Medium-Term Money Neutrality and the Effective Lower Bound

                                         ABSTRACT

Conventional wisdom suggests that medium-term money neutrality imposes strong limitations on
the effects of monetary policy. The point of this paper is that models with medium- and long-term
money neutrality are prone to generate non-existence of equilibria at the effective lower bound
(ELB) on interest rates. Non-existence is suggestive of sharp output contractions --- so-called
contractionary black holes --- at the ELB. Paradoxically, the case for expansionary monetary
policy at the ELB is even stronger in models that feature near money neutrality. The results
highlight the benefits of a monetary policy regime in which the central bank temporarily
overshoots its inflation target once confronted by the ELB.

1      Introduction

       "What we know, or should know, from the past is that once inflation becomes anticipated and
       ingrained -- as it eventually would -- then the stimulating effects are lost." (Paul Volcker,
       former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, New York Times, 9/19/11)


     Most modern macroeconomic models feature medium- or long-term monetary neutrality or are relatively
close to neutrality. This means, one might suspect, that with sufficiently long time passing, output is pinned
down by the production capacities and labor supply, independently of monetary policy. The monetary
neutrality assumption made its way into the core of economic thought following the seminal contributions
of Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1967) and the stagflation of the 1970s when inflation rose without any
improvement in output and employment.
     The point of this paper is that this medium- or long-term monetary neutrality assumption runs into
a direct conflict with the aggregate demand side of modern general equilibrium models under relatively
plausible conditions. The two most important conditions for this conflict to occur are that i) central bank
reaches the effective lower bound (ELB) on interest rates, and ii) policy is set according to a monetary
policy regime under which the central bank is strongly averse to any overshooting of its in inflation target.
More specifically, we consider a policy regime according to which the central bank is unable/unwilling to
increase inflation expectations in response to a shock that brings the economy to the ELB. A policy regime
governed by the popular Taylor rule, for example, satisfies this condition.
     The conflict between aggregate supply and demand results in some cases in non-existence of equilibria,
or in output contracting without a bound at the ELB -- a phenomenon we term contractionary black
holes. As we argue below, the reason is that any adverse shock that brings the economy to the ELB and
causes a decline in short-run inflation and medium-run inflation expectations induces an increase in the
real interest rate, which in turn reinforces the output contraction and the downward pressures on inflation
and inflation expectations. A key conclusion of this paper is that the closer the aggregate supply side is
to exhibiting medium- or short-term money neutrality, the more likely the model is to exhibit a very large
output contraction at the ELB, or non-existence of the equilibrium. In addition, the case for expansionary
monetary policy at the ELB is even stronger, and the stimulative effects of monetary policy are also larger,
the closer the model is to exhibit money neutrality. This may seem deeply counterintuitive.1 At the ELB,
Volcker's opening quote of the paper is turned on its head: as expectations become more ingrained the
effect of a stimulus becomes larger, rather than smaller.
     We start the paper by showing the problem of non-existence in a microfounded model which nests a
standard Phillips curve with a static inflation output trade-off, and the New Classical Phillips curve where
there is no such trade-off once expectations adjust:

                                                        ^t + Et-1 t ,
                                                    t = Y                                                                     (1)
    1 Aside   from Volcker who is quoted at the beginning of this paper, many other prominent economists have expressed
skepticism about policies intended to raise inflation expectations at the ELB. For instance Cochrane (2012): "But it's a rare
Phillips curve in which raising expected inflation is a good thing. It just gives you more inflation, with if anything less output
and employment."




                                                                1
                                                                                      ^t is output in
where  > 0,   [0, 1] are coefficients, t is inflation in deviation from steady state, Y
deviation from its potential, and Et-1 is an expectations operator. Our benchmark is  = 1, in which
case the model is the standard New Classical Phillips curve with strong monetary neutrality (Lucas, 1972;
Barro and Gordon, 1983). Meanwhile, if  = 0 the model features a classic static trade-off between inflation
and output. We choose this model, not for its realism, but for clarity. It clearly illustrates the problem of
non-existence when the aggregate supply side incorporates a strong money neutrality. Here, if inflation is
fully anticipated and  = 1, then t = Et-1 t and equation (1) implies that Y^t = 0. Hence, any increase
in inflation once anticipated, seems to loose its expansionary effect, as suggested by Volcker's quote.
   We point out in Section 3 that this particular result is obtained by looking exclusively at the "supply
equation" (1) under the assumption that  = 1. When we introduce a standard aggregate demand side
to the model, along with a standard monetary policy reaction function, it becomes clear that this result
is only partial and misleading in general equilibrium. A key result is that if shocks are large enough for
the ELB on the short-term nominal interest rate to bind, then, given expectations, output is demand
determined. In that case -- assuming monetary policy seeks to bring inflation back to the central bank's
inflation target without overshooting it -- output demanded is always below "potential," i.e., Y ^t < 0.
                                                                                ^t = 0 implied by the supply
Moreover, even if inflation is perfectly anticipated, we show that the solution Y
side is inconsistent with the demand-side equilibrium conditions of the model. Hence a key result of this
paper is the non-existence of an equilibrium in the model when the ELB binds.
   How can this clash between the demand and supply sides of the model be resolved? What is the
interpretation of the non-existence result? We propose an interpretation by analyzing two cases that each
relax an assumption of our baseline model. First, in Section 4, we relax the assumption that  = 1. We
show that the non-existence result is a knife-edge result for  = 1, and an equilibrium exists in close
vicinity of it, although it requires a sharp drop in output. Indeed, paradoxically, as the model moves closer
to monetary neutrality, i.e., as  moves from 0 to 1, the output in the short run contracts more and more
until it collapses without bound. Second, while maintaining the benchmark assumption that  = 1, we
relax in Section 5 the assumption of perfect foresight. It turns out that non-existence in a perfect foresight
equilibrium is also a fragile knife-edge result. We show that when introducing a little uncertainty, again
an equilibrium exists. In this equilibrium the "clash of the two equations" is again resolved in favor of the
demand side, and the solution features an output collapse and deflation. Once inflation becomes perfectly
anticipated towards the perfect foresight limit, output and inflation collapse completely. We refer to the
situation in which output collapses without a bound as a contractionary black hole.
   Interestingly, we show that at the ELB, as long as the equilibrium exists, anticipated inflation is far
from neutral under our specification of the monetary policy regime. In fact, raising inflation expectations
can have extremely large effects on output in this model, with the effects getting larger and larger as the
model approaches the contractionary black hole. This implies that the monetary policy regime plays a key
role in stabilizing output and inflation. In our baseline, we assume that, when possible, the central bank
sets its policy rate according to a simple policy rule that seeks to bring inflation back to its target (from
below) in response to a ELB shock. However, if the policy regime instead implies a temporary overshoot
of the inflation target it can successfully stabilize inflation and output. If properly designed, a new policy
regime can even eliminate the possibility of contractionary black holes altogether.
   Our paradoxical conclusion that output contracts more at the ELB the closer the model is to monetary
neutrality is related to, but is conceptually distinct from the price flexibility paradox in New Keynesian


                                                      2
models.2 According to this paradox, if the central bank has an inflation target that is too low to accommo-
date a negative natural rate of interest, then the more prices become flexible, the more output contracts at
the ELB. This is because higher price flexibility results in more deflationary expectations, which contract
aggregate demand. This is paradoxical, for we know that at full flexibility, output is by definition equal to
the flexible-price output. The resolution of this paradox, we suggest (and show explicitly toward the end
of the paper), is that there is no equilibrium in the flexible-price model.
     While most of our analysis is conducted in linear(ized) models, Section 6 shows that our main result on
non-existence of the equilibrium is not an artifact of an approximation. Indeed, the equilibrium displays
similar features in the non-linear version of our baseline model.
     Section 7 moves to the more empirically realistic New Keynesian model now popular in the literature.
In that model, the short run is no longer just defined by just one period. The way the non-existence
arises is via a constraint on how long the slump can last without an unbounded collapse in output. For
empirically reasonable values, for example, the bound on how long the slump can last without implosion
is relatively tight. One implication of this result, from a modeling standpoint, is that one has to move
away from assuming monetary neutrality in the medium and short run in order to account for plausibly
persistent slumps. For example, it is difficult to account for the long slump in Japan at the ELB without
deviating away from medium term monetary neutrality.
     In Section 8, we connect our results to the literature on secular stagnation, a literature emphasizing
a permanent liquidity trap. This section highlights that a key requirement of this literature is not only
a change to the aggregate demand side of the model -- in order to encompass a permanent reduction in
the real interest rate -- but also to the aggregate supply side, to allow for a permanent trade-off between
inflation and output. In Section 9, we connect our result to the price-flexibility paradox. Here we highlight
via a simple flexible-price model, that the key to understand the paradox is that there generally is non-
existence of equilibria in response to temporary negative real interest rates if the central bank targets zero
inflation. Section 10 discusses alternative policy rules that generate equilibrium existence, such as policies
seeking to stabilize prices around a price-level target. Section 11 concludes.


2      Medium-Term Neutrality of Money
We start by briefly reviewing a key property of the aggregate supply relationship (1), shared by most
modern specifications of nominal rigidities, namely the medium-run money neutrality when  = 1. We
      
label t the inflation rate that the central bank seeks to achieve in any period t, and call it the inflation
target for short. We assume that we initially start with an inflation target at 0, and that the central bank
                               
raises the inflation target to S > 0 in the short run, that is at t = S . We also assume that in the short
run, inflation expectations haven't adjusted, so that ES -1 S = 0. Let us define the medium run as the
period in which expectations have adjusted so that M = ES M =   . For now, there is no difference
between long and medium run but we will make a distinction between these shortly.
     Figure 1 shows the output and inflation rates in the model in the short run, given by the schedule
    2 This   paradox was first shown in the New Keynesian model in Eggertsson (2012). See also discussion in Eggertsson and
Krugman (2012), Werning (2012), Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011) and Bhattarai, Eggertsson Schoenle (2018).
Mathematically, the flexibility paradox is about higher  leading to lower output at the ELB, while this paper is about 
moving closer to 1, which leads to a fall in output.

         ^S so that   = Y
S =   =  Y              ^S . We see that in the short run the government can achieve higher output
by creating (unexpected) inflation, by increasing its inflation target   . The trade-off between inflation and
output is given by -1 , i.e. a one percentage point increase in inflation increases output by -1 percent.
Hence in the short run the government has a menu of choices of inflation output pairs on the solid line
dotted by A and B, but this trade-off will generally depend on the extent to which the higher inflation
targets is "ingrained" in expectations. For large enough inflation the government can even achieve the first
best output Y ^  that may be different from the steady state due, e.g., to monopoly distortions.



                                                                                     





                                                                                     

                                                      

        Figure 1: The tradeoff between inflation and output when inflation expectations are fixed.


   The key lesson of models with forward-looking price setters is that this trade-off is an illusion once
expectations adjust. Let us consider the baseline specification in which  = 1. Once the new inflation
target   becomes fully anticipated, as happens in the medium run, then t = Et-1 t =   and the AS
equation (1) becomes M =   = Y       ^M +   , which implies that Y
                                                                 ^M = 0. Once an inflation policy is
anticipated, the government can only choose between different inflation rates on dashed curve from A to C
in Figure 2 without any improvement in output. In particular, suppose the private sector anticipated that
the government would try to achieve point B (where output is at potential). In this case ES M = M and
the AS curve shifts as shown in the figure so that once the government chooses M there are no gains in
output, only higher inflation. This is at core the Volcker's remark "What we know, or should know, from
the past is that once inflation becomes anticipated and ingrained -- as it eventually would -- then the
stimulating effects are lost."
   The same property holds in most modern models of dynamic price setting in absence of ad-hoc assump-
tions. We will review in detail in Section 7 the popular New Keynesian model. A leading alternative is
the sticky information model of Mankiw and Reis (2002). According to their model, the aggregate supply

                                                                       ^t-1 )

where  > 0 is a coefficient and 0 <  < 1. This model can be seen as a generalization of the baseline
specification just discussed (1): once again we see that once higher inflation is anticipated, the second term
on the right-hand side of (2) reduces to   . In this model, however, it takes a longer time to obtain money
neutrality than in the simple example that serves as our benchmark.


3     Introducing Demand: The Problem of Non-Existence
In the last section we reviewed the simple New Classical model that features no trade-off between inflation
and output in the medium run (when  = 1), where the medium run is defined by the fact that expectations
have adjusted. Missing in this picture, however, is a demand side. Here we introduce the demand side,
and formulate, in the process, microfoundations for the Phillips Curve.

    Reviewing the aggregate supply relationship characterized above, it should be clear why previous au-
thors have often abstracted from the demand side. To the extent that the nominal interest rate does not
appear in equation (1), or in the government's assumed objective function, there is no loss of generality
in assuming that instead of choosing the nominal interest rate, it , the government chooses directly either
t or Y^t that satisfy the restriction (1). The nominal interest rate consistent with these levels of inflation
and output can then just be backed out of (14).6 However, nothing in this way of proceeding guarantees
that the implied interest rate must be non-negative. Therefore, when one explicitly accounts for the ELB,
aggregate demand needs to be incorporated.
    Introducing aggregate demand requires a more complete specification of monetary policy. We assume
that policy satisfies:
                                                         e               
                                            it = max{0, rt + t +   ( t - t )}                                               (15)
      
where t is the government's inflation target, and  > 1 so that the so-called "Taylor principle" applies,
whereby the nominal interest rate is raised more than one-for-one with inflation around the inflation target.
    There are several reasons to focus on policy (15). One is that it implements the optimal monetary
policy under discretion if the central bank minimizes7
                                                     
                                          L t = Et                       2
                                                             T -t {(T - T       ^T
                                                                          ) + y Y 2
                                                                                    }.
                                                     T =t

A second is that this policy specification implies that at the ELB, the central bank does not try to commit
to generating above-target inflation. Arguably, this is a reasonable characterization of the policy of major

  6 A similar argument can also be made for the money supply. We can add money in the utility function into our framework,

so that the government's choice of the nominal interest rate is then modeled via its choice for the money supply. We omit
this detail here.

central banks following the crisis of 2008, as no major central bank committed explicitly to generating
above-target inflation, even if this would be optimal in the model, under commitment.8 In Section 10, we
discuss how the existence results reported below are affected by alternative policy rules.
    Let us revisit the example discussed in Section 2, where we explored the effect of increasing the inflation
target. How does aggregate demand complement the picture? As inflation becomes anticipated, the
equilibrium moves from point B to C : Higher inflation leads to no output gains once fully anticipated.
Consistently with equation (14), the increase in inflation is reflected in a higher nominal interest rate, i.e.,
iS = M . This is arguably -- in broad terms -- what happened during the "great inflation" of the 1970s:
as inflation expectations rose, nominal rates rose as well, with no gains in output. It would seem, then, at
least when studying the 1970s, that the demand side is only relevant to "back out" the nominal interest
rate.
    However, when the ELB becomes binding, the demand side no longer just backs out the interest rate
consistent with that equilibrium. Instead, with the interest rate fixed, equation (14) plays a key role in
determining the overall number of good demanded. This is the case that we now turn to.


3.3        Short, medium, long run, and equilibrium non-existence in the New Clas-
           sical benchmark
We proceed with the New Classical benchmark ( = 1) to show how strong medium-term money neutrality
                                                                                                    e
generates equilibrium non-existence, in the face of the ELB. Consider an unexpected negative shock rt <r
                                                                                                       ¯
in period zero called the "short run." The short run is defined by the fact that expectations have not
                                                        
adjusted; they remain at "steady state" so that E-1 S = L . The shock stays at its negative level in the
next period (called the medium run) and reverts back to normal in the third period called the "long run."
Expectations fully adjust in the medium and the long run so that the only difference between the medium
and the long run is the absence of the shock in the long run. The only difference between the medium and
the short run is that expectations have adjusted in the medium run, not in the short run. To summarize:
   8 One   interpretation of that behavior is that central banks did not commit to generate above-target inflation because a
commitment of that kind is not dynamically consistent, i.e., it is not "credible" if the public believes that the central bank
sets policy under discretion.

                                                                                                 ¯.

     In period t = M the shock is still rt = rS . In periods t  L the shock is back at steady state

     rt        ¯. While the shock is unexpected in period t = S , so that ES -1 S =   , there is perfect
        = rL = r
     foresight between S, M, and L. Periods t > L are identical to L: there are no shocks and agents have
     perfect foresight.

   We proceed by analyzing the long run, before showing non-existence of equilibria in the medium run.
The proposition below establishes that in the long run, t  L, policy rule (15) implies a unique bounded
                                                 
solution at positive interest rates in which t = L =   . We assume that ELB is not binding in the
long run, thus excluding the possibility of self-fulfilling liquidity traps, a subject of another branch of the
literature.9 This restriction is relaxed in Section 6 below.

in the long run t  L. Then the model (1), (14)­(15) implies a unique bounded long-run equilibrium

   Proof. Given Assumption A1, perfect foresight between periods M and L implies that EL-1 L =
EM L = L . It follows from equation (1) that for all t  L

                    ^t = 0 for t  L. This implies that for any t  L (14) simplifies to
or simply that that Y

It follows from (15) and (16) that

or equivalently that

   Consider the medium run. The aggregate supply (AS) equation (1) implies

                                   ^M = -1 (M - ES M ) = -1 (M - M ) = 0

   The two curves are plotted in Figure 4 for a realization of the shock rM satisfying rM + M +  (M -

M )   > 0. Since inflation is perfectly anticipated the AS curve is vertical. Meanwhile, the AD curve is
downward sloping in inflation. This is due to the fact that  > 1 so that the central bank reduces the
policy rate more than one-to-one with the fall in inflation (and vice versa), thus stimulating spending as
inflation drops, as shown in the first row of (17). Yet, there is a limit to how much the central bank can
stimulate spending by rate cuts. If medium term inflation, M , is low enough so that the ELB is binding,
     ^M is given by the second row of (17), i.e. Y
then Y                                           ^M = re +   . Now output demanded does not depend

upon realized inflation (the ratio of prices today relative to yesterday). Instead demand only depends upon
                            
expected inflation, EM L (= L ) , which determines the price of goods tomorrow relative to the price today.
   An equilibrium is determined by the intersection of the AS and AD equation. For a positive interest
rate, we see that this equilibrium determination happens at M =   and Y  ^M = 0. Figure 5 shows the
                                                                          M

enough, the nominal interest rate is reduced but inflation stays at M and output at potential.
   There is nothing in the model, however, that prevents the AD curve from shifting even further than in
                    e     
Figure 5. Consider rM < - M . This shifts the AD curve to the left of the AS curve, a situation shown in

always positive in the long run. Then there exists no bounded equilibrium in the medium run that satisfies
equations (1) and (14)­(15).

   Proof. See Appendix.
   How should this proposition be interpreted? The aggregate supply equation and the aggregate demand
equation in Figure 5 are pointing to different directions. On the one hand, the aggregate supply equation

             ^M = 0 : If everybody perfectly anticipates the future, then prices act as if they are perfectly

flexible and output is thus at potential. Meanwhile, the aggregate demand equation imposes that demand
                                      ^M < 0. For households to be willing to buy all supplied goods, the

real interest rate must be sufficiently negative. Yet, this is not possible if expected inflation is below t
without a negative nominal interest rate. Evidently demand and supply clash -- no level of output and
inflation satisfy both equations at the same time. What is particularly curious is that some of the policy
discussion reviewed in the introduction seems to be driven by an intuition which is derived exactly when
this clash occurs but only using the AS equation. The interpretation we propose is that the non-existence
result is suggestive of a severe output contraction that becomes visible once the equilibrium existence is
restored. We do so in the next two sections, by relaxing the strong assumption of either i) full monetary
neutrality as in the New Classical benchmark ( = 1), or ii) perfect foresight.
    Before proceeding further, it is worth pointing out another fundamental driving force of the non-
existence result, namely monetary policy. To see this, note the requirement for non-existence of the
              e     
equilibrium: rM < - L . This means that the government can always guarantee the existence of an equilib-
rium or mitigate a very severe output contraction caused by the ELB, by choosing a high enough inflation
target. While a higher long-run inflation target is one way of getting there, we also discuss more broadly
other types of monetary policies in Section 10.


4     Restoring the Equilibrium via Monetary Non-Neutrality
The simplest way to restore an equilibrium is by departing from our New Classical benchmark, that is, by
assuming that 0   < 1, so that (1) implies a trade-off between inflation and output in the medium run

That trade-off restores equilibrium existence as can be inferred from Figure 6 where the dashed AS curve
denotes the case when  < 1: Once the AS curve is upward sloping it must intersect the aggregate demand
curve. The equilibrium is one in which medium-term output is completely determined by the AD equation

While a low natural rate of interest rS contributes to an output contraction, the latter is reinforced by
declining inflation in the medium run. In particular, as the Phillips Curve approaches the New Classical
benchmark, the output contraction in the short run can be very large, given the large contraction in
medium-run inflation. Substituting (18) and (19) into the IS curve in the short run, we obtain

Proposition 3 Assume A1, rS + L < 0,  > 1, and  < 1. The higher , the lower output in the
short run. As the model approaches the New Classical benchmark that features no medium-term monetary
                                                                                        ^S  - and
neutrality (  1), then output and inflation in the short run contracts without a bound, Y
S  -.

    This suggests that, as mentioned in the introduction, the equilibrium non-existence obtained as   1
is associated with a collapse in output and inflation, a so-called contractionary black hole. Thus as the
model converges towards monetary neutrality, the fall in output intensifies without a bound.
    A key policy implication of the above analysis is that the benefits of anticipated inflation become
arbitrarily large, when the model approaches money neutrality. The following proposition follows directly
from (20).

                           e             
Proposition 4 Suppose A1, rS < -M ,r
                                   ¯ > - L ,  > 1,   1, and that the nominal interest rate is

output in the short run,   dL ,   is   1-  .   The output effect of anticipated inflation increases without a bound
as   1.

    This proposition represents another fundamental result. As the model moves closer to the New Classical
benchmark featuring medium-run monetary neutrality, then the benefits of increasing anticipated inflation
increases without a bound as   1, when the interest rate is constrained by the ELB.


5     Restoring the Equilibrium via Uncertainty
Our analysis has so far abstracted from uncertainty. As shown in Section 3, the New Classical benchmark
( = 1) features money neutrality in the medium run. However, monetary neutrality relies on the fact
that people can perfectly forecast inflation. Realistically, however, there is always some uncertainty. The
presence of uncertainty also implies a trade-off between output and inflation in the medium run, just as in
the case that  < 1. To illustrate this, we return to our New Classical benchmark with  = 1, but deviate
from perfect foresight, while maintaining rational expectations.
    Instead of the shock staying "on" in the medium run with certainty before reverting back to steady

of uncertainty is shown in Figure 7. As we now show, this seemingly minor extension generates existence.

     Proof. The solution is obtained by solving (21)­(26) (see Appendix for details).
     The model equilibrium exists in the medium run, now that there is no longer perfect foresight. For
instance, if the shock is in the low state, then the AS equation is given by

                                   low

                                                      + (1 - )M

or
                                          low      ^ low   high
                                          M   =    Y     + M    .

                                high
We can now use our solution for M    to show that inflation and output are related in the medium run
according to
                          low     1 -  +   -1 ^ low 1         -1

                                                                 M .                                    (27)
                                       
     Equation (27) reveals that the AS curve is no longer vertical, but that it is upward sloping in the
output-inflation space as shown in Figure 8. What generates existence is the fact that inflation is no longer
perfectly anticipated, as there is more than one state of the world in the medium run. Thus the presence of
uncertainty generates equilibrium existence similarly to hard wiring a permanent trade-off between inflation
and output, as we did in last section. Observe that as the uncertainty shrinks near the low state, then the
amount of deflation in the medium term increases. Indeed, as the model approaches perfect foresight, i.e.,
  0 then M  -, just as in the case when   1.
     Again, we will see that the limiting case in which uncertainty disappears features money neutrality in
the medium run and very large contractions in economic activity and inflation, in the short run, when the
interest rate is constrained by the ELB. Taking the medium-run solution for M and Y   ^M as given, output

background. The AD curve shifts back not only due to the shock rS , but also due to expected deflation
-- given by ES M . The expected deflation in the model with uncertainty is given by

Again, medium term inflation expectation are declining as the model approaches monetary neutrality,
which occurs here as it approaches perfect foresight   0 -- ultimately dropping without a bound, as can
be seen in expression (28). The next proposition summarizes this result for the New Classical benchmark
( = 1), once we deviate from perfect foresight.

We could equivalently draw a similar figure for   1.

    Note the parallel between the two departures from money neutrality considered in this and the previous
section. Whether we let the model approach full neutrality via the fraction of price-setters who index their
prices to lagged prices (  1) or by converging to the perfect foresight case (  0), output and inflation
in the short run collapse without bound when the interest rate is constrained by the ELB.
    Similarly to the previous section, the benefits of anticipated inflation become arbitrarily large, when
the model approaches money neutrality:

    Proof. See Appendix.
    As the New Classical model converges to perfect foresight, i.e., expected inflation becomes "ingrained",
then the benefits of increasing long-run inflation expectations on short-term output become arbitrarily
large.


6        Equilibrium Non-Existence in a Non-Linear Version of the
         Model
While our analysis has been conducted in the context of a linearized model the results are not an artifact of
an approximation. To illustrate this we briefly mention a few results, and in particular the equilibrium non-
existence when the ELB binds, in the New Classical benchmark, that is when ind = 0 in the microfounded
model (corresponding to  = 1).

     The following proposition, which relates to Benhabib, Schmitt-Groh´
                                                                       e and Uribe (2001), establishes the
existence of multiple long-run steady states.

Proposition 8 Consider the model given by (5)­(12) for all t  t0 . Suppose that monetary policy is given
by an interest-rate reaction function
                                                it =  (t , t , t )                                             (29)

where t  Pt /Pt-1 denotes inflation, t is the inflation target, and that the policy rule  () is non-negative
for all values of its arguments, is increasing in its first argument, and that  (    
                                                                                 t , t , t ) / t > 1, so
that the "Taylor principle" applies around the inflation target. Suppose furthermore that agents know at
some date t1  t0 , that the inflation target                               
                                             t will remain constant at t =  >  for all t  t1 .
Then the model (5)­(12), (29) admits at least two possible steady states characterized by constant values

    Proof. See Appendix.
    As stated, at least two long-run steady states are possible in this model: one with constant inflation
at the central bank's target level and a positive nominal interest rate, and one with zero nominal interest
rate (as in the Friedman rule) and perpetual deflation. Our earlier analysis took the first steady state as
given. Importantly, however, the lack of existence of a medium run equilibrium does not depend on this
assumption. As established in the next proposition, if the preference shock takes a low enough value in the
medium run, then no medium run equilibrium exists in the non-linear version of the model under perfect
foresight. We modify slightly Assumption A1 as follows:

A1' Consider the three periods t = S, M, L. In period t = S there is an unexpected shock S <        ¯ -1 ¯
                                                                                                      L L,
    where  ¯L is the steady-state value of the preference shock and ¯ L is the steady state inflation rate.
      In period t = M the shock is still M = S . In periods t  L, the shock is back at its steady state
      ¯L . While the shock is unexpected in period t = S , there is perfect foresight between S, M, and L.
      
      Periods t > L are identical to L: there are no shocks and agents have perfect foresight.

                                                                            ¯L , ¯
                                                                       ¯L , C

ing (5)­(29), there exists no medium-term equilibrium for small enough value of the exogenous disturbance

                                               M <  ¯ -1 ¯
                                                      L L.                                              (31)

    Proof. See Appendix.
    The condition (31) causing the absence of any medium-term equilibrium is analogous to the requirement
that the natural rate of interest be low enough for the nominal rate to be constrained by the ELB, as seen
in our analysis above. It requires M to be low enough, so that the representative consumer finds it
preferable to consume less in the present (i.e., in the medium term) than in the future (i.e., the long run).
Equivalently, the household prefers to save in the medium term. Doing so, reduces aggregate demand in
the medium run, leading firms to lower their prices. This lowers inflation and increases the real interest
rate. That increase in the medium-term real rate discourages households further from consuming, thereby
leading to a collapse of the economy.
    Note that if we are in the regular steady state with ¯ L =  , (and  ¯ -1 < 1) then the higher the
                                                               L          L
long-run inflation target L , the easier it is for the medium-term equilibrium to exist. Indeed, the higher
the long-run inflation target, the more difficult it is for the condition (31) to be satisfied, as M needs to
fall possibly much below   ¯L for the medium run equilibrium to cease to exist. Instead, if we are in the
"Friedman" steady state, where   ¯ L = , then the medium-run equilibrium ceases to exist and the economy
collapses as soon as M falls below the long-run value of ¯L , regardless of the inflation target.



7     Non-Existence and Output Explosions in the New Keynesian
      Model
So far we limited our attention to a simple Phillips curve that nests a static Phillips Curve with the New
Classical one to clearly illustrate the implications of money neutrality in the face of the ELB. In the last
few decades, however, the New Keynesian Phillips curve has become more popular, both in quantitative


                                                     19
monetary models and in discussions of monetary policy (see, e.g., Woodford (2003), Christiano et al. (2005),
Smets and Wouters (2007)). The New Keynesian Phillips curve is derived from the same microfoundations
as in Section 3.1, but under the assumption that constant fraction of randomly chosen firms reset their
prices in every period. It is given by
                                                   ^t + Et t+1 .
                                              t =  Y                                                               (32)

   The IS equation, the policy rule and the ELB remain the same as before. This section confirms the basic
insights from the previous analysis. The way non-existence appears in this model, is that if the shock that
gives rise to the ELB has long enough duration, inflation and output drop without a bound. We establish
this result considering two alternative shock processes common in the literature, first a deterministic one,
and then a two-state Markov process with an absorbing state.

                                                                              e

      steady state is an absorbing state.  denotes the period in which the steady state is reached.

   The next proposition summarizes the behavior of the model under A3.

                                                                    
Proposition 10 Suppose A3 and that the inflation target is constant t =¯  for all t > T . We assume
r
¯ > -¯  ,  > 1. Moreover, we assume that r is sufficiently low for the lower bound to bind, that is
r+¯  < 0, so that it = 0 for all t = 0, 1, ...T, and that the nominal interest rate is positive in all periods
t > T. Then the model (14)­(15) and (32) implies a unique bounded equilibrium given by
                                                 T -t                T -t
                                 -r + c1 (e1 )          + c2 (e2 )          for t = 0, 1, ...T
                    t    =           
                                 ¯                                                for t > T
                                      c1             T -t       c2              T -t
                    ^t           c0 +e1 -1   (e1 )          +   e2 -1   (e2 )          for t = 0, 1, ...T
                    Y    =       1-  
                                    ¯                                                     for t > T

where c0 , c1 , c2 , e1 , e2 are constants satisfying c2 < 0 and 0 < e1 < 1 <  -1 < e2 . In this equilibrium,
output and inflation initially drop and then revert to the long-run steady state after date T . The magnitude
of the initial drop in inflation and output grows exponentially with T, the duration of the natural rate of
interest in its low state r.

   Proof. See Appendix.
   While the equilibrium continues to exist under A3, longer durations of the ELB imply ever larger drops
                                                                         T -t
in output and inflation, given the dominant terms c2 (e2 )                      , so that these drops eventually become
unboundedly large as T - t becomes very large. Hence, the model imposes a limit on the duration of the
recession to prevent it from exploding. Our proposition is closely related to the finding by Carlstrom,
Fuerst and Paustian (2012), who show that an interest rate peg has a larger impact on inflation the longer
the duration of the peg. It also relates to the literature on the "forward guidance puzzle" (Del Negro,
Giannoni, Patterson, 2015; McKay, Nakamura and Steinsson, 2016) according to which expectations of
future interest-rate changes have implausibly large effects on short-term output.

   Assumption A4 allows for a useful graphical representation of the conditions for equilibrium existence
in the New Keynesian model, which also connect to our earlier exposition. Let us call the stochastic period
in which the shock recovers to its steady-state long-run value T . It is easy to confirm that the unique
bounded solution for t  T is t =     ¯  and Y^t = 0, when the ELB is not binding in the long run. For
periods t < T , however, r + ¯  < 0 so that the ELB is binding, and setting for simplicity ¯  = 0, the model
solves the following two equations:

                                             ~t Y
                                       ^t = µE
                                       Y                ~t t+1 + r
                                                ^t+1 + µE                                                (33)

Proposition 11 Suppose A4 and that the inflation target is constant at   = 0. Then t = 0 and Y
once the steady state is reached (for all t   ). If (1 - µ)(1 - µ ) - µ > 0, there is a unique bounded
solution in the short run, t < , given by

                                      ^S              (1 - µ)
                                      Y    =                      re
                                               (1 - µ)(1 - µ ) - µ S

                                               (1 - µ)(1 - µ) - µ S

   The proof of this proposition is similar to that of Proposition 3 in Eggertsson (2010). It establishes that
a necessary and sufficient condition for obtaining a unique bounded solution is (1 - µ)(1 - µ ) - µ > 0.
We provide below an intuitive explanation for this condition using a graphical analysis closely resembling
what we have done so far in the paper.
   Conditional on there being a unique bounded solution to the system, the solution is a pair of numbers
 ^
(YS , S ) that solve (33) and (34), which can be expressed as

                                           ^ AD = µ S +  r
                                           Y                                                             (35)
                                             S
                                                 1-µ   1-µ
                                                         ^ AS
                                               S =        Y .                                            (36)
                                                     1 - µ S
These equations represent the AD and the AS relationships which are plotted in Figure 12. At the
intersection point A, µ = 0, i.e., the shock is expected to revert back to steady state with probability 1
next period. Output is completely demand determined and is equal to r. The AD is vertical in that case,
as it doesn't depend on inflation. The Phillips curve (or upward-sloping AS) then determines the inflation
rate associated with the given level of output. At this point, the trade-off between inflation and output is
given by . Consider now an increase in µ, which has the effect of increasing the expected duration of the
ELB. This shifts the AD curve so that inflation becomes positively related to output. This is because a
fall in inflation in the short run will be reflected in lower inflation expectations, thus increasing the real
interest rate and suppressing demand. In addition, the higher µ also results in a shift in the AS curve
towards a steeper curve, which is closer monetary neutrality. As a result, the higher µ leads to a larger

output contraction and inflation decline, at point B. In all, the shift of the Phillips curve towards a steeper
AS curve featuring more monetary neutrality intensifies the economic contraction at the ELB.
    Why does an increase in the duration of ELB move the models closer to monetary neutrality? If  = 1,
then in the limit when µ = 1 there is full monetary neutrality. The intuition is that the new Keynesian
Phillips curve has forward looking expectations, so that the longer the ELB is expected to bind, the closer
the AS approaches the AS that would obtain in steady state, as can be seen in (36).
    Figure 12 reveals another important observation, which is closely related to the previous proposition.
As µ increases, then the two curves become closer and closer to parallel, leading to lower and lower
levels of output and inflation. Both drop without bound when the AD and AS lines are parallel, and no
equilibrium exists, similarly to the our earlier cases discussed. The condition in the last proposition for
a unique bounded solution is equivalent to the requirement that the aggregate demand curve be steeper
                                   µ         1-µ 10
than aggregate supply, i.e.       1- µ   >      .
    A final observation, although we do not show the explicit formulas, is that in this model as in the
preceding discussion, when the output collapses, the benefit of inflation becomes unbounded.
  10 Observe   that if this condition holds, the log-linear model exhibits indeterminacy. As shown by Eggertsson and Singh
(2019), this region of the parameter space does not represent a valid solution in the non-linear version of the model. Intuitively,
as explained in the text, as the duration of the crisis increases, the drop in output ultimately becomes unbounded, which
results in the linear approximation to be no longer valid.




                                                                22
8     Equilibrium Non-Existence in a Secular Stagnation
There is a recent literature on long-lasting monetary slumps, often identified with secular stagnation. Here
we stress that this literature needs to assume monetary non-neutrality to establish existence of equilibria
for the same reason as we have documented, i.e. that the aggregate demand side will otherwise clash with
the supply side of the model, yielding no equilibria. This literature on long demand slumps highlights that
the aggregate demand side of the model needs to be extended to consider long-lasting drops in the interest
rate. Common modeling devices are overlapping generations models (Eggertsson, Mehrotra, Robbins,
2019), wealth in utility (Michaillat and Saez, 2019) or incomplete asset markets. These extensions can
often be summarized by the linearized version of the IS curve with discounting

                                                   ^t+1 -  (it - Et t+1 - rt
                                           ^t = Et Y
                                           Y                               e
                                                                             )                                            (37)

where 0 <  < 1. A key property of this equation, is that in steady state

                                              ^L = - 1  (iL - L - rL
                                              Y                    e
                                                                     ),                                                   (38)
                                                    1-
that is, the steady-state long-run demand is decreasing in the real interest rate. A key to obtaining a
downward sloping relationship between long-run demand and the interest rate is  < 1.
    Related to this extension, many authors have pointed out that assuming  = 1 is responsible for
the contractionary explosive behavior of output the New Keynesian model, which has some unattractive
properties such as, for example, giving rise to the forward guidance puzzle (see Del Negro, Giannoni and
Patterson, 2012; McKay, Nakamura and Steinsson, 2016). A key resolution of this literature has been to
include discounting in the IS equation as in shown in (37).
    What has not been emphasized as much, however, is the role of monetary neutrality emphasized in
this paper. If the AS equation has too strong a monetary neutrality, then the model exhibits explosive
behavior as well, or gives rise to equilibrium non-existence. The easiest way to see this is to complement
the equation (38) with an aggregate supply. It is easy to see that if we assume the New Classical Phillips
Curve (1) with  = 1, then once again we have equilibrium non-existence, exactly as we have documented
in this paper, regardless of the value of  . Meanwhile, in the NK model, the consider the long-run trade-off
is given by
                                         ^L = 1 -  L .
                                         Y                                                  (39)
                                                
                                                                        e
As  approaches 1, then the model approaches money neutrality. Assuming rL < 0 so that the ELB is
binding, we obtain the following solution for long run output

                                                   ^L =                    e
                                                   Y                      rL .
                                                          1--       1- 

                                                                                                   11
    The condition for equilibrium existence in the linearized model is: 1 -  >                   1-  .    We see that as 
                                                                                                          
approaches 1, and the model moves closer and closer to monetary neutrality, the term                     1-    increases, and
output becomes more and more negative until its contraction becomes unbounded and the equilibrium
ceases to exist.
 11 See   Eggertsson and Singh (2019) for a discussion in a closely related context for why this is required for equilibrium
existence. Essentially what happens is that the model "explodes" as 1 -  - 1-
                                                                              approaches zero, and the linear approximation
                                  
is no longer valid when 1 -  -   1- 
                                       takes on negative values. In the non-linear counterpart of the model, there is no longer
an intersection between aggregate supply and demand in this case.


                                                               23
    In calibrations of the New Keynesian model, the parameter  is typically assumed to be very close
to 1, e.g. 0.99 when calibrated in quarterly frequencies. It is for this reason that authors studying
questions related to secular stagnation typically adopt a Phillips Curve specification with a permanent
trade-off between inflation and output, for example due to wages being rigid downward. Examples in this
vein include Eggertsson, Mehrotra and Robbins (2019) and Schmitt-Groh´
                                                                     e and Uribe (2017). A notable
exception is Michaillat and Saez (2019), who study long-run equilibria in a New Keynesian setting. They
obtain long-run trade-offs by assuming a low value of  ; appealing to field and laboratory evidence they
argue for a annual discount rate as low as  = 0.9 at quarterly frequencies.


9     Flexible Prices and Equilibrium Non-Existence
In the introduction we noted a connection to the price flexibility paradox and suggested that a key obser-
vation is that there is no equilibrium if prices are flexible and the central bank targets zero inflation. We
now develop this argument further. Consider a flexible price economy, given by a Fisher Equation and the
ELB

                                             rt   =   it - Et t+1
                                             it       0.

    Because this economy has flexible prices the real interest rate rt is exogenous, while the nominal
interest rate it is controlled by the central bank. This economy is for example derived in Woodford (2003),
corresponding to a classic endowment economy. Consider a shock to the real interest rate so that it is
negative in period 0, r0 < 0, and rt =  -1 - 1 > 0 for all t > 0. As the ELB is no longer binding
from period 1 on, the central bank can generate any inflation rate it chooses. How does it implement this
inflation rate? For concreteness, one can for example imagine a reduced-form money demand function as
in Krugman (1998)
                                                Mt
                                                      Yt
                                                 Pt
which is slack when the ELB is binding. Since the interest rate is positive in period t  1, nothing prevents
the central bank from meeting its assumed objective and choosing a money supply such that the price level
in period 1 and onward is the same as in period 0, i.e., Pt = P0 for all t > 0, so that t = 0 for all t > 0.
This implies however that the equilibrium cannot exist in period 0

                                            r 0 = i 0 - 1 = i 0  0 ,

which contradicts our initial assumption that r0 < 0. The flexible-price economy needs to generate negative
real interest rates in period 0, and the only way it can do so is via expected inflation. Yet 1 is ultimately
determined by the central bank in the next period. There is no guarantee that the central bank will deliver
the required inflation given that it is assumed to target zero inflation. There is also no reason for it not to
pin down the price level at that time, for example via money supply, since the interest rate is then again
positive.




                                                      24
10     Non-Existence and Alternative Monetary Policy Specifica-
       tions
In this paper we have focused on the equilibrium non-existence under the assumption that the central bank
                              
targets some inflation target t whenever it can, with the only reason preventing it from doing so being
the effective lower bound. This does not mean, however, that non-existence of equilibria arises under all
policy specifications. Indeed, the equilibrium can be restored and the ELB can be made irrelevant if the
central bank chooses for example a sufficiently high inflation target. Alternatively, the equilibrium could
be restored even with a low inflation target, if the central bank seeks to stabilize the price level. To see
this, consider again the example discussed in the previous section of a flexible-price economy where the
central bank targets zero inflation, but suppose now that the central bank targets a price level p
                                                                                                 ¯. In this
case
                                    r 0 = i 0 - 1 = - p 1 + p 0 = - p
                                                                    ¯ + p0

or p0 = r0 + p
             ¯. In period 0, the price level falls sufficiently so as to generate enough expected inflation.
More generally, price-level targeting regimes tend to be more robust for generating a stable equilibrium,
and are similarly less prone to generating equilibrium non-existence. The optimal commitment policy is a
policy regime that is relatively close to a price-level targeting regime, as shown in Eggertsson and Woodford
(2003), Giannoni and Woodford (2005), and Giannoni (2014). The same can be said about certain inertial
Taylor-type interest-rate rules that assign enough weight to lagged interest rates.


11     Conclusion
Conventional wisdom suggests that medium-term money neutrality imposes strong limitations on the effects
of monetary policy. In particular, as expectations become more ingrained it is commonly believed that
a monetary stimulus tends to have smaller output effects and results in higher inflation. As we have
shown in this paper, this medium-term monetary neutrality assumption runs into a direct conflict with
the aggregate demand side of modern general equilibrium models once the effective lower bound on the
nominal interest rate is taken into account. This results in some cases in non-existence of equilibria, or
in output contracting without a bound at the ELB -- a phenomenon we term contractionary black holes.
Our analysis first discussed the New Classical Phillips curve as it features full monetary neutrality in
the medium run, and considered deviations from this benchmark, which produce a medium-run trade-off
between inflation and output. A key conclusion is that the closer the aggregate supply is to exhibiting
medium-term money neutrality, the more likely the model is to produce equilibrium non-existence or a
very large output contraction in the short run, at the ELB. This is because an adverse shock at the ELB
causes a decline in short-run inflation and in medium-term inflation expectations, which increases the real
interest rate and reinforces the output contraction. The closer we are to money neutrality, the larger is
the decline in medium-run inflation expectations, the higher the increase the real interest rate and thus
the sharper the output contraction in the short run. Our analysis then proceeded with the New Keynesian
Phillips curve. In that case, while the result manifests itself via the duration at the ELB, we found again
that the closer the Phillips curve is to producing medium-term monetary neutrality, the sharper is the
short-run output contraction at the ELB.


                                                     25
   Paradoxically, the case for expansionary monetary policy at the ELB is even stronger in models that
feature near money neutrality. It is in this case that a monetary stimulus most effectively raises medium-
term inflation expectations and lowers real interest rates, so as to bring output closer to its potential. Our
analysis reveals that in the face of the ELB, output and inflation can be stabilized by raising inflation
expectations in a relatively short period after the shock which brought the economy to the ELB has
subsided. However, as in conventional analyses, once the economy has exited from the ELB, there is no
meaningful gain from raising the long-run inflation target.

A         Appendix: Linearization of the Optimal Pricing Conditions
This sections shows how a linearization of the optimal pricing conditions (9)-(12) results in the Phillips
curve (1) or equivalently (13). Using (7) to replace Wt in (9)-(10), and linearizing the resulting expressions
yields

                                      uc > 0. Linearizing in turn (12) yields

Using (41) to solve for p  ix

Using (40) to eliminate p t     yields finally the Phillips curve (1), with                                          +  -1 >

B         Appendix: Proof of Propositions for the New Classical Model
B.1       Proof of Proposition 2
                                           
Proof. Under the assumptions A1, r  ¯ > - L ,  > 1 and that the nominal interest rate is always positive
                                                                                                ^L = 0,
in the long run, it follows from Proposition 1 that a long-run equilibrium is well defined with Y
           
and EM L = L                                                                               ^M , iM
             . Next, suppose, as a way of contradiction, that a medium run equilibrium M , Y
satisfying (1) and (14)­(15) exists. Perfect foresight between periods S and M implies ES M = M , so
that the aggregate supply equation (1) in period M implies Y  ^M = 0. On the demand side, consider two
                              e                                                       e    
alternative cases. First, if rM + M   +   ( M - M )  0, then iM = 0 by (15). Since rM   + L  < 0 by
                                      ^M =  (  + re ) < 0. Alternatively, if re +   +  (M -   ) > 0,
assumption, it follows from (14) that Y       L   M                           M   M         M
then iM > 0 by (15). In this case, (14) implies

                                ^M = - (iM - L
                                Y                 e
                                               - rM             
                                                    ) = -iM +  (L    e
                                                                  + rM ) < 0.

                                      ^M < 0. This leads to a contradiction with the implication of (1)
So in both cases (14)­(15) imply that Y
                   ^M = 0. Hence no medium-run equilibrium M , Y
according to which Y                                               ^M , iM satisfying (1) and (14)­(15)
exists.

                                                    ^L = 0. Using this, equations (21)­(26) can be written

for any t  t1 . This simplifies to

Combining this with the government's interest-rate reaction function

other constant solution is ¯ t =  < 1 and ¯  it =  ,   ¯     ¯

chap. 2), for any initial inflation 0  0,      ¯  , one of these steady states will eventually be reached. In
                                                 L
contrast, for any 0 >   ¯  , inflation will increase forever and get unboundedly large. Such an equilibrium
                          L
is not consistent with a constant steady state inflation.

Using (43), we can determine medium-term output supplied

On the demand side, however, equilibrium output must satisfy (42) or

                                                             ¯L )

Using (53), this simplifies to
                                            M = (1 + iM ) ¯L ¯ -1
                                                               L

so that iM < 0, if condition (31) holds. It follows that the ELB condition (45) is violated and hence that
there is no medium-term equilibrium if (31) holds.

Combining the first two equations and using the assumption ¯

Equilibrium after period T.                   After period T , the equations (14)­(15) and (32) reduce to

Note that with  > 1, we have det (A) =  -1 ( + 1) > 1, and tr (A) =  -1 +  -1  + 1. This implies:
                                                                                                       1
det (A) - tr (A) = -1 +  -1  ( - 1) > -1, and det (A) + tr (A) =                                           ( +  ( + 1) + 2) > 1. It then
follows from Proposition C.1. in Woodford (2003, p. 670) that the matrix A has both eigenvalues outside
the unit circle, so that A-1 exists and has both eigenvalues inside the unit circle.
     Iterating forward equation (54), we have

                                  zt      =      -A-1 t + Et A-1 zt+1

Since limn Et A-n zt+n = 0 for any bounded process {zt } , we obtain the unique bounded solution
                         
                                                                                        -1                 -1               ¯

so that inflation and output are at their long-run steady state at all dates t > T.

Equilibrium in periods t = 0, 1, ..., T.                      With the ELB assumed binding in periods t = 0, 1, ..., T, the
model reduces to

                                                  t       =       ^t + Et t+1
                                                                  Y
                                                  ^t
                                                  Y       =          ^t+1 +  (Et t+1 + r).
                                                                  Et Y                                                               (55)

Combining the last two equations yields

                                            Et [t - (1 +  +  ) t+1 + t+2 ] = r.                                                      (56)

Let  be the "steady state" value of t , in periods t = 0, ...T. It satisfies  - (1 +  +  )  +  = r,
or  = -r. We can then rewrite (56) as the homogenous equation

                                                              Et [ B ( L ) ~t+2 ] = 0                                                (57)

where ~t  t - , the lag polynomial B (L) is given by

                                                 B ( L)            L2 - (1 +  +  ) L + 
                                                              =     (1 - e1 L) (1 - e2 L)                                            (58)

and e1 , e2 are the two roots of the characteristic polynomial P (x) = x2 - (1 +  +  ) x + 1. Note that
P (x) is convex, and P (0) = 1 > 0, P (1) = - < 0, P  -1 = - -1 < 0, so that P (x) = 0 admits
two real solutions 0 < e1 < 1 <  -1 < e2 . Expanding (58) and comparing it to B (L) reveals that
e1 e2 =  -1 . Using this, we can rewrite (57) as

                                                   0 = Et [(1 - e1 L) (1 - e2 L) ~t+2 ]

Defining zt  (1 - e1 L) ~t , this can be expressed as
                                           1 -1                                                  1 -1

where the last equality is obtained after iterating forward. Using again the definition of zt , we can then
write

This expression can be iterated forward to yield
