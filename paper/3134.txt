       STAGGERED PRICE SETTING WITH ENDOGENOUS FREQUENCY OF ADJUSTMENT


                                  ABSTRACT

The classic models of staggered adjustment of Taylor and Blanchard takes the
frequency of price or wage adjustment as exogenous. This paper develops a
model in which the frequency of price changes in endogenous. It then uses
the model to analyze the effects of changes in the parameters of the economy
on the frequency of adjustment and the real effects of monetary shocks.
