               The Implications of an Endogenous Money Supply
                            for Monetary Neutrality

                                   ABSTRACT




   This paper examines the implications of an endogenous money supply for the

perceived   (by econometricians) and actual nonneutrality of money in rational

expectations models of the class put forward by Lucas (1972, 1973) and Barro

(1976, 1980) that stress incomplete information. First, if there is contempo-

raneous policy response (e.g., to interest rates), then a simultaneous equa-

tions bias produces inconsistency in tests that use contemporaneous monetary

statistics such as those proposed by King (1981) and Boschen-Grossman (1983).

Thus, an econometrician might erroneously conclude that money is nonneutral in

a fully classical model. Second, if money acts as a 'signal' about economic

conditions then autonomous (policy induced) changes in the money stock can

have real effects.    In contrast to the nonneutrality of money in the Lucas-

Barro analysis, which arises due to incomplete information about monetary

aggregates, this nonneutrality requires that monetary information be utilized

by economic agents.

               The Implications of an Endogenous Money Supply
                            for Monetary Neutrality


     The nonneutrality ot exogenous monetary changes in the rational expecta-

tions/monetarist models of Lucas (1972,1973) and Barro (1976,1980) arises as a

consequence of imperfect information. In these setups, economic agents do not

directly observe the quantity of money and, consequently, mistakenly perceive

changes in nominal prices as reflecting altered relative opportunities.

However, as King (1981) points out, if a monetary statistic is contemporane-

ously observable (even with some noise) then the Lucas-Barro models predict a

zero correlation between output and monetary statistics, as perceived varia-

tions in money are neutral in these models. Using quarterly post-war U.S.

data, Boschen and Grossman (1982) find a significant non-zero correlation

between output and contemporaneous monetary statistics, which leads to a

rejection of the Lucas-Barro model if agents are (plausibly) assumed to posess

such statistics.

      If money is endogenous and observable, however, then important modifica-

tions of both theory and econometric procedures are necessary, as we demon-

strate in this paper. First, even if money is fully neutral, endogeneity

implies that the zero-correlation hypothesis tested by Boschen-Grossman is not

an implication of the rational expectations/monetarist models of Lucas and

Barro. We describe an econometric procedure that can handle some forms of

this 'simultaneous equations' bias, producing a valid test of the neutrality

hypothesis. Second, if money serves as a 'signal' about economic conditions-

 -say, because agents do not observe some other aggregate state variable with

 which money is correlated- -then autonomous movements in money can have             real

 effects.    This nonneutrality requires that money be observed by economic

 agents, a polar opposite assumption to that made by Lucas and Barro. However,

 for this nonneutrality to arise, it is still central that information is

 imperfect, in the sense that agents are unable to observe all the shocks that

impact upon the system.

     The organization of the remainder of the paper is as follows.             In section

I, we review the basic relationship between money and economic activity in

equilibrium models, using Barro's (1980) model as our organizing framework.

In section II, we look at neutrality tests under some alternative assumptions

about monetary information and the money supply process, working within a

model in which the contemporaneously perceived component of money is actually

neutral. We discuss some spurious rejections of the neutrality hypothesis

that may emerge when money is endogenous and suggest an econometric procedure

that deals with one class of these problems. In section III, our focus shifts

to an equilibrium model with a substantially different economic mechanism, in

which autonomous movements in a partly endogenous money aggregate are nonneu-

tral because they are a valuable, but imperfect, 'signals about economic

conditions. Section IV is a brief summary and conclusions.


I.   Equilibrium Models, Expectations, and Money
     The analysis   in   parts II   and III below   employs a variant   of   the business
cycle   model constructed by Barro (1980). Here, we give a brief review of this

model and describe the special features that are important for our paper.

     In common with the general class of models put forward by Lucas (1977),

there is a single final product that is traded in a large number of decentral-

ized exchange locations (z1,2,.. . ,Z).      In each location, the commodity supply

and demand schedules are given by the following log-linear specifications:
                                                                                        3

                                                              +
(1)     y(z) =   k(z)     + a5 rt(z) -     S a(z)    +
                                                         8m
(2)     y(z) =   k(z)
                          -   ad rt(z) +   S at(z)   +
                                                         o
                      + 82 E           +


where the parameters a, , and 0 are all taken to be positive. As in Barro's

models (1976, 1980), commodity supply depends on a systematic component

(k(z)), the relevant rate of return from the perspective of market z

(r(z)), a local supply disturbance ((z)), and on a wealth term, a(z).

Commodity demand is specified with symmetric, though opposfte influences.

      The model also incorporates a permanent aggregate disturbance              which

affects both supply and demand in the current period. In addition, commodity

demand is assumed to depend positively on the locally perceived future value

of this disturbance (E11+i).2 One rationalization of such a specification

would be that         represents shifts in the marginal efficiency of capital. The

resulting investment responses would generally be larger if they are foreseen
            _d
(02 > 81 = 01    +    s
                          >   0).   However, a complete analysis of capital accumula-
                     01
tion would involve many issues that are tangential to the main issues of this

paper.

       Local commodity market equilibrium determines a real rate of return and

quantity of output as functions of the various shift variables discussed

 above.




      Throughout our discussion, we use the shorthand notation Ext to denote the
      rational expectation of the variable x, based on the information set I(z)
      possessed by agents in market z.

      Lucas (1975), King (1981), and Trehan (1982) discuss aspects of incorporat-
      ing capital accumulation into this sort of model.

discussion below will center on a(z) and Ent+1 as channels of influence for

monetary variables on real activity.

          Since there is a nominal inside bond in Barro's model, the relevant real

rate of return from the perspective of market z is Rt +                                             -
                                                                                             P(z)       EPt+1,   where

P(z) is the logarithm of the price in market z at date t and l+1 is the

logarithm of the general price level at date t+l.

          The aggregate portfolio balance condition (5) specifies that the logarithm

of the nominal money stock equals the logarithm of nominal money demand.

Nominal money demand depends positively on the general price level and the

level of economy-wide average real balances T, which depends on economy-wide

average real income                       and the nominal interest rate (R) in conventional

ways.

"
     Barro and King (1982) point out that time separable preferences imply that
     H0, so that this channel may not be relevant. Yet, for our general pur-
     poses this mechanism for monetary effects on real output is as good as any
     other.
                                                                                                  5

           s.                                     d.                                       is a
where M is the nominal money supply, Mt i nominal molley demand and

shift term. This condition and economy-wide averages of (3) and (4) determine

the price level and the nominal interest rate.

      Following Archibald and Lipsey (1958) and Barro (1980), it is assumed that

money is wealth only to the extent that there is a gap between real balances

held and those desired for transactions purposes, which neglects the income

effects of the flow of transactions services derived from money holding.

Specifically, we assume that a(z) = (Mt            + EM+i - EZPt+i)           -
                                                                                  ETt+i.   Impos-

ing the expected future version of the monetary equilibrium condition (5) on

the model, it then follows that a(z) = Mt                  -         (for a detailed discussion
                                                               EMt
and alternative derivation, see Barro (1980)).

      Consequently, economy-wide average output depends on the money stock only

to the extent that variations in this quantity are not generally recognized to

be taking place. Now, assuming that                    =
                                                               -1 + v, where V iS serially
independent and distributed N(0,o2), we obtain economy-wide average output

as:


                              -               +-               v
(6)         =; +(Mt               EM) +02 Evt
       —        s        d            G+aSO
                                              2
with y = -s--- k    + 2....       +


where k is the economy-wide average value of k(z), etc. (Ext denotes an

economy-wide average expectation, here and below).

      The expression for aggregate output (6) derived from our particular model

 shares key features with other members of the class of equilibrium business

 cycle models put forward by Lucas, Barro and others. In particular, perceived

 monetary disturbances--changes affecting Mt and EMt equally--are irrelevant

 for output determination. Our model also incorporates a role for the actual
                                                                                                  6

and perceived value of the aggregate disturbances,                        v, for which we have
suggested a technological interpretation.                       It should be pointed out that for

the bulk of our analysis, it is (6) that is key, rather than the particular

structural model from which it is derived.


The Money Supply Process and Monetary Information

       To close the model, it is necessary to specify how the quantity of money

evolves over time. We assume that the money stock is the outcome of two

components, the money multiplier and the monetary base, so that the growth

rate of money may be divided into multiplier growth                         and base growth (hr).
                                                                       ()
(7)                             +
         Mt M1 =                    ht


       We make the following assumptions about the evolution of these components.

Each has a portion that is predictable on the basis of previous information,

which we denote E                   and E h .       The unpredictable component of money
                         t-l              t-l
growth we denote m =                     -E      + (h -   E hr). In the discussion below,
                                          t-l             t-l
we consider the following alternative assumptions about the exogeneity and

observability of m:


(8a)     mt is not observable and is an independent, normal variable


(8b)        is observable and is an independent, normal variable


(8c)       m is the sum of two independent normal variables.                         The first,
                =   (h   - E h ),        is   observable and the second, x. =       -E
           is   not.
                          t-l                                                        t-l

(8d) m = P1v             + w and is observable


(8e)     mt =            -    E Rt) + w and is observable
                Tp2(Rt
                             t-l
                                                                            7


where, in both (8d) and (8e), wt is an independent, normal variable.

    In the former three specifications, the money supply is an exogenous

variable with respect to output, although three contrasting assumptions about

its observability by economic agents are made.     First, (8a) represents the

Lucas-Barro hypothesis that agents do not posess contemporaneous monetary

statistics. Alternatively, as in King (1981) and Boschen-Grossman (1982),

(Sb) assumes that agents have contemporaneous monetary information.. Specifi-

cation (8c) represents an intermediate case where agents are assumed to

observe high powered money but not the monetary multiplier within the decision

period.

    In the latter two specifications, we allow the money supply to be endoge-

nous and assume that it is observable by economic agents.   In (8d) the money

supply reacts to the aggregate shock, v. Below, we discuss two alternative

interpretations for v and the reasons such a response may be observed.

Finally in (8e), this dependence is assumed to derive from a response to

nominal interest rate movements, a pattern of behavior that is frequently

asserted to describe central bank operating policies (see, for example, Poole

(1975)).   In our setup, this dependence might plausibily derive from either

reserve management activities of banks that affect the growth of the multi-

plier () or central bank operating policies that lead to a dependence of the
growth in the monetary base (hr) on the interest rate.


II. Neutrality   Tests
    The basis for neutrality tests ii the observation that perceived monetary

growth does not affect output in Lucas-type business cycle models. However,

the elements of money that are unperceived depend in an essential way on the

information structure of the model. In this section we discuss some neutral-
                                                                             8

 ity tests employing a output specification that is a special case of (6), in

that perceptions of real variables are irrelevant to output determination

 (02=0).


Anticipated Money Growth

    Barro and others have tested the neutrality of anticipated money growth,

which is one implication of the sort of model we discuss here. If we maintain

that money is not contemporaneously observable, it is necessary to decompose

money into its anticipated and unanticipated components, because unanticipated

money can have real effects if it is also unperceived. Testing is complicated

because the construct unperceived money (Mt -
                                                 EMt
                                                       =   - Em)    depends in

complicated ways on the elements of information sets. However, if money is

not directly observable but agents do observe local prices and interest rates,

then it can be shown that unanticipated monetary events typically exert      a

positive but less than one-to-one impact on unperceived money (mt -
                                                                         Em)
because agents learn about monetary shocks from the available price signals

(see Barro (1980) and King (1983) for some detailed discussions). Thus, under

our informational assumption (8a), there will be a causal, positive influence

of unanticipated money growth on output, which Lucas and Barro have stressed.

Anticipated money growth, which is perceived, will not have this property.


Contemporaneous Monetary Information

    When contemporaneous monetary information is available, however, matters

are altered substantially. If money is accurately observable, as under our

assumption (8b), then the gap m -        will necessarily be zero if economic
                                    Em
agents use information efficiently. King (1981) discussed how this result

extends to models in which money is not accurately observed but, instead, is
                                                                                          9


corrupted by a temporary measurement error. Essentially, since unperceived

money takes the form of an 'expectation error,' it should not be correlated

with any information variable that economic agents use to form expectations.

Thus, output should be uncorrelated with contemporaneously observed monetary

statistics, even if these are imperfect indicators of the stock of money.

That is, given that output depends on real variables and unperceived money, in

the        restricted     form         of       (6)        that    we     are     using,

   =      +
                      Em) +-   v, then it follows that a test of the neutral-
                  -



ity proposition may be obtained by a regression of output on contemporaneous

monetary statistics. The twin hypotheses of (i) neutrality of perceived money

growth and (ii) rational expectations based on contemporaneous information

imply a zero regression coefficient in this case.

       Boschen (1981) and Boschen-Grossman (1982) employ such tests on quarterly

post-war data for the United States.5 Using a variety of specifications,

measures of money, and real activity, they document that estimated regression

coefficients typically differ from zero at conventional statistical levels.

       One potential explanation of these results is that the relevant monetary

aggregate is only partly observed, which could correspond to our case (8c).

In this case, variations in the monetary base would be neutral--because they

were rapidly perceived--while variations in the money multiplier would be
   In this quick summary of the Boschen-Grossmafl work, we gloss over the
  important contribution that their theoretical analysis makes to formulating
  the neutrality test in an empirically tractable manner. The difficulty is
  that actual money growth, Mt - Mt_l,                involves both an anticipated and
  unanticipated component. In principle, spurious rejection of the neutral-

   ity hypothesis could emerge if there were a correlation between               (antic-

      ipated output) and E       -
                                            (anticipated   money) through the operation
                         t-1
   of a feedback policy rule by the monetary authority. Two solutions to this
   potential problem appear available. The first is to 'hold fixed' sepa-

      rately the elements of         in the regression. The second is to purge money

      of its anticipated component.         Boschen-Grossmafl opt for the former proce-

      dure, which they implement empirically by viewing             as a distributed lag

      of past
                                                                                   10

 nonneutral.6 Hence, the correct formulation of the neutrality test using

 contemporaneous monetary information would use the base rather than a broader

 monetary aggregate. John Boschen has suggested to us that such tests would

 not result in rejection of the neutrality hypothesis, at least for the second

 half of the post-war period, based on some preliminary empirical results that

 obtained in his thesis research (1981).     This distinction is clearly worth
 exploring in future empirical research.


 Endogenous Unexpected Money

     If the unpredictable movements in money, m, are endogenous--in the sense

 of being correlated with autonomous determinants of output, v, in the struc-

 tural model above--then spurious rejections of the neutrality hypothesis may

occur even if it is actually true.       To discuss this point and econometric

procedures that may be appropriate, we consider in turn the policy specifica-

tion (8d,e), each of which involves the assumption that agents accurately

observe the money stock. Consequently, unperceived money will be zero in each

case. For (8d) we take an alternative interpretation of v, and let it repre-

sent government spending. This specification then implies that part of gov-

ernment spending is financed by printing new money.        It is assumed that gov-

ernment spending is determined exogenously and that all spending is temporary,

so that    =
               Vt here. Notice that the issue of whether the    spending is perma-
nent or temporary serves only to determine the size of the 8 coefficients in

the supply and demand equations above.

    Under these assumptions, (6) becomes      =        +
                                                  yt       v. A regression of
output on money will produce a positive coefficient even when both money and

government spending are perfectly observable due to the 'common effect' of
                                                                              v.
G Boschen (1981, pp. 26-28) discusses the changing reporting procedures used
  by the Federal Reserve System over the post-war period.
                                                                                             11


      Specification (8e) differs from the preceeding case in that money is

assumed to react to unpredictable changes in the nominal interest rate, which

is endogenous in the model considered above. In the present case, v can be

interpreted either as a technological shock or a shock to government spending.

Then a simple regression of output on the contemporaneous monetary statistic

and     will generally yield a non-zero regression coefficient, i.e.,


          =           +
(9)                       c(m),
                  G
                  —               -

            ''2   a cov(R                 Rt, v)/var (mr).


      Thus, changes in money supply and               output     will be positively correlated

(recall that the money supply reacts positively to interest rate changes) as

long as the technological disturbance leads to a higher interest rate. From
                                                                  >        Even if this is not
(3) above, this will be the case as long as                           O.
the case, the example above clearly brings out the potential for spurious

rejections of the neutrality hypothesis.
                                                                               known, then it is
      If the parameters of the policy reaction function are

easy to correct for the correlations discussed in the two examples above. In

these cases all that is required is to make an adjustment for that part of the

change in money supply which is endogenous.                            A regression of y on

 (m -             -       E Rt)) would then be the correct method of testing for neu-

 tral, i.e., variations in money supply have no effect on output. The positive

 correlation between observed money and output occurs
                                                                           solely as a result of

 permitting money to be endogenous. Further, endogeneity may provide an alter-

 native explanation for Boschen's finding that the neutrality hypothesis cannot

 be rejected if the monetary base is used as the relevant aggregate. To the

 extent that the multiplier is 'more' endogenous than the base, the discussion

 indicates that it would be more highly correlated with output than the lat-

 ter.


 Ill.    Money as a Signal
        In   this section, we introduce the possibility that autonomous monetary

disturbances are nonneutral because agents view monetary statistics as convey-

ing valuable information about economic conditions.          In principle, the sig-
nalling role could arise either because the monetary authorities had access to

superior information or, more plausibly, because the money supply responds

endogenously to aggregate state variables that are not directly observable.

        For the present purposes, it is key that the money stock is observable

(though it need not be observed without noise) and endogenous, so that we

employ specification (8d) above. Further, we maintain the imperfect informa-

tion assumption in the sense that agents cannot observe the aggregate distur-

bances w and v that hit the system. For concreteness, we interpret v as

the current shock to technology, so that the current state of technology is

given by        =
                    t-l   + v. Under the policy rule (8d), money reacts directly to

the technology shock v, i.e., m =              + w, and also involves an autonomous

component w. Such a positive endogenous response (4 > U) may occur, for

example, if a sudden realizatio.-i of profitable investment opportunities

  The bulk of the business cycle correlation between output and monetary
  magnitudes is with banking system measures.  For example, Friedman and
  Schwartz (1963, Chapter 7) stress that changes in the money multiplier
  represent the major source of monetary change throughout the Great Contrac-
  tion. Working from a different perspective, King and Plosser (1981) show
  that high powered money is weakly correlated with output fluctuations while
  deposits are significantly positively correlated over the post war period.

our assumption that money is accurately observable, it is direct that

m = Em,         so that aggregate output takes the form

This expression emphasizes that the expectational channel by which money can

be nonneutral is Evt, the perceived value of the technology shock.

       The nature of the rational expectations solution for Evt as a function of

information variables depends on the information set, which in principle would

involve the current money supply, the nominal interest rate and the local

price. However, a full-blown solution for Ev becomes extremely complicated

in this model if several signals are used (see, for example, Barro (1980) in

which there are two signals). Therefore, for illustrative purposes, we first

discuss expectation formation under the assumption that the only signal that

agents possess is the current money stock.

       Given the linear normal structure of the model, it follows that agents'

one signal rule will take the following simple form.

the only source of information, expectations do not differ across markets.

Thus, it follows that average expectations Ev respond by less than one-to-

one with v (since 0 <                  < 1) and positively to autonomous monetary shocks

       if there is a positive relationship between money and technology shocks

       > 0).       In this case, random increases in the money supply raise output,

according to (10) above, because agents treat these fluctuations as signalling

positive movements in v, e.g., indicating an increase in the future profit-

ability of investment.

       The fact that the output effect of autonomous movements in money (we) is

positive (given 4 > 0) is easily seen.                   Substituting (11) in (10) gives a

reduced form expression that links output to the fundamental shocks v and
                                                                                      w.

Further, using policy specification (8d), we obtain


(13)      Cov[(y -      y)(M      -

which is unambiguously positive for *1 > 0.                    Therefore, the coefficient

obtained from regressing output on money will be positive.

       Thus, in the present model, (12) demonstrates that there is a true causal

relationship that exists between autonomous monetary movements (wv) and out-

put, with a positive influence existing so long as agent's perceptions of the

unobservable real aggregate shock (vt) are positively related to the observed

aggregate (i.e., Z =             p o/(4l      + o) > 0). Further, there is a posi-

tive covariance between output and measured money under the same conditions

       > 0), in view of (13).

       However, the covariance calculated in (13) is not informative about the

empirical relevance of the key element of this model, which is the nonneutral-

ity mechanism.8 Specifically, suppose that one adopts the alternative hypothe-

sis--advanced, for example, by King and Plosser (l98l)--that attributes the

comovements of money and output to the fact that these variables both respond

to aggregate real shocks that are observable by economic agents.         In the

current setup, this implies that output is simply given by



                    t
                    —
                        =

                            a   v
which follows from (10) above by replacing Ev with v. This model also

generates the covariance (13), which in fact will be produced by any model in

which money is a common component of the information set on which Evt is

based.9

       That this covariance is silent on the predictions of our model implies

that empirical strategies must isolate contemporaneously unperceived compo-

nents of autonomous money growth (our w) to test the key predictions of our

model, i.e., the expectational nonneutrality displayed in (10) versus alterna-

tive theories (such as (10)'). We are presently investigating the feasibility

of some alternative empirical strategies.     One attractive possibility1° is to

examine the implications of money supply                              previously

by Cornell (1983), Engel and Frankel (1982) and others--in the context of our

theory, particularly investigating implications for interest rates, commodity

prices and production.




   To see this, note that (10) may be written as

        -
            t  a w - — (Vt
                =             - a56
                                Eve).
   A basic property of rational expectations is that the expectation error
               will always be uncorrelated with elements of I(z), such as
   (Vt -    Ev)
   money growth in our setup.

    statistically significant interest rate effects of Ml surprises and
       insignificant base impacts over several recent intervals.
                                                                                 16

        The above discussion proceeded under the maintained hypothesis that money

 was the only source of contemporaneous information. Although we have not

 worked out a solution to the complete model with three signals, we provide

 some speculations based on results of parallel studies. First, it will be

 necessary for there to be at least three aggregate shocks if the money stock

 and interest rate are to be prevented from fully revealing all relevant infor-

mation. Thus, for example, temporary supply or demand shocks would have to be

added to the model.

        Second, when there are more signals, it is likely that the extent of

agents' reliance on the money supply ()      will   be reduced.   Intuitively, this
is because the additional information reduces the reliance on any one signal

(subject to certain restrictions on the covariance matrix of v and the sig-

nals). Further, agents' expectations will be more precise as more information

is added.11 However, it is unlikely that these considerations will alter the

direction of the channel outlined above, although the magnitude of money

supply effects may be reduced.

      Thus, we have provided an example of the general idea that money may be

nonneutral because it acts as a signal.      In contrast to Lucas and Barro, a

positive correlation of autonomous money (we) and output emerges as a result

of contemporaneous monetary information rather than in the absence of such
data.


IV.     Summary and Conclusions
      Previous studies of the nonneutrality of money (Lucas, Barro) have made

the critical assumption that the current money supply cannot be observed.

Further, these studies have also assumed that the money supply is determined
'     Notice that this argument overlooks difficulties arising from the fact
      that the information content of signals is endogenous in setups such as
      those discussed above.
                                                                           17


exogenously. In this paper, we have shown that relaxing the second assumption

has important consequences for the neutrality of money- -both perceived (by

econometricians) and actual. Once money is permitted to be endogenous, posi-

tive comovements in money and output can be obtained even if the current money

stock is known to agents.

    Above, we analyzed two different situations.    In the first case, money

reacts to variables which are themselves directly observable. Money is neu-

tral in this case, yet regressions of output on money can produce positive

coefficients.   In the second case, money acts as a signal for some variable

which is itself not directly observable.   Here, money is no longer neutral.

Changes in the money supply bring about changes in real activity, with a

positive comovement being a plausible occurrence.
