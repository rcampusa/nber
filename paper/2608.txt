        Knowledge of actual Federal Reserve behavior is important in studies of monetary policy and

financial markets for   at least two reasons. First, the   interpretation of variables chosen to represent the

monetary policy process may be marred        if they    do not correspond to variables actually used by the

Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy or to gauge its performance. Accordingly, the Federal

Reserve's choices regarding targets, intermediate targets, and instruments may play            a key     role in

research design.1    Unfortunately, information regarding these choices is not always easy to obtain.

Relevant Federal Reserve policy statements, such as the FOMC policy directive, are released with a

substantial delay and often are ambiguous.2            Thus, additional knowledge regarding actual Federal

Reserve behavior may have a methodological payoff.3

        Second, the recurrent issue of policy credibility requires an assessment of the extent to which

Federal Reserve statements find a reflection in the beliefs and behavior         of economic agents.      While

credibility potentially has a variety   of interpretations, all would seem to require that a shxft in stated

policy objectives and instruments be associated with at least some change in market behavior. Thus,

additional knowledge regarding Federal Reserve behavior, and the financial market's reaction to it,

may help illuminate the credibility issue.

        This paper examines actual Federal Reserve behavior from            a financial   markets perspective.

Movements in interest rates are used as the metric in this exercise. The underlying presumption is that

financial market participants fully understand Federal Reserve behavior. This position is sensible for

two reasons.    First, many financial market participants are former Federal Reserve officials and
economists. Second, given the key role       of the Federal   Reserve in influencing interest rates in   at least

the short-run, market participantshave     a strong incentive to study Federal Reserve behavior.
        Following this introductory section, a framework for examining monetary policy is presented in

the first section.   Within this framework, several different types         of   monetary policy regimes are
distinguished.    In the   second section, the implications   of the   different monetary policy regimes on the

hehavior of interest rates are discussed. The third section presents empirical resolD          u sotual Federal
Reserve behavior. The period beginning in 1980 and ending in early 1987 is considered, This period is

interesting in that Federal Reserve statements indicate that monetary policy changed several times.

Thus specific instances of Federal Reserve behavior can be analyzed in terms of the credibility of

pohcymakers. The main conclusions are summarized in the final section.

I.       The Monetary      jic Frawrk
         Several aspects of monetary policy are reviewed in a stylized framework in this section             The

long-run objectives of monetary oolicy are first considered. These long-run objectives involve both the

targets and intermediate targets of policy over a gwen year. Next, several features pertaining to short-
run rr.onetary policy are discussed.     it is   argued that to interpret Federai Reserve behsvior correctly.

the short-run impemertation of monetary policy must be examined.                    Different types of' short-run

policies are distinguished both by the type of operating procedure implemented by the Federal Resent
and by the desire to offset deviationsfrom the targets

         A. Monetary Policy      QÃ§jives
         The uncertainties facing the Federal Reserve make monetary policy a particularly challenging

task, even apart from outside political pressures. The first choice facing .poticymskers is to decide

whetF.sr policy should be based directly on        a set of ultimate targets, such     as output, employment.

inflation, and foreign exchange rates,     or on    an intermediate target.       Potential intermediate targets

include monetary and credit aggregates, as well as other indicators from financial markets, including

interest rates.

        In the mid to late 1970s, the intermediate target procedure was progressively made more of a

formal part of Federal Reserve policy. Coinciding with this adoption, the Federal Reserve initiated a

series of annual targets for monetary and credit aggregates. This procedure was formalized further

under the Humphrey-Hawkins Act in 1978, which imposed                  a single   non-overlapping calendar year

policy period on the Federal Reserve.

        By the early 1980s, the intermediate target procedure was firmly entrenched .Nevertheless,



                                                          2
some ambiguities were apparent. One area of ambiguity involved the appropriate weights to be placed

on the various intermediate targets, particularly MI and M2, in formulating policy. A second area

involved uncertainties about the proper definition   of the narrowly   defined money stock, MI. Despite

                                                                                     erratic MI
problems in determining an appropriate definition for Ml, and the related problem of

velocity, Ml was the main focus of monetary policy. One reason for the use of Ml was          its timeliness.
                                                                                data on broader
Preliminary Mi data are available weekly with a lag of about 1-1/2 weeks, while

monetary aggregates are available only monthly. Many of the components         of the    broader aggregates

are, however, available weekly.      A second was    that Ml was the traditionally preferred monetary

aggregate because of its intended link with transactions balances. Another reason was that the reserve

requirements applied to non-Mi components of the broader aggregates are either zero or very low,

implying a potentially loose relationship between reserves and the broader aggregates.

        Because of the continuing erratic behavior of Ml velocity, the Federal Reserve virtually

abandoned its intermediate target procedure by the mid-1980s. In the record of policy actions at the

November 2, 1987 FOMC meeting, for example, the FOMC's domestic policy directive listed the

behavior of the monetary aggregates last among four items that could cause the Federal Reserve to

charge current pressure on reserve positions. The first three items were the strength of the business

expansion, inflationary pressures, and developments in foreign exchange markets. Thus. policymakers

were looking directly   at measures of economic performance. It also   is noteworthy   that the items in this

list occasionally change order. Developments in foreign exchange markets, for example, had been listed

first a few months earlier,

        The above is clearly a casual interpretation of monetary policy objectives in the 1980s.     It does,

nevertheless, suggest several hypotheses about Federal Reserve behavior. These hypotheses are tested

in the third section.     However, to interpret Federal Reserve behavior more precisely, the short-run

implementation of policy must be considered.

        B. Short-Run Monetary      j]j
        The Federal Reserve's short-run monetary policy can be described in terms of two factors. The

first concerns the rate at which the Federal Reserve attempts to offset any deviation from its target or



                                                       3
 intermediate target. The second is the type of operating procedure adopted. This latter area involves

 the choice of an instrument, or operating target, to conduct monetary policy.

          The view of monetary policy advanced here is that the Federal Reserve does not initiate short-.
 run shocks to the monetary aggregates; it merely reacts to them.          This view seems particularly

 appropriate prior to Fehruary 1984, when contemporaneous reserve requirements (CRR) were adopted.

 Under the lagged reserve requirement (LRR) system in effect from 1968 to that time, there was no

 direct link between hank reserves and MI in    a given week,    As a consequence, the money stock was

 essentially demand determined, and monetary shocks reflected shifts in the public's demand for

 money.4

          Given that observed monetary shocks represent new information to       boththe   public and the

 Fcderal Reserve, the relevant issue for policymakers is to determin the desired adjustment toward the

 monetary target. Casual evidence suggests that this adjustment speed may have changed at least twice

since the late 1970s. In particular, the Federal Reserve committed itself more ciosely to Ml targets in

October 1979, implying that any deviation from the monetary targets would be offset more quickly

than before. In October 1982, the Federal Reserve de-emphssized its monetary targets, implying slower

adjustment speeds.

          At the same time that the Federal Reserve changes adjustment speeds, it may also change its

operating procedures. The choice of operating procedures, however, is logically independent        of the
desired rate of adjustment. That is. any    of the three most prominent types of operating   procedures --
the federal funds   rate, nonborrowed reserves, and borrowed reserves procedures -- can potentially yield

virtually the same rate of adjustment.5     Nevertheless, the adoption of a federal funds rate, or money

market conditions, operating procedure is frequently interpreted as      an   abandonment    of monetary
targets. Similarly, the adoption of the nonborrowed reserves, or reserves aggregate, procedure in
October 1979 is often viewed as being consistent with a greater desire to offset monetary shocks. As

discussed in the next section, actual interest rate behavior can be used to infer both the type        of
operating procedure adopted by the Federal Reserve and the desired rate at which monetary shocks are

offset.




                                                     4
II,       Imolications for Interest      Bii
          Market interest rate data are used to represent the actions of financial     arket participants. It

is further assumed that market participants fully understand Federal Reserve behavior.                     As a

consequence, the Federal Reserves reaction function can be inferred under this rational expectations

assumption.       Moreover, changes in the estimated reaction function can be used        to   infer changes in

monetary policy regimes.

          Three aspects of interest rate behavior are considered here. These are the volatility of interest

rates, the response of interest rates to weekly MI announcements, and the response of interest rates to

new information about inflation, economic activity, and exchange rates. Differences in the volatility of

interest rates in different periods are used to infer changes in Federal Reserve operating procedures.

Similarly, changes in the response of interest rates to Ml announcements also are used to infer changes

in operating procedures as well as different degrees of emphasis on Ml targets. Finally, the response of

interest rates to other economic information is used to infer the targets of monetary policy during           a
particular period.
           A.   Volatility of Interest   EI
                The volatility of the federal funds rate depends on disturbances affecting the market for

reserves, Federal Reserve intervention in the reserves market through open market operations, and the

market's perception of the type of operating procedure being used,         If the    market believes that the

Federal Reserve will offset shocks affecting the reserves market through open market operations, and

the shocks are in fact offset fairly quickly, the federal funds rate will be relatively stable over a short

period, such as a week. If disturbances in either the demand for or supply of reserves are not expected

to    be offset, however,   the federal funds rate will move quickly to clear the reserves market. Different

operating procedures imply different behavior for the federal funds rate through these channels.6

           Under the federal funds rate procedure, the Federal Reserve offsets most shocks affecting the

reserves market to keep the federal funds rate relatively stable over a given period, such          as a   week.

Even under this procedure, however, the federal funds rate would be expected         to exhibit some volatility



                                                         )
over time. In particular, to offset deviations in money growth from its target, the Federal Reserve may

initiate discretionary changes in the rate,        Nevertheless, in comparison to the other operating

procedures discussed below, the federal funds rate should be relatively more stable under this procedure.

        Under the nonborrowed reserves procedure, moat disturbances affecting the reserves market,

and therefore the federal funds rate, are not offset.         Instead, the nonborrowed reserves path is

maintained over a given period and the federal funds rate fluctuates in response to shocks either      to the
demand fur    or supply   of reserves, As a result, the federal funds rate would be expected to be more

volatile under this procedure.

        The final procedure considered is the borrowed reserves procedure. Under this procedure, the

Federal Reserve can be. characterized as attempting to' achieve a certain level of discdunt window

borrowing over a given period. In this case, unanticipated changes in either required or excess reserves

are accommodated by changing nonborrowed reserves, If the demand for required reserves is higher

than expected, fur example, the federal funds rate rises initially and borrowing increases to equate

supply and demand in the reserves market. To offset the increase in borrowing, nonborrowed reserves

are increased until the federal funds rate falls to its previous level. In contrast, if a shock originating in

the demand for borrowed reserves occurs in      which borrowing is higher   than expected at every level of

the federal funds rate, this disturbance is at most partially offset and the federal funds rate falls. The

decline in the federal funds rate serves to reduce the demand for borrowed reserves. So, this source of

disturbances in the reserves market causes fluctuations in the federal funds rate. In comparison with

the other procedures, the borrowed reserves procedure implies more short-run volatility in the federal

funds rate than the federal funds rate procedure and less volatility than the nonborrowed reserves

procedure.7

        The volatility of other interest rates, such as the 3-month Treasury bill yield, also depends on

the type of operating procedure employed by the Federal Reserve, although to a lesser extent. The 3-

month Treasury bill yield depends on both the current federal funds rate and the rate expected in

future weeks. If the curreot week's federal funds rate fluctuates, then some of this volatility is reflected

in the Treasury bill yield.
        Treasury bill yields also fluctuate if financial market participants change their assessments

about the    federal   funds rate in future   weeks.   Monetary targets are important in examining this link.

If new information about either money or the economy suggest8, for example, that the future level of

the money stock will be higher than previously expected, the Treasury bill yield may rise if the market

expects the Federal Reserve to offset this increase. In this instance,          the market expects the          Federal

Reserve to attempt to achieve a particular monetary target, and the magnitude                  of the      increase   in

interest rates reflects the desired speed of short-run adjustment.back to the target level. Alternatively,

if the Federal Reserve places little or no weight on a particular monetary target, the market will expect

future levels of the federal funds rate to be           as   previously predicted.   So, for   a   given monetary

disturbance, the greater the Federal Reserve's commitment to achieve a particular monetary target, the

greater the coinciding fluctuation in longer term yields.

        B.    Response to           g    Economic Announcements

              The response of interest rates to money and economic announcements provides futher

evidence on the type of operating procedure adopted by the Federal Reserve, as well                a.s   the   degree of

emphasis placed on various targets and intermediate targets of policy. In particular, the response of

the federal funds      rate depends on the    type of operating procedure. The response of longer-term yields

depends somewhat on the operating procedure, but             it   depends more importantly on the intermediate

target or target of policy. The responses to       Ml announcements and other economic announcements are

considered separately below.

        First, consider the response to the federal funds rate to weekly Ml announcements.                         Th

response depends directly on the type of operating procedure employed by the Federal Reserve, In

particular,the response depends on whether the corresponding shock to the market for reserves is offset.
The reserves market is affected by unanticipated announced changes in Ml initially through the

market's assessment of the demand for required reserves. Under the LRR system in effect before

February 1984, required reserves depended on the level of the money stock two weeks previously, the

statement week corresponding to the current week's money announcement data. Under the CRR

system adopted in February 1984, required reserves depend on the current money stock, with                      a lag of
two days.8     As   a consequence, the money announcement data under      CRR do not coincide with the

current reserves periods. Unanticipated announced changes in         Ml may     still affect the demand for

reserves, however, if the unanticipated changes have persistent effects on future levels of the money

stock,   That is, the current week's demand for reserves would he affected if            a   positive money

announcement surprise causes market participants to raise their assessments of the current week's

money stock.

         Under the federal funds rate procedure, the federal funds rate should not respond to money

announcement surprises, in this case, market participantsexpect the Federal Reserve to accommodate

the implied shock in the reserves market, In contrast, the federal funds rate should increase in response

to a positive money announcement surprise under the nonborrowed reserves procedure. This rise is due

to a higher assessment of the demand for reserves that is not expected to be accommodated through

Federal Reserve open msrket operations. Similar to the federal funds rate procedure, the federal funds

rate should not respond to money announcement surprises under the borrowed reserves procedure. This
behavior follows because the Federal Reserve accommodates shocks to the demand for reserves under

this operating procedure.

         The response of Treasury bill yields and other longer term yields to money announcement

surprises depends partly on the response of the federal funds rate.       Most of the response. however,

depends on the extent to which the market expects the Federal Reserve to offset the shock in the

future. In particular, the response   is greater   the more quickly the Federal   Reserve acts   to offset the

money surprise. So, the response to the Treasury bill yield to money announcement surprises can be

used tn determine whether the Federal Reserve is perceived to he attempting to achieve its Ml target.9

         The response of Treasury bill yields to unanticipated announced changes in economic activity

and inflation may operate through the same channels as money announcements if these other economic

announcements provide information useful in predicting money demand. In particular, if either real

economic activity or inflation is higher than expected, the market may raise         its assessment    of the

current and future week's demand for money.            interest rates, then, wnuld be expected to rise in

response to this new information about the domestic economy           if the   market does not expect the




                                                       8
 Federal Reserve to accommodate the increased demand. A 8imilar direct link between exchange rate

 movements and the demand for money is not evident.

          The primary effect of new information about economic activity, inflation, and foreign exchange

 rates on interest rates is likely due to the direct value of this information. That is, if policymakers are

 placing more weight on their targets, and less weight on their intermediate monetary targets, new

 information about the economy and exchange rates may cause immediate interest rate movements. If

 inflation is announced to be higher than expected, for example, policymakers may adopt more

 restrictive policies, causing interest rates to rise immediately.     The effect could be the same for an

 unexpectedly large increase in economic activity, especially during the later stages       of an   economic

expansion when concern about future inflation is growing. Moreover, if the Federal Reserve is focusing

directly on the value of the dollar in currency markets, new information about exchange rates may lead

to immediate interest rate movements. Depending           on the Federal Reserves   ernphass on this type of
direct information about its ultimate targets, the response of interest rates may have varied over

different periods.



Ill.      Empirical Results

         The various aspects of interest rate behavior discussed in the previous section are used below to

test hypotheses about the behavior to the Federal Reserve in conducting monetary policy. Three

separate periods are examined since 1980. The first actually begins in October 1979, when the Federal

Reserve announced        a new   operating procedure along with an increased emphasis on the monetary

aggregates. This new procedure corresponds to the nonborrowed reserves procedure discussed in the

previous section. The second period begins in October 1982, when the Federal Reserve announced the

abandoned the nonborrowed reserves procedure in favor of the borrowed reserves operating procedure.

At that time, somewhat less emphasis also may have been placed on the monetary aggregates                â



specifically   Ml --   as intermediate targets. The   third period begins in February 1984, coinciding with

the implementation of CRR. Because of the uncertainties regarding the effects of CRR among other

factors, the Federal Reserve may have dc-emphasized the role of the monetary aggregates further in




                                                         9
this period.10     Another period, beginning in October 1977 and ending in October 1979, also is

examined to compare the monetary policy regimes in the 1980s with monetary policy in the late 1970s.

Prior to October   1979,   the federal funds rate procedure was in effect.



        A. Volatility of Interest

             The volatility     of the   federal funds rate and the 3-month Treasury hill yield is examined

over four periods in Table 1. As is apparent in the table, the weekly volatility of the federal funds rate


                                                     TABLE I



is consistent with the changes in operating procedures hypothesized previously.               in particular. in

cbntparisun tu the pre-October 1979 period, the standard deviation of weekly percentage changes in the

federal funds rate was about four times as large in the October 1979 - October 1982 period. This

behavior is consistent with     a switch to the nonhorrowed      reserves procedure from the federal funds rate

procedure. The volatility then declined to about half that of the October 1979 - October 1982 period in

both of the periods after October 1982. Despite this decline, the volatility since October 1982 is

significantly larger than that experienced prior to October 1979, suggesting that the Federal Reserve

did not return to the federal funds rate procedure.1'            Instead, the evidence is consistent with the

adoption   of the borrowed reserves procedure.
        Similar to the volatility of the federal funds rate, the volatility      of the   3-month Treasury bill

yield also increased significantly following October 1979. In contrast to the federal funds rate, however,

volatility after October 1982 returned       to pre-October   1979 levels. While some portion of the volatility

of the Treasury bill yield should reflect the volatility of the federal funds rate, a larger part can be

attributed to changes in the market's expectation about future monetary policy, As a result, the

increased volatility   of the   Treasury bill yield in the October 1979 - October 1982period is consistent

with a greater commitment of the Federal Reserve to offset a given shock affecting the money stock,

while the decline in volatility after October 1982 suggests the opposite.            Other evidence, however,




                                                         10
allows more direct inference about this possible shift.

         B. Response to MQ!            Economic Announcements

             To provide further evidence on changes in monetary policy operating procedures,

hypotheses discussed in the previous section about the response of the federal funds rate to money

announcement surprises are first tested. Then, to determine the market's assessment             of the   Federal

Reserve's targets and intermediate targets, the response of the 3âmonth Treasury bill yields to money

and other economic announcements is examined empirically.

         The usual efficient markets model     is used   to estimate the responses of both the federal funds

rate and the 3-month Treasury bill yield.          This model relates daily changes in interest rates to

unanticipated announced changes in money and other economic variables. With the exception of the

exchange rate variable, unanticipated changes are measured as the difference between announced and

expected values. The expected values are taken from           a survey    conducted by Money Market Services.

Inc. The survey data are further adjusted, however, to take into account information from the time of

the survey to the time of the announcement.'2        If the Federal Reserve -- and therefore the market --

views new information about     a particular   variable as being relevant for policy, the estimated response

of interest rates should be significant.

         The estimated response of the federal funds rate to the unanticipated component of weekly Ml

announcements is reported in Table 2. The only statistically significant response occurs in the January

                                                  TABLE 2

198Q   - October 1982 period, consistent with the nonborrowed reserves procedure.13 In the two post-

October 1982 periods, the response is insignificantly different from zero, consistent with either the

federal funds rate or borrowed reserves procedures. Although estimates are not reported here, previous

studies find that the response also is insignificantly different from zero prior to October 1979 [e.g.,

Roley and Walsh (1985)].         Combined with the evidence from Table 1, the results support the

hypothesis that the Federal Reserve operated under            a federal   funds rate procedure prior to October

1979, and then implemented the nonborrowed reserves procedure               during the October 1979 -    October

1982 period. After October 1982, the combined evidence from      Tablss 1 and 2 suggests that the Federal

Reserve adopted the borrowed reaerves procedure.

        To determine the relative importance of various targets and intermediate targeta of monetary

policy, the response of the 3-month Treasury bill yield to a set of economic variables is estimated in

Table 3.    In addition to weekly Ml announcements, the unanticipated components               of   monthly

annnuncements of the producer price index, consumer price index, industrial production. and the

unemployment rate are considered. Daily changes in the yen/dollar exchange rate also are included to

estimate the significance of foreign exchange rate factors. Yen/dollar rate changes are measured as the

difference in ciosing and opening quotes in the Tokyo market each day. Thus, such movements in the

Tokyo market cao be regacded as news to traders in New York, since these movements are recorded

when the New York idarket is ciosed.

                                                TABLE 3

        The results in Table   3   indicate that the role of Ml targets successively diminished over the

three periods since   1980. and the differences across periods    are significant at the 5 percent level.

Moreover, since February 1984, the response of the 3-month Tressury bill yield to weekly Ml

announcements is insignificant!y different from   zero'4   While the role of Mi has decreased, the reeulte

suggest that the effect of direct information about the domestic economy has increased over time. As

indicated by the reported       F-statistics, the hypothesis that new information about inflation,

unemployment, and output does not affect interest rates can be rejected      at the   5 percent level in the

February 1984   - September    1986 period. The most significant variable during this latter period is

industrial production, suggesting that the Federal Reserve was looking directly at the performance of

the economy in conducting policy. Finally, yen/dollar exchange rate movements are not estimated to

have had significant effects overall, though intermittent effects cannot be ruled   out.'

IV.        Conclusions

          This paper exploited the financial market's understanding of Federal Reserve behavior in

considering changes in monetary policy. In particular, both interest rate volatility and the financial

market's perception of the Federal Reserve's reaction function were osed to examine several monetary

policy regimes over the last decade. One regime began in October 1979, when the Federal Reserve

adopted    a nonhorrow"d   reserves operating procedure and placed greater emphasis on Ml.       Prior to

October 1979, the     fedrai funds rate operating   procedure was to effect. In October 1982, monetary

policy shi1ted to a borrowed reserves operating procedure and     a diminished   role for Mi. Finally, in

February 19k4, stil less weight was placed on Ml as an intermediate target of policy, with more weight

placed directly or. the performance of the domestic economy These d,fferent periodc correspond to

Federal Reser.e start-ri.rnts about changes in policy, and, as a whole, the evidence suggests tha actual

changes wet" n.ade. To that extent. tne evidence suggests that piliry was credible.

          To anayce the motives surrounding the Federal Reserre's formulation and inplcnientation of

niooetary 1eAtry, it seems particularly worthwhile to study these specific episodes on a case study basis.

Such a sun> nay reseal the relative importance placed on political and economic factors influencing

Federal lleser'.e behasior. In brief, it appears that both factors are important. 'The change in policy in

October 197       for exa'nple. was drisen by the desire to ncrcase interest rates to defend the dollar in

foreign eamhange narkets and to reduce inflation in the U.S. A slowdown in the growth               of the

monetary aggregates also was desired to reduce infiatioo in the future. Under the federal funds rate

procedure in effect prior to October 1979. the Federal Reserve would be blamed for        a sharp   rise in

interest rates.    To deflect such criticism, policymakers adopted a procedure in which "the market

determines rates," the nooborrowed reserves procedure. At the same time, there was some hope that

this procedure would allow closer control of Ml and hence reduce the prospects of continued high

inflation.

           Similar economic and political choices were made in 1982. In particular, by October 1982, the

behavior    of both Ml   and the economy was seemingly becoming more unpredictable, and the Federal

Reserve's independence was being threatened by the Congress. Policymakers decided to weakeo the




                                                      13
link between Ml and interest rates, thereby reducing interest rate volatility                Nevertheless the

advantage of some interest rate volatility due to market factors was the lack of blame attached to the

Federal Reserve for     a   particular level of interest rates.     As a consequence, the borrowed reserves

procedure was adopted, in which the federal funds rate fluctuated in response to errors in the

borrowings function.        In this sense, the Federal Reserve could continue to claim that it was not

targeting   a particular level of interest   rates. A macroeconomicjustification for the borrowed reserves

procedure is not, however, readily apparent, as the added volatility of interest rates created by random

shifts in discount window borrowing creates no clear benefit.16

        The third regime in the I980s appears to have             been due primarily   to an economic decisioo

based on the uncertainties     f   the economic environment, Jo particular, the implementation      of CRR   in

February 1984 had the potential of affecting the behavior of an already unpredictable money stock as

well as altering the previous rslatiooships between reserves aod money. This change was a delayed

product of the nonborrowed reserves regime,        as closer monetary     control was more likely under CRR

than LRR. Because of the added uncertainties surrounding CRR and the continuing erratic behavior of
Ml velocity, policymakers dc-emphasized their monetary targets further, and the borrowed reserves

procedure was maintained.

        In   sum..t e behavior     of the Federal Reserve in conducting monetary policy is best described by

considering the Federal Reserve's operating procedures, targets, and desire to achieve its targets.

Changes in these factors led to at least three different policy regimes in the 1980s.'         Jo these regimes

the importance to the Federal Reserve of tight monetary control increased initially and subsequently

became negligible. The lasting inheritance of the regime shift that began in October 1979 is the

Federal Reserve's substantiallygreater willingness to tolerate interest-rate volatility. Regardless of the

specific details of the operating procedures adopted, there apparently has been no reversion to the

federal funds rate procedure employed in the late 1970s.

*    We are grateful to Thomas Mayer for helpful comments, to Steven            R. Thorley for research

     assistance, and to the National Science Foundation (Grant No, SES-8408603) for research

     support.



1.   The terminology used here for targets, intermediate targets, and instruments of policy       follows

     B. Friedman (1975).

2.   Mayer   (l97) and    Goodfriend (1986) discuss issues relating to the disclosure of the FOMC's

     policy directive in detail.

3.   One example among many possible illustrations, wo.ild be the avoidaoce of confusion between

     use of an interest rate instrument to achieve a particular policy target and interest rate

     targeting where the level of an interest rate itselfis the policy objective.

4.   For further discussion on tins issue, see LeRoy (1979. Hetcel (1982), and Roley (1987).
5.   The nonborrowed reserves procedure is potentially slightly faster because of federal funds rate

     moserncnts in the current week. This property is discussed further in the next section. Also

     see Roley 1987).

6.   For a more detailed discussion of these operating procedures, see Roley (1987).

7.   A variant of the federal funds rate procedure which apparently was introduced following the

     sharp decline of the stock market on October       19, 1987   is intermediate between the federal

     funds rate procedure described above and the borrowed reserves procedure. In contrast to the

     earlier funds rate procedure, in which the Federal Reserve entered the reserves market almost

     daily to add or drain reserves in order to keep the funds rate close to target, open market

     operations under the variant procedure are relatively sparse and generally limited to adding or

     draining reserves, but not both, during     a reserves maintenance    period.   In this regard, the

     variant resembles the borrowed reserves procedure. The main difference          is   that there   is no


     explicit target for borrowed reserves, so that shocks to banks' demand for borrowed reserves do

     not (in principle) affect the funds rate. Some market participantshave described the variant



                                                  15
      procedure as a "fuzzy" funds rate target, since the allowable deviation       of the   actual rate from

      the target    is larger   than under the earlier funds rate procedure. The Federal Reserve has

      announced its intention to revert to the borrowed reserves procedure           at some    point in the

      future.

8.    Also, reserve computation      and maintenance periods are two weeks in length, while they lasted

      one week under LRR. The response under 2-week CRR is examined in detail by Roley (1987).

9.    Considerable evidence suggests that the response of Treasury bill yields to Ml announcements

      is   a response in the real rate, not expected inflation. One type of evidence is from the response

      of foreign exchange rates to Ml       announcement surprises. In particular, the dollar appreciates

      in response to positive money announcement surprises. See, for example, Cornell (1982), Engle

      and Frankel (1984), and Flardouvelis (1984).

10.   The introduction of CRR introduced       at least two uncertainties.   First, the previous relationship

 -    describing    the demand for reserves changed, leading to uncertainties about the effects of

      various shocks on the federal funds rate. Second, the stochastic behavior of the money stock

      itselfwas potentially affected, as it was no longer entirely demand determined in a given week.

Ii.   The test of the hypothesis that the two post-October 1982 periods have the same volatility as

      the pre-October    1979 period yields F-statistics of 3.88 (64, 100) and 5.29 (154, 100), which are

      significant at the 5 percent level,

12.   The change in the Treasury bill yield over the previous five business days is used as a proxy for

      this information. See Roley (1983).

13.   The results are qualitatively the same when the estimation period starts in October 1979

      instead of January 1980. See Roley and Walsh (1985). To conform with the results in Table

      3, the January 1980 starting period was used. This date was chosen because of the availability

      of data for the exchange rate variable used in Table 3.

14.   In a specification analogous to that used in Table 2, the response of the Treasury bill yield to

      money announcement surprises also was examined over additional subperiode. In particular,

      starting with September      29, 1977, the response was estimated for overlapping 26 week periods,




                                                     16
      beginning every 13 weeks. The first two estimation periods, for example, were September 29,

      1977   -   March 23, 1978 and December 29, 1977 - June 22, 1978, respectively. The results from

      these regressions generally support the beginning and ending dates of the subsarnplea used in

      the tables.     In particular, all responses after the June 1982 - December 1982 period were

      estimated to be smaller than those of this period. Moreover, the responses in both the June

      1983 - December 1983 and September 1983             March 1984 periods were statistically significant

      at   the 5 percent level, but the esttrnated responses starting with the Decerriber 1983        - June


      1984 period were    not significant. This result   is consiscent with   a change in thc response around

      the beginring of 1984,

15.   Positive ar,d negative movements also were considered separately, but the statistical

      significance of the revolts did   nt clang"
16.   The borrowed reserves procedure was implemented under LRR.                  Under CRR, hos,eer, this

      procedure -nay be capable of offsetting shocks from money and factors supplying reserves. See,
      for example, Roth and Seibert '1983).

17.   And, as noted in footnote 7, a fourth regime may have begun following the October 19, 1987

      stock-market crash.

Notes: See the notes in Table 2. The last period ends on September 29, 1986, due to the availability of yen/dollar
        exchange rate data. Equations are estimated in the form:
                            ARTB = b0 + b1 UPPI + b2 UCPIL + h3 un + b4 UUNEMt 1- b5 UMl + b6 YENt +
          where the U's indicate that only the unanticipated components of the data are included. Unanticipated values
          of the first five variables are calculated using survey data provided by Money Market Services, Inc.

 RTBt       change in 3âmonth Treasury bill yield from 3:30 p.m. to 33O p.m. on auccessive business days
PPI       = percentage change in the producer price index,
CPI           percentage change in the consumer price index.
IP        =
              percentage change in the industrial production index.
UNEM          percentage of labor force unemployment.
YEN       = change in the yen/dollar exchange rate from open to close in the Tokyo market             on day t.
F1(m,n) =     Fâstatistic with (m,n) degrees of freedom for the hypothesis that the response coefficient, b5, is the
              same as that estimated in the previous period. The relevant estimated equations are weighted by their
              standard errors,
F2(m,n)       F--statistic with (m,n) degrees   of   freedom   for the   hypothesis that b1            =             0.
