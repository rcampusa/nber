                    Randomization with Asymetric Information




                                      ABSTRACT




          It is by now well-known that,     in the presence of moral hazard or

adverse selection, randomization of insurance premia and benefits may be

Pareto efficient.    This paper:    i) provides a typology of the various forms

that randomization may take;       ii) derives necessary and/or sufficient condi-

tions for the desirability of these various forms of randomization; iii) ob-

tains some simple characterization theorems of the efficient random policies;

iv) gives some intuition behind the results;      and v) considers why randomiza-

tion appears to occur less often in practice than the theory suggests it

should.

           During the past fifteen years, an extensive literature has developed
                                                                                        -
analyzing the structure of adverse selection and moral hazard (principal

agent)   problems.   Early on it was recognized that these problems may not have

the usual convexity-concavityproperties so familiar to economists;               and only

a few years later, it was realized that this in turn implies that, in a

variety of circumstances,        randomization    is efficient.1

           The aims of this paper are:        (i) to provide a typology of the various

forms that randomization        may take;    (ii) to provide necessary    and/or suffi-

cient conditions for the desirability2           of these various forms of randomization

in the context of the standard models of an insurance              market with moral hazard

or adverse selection:      (iii) to provide some simple characterizationtheorems

of the efficient     random policies;       (iv) to provide some intuition behind the

results; and (v) to consider why randomization            appears to occur less often in

practice than the theory suggests it should.

           Many of the results in the paper are new.          Some (Propositions 2, 4.

and 6), however,     are not.     In particular,    several recent papers have investi-

gated the desirability of randomization           of insurance contracts in the presence

of moral hazard (Holmstrom [1979], Gjesdal [1982], and Fellingham,              Kwon, and

Newman [1984]).      All treat a continuum of possible outcomes, which tends to

obscure intuition.      We rederive their results for the two-outcome case.          em-


ploying derivations which highlight the intuition,

           Section 1 treats randomization with moral hazard, and section 2 ran-

domization with adverse selection.           The concluding section contains a discus-

sion of why randomization        is not as common as theory suggests it should be,

which casts doubt on the appropriatenessof several of the standard assump-

tions employed in the incentives and contract literatures.

           Throughout the paper, we cast the problem in terms of a monopoly                 in-
                                                                              2


surer who maximizes profits subject to providing its clients with an exoge-

nously-specified level of expected utility and subject also to the relevant

incentive-compatibilityconstraints.         This allows us to characterize Pareto

efficient       contracts.   Throughout the paper, competitive equilibrium (when it

exists) corresponds to the solution of the monopoly problem with expected

utility at the competitive equilibrium level(s).3 Thus, when we say that

randomization is desirable, we mean that randomization       is Pareto efficient,      is

profitable for a monopoly insurer, and is a characteristic of competitive

equilibrium.



1.   Moral Hazard

            Consider the simplest moral hazard setting.     There are a large number

of identical individuals, each of whom realizes one of two possible outcomes

or   events. Either an accident does not occur in which case the individual
receives    w   prior to insurance, or an accident4 does occur in which case the
individual      receives w-d, where d   Is the accident damage. The probability that
an accident occurs depends on the individual's accident-prevention effort, e;
i.e. p=p(e). It is assumed that p'cO and p''>O, and that the individual al-
ways expends some effort in the monopoly solution. Also, individuals acci-

dent   probabilities are statistically independent.

            Moral hazard arises because an insurer is unable to observe effort.

As a result, insurance contracts cannot be written contingent on effort,          Ve

assume that the insurer can, however, ohserve its clients' total insurance
purchases..5 In these circumstances, the non-random insurance contract will
specify a (net) insurance payout or benefit a payable to an individual if an
accident occurs and an insurance premium fi payable by the individual if an
accident does not occur. Thus, consumption (y) is w-d÷a when an accident does
                                                                                                  3



occur, and       w-J3   when it does not.

             The individual's expected utility is

             EU =                                  +
                        (l-p(e))U0(w-fl,e)             p(e)U1(w-d+u,e),                         (1)

where U0 is the no-accident utility function and U1 the accident utility func-

tion.       It is assumed that

              ou.               a2u.          au
                I >
                           0,   —i     < 0,   1    <   0 for     j =   0,1.

Note that this specification permits utility functions to be outcome- contin-

gent;       the accident may have non-pecuniary effects or influence tastes.                       e
shall have occasion to particularize tl):

    (i)       separable utility function

              EU =      (l-p(e))u0(w-fl)+p(e)u1(w-d+o)-e                                        (I')

with         >   0   and          < 0 for j=0,l, and effort is measured in terms of the dis-
        u                   u
utility is causes.

    (ii)         separable, event-independent               utility function

              EU =      (1-p(e))u(w-/3)+p(e)u(w-d+o)-e                                          (1'')

             The individual chooses effort to maximize expected utility, taking

the parameters of the insurance contract as given.                            This yields a function or

correspcndence relating effort to the parameters of the insurance contract,

e=e(a,3),        which, when substituted into the expected utility function, EU,

yields expected utility as a function of a and                           , v(a,).    The insurers prob-

lem is to choose (a,fl) to maximize profits subject to providing                          its clients

with a given level of expected utility.6

              The question to be addressed                 is;    Under what circumstances    does ran-

domization of the parameters of the insurance contract result in a welfare

improvement?

              The basic intuition behind why randomization might be desirable is
                                                                                     4



this:    Moral hazard causes a tradeoff between risk-bearing and incentives,

since if full insurance were provided the insured would take little or no

accident-preventioneffort.            As a result, the deterministic monopoly insur-

ance contract typically entails the insured receiving less than full insur-

ance and expending less than the first-best (i.e., with effort observable)

level of effort.        A compensated randomization of insurance may cause the in-

sured to increase effort by enough that profits are increased                The techniques

of Rothschild-Stiglitz [1970] can be used to ascertain conditions under which

a mean-preserving randomization of, say, the payout will increase effort at

accident avoidance; randomization will do so provided only that the first-

order condition for effort is convex in the payout.               Randomization also has a

direct, negative effect on risk-averse individuals.               Thus, whether randomiza-

tion is desirable depends on a careful balancing of the welfare gains from the

mitigation of the moral           hazard problem with the welfare losses from increased

risk.    While the latter depend on the degree of risk aversion (which depends

on first and second derivatives of the utility function), the former depend on

the degree of concavity of the first-order condition for effort (which depends

on first, second, and        .kjd     derivatives of the utility function).      There ap-

pears to be no        &LjQLi      reason why the effort effect should not outweigh the

risk effect.      This intuition turns out to be correct.7

1.1     The forms of randomization

            We will    consider     two types of randomization.     If the realization of

the random policy occurs before the insured individual makes his effort deci-

sion, we shall say that the randomization is ex ante;               if it occurs           his
effort decision,                     In   all cases, we assume that the individual knows

fully the nature of the randomization being undertaken.               With          ran-


domization, the insurer quotes a set of random policies {a1,fl1,Q1}, which we
                                                                                     5



term the insurance contract, where Q1              =   1) is the probability that policy
                                             (EQ
i   will be assigned to the individual             he has made his effort decision.

The individual makes his effort decision and only after this finds out which

of the policies the insurance company has assigned him.            With ex ante random—

ization, the insurer again quotes a set of random policies {o,,3,Q1}            but nax

      is the probability that policy i will be assigned to the individual before

he makes his effort decision,        The individual is randomly assigned a policy

and        makes his   effort   decision.   To simplify the analysis,    we shall con-

consider each form of randomization in isolation,            Thus, in the subsection on

cx post randomization,      ex ante randomization is excluded by assumption,         and in

the section on    ex ante randomization, cx post randomization is excluded by

assumption.

1.2     Ex post randomization

           The insurer chooses that insurance contract which maximizes his ex-

pected profits, subject to providing its clients with a given level of expect-

ed utility and taking into account the dependence of effort on the terms of

the contract.    We can formalize the problem as        a   two-stage (indirect control'

pob1em.     In the first stage, the individual         chooses effort, taking the para-

meters of the insurance contract as given, to maximize his expected utility:

           EU                                                                   (2)
                Thi(,fl,e)Q

where

           u(1,fl,e)       U0(w-3,e)(l-p(e))+U1(w-d+e1,e)p(e).
Thus,

                            = argmax EU.                                       (3;
                                 e
In the second stage, the insurer maximizes its expected profit, taking the

dependence of the accident probability on effort, and           the dependence of    effort
                                                                                                   6



on the parameters of the insurance contracts,                    into account.          It turns out to

be convenient,        in analyzing the second problem, to embed in it the maximiza-

tion    condition for the first stage;                  we thus write the insurer's problem as

                            (E1)(l-p(e))            -
                                                          (Ee)p(è)

              Before proceeding to analyse (4), we state:

              {x,Q}

indexes constraints, F(.) is a weakly concave function and                             g3(.) are strictly

convex constraint functions, randomization of x is undesirable.

              Lemma i is well-known and implies in this context that randomization

is undesirable when the insurer's profit-maximization problem is concave.

              Since (4) is not in general a concave programming problem, it appear

that randomization may in some circumstances be desirable. Characterization

of the solution to (4) is difficult. Two results may, how-

ever,    be obtained:

Prooosition 1:        With ex post randomization,              the optimum can be achieved with

        at most three insurance policies.

Pronosition 2:        With separable utility functions,                            randomization is

        never desirable.8
                                                                                                       7



            The first Proposition is established as follows:                            The first-order

condition of the individuals effort choice problem satisfies

                ôv(a.    ,a• ,e)
                     e'            i°                                                                (5)


(Because exoected utility is not necessarily a concave function of effort,                                   (5)

is only a necessary condition;                     constraint       iv) is the necessary and sufficient

condition).       One may imagine that the problem has been completely solved, and

that one is told what the profit-maximizing random policies are and what the

individual's level of effort is, but                            the probabilities with which the op-

timal random policies are assigned.                         There are then three linear equations --

constraints       (i) and (ii) in (4), and (5)
                                               --                   that   can be solved for the optimal

assignment probabilities. Thus, the assignment probabilities are determinate
with at most three random policies.

               Proposition 2 is proved by writing the insurer's maximization prob-

lem in such a way that Lemma                   1   may be applied.         Suppose that the level of ef-

fort chosen by individuals in the solution to the monopoly insurer's problem,

      has been determined.                And let           denote the probability-weightedaverage

of u0 (recall (1')) across the random contracts, i.e.                               a   E                  and
                                                                                            u0(w-fl1)Q1,

(since with separable utility, expected utility is a concave function

fort).

               Substitute (6b) into (6a) to obtain

Since constraints (6a) and (7a) together are equivalent to constraints (6a)

and (6b) together,           the insurer's problem may be rewritten as

Since this programming problem has a linear objective function and constraint

functions that are strictly convex in                                        Lemma I applies, and so ran-

domization is undesirable.

             The "trick" in the proof was to rewrite constraints (6a) and (6b),

where (6b) is not        a   convex constraint,                 as (6a) and (7a), both of which are

convex constraints.

             Proposition 2 and its proof are useful because they provide the ba-

sis of a general theorem characterizing sufficient conditions for randomiza-

tion to be undesirable. If the utility function is not separable, the equa-

tion analogous to (7a) is

necessarily a convex constraint,                       it appears that randomization may be desir-

able.    Since the analog to (6a) for non-separable utility is a convex con-

straint, if constraint (7b) is also convex, then by Lemma                                 1   randomization is

undesirable, i.e.:

            Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for randomization to be

desirable is difficult. A large randomization may be desirable, even when a

small one is not, and the desirability of large randomizations depends on

global rather than local properties of the functions U0(.), U1(), and p(.),

as well as the parameters w and d.1° Determining necessary and sufficient

conditions for a local randomization to be desirable is presumably possible.

but since efficient randomization may entail three random policies (recall

Proposition 1), doing so would be algebraically very tedious. As a result, we

shall adopt the more modest goal of deriving necessary and sufficient con-

ditions for a local randomization of the payout. holding the premium fixed, to

            A necessary condition for a local randomization of the payout to be

desirable, is that a small, mean-preserving spread in a, holding 1 fixed,                          in-


crease effort.           If this condition is not satisfied, then the randomization not

only lowers expected utility, by exposing the individual to more risk, but

also decreases profits by increasing the probability of accident. From first

principles, or from Rothschild and Stiglitz [1970]                  ,
                                                                        it   is straightfor-

the probability of accident rise, but also compensating the individual for the

risk he faces is costly.             From first principles or from Diamond-Stiglitz

theory   imposes no natural restrictions on the values of                                   or

hence, it appears that randomization can be desirable.13

            The result is depicted in Figure 1.                  The deterministic optimum is

expected utility could be increased with a rise in a).                           Since also both the

indifference curve and iso-profit curve through the deterministic optimum have

zero slope in    -a space at            the deterministic optimum. randomization is

desirable if the iso-profit curve has greater positive curvature than the                                               in-

difference curve.

1.3   Ex ante randomization

            The desirability of ex ante randomization depends on quite                                  a     differ-

ent set of considerations.

            Define   EU(11)    to be the maximum expected utility as a function of                                  th
insurer's    (expected) profit per client,              11,   when only deterministic contracts

are admitted.       The desirability of ex ante randomization depends on the cur-

vature properties of          EU(fl).    This is shown in Figure 2.               Suppose, for the sake
of argument,    that the solution to the monopoly insurer's problem with deter-

ministic contracts occurs at C, with expected profit per contract of                                                Now
                                                                                                            JIG.

allow ex ante randomization. It is immediate that no more than one policy,

with a given level of expected profits, need be offered in the profit-maxi-

mizing insurance contract.              This implies that if the profit-maximizing con-

tract contains more than one policy, each must have a different level of
                                                                                                      12



profits associated with it.             Suppose the insurer offers two ex ante random

policies in his contract,            policy A with profits      11A
                                                                      <        and policy B with

                          with the probability weights chosen so that the expected
profits   B   >
                   11c'

profit from the pair of contracts is ll.               It is evident from the diagram that,

as drawn, this cx ante randomization increases expected utility and is there-

fore desirable. It is also evident that:                i) the desirability of ex ante

randomization stems from the convexity of              EU(I1)   near C;         and ii) that no more

than two random policies are needed in a profit-maximizing contract with

ante randomization.

           We formalize this intuition in a series of Propositions.

Proposition 5:        If    EU(ll)   is concave, ex ante randomization is never desirable.

Proposition 6:        If    EU(ll)   is convex at the level of profits at the determirtis-

        tic monopoly insurer profit maximum, then cx ante randomization is desir-

        able.14

Proposition 7:        With cx ante randomization,         no more than two random policies

        are required in the profit-maximizing insurance contract.

            In the absence of any          moral   hazard problem, expected utility is a

concave function of          II   because of diminishing marginal utility. But with moral

hazard, as    11   changes, effort changes.          In the normal case, as profit increases

(decreases), the individual will expend more (less) effort at accident avoid-

ance.     If the absolute value of the individual's effort response is greater

for increases in profits than to decreases (in                  a   sense to be made more precise

below), expected utility may be a convex function of                      II   and cx ante randomiza-

tion may be desirable.

            It should be clear from Figure 2 that convexity of                      EU(fl)   at   C   is not

                                                                                             in particu-
a   necessary condition for cx ante randomization to be desirable;
                                                                          at C.
lar, non-local randomization may be desirable even when EU(ll) is concave
                                                                                                                      13



The desirability of non-local randomization is difficult to characterize

because it depends on global rather than local properties of the event-con-

tingent utility functions and the probability of accident function. In what

follows, we shall therefore consider only local randomizations.

                To simplify, we hold          fi    fixed      at its level in the absence of randomi-

zation (since if expected utility can be increased via ex ante randomization

with   j3   fixed, it can a fortiori be increased with                                variable)   and treat the

special case of a separable,                 event-independentutility function (1')                                   Recall

that from the individuals maximization problem without randomization, we can

express effort as a function of the contract parameters;                                       i.e. e=e(e.Th.            Now

II=fl(l-p)-ep.         Thus, we may write

                e(e,)      =
                               e[1                 fi)


Substitute this into the expression for expected utility,
                                                         =   ê(ll,fl).                                            (10)

Se have thus established

Prouosition 8:    A   sufficient condition for ex ante randomization to be desir-

      able is that the expression on the RHS of (12) be positive.

It                                 —v
     is argued in Appendix 1 that 82 can be positive if p''' is sufficiently


negative.15 The reason for the complexity of the result is that what is rele-

vant is the extent to which successive increases         in   II   lead to increases in

effort (and how these increases     in effort lead to increases          in the likelihood

of a loss).    Since the level of effdrt depends on first derivatives (say of

p(e)), changes in levels depend on second derivatives, and differences in

changes in levels (which are critical for ascertaining the convexity or con-

cavity of profit as a function of    II)   depend on third derivatives.

          To simplify, we have considered ex post and ex ante randomization in

isolation.    It should be evident that there are circumstances in which it is

desirable to employ both forms of randomization simultaneously.



2.   Selection
           It seems plausible that randomization can be desirable when adverse

selection is present, by altering the position of the self-selection locus.

To investigate this, we treat the case where there are two groups in the popu-

lation,   one high-risk (H) and one low-risk (L).

          Suppose that, in the absence of randomization, the monopoly insurer

provides group H with contract (&H,bH) and group L contract              (LL)    as de-

picted in Figure 3.     Group H utility is   U11,   and group L utility U1.      The basic

adverse selection mechanism should be familiar.          If the insurer were able to

distinguish between individuals in the two groups, the contracts would be

(;HH) and                       the
                        providing      insurer with    ifiaximum    profits consistent
                                                                                                      15



with the exogenous utility levels.                 But with adverse selection, the insurer is

unable to distinguish between high- and low-risk individuals.                            If it were to

offer    (a11,fl11)   and    (&LL)       both high- and low-risk individuals would choose

(;LL)         If the proportion of the population in the high-risk group is above

a    certain critical level, which we assume is the case, the insurer maximizes

its profits by offering the pair of contracts                  (a11,fl14)   and               where

(LL)        is the most profitable contract that can be offered to the low-risk


group consistent with their obtaining UL and with the high-risk group prefer-

ring to 'self-select", i.e. to choose                (,          which is more expensive but

provides more insurance, rather than the one designed for low-risk individ-

uals.     (LL)            lies   just below' the intersection point of            U11   and

                      =             is   called the self-selection locus.           Throughout this

section,     we assume that profit-maximization entails the insurer offering a

different contract to each group.

             We now consider the use of randomization as a self-selection device.

Again, randomization can take on two forms.                   (Both are depicted in Table 1)

In the first, the insurer announces two contracts,                    denoted by A and B.             If the

idividual chooses contract A, he will be assigned policy                          (e,) with          proba-

bility            similarly if he chooses contract B, he will be assigned (a,fl)

with probability Q.               The individual    reveals   his type by his       choice        of con-

tract.     We say that offering such a pair of contracts entails ex post random-

ization,     since the uncertainty is resolved                     the      individual chooses be-

tween the two contracts, i.e. after he has revealed his type.                            Traditional

adverse selection models can be viewed as treating the case where                             A   and B both

consist of a single policy;                we ask here, when is this desirable?

             The second form that randomization may take is also depicted in Table

1.    The insurer gives the individual a lottery of policy pairs,
                                                I
      =
              [(a',fl),                 QiL          =   I.    The firm then randomly assigns him a
                                               i=1

policy pair, e.g.                 L.   with probability Q1,.       Baying been assigned a          policy

pair, say L1,, the individual can then choose between A1,                           =                   and
                                                                                         (&,,/?,)
          =                       The individual reveals his type through his choice of
B1,            (o,,4,).                                                                                   A1,
                                                                                                                 or

              We say that such a contract entails ex ante randomization, since the
B1,.

uncertainty is resolved before the individual makes his choice, and therefore

before he reveals his type.                    In the standard adverse selection model, the                    in-


dividual is offered a single pair of policies, rather than a lottery of pairs

of policies.

                     We shall employ the following additional notation:                  niC,   the popula-

tion of group k, k=H,L;                   k,   the accident probability of group k;                      the
                                                                                                   u,
utility function for group k in the event of no accident;                               and   u,   the corre-

sponding utility function when an accident occurs.                          Superscript k(=H,L) on a

contract parameter indicates that the corresponding contract is designed for

group k.

                     We first prove:

            iv)               Q
            Consider the profit maximization problem identical to (13) in all

     respects except that the set of constraints iii) is replaced by
                                                                           >   0.

     We term this the modified maximization problem.          Since this constraint is

     weaker than the set of constraints iii) of (13), profits are at least as

     high for the modified maximization problem as for (13).          But the modified

     maximization problem is that of a monopoly insurer who undertakes ex post

     randomization.

            e have established that ex ante randomization is unnecessary by
showing that ex post randomization is always at least as profitable.            If there

are zestrictions on cx post randomization-         ex ante randomization may still be

desirable.        However,   we shall not attempt to dtermine conditions under wnich

cx ante randomization is, in fact, desirable.

            Proposition 9 is useful because it enables us to focus on cx POSt

randomization.                 randomization of the high-risk group's policy is unaw-

biguousiy    harmful since it reduces the profitability of the      high-risk group's
'untract,    while leaving the low-risk groups contract unchanged.

randomization of the low-risk group's policy, meanwhile,         has two possibly off-

setting effects. On one hand, the low-risk individuals must be compensated for

th   increased risk they then face.          On the other hand, such randomization may

weaken the self-selection constraint.           If high-risk individuals are very risk-


averse,     they will shy away from the randomized policy, allowing the low-risk

individuals       to obtain more insurance on average than they otherwise would.

The Propositions that follow capture this intuition.

            We start by considering the case where high- and low-risk individuals
have   the    tastes (event-contingent utility functions).
             same                                                                              Let h be   the cer-
tainty-equivalent insurance premium corresponding to the                                        fl random con-
tract                      defined implicitly by

and a be the certainty-equivalent insurance payout. defined implicitly by

                            m S u1(w-d+a)Q.                                                                (14b)
             u1(w-d+a)

The expected utility for an individual in group k is, using (14),

             EUK =       (lpk)(E   uo(w-fl)Q)
                                                        +   pk(E u1(w-d+e)Q)

                    =
                         (1pk)u0(wb)
                                               +   k u1e-d+a);
thus, expected utility can be expressed in terms of the certainty-equivalent

premium and payout corresponding to any ex post random contract. The self-se-

lection constraint,          meanwhile, can be written as
                                       -
             (l-p11)     (u0(w-b11)        u0(w-b))
                +                          -                         0,
                    ptT(u1(w-d+a")                 u1(w-d÷ah)                                              (16)

where   (a'C,bk)        is the certainty-equivalent of the random contract

designed for group k.              Next, define                B
                                                                   'f     4   to   be the average premium in

the random policy designed for group k, and                               n S
                                                                                     at   to   be the correspond-


ing average payout.             Risk aversion implies that ak <                     k and bk k            with at

least one of the inequalities being strict if the corresponding contract is

randomized.

             Recall that we have assumed that profit-maximizationentails differ-

ent contracts for the high- and low-risk groups.                                Thus,   where Uk is the exoge-

The insurer's profit-maximizationproblem, with ex post randomization, may be

written as

                max                     E   flk((lk)k - pkak)
                                      k=R,L
                                                                                  (18)
                                        s.t.
                k=H,L
         i)       (16) (the self-selection constraint)

         ii)      (17) (the expected utility constraints)

         iii)     ak <   k   bk

From this formulation, it is evident that the profit-maximizing contract pair

has the properties        = ak and     = bk for k=H,L, and therefore that ex post


randomization is undesirable.

         This result is stated in16

Proposition 10:       1ith adverse selection and two groups who differ in risk but

     not in tastes, ex post randomization is never desirable.

         The intuition       underlyg this   result can be seen from Figure 4.           Sup-

pose that in the absence of randomization,      the profit-maximizing deterministic

contracts are              and          corresponding to   which are profit levels,

   and ü'.     Because the contracts are deterministic, the premiums and          payouts
equal their corresponding certainty-equivalents,which we denote by              (,b1)
and (aL,bL), respectively.        Since expected utility can be expressed in terms

of the certainty-equivalentpremium and payout, we may portray the determinis-

tic profit-maximizing pair of contracts in a-b space:                    lies   at the

point of tangency of iP and the profit line bH(lpH)
                                                           -
                                                               aHphi =      while

(LL)    lies at the point of intersection of (P and (P. E0 in the Figure.

         Now consider randomizing the contract for the low-risk group, hold-

ing (P and       fixed.    Since the randomization does not alter the position of

the self-selection constraint in a-b space, the low-risk groups certainty-
                                                                                            20



equivalent policy remains                       Since,      with randomization,   aL     and

L(bL    with at least one of the inequalities holding strictly, then

                   <            -   aLpL   =           Thus, the randomization reduces     prof-

its on the low-risk group's policy, while leaving profits or the high-risk

group's policy unaffected.

              We now examine the situation where individuals differ in terms of

both risk class and tastes for risk.               We derive a condition under which a

small amount of randomization is desirable.

              We randomize the contract for low-risk individuals in such a way

that:17       i) there are two policies,        both with probability .5;         ii) low-risk

individuals'      utility is the same with either policy and equals their certainty

utility; and iii) the profit level on the low-risk contract is maintained.

Randomization will then be desirable if (and only if) it lowers the utility of

the high-risk individuals when they hold the low-risk contract, since if this

happens, the self-selection constraint is relaxed, and the low-risk contract

can then be adjusted to increase its profitability. To simplify the algebra,

it is assumed that both groups' utility functions are event-independent.

              The randomization satisfies the above conditions:

              (1L)L(flL)LL(dL) =                                                          (19a)
                                                   =                                      (19b)
              (lp1)uL(w   4)+pLuh(wd+a)
                            -                   = 2ñL
                                pL(a+a)                                                   (20)

The expected utility of         a   high-risk individual when he purchases          a   low-risk

contract is

       EU11   =                                                                           (21)

It is shown in Appendix 2 that the first-order effect of an infinitesmal ran-

domization is zero;        i.e.                    =   0.   To ascertain the desirability of       a

        domization is desirable.

            The intuition for this result is straightforward.    When a high-risk

individual is infinitely risk-averse, he will care only about the worst pos-

sible outcome. Since the randomization worsens the worst possible outcome

when the low-risk contract is bought, it reduces the utility of the high-risk

individual when he purchases the low-risk contract,      which relaxes the self-

selection constraint.

j,jon12:            For any (w,d,uH(.),pH,pL)    such that d>>O, and   H>>L    there

        is a finite number AL such that with AL<A, cx post randomization is de-

        sirable.

            Consider the extreme case where A' is close to zero.       Then the ran-

domization undertaken is almost a randomization along the low-risk budget

line,    Because the high-risk group is risk-averse, its expected utility       in-

creases less from the increase in insurance in one policy than its expected

utility decreases from the almost same-sized decrease in insurance in the

other OiiCy.       Hence, the randomization loosens the self-selection constraint.

            Note that none of the above results depend on constancy of absolute

risk aversion and that finite randomizations may be Pareto-improving even when

infinitesmal randomizations are not.

            We have examined the circumstances    under which randomization is de-

sirable with either moral hazard or adverse selection, and explained the re-

sults,     Future research should extend these results to the general situation

where both moral hazard and adverse selection are present.



3.   Discussion

            In the previous two sections we employed standard assumptions to de-

rive necessary and/or sufficient conditions for the randomization of insurance
                                                                                23


contracts to be desirable. We investigated the desirability of randomiza-

tion by analyzing whether randomization could increase the profits of a mono-

poly insurer faced with expected utility constraints.       It bears repeating that

if each insurer can observe his clients     total purchases of insurance,   compe-

titive equilibrium18 coincides with the solution to the monopoly insurers

problem when the expected utility levels are those that would obtain in com-

petitive equilibrium. Hence, all the results of the paper apply to competi

tive equilibrium.

            In the absence of relevant empirical work, it is not possible to     sa
how stringent the conditions we derived for randomization to be desirable in

fact are.    However, none of our arguments implies that randomization is       1ncr-


mally' undesirable. Thus,     it is remarkable that randomization of insurance

contracts is not in fact observed.    This statement needs to be qualified

somewhat since the seeming capriciousness of the tax collector and insurance

adjustor could be veiled forms of randomization9 Nevertheless,         we know of

no explicit random contracts    in competitive insurance   markets.   How can   e
explain this apparent discrepancy between theory and fact?

            Along with the possibility that the conditions for randomization ar

never met, we have come up with six reasons why randomization might not occur

as frequently as the theory suggests.     Each of these reasons leads one to

question the appropriateness of some of the assumptions underlying our ana-

lysis and more generally underlying much of the literature on incentives         and

contracts, particularly that focussing on non-linear contracts.

1.   Firms may not have discovered the advantages of randomization or else cus-

tomers may be reluctant to purchase random insurance policies since they do

not understand them.     To the extent that this explanation is valid, one must

question the appropriateness of assuming that the contracting parties exhibit
                                                                            24



unbounded rationality

2.   A related argument is that it is costly to write down and enforce complex

contracts.    This argument is consistent with the observation that non- stochas-

tic contracts are almost invariably considerably less complex than contract

theory predicts.    If this argument carries force, then contract theory should

treat the costs of complexity.

          Simple contracts may be observed not only because the costs of com-

plexity are high, but also because the benefits are low.20'21

3.   Even in those circumstances where randomization of insurance contracts is

desirable, insured individuals would obtain insurance against the randomiza-

tion if they could.    They would perceive the benefits of such randomization

insurance,    but because they act non-cooperatively would neglect that,   in re-

sponse to everyonets purchasing the randomization insurance, accident insur-

ance companies would be forced to offer less attractive contracts in order to

break even.    Full randomization insurance would completely neutralize the ef-

fects of randomization of the accident insurance contract, and so accident

insurance firms would have no incentive to randomize. The analysis assumed

away such randomization insurance.22 But with limited observability, which

underlies both moral hazard and adverse selection,    the assumption may be

unwarranted.23 A more satisfactory analysis would describe the economy in

such a way that which markets are present and what contracts are enforceable,

are derived rather than assumed.

4.   In some contexts (e.g., the draft in the U.S.) lotteries are commonly re-

garded as fair, in other contexts as unfair (horizontal equity).     While the

persuasive modelling of fairness and horizontal equity has proved elusive, it

may be that consumers would find random iriurance policies unattractive be-

cause they view them as unfair.
                                                                          25


5.   For other, familiar reasons, one may question the appropriateness of em-

ploying von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory (?Iachina [1987]).

6.   A sixth reason why such contracts may not be employed is that individuals

may not trust their insurers to randomize in the manner specified in their

contracts. To know whether a firm is complying with the contract, an individ-

ual must know not only which policy he has been assigned, but also which pOli-

cies have been assigned to all its other clients.    Even if he were able to

verify that the firm assigned the policies with the contractually-specified

probabilities, the firm could still cheat by assigning the policies in a     sys-
tematic   way, e.g. to friends or to those offering kickbacks.   Whether reputa-

tion would be an effective enforcement mechanism in this context is moot.

            A final point is that precluding randomization by assumption is not a

satisfactory way of treating the empirical fact that random contracts are not

observed.    First, by prohibiting randomization from entering through the front
                                                                                For
door, one might find it entering in disguised form through the back door.

                                                                        to
example, suppose that the moral hazard model of the paper were enriched

allow for several symmetric types of accidents.     If random insurance contract


were excluded by assumption,    then in some circumstances in which ex ante ran-

domization is    desirable, competitive equilibrium would entail extended exclu-

sivity (each individual would purchase all his insurance from a single firm)

and firms randomly cross-subsidizing between types of insurance,    e.g. one firm

                                                             from automobile
might run a loss on cancer insurance financed by its profits
                                                                            Sec-
accident insurance.     Doing so would allow firms to indirectly randomize.
                                                                       result
ond, one cannot be sure that whatever considerations (discussed above)

in random insurance contracts not being observed do not also have implications

for the structure of nonrandom contracts. For example, if complexity is
                                                                               im-


                                                                     and non-
portant, the competitive equilibrium contract may be simple, linear,
                                                                        26



random.   But if one were simply to exclude random contracts by assumption,

without explicitly treating complexity, the solution might indicate that the

equilibrium contract would be highly non-linear and complex. For both these

reasons, disallowing random contracts by assumption is likely to generate

spurious results.

1.   The earliest studies were in the context of the problems of optimal

     taxation:       Weiss [1976]   ,   Stiglitz   [1982a, 1982b]       ,

     exists a Pareto-improving randomization.                  Also,    if randomization i5

     desirable, it will be employed by insurance firms in competitive

     equilibrium (as long as they (an observe their clients' total pur-

     chases of insurance) and by a monopoly insurer.

3.   This equivalence can be established on the basis of arguments pre-

     sented in Arnott and Stiglitz [1987b].

4.   "Accident" may be reinterpreted as "large damage conditional on an

     accident occurring", and "no accident" as 'small damage conditional

     on   art   accident occurring".

5.   The assumption of a monopoly insurer implies this assumption.                          This

     assumption is. however, consequential                in the competitive equilibrium

     interpretation - see Arnott           and Stiglitz      {1987b]

6.   This problem      is treated       exhaustively in Arriott and Stigiitz fl9STa
7.   This intuition applies to what we shall, in the next subsection.
     identify      as ex post randomization.         A rather different set              of argu
     ments      are relevant for ex ante randomization; see below, section

     1.3.

8.   This Proposition has been proven previously for the continuum of out-

     comes case by Holmstrom [1979]           .   Our proof, however, is new.

9,   Since they are expressed in terms of the characteristics of the con

     straint set, Propositions 2 and 3, as well as Corollary 1, apply to

     any    (a,fl)   (and the associated levels of         U   and e) and not just to
      profit-maximizing a and         jl   associated   with a given level of expected

      utility. The same remark applies to Proposition 4.

10.   Furthermore, with non-separable utility, effort need not be                 a   con-

      tinuous function of the contract parameters. We have chosen not to

      treat this complication.

Ii,   We have considered other two-dimensional perturbations: i) random-

      izing the premium, holding the payout fixed;               and ii) randomizing the

      payout, while varying the premium to maintain profits constant,                   and

      investigating the change in expected utility.

12.   This Proposition has been proven previously by Gjesdal [Proposition

      3, 19821    for the continuum of        outcomes    case. Our proof, however, is
      new.

13.   esoai      L1982' pps    382-3j provides an example         in which exgt ran-
      domizat ion   is   desirable.

14.   This Proposition is similar to Theorem 3 of Fellingham. Kwon, and

      newne;n   [1984]
      Feilinaham, Kwon arid     Newman       [1984, pps. 296-297] provide an example
    in which ex ante randomizatioe is desirable.
16. It can also be proven, rather obviously, that "with adverse selection
    and two groups, randomization is never desirable if the high-risk

    group is less risk-averse than the low-risk group".
17.   We would like to thank Stephen Slutsky for suggesting this randomiza-

      tion procedure to us in another context.

i8.   By   competitive equilibrium, we          mean    a Nash equilibrium in contracts
      with   free entry and exit.           In the case of adverse selection, this

      statement applies only when competitive equilibrium exists              -   see

      Rothschild and Stiglitz         i9W       for a discussion of non-existence of
      competitive equilibrium in this context.

19.   We consider this unlikely,       however.    A more plausible explanation for

      the randomness of tax audits is that decreasing the probability of

      audit, while holding the expected fine constant, reduces administra-

      tive costs.

20.   In moral hazard theory, it is assumed that insurance companies know

      the accident technology and consumers tastes perfectly,           and in ad-

      verse selection theory that they know consumers' tastes and the com-

      position of the population perfectly. Intuition suggests that the

      more imperfect    is insurers'    knowledge,   the smoother the optimal con-

      tract and the smaller the gains from complexity.

21.   In this context it should be noted that the literature on the ran-

      domization of insurance contracts,          including this paper, has not at-

      tempted to measure the benefits from randomization, though doing so

      would not be excessively difficult.

22.   The problem of "side-contracts"       is a pervasive, though neglected, one

      in contract theory.     For instance, whenever payments schedules are

      non-linear, there is an incentive for side-payments and the creation

      of secondary markets.     If the payment function is concave,       indivi-

      duals have an incentive to smooth measured output (selling output on

      the secondary market when output is high, and buying when it is low)

      and to make measured output more uneven when the payment schedule is

      convex (e.g. by introducing randomization) .The presence of such se-

      condary markets provides one explanation for the linearity of pay-

      ment schedules.

23.   By   treating   a monopoly insurer, the analysis assumed that individ-

      uals' total purchases of accident insurance are observable.           In these
circumstances, competitive equilibrium is characterized by exclusiv-

ity   -   each insurance company will require that    its clientspurchase

insurance only from itself.       In this case, it is not inconsistent to

assume away randomization insurance,      since accident insurance con-

panics may be able to observe their clients' purchases of randomixa-

tion insurance as well.       Exclusive accident contracts are also en-

forceable if the accident insurance companies cannot observe indi-

viduals'     total purchases of accident insurance,    but can enforce re-

fusing to make     a   payment in the event of accident if the insured re-

ceives payment from any other company for the accident.        This re-

quires that accident insurance companies monitor only victims. With

this more limited form of observability, it is not inconsistent to

assume that accident insurance firms can enforce exclusive accident

insurance contracts but cannot monitor their clients' purchases of

randomization insurance.
