                Excess Capacity, Monopolistic Competition and

             International Transmission of Monetary Disturbances


                                       ABSTRACT



         A stochastic two—country neoclassical rational expectations model

with sticky prices ——   optimally   set by monopolistically competitive firms ——

and possible excess capacity is developed to examine international spillover

effects on output of monetary disturbances. The Mundell—Fleming model

predicts that monetary expansion at home leads to recession abroad. In

contrast, our main result is that spillover effects of monetary policy may be

either positive or negative, depending upon whether the intertemporal

elasticity of substitution in consumption exceeds the intratemporal elasticity

of substitution. The model in addition is used to determine nominal and real

inteest rates, exchange rates, and other asset prices.

                                 I. Introduction

     The debates on the shift in US monetary policy since late 1979 vividly

demonstrate the importance of the international transmission of the effects of

monetary policy. The shift to stricter money targets in 1979 has by nny been

associated with at least the initial rise in the US dollar exchange rate and the

worldwide slump that followed upon this shift in monetary operating procedures.

However, the theoretical basis for such an assessment of the transmission of

monetary policy in the existing literature is not entirely satisfactory in several

respects.

     Existing international neoclassical monetary models models with flexible

prices and continuously clearing markets, like Stockman (1980). Lucas (1982) and

Svensson (l985a), while useful as benchmarks, fail to address the sluggishness in

price and wage adjustment, arid relatively large adjustment in output and

employment, that seem a persistent feature of macroeconomic fluctuations. The

models mentioned have exogenous output, and hence cannot incorporate any effects

of monetary disturbances on output. Also, the price level in these models is as

variable as any asset price, like exchange rates and stock prices, and jumps

instantaneously when new information arrives. We believe these models exaggerate

the variability of the price level. Models that explicitly incorporate the

possibility of sticky prices usually suffer, however, from a series of well known

shortcomings. Typically, price setting rules are arbitrarily assumed rather than

linked to rational behavior of the price setting agents in the economy. Moreover,

in spite of the obvious incompatibility of price setting behavior on the one hand,

and assumptions of perfect competition on the other, firm behavior is typically

based on the assumption of the latter market structure. Often, intertemporal

issues concerning expectations, savings and investment behavior are treated in a

static context, precluding a meaningful analysis; and so on. While individual
                                       2


papers are emerging dealing with each of these issues,1 no satisfactory framework

has as yet been developed for a full analysis of the international transmission of

monetary policy shocks.

     Of course, the Mundell—Fleming model,2 still to a large extent the workhorse

of international macroeconomics, can be considered as an early sticky—price model,

with Keynesian unemployment and excess commodity supply prevailing throughout the

world. It leads to strong conclusions about international transmission of monetary

policy. Let us consider, for instance, the two—country version with flexible

exchange rates and perfect capital mobility, the straigth—forward

flexible—exchange—rate extension of the fixed price IS—LM model with demand

determined output.

     An expansion of the foreign money supply leads in that model to an incipient

capital outflow from the foreign country into the home country, an appreciation of

the home currency, and an improvement in the home country's terms of trade. This

deteriorates the home country's trade balance, and depresses demand for home

output. The world rate of interest falls. Since the home interest rate is equal to

the world interest rate by the assumption of perfect capital mobility, the home

interest rate falls as well. In the new equilibrium, home money market equilibrium

requires that home output has fallen. The home country's trade account has

deteriorated. Foreign output has expanded. A monetary expansion is in this sense

beggar-thy—neighbor policy.

     The IS—LM and hence the Mundell—Fleming model has obvious and well-known

weaknesses. The behavioral functions, including the money demand functions, are

not derived from intertemporal optimizing behaviour. Expectations are stationary.



     For instance, Aizenman (1985), Blanchard and Kiyotaki (1986) and Svensson
(1986) use monopolistic competition; Persson (1982) and van Wijnbergen (1985)
introduce savings and investment behavior based on intertemporal optimizing
behavior in a fix—price model.

                                            3


Saving, investment and the trade balance are treated without regard for the

intertemporal considerations that   should   be inherent in saving and investment

decisions. These shortcomings often qualitatively affect the results, as

comparision with this paper demonstrates.

     Considerable effort has been devoted in the international macro field to

remedy these inadequacies, and it   would    take to long here to survey the major

developments. Let us however note one particular development. Recently rigorous

two—country monetary general equilibrium models with rational expectations and

uncertainty have been developed and used in international finance. These models

are essentially monetary and international extensions of Lucas (1978) celebrated

model, like Lucas (1982), Stockman (1980). Svensson (1985a) and Stockmari and

Svensson (1987). These models rely on full employment and flexible prices. More

recently, Svensson (1986) has shown one way of incorporating sticky goods prices

and demand determined output with maintained rigour in these models, although in a

closed economy setting. Here we extend Svensson (1986) to a two—country flexible

exchange rate setting, in order to examine the strong results of the

Mundell—Flemirig model in a more rigorous framework. The new results obtained

clearly demonstrate the positive payoff of such effects. We also hope that our

model will in general provide a more satisfactory framework for the analysis of

international transmission of international disturbances.

     The organisation of the paper is as follows. In section II we present the

model. In section III we discuss the output effects of monetary disturbances.

Section IV discusses the impact of monetary disturbances on interest rates.

Section V concludes. Some technical details are presented in an appendix.

                                    II. The Model

     The world consists of two countries, home and foreign. Each country is

completely specialized in the production of home and foreign goods, respectively.

As further specified below, there is production of differentiated products, but at
                                                  4


this stage it is sufficient to consider two aggregate goods only. In period t

(t =    ..., —1.   0. 1. ...)   world per capita production of each good,       and Y,
respectively, is costless up to an exogenous stochastic capacity level, y arid y.

Hence

(1)

There is a representative consumer in each country. Hence world population is 2,

and world production of the two goods is               and 2YI, respectively.

       Goods are perishable arid cannot be stored between periods. Hence, whenever

output and consumption fall short of capacity there is waste of resources, excess

capacity, and underemployment.3

       There are two currencies, home and foreign. The supply of currencies in

period t,          and N, respectively, is stochastic and given by

(2)                =         and   N =   wN1.
where       and        are the (gross rates of) monetary expansion of home arid foreign

currency. We call the vector s =                          the state. We assume that the

states are serially independently distributed, and that their probability

distribution is given by the time—invariant probability distribution function

F(s).
       The home and the foreign consumer have identical preferences. Let us consider

the situation f or the home consumer. His preferences in period t are given by the

expected utility function

(3)
                       Tt
             ETP u(chT.cfr). 0 < p              < 1.

Here       denotes the expectations operator conditional upon information available

in period t; u(ch.cf) is a standard concave instantaneous utility function of

consumption Cht arid cf of home and foreign goods in period t.



     With a different interpretation of the model, assuming a linear technology
with labor input and goods output, Y and     can be identified as actual
endogenous labor employment and exogenous labor supply, respectively. Then we can
interpret excess capacity directly as unemployment.
                                             5

        The timing of markets and transactions facing the consumer needs to be

 specified. We shall explain it in some detail for the home consumer. The home

consumer enters period t with stocks of six different assets, namely home and

 foreign currency. Mr_i and Ni. shares in home and foreign firms, Zhtl and

Zftl. arid claims to transfers of home and foreign currency. XMt_l arid x_1.4

Then he learns the current state s of current capacities and monetary expansions.

and he receives money transfers of home and foreign currency, in proportion to his

claims on such transfers. After that, the goods market opens. On the goods market

the consumer can buy home and foreign goods. He must pay f or home goods with home

currency and for foreign goods with foreign currency. Hence he faces the liquidity

constraints

(4a)           Phch    M1     (wt_1)itlxMtl and
(4b)           PtCft        + ((L)_l)NlxNtl.
where ht and           is the home—currency price of home goods and the foreign

currency   price of foreign goods, respectively,   and where   the second terms on the
right   hand sides are the transfers received.
       Since   nominal goods prices will be sticky and not adjust to the current state

of the market, there will be excess demand in some states and excess supply in

others. When there is excess demand consumers will be rationed. Therefore the home

consumer also faces the rationing constraints

(5)

(recall that       and Y are output per capita). We assume uniform rationing such

that home and foreign consumers are treated equally when there is rationing on the

markets for home and foreign goods.

       After the consumer's transactions on the goods market, that market closes and




     Home consumers receive transfers of home currency, and foreign consumers
receive foreign currency. Risk averse consumers have an incentive to diversify
their portfolio. This gives rise to trade in claims on net transfers of currency
(see Lucas (1982)).
                                             6


the asset market opens. On the asset market, dividends on shares in firms (cash

from sales of output) are distributed and the consumer can trade assets according

to the budget constraint

            + ft + e PY3*)zf            + RMtxMtl + RNtXNt1
Here et is the exchange rate,       and          are the home currency prices of shares

in home arid foreign firms, and RMt and RNt are the home currency prices of claims

to transfers of home arid foreign currency. The inequality (6) simply states that

the value of end—of—period asset stocks plus the value of current period

consumption cannot exceed the value of asset stocks carried over from the previous

period plus current period income. After these transactions the asset market

closes, and the home consumer leaves period t and enters period t+l with new

stocks of his six assets: M. N. Zht. Zft. XMt and XNt.

      The home consumer will maximize expected utility (3) subject to the sequence

of liquidity, rationing arid budget constraints (4)—(6). The foreign consumer will

maximize the same utility function, with the same constraints, only his variables

are denoted by '*',   like c, c. M. N. etc.
      Firms' price setting behavior is modelled as in Svensson (1986), by

introducing differentiated products and monopolistic competition along the lines

of Dixit and Stiglitz (l977). As is further specified in the Appendix, home

(foreign) firms produce differentiated home (foreign) goods in monopolistic

competition. Firms set prices in their own currency.6 For some reason they must




     See Aizenman (1985), Blanchard and Kiyotaki          (1986), Dornbusch (1987) and
Giovannini (1985) •for alternative price setting          stories.   Aizenman makes the price
setting period endogenous.

     See Giovannini (1985) for an analysis of what determines whether firms prefer
to set prices in home or foreign currency.
                                                  7


set prices one period in advance, that is, before the current state is known.                This
could be because it takes time to implement a price change. or because the firms

cannot observe the current state of the economy except with a lag. For instance,

firms may not be able to observe their demand and infere the state of the economy

until the end of the week, whereas they must post a price at the beginning of the

week. Thus, own—currency goods prices ht+l arid                       will be predetermined and

prices in period t+l can only depend on the state variables in period t. These

will turn out to be the state s, the money stocks M..i and N1, and the

predetermined price levels ht and                 The pricing functions are the result of

the home and foreign firms maximizing their stock market values. However, since

the states are serially uncorrelated, the current state conveys no information

about the state of tomorrow's markets. Hence, the pricing will be to some extent

independent of the current state. Also, there is no money illusion in this world.

The outcome is that prices for period t+l are set proportionally to the stocks of

money in period t. It follows that the pricing functions (assumed stationary) have

the simple form

(7)         ht+1 =            = wi/k and                 =        =

where the constants k and kM are determined by the first—order conditions for

maximization of stock market values (see Appendix for details).

       We consider a perfectly pooled equilibrium, where the home and foreign

consumer hold identical portfolios and consume identical quantities of the goods.

That is, they hold the same per capita share of world asset stocks and consume the

same per capita share of world output of each good: half of world quantities. Then

the market equilibrium conditions for the goods, money and other assets can be

written

(Sa)        Cht =         =        and cf =
                                                  c      =    y,

                                                  XNt
                                                        —

                                                              =        =   1.
                                                8


Note that total output is         and 2Y, total money stocks 2M and 2N. and that

total quantity of each other asset is normalized to equal 2. The inequalities in

the goods market equilibrium conditions (Ba) allow for the possibility of excess

supply and underutilization of resources.

      The first—order conditions for the consumers and their liquidity, rationing

and budget constraints, together with the pricing functions (7) and the market

equilibrium conditions (8). determine the equilibrium. The equilibrium is the

usual stationary stochastic rational expectations equilibrium, where realizations

of the endogenous variables in period t are given as time—independent functions of

realizations of the exogenous state, the vector of capacities and monetary

expansions, in period t.

      At this stage we do not need to discuss the equilibrium conditions in further

detail. (The determination of the equilibrium is further discussed in the

Appendix.) It is sufficient to note that equilibrium home and foreign output are

given by the reduced form output functions

(9)          Y(y.y.w,w) and YM(y,yM,w,wE).

where we have dropped the time subscripts. As further specified below, the precise

functional form of (9) will depend on which regime the economy is in, namely

whether liquidy constraints or capacity constraints are binding in one, both, or

none of the markets for home home and foreign goods.

      One can also solve for the other endogenous variables: the exchange rate, the

terms of trade, nominal and real interest rates, stock market values, etc. Some of

these variables are further discussed below.

                      III. Output Effects of Monetary Disturbances

      We are interested in the effect on home output of a foreign monetary

expansion.   Let   us first note that   the   experiment considered is a serially

uncorrelated shock to the growth rate of the foreign money stock, which is

equivalent to a permanent     shock   to the level of the foreign monely stock. This is
                                         9


equivalent to the usual experiment in the Mundell—Fleming model.

       In terms of the output functions (9). we like to find the partial derivative

of home output with respect to foreign monetary expansion, Y.7 In order to

understand how this partial is determined, we need to understand the nature of the

equilibrium in more detail. There are two goods markets, the (world) markets for

home and for foreign goods. Each of these markets can be in one of three possible

regimes, depending upon the realization of capacities and monetary expansions

which determines what combination of capacity and liquidity constraints is

binding. There are hence nine possible regimes all together. (The regimes are

specified in detail in the Appendix.)

       It is practical to start with the market for foreign goods. We will need to

understand how a foreign monetary expansion affects foreign output, that is, what

determines the derivative Y. We call the three possible regimes for the foreign

goods market the full capacity regime, the liquidity constrained regime, and the

underconsumption regime, respectively, and we label them FE, L* and U*. The full

capacity regime is the one when consumers are rationed in foreign goods (the

rationing constraint (5) binds for foreign goods), and consumption and output of

foreign goods is equal to capacity. In this regime foreign output Is independent

of foreign monetary expansion:

(ba)       Y=yM, soY=O                   (F9*).

The full capacity regime is the only one where there is no waste of resources.

     The liquidity constrained regime is the one when consumers' liquidity

constraint (4b) for foreign currency is binding. Then consumption and output of

foreign goods equal real balances in foreign currency. These real balances are

       which by the pricing function (7) equal kw* and are proportional to the

foreign monetary expansion. Hence, in the liquidity constrained regime, foreign



     The output functions are not differentiable on the borderline of the regimes
specifed in the Appendix. Hence, derivatives are defined for the interior of the
regimes.
                                                10


output is given by

(lOb)       Y = ksw, so Y =           k   > 0    (L*),

and foreign output is proportional to foreign monetary expansion.

        In the underconsumption regime. neither the capacity constraint nor the

liquidity constraint is binding. There consumption and output of foreign goods is

determined by the first—order condition that the marginal utility of consumption

of foreign goods. uf(ch.cf). equals the marginal utility of wealth measured in

foreign goods. ? (the Lagrange multiplier of the budget constraint (6) when the

latter is deflated by the foreign currency price of foreign goods. Pr). Hence, in

equilibrium

(lOc)       uf(Y.Y3*) =

where we have substituted home and foreign output for consumption of home and

foreign goods. (In general this first-order condition is uf(Y.YE) =         X+         +

where      and      are the Lagrange multipliers of the liquidity constraint (4b) and

the foreign goods rationing constraint in (5).) The marginal utility of wealth

measured in foreign currency also fulfills the first—order condition for foreign

currency holdings.

(lOd)               =   13E[ (Xv' +    )/P'].
Expectations are conditional upon information available in the current period, and

variables with a prime        refer   to variables next period. Equation (lOd) is an

asset—pricing equation for foreign currency. The variable j.i' is the Lagrange

multiplier of the foreign—currency liquidity constraint next period, and can be

interpreted as the liquidity services of foreign real balances next period. The

equation states that the current value of money reflects its future "resale" value

on next period's asset market and the liquidity services the money stock will

provide on next period's commodity market. From the pricing function (7) and from

the assumption that shocks are serially uncorrelated. we can write ClOd) as

(l0e)            = AM/w3,
                                             11



where AM = f3E[?M' +   j.t'] is   constant. The marginal utility of wealth measured in

foreign goods is inversely proportional to the foreign monetary expansion. This is

so since the current marginal utility of next period's foreign currency real

balances, AM, is constant, and the rate of deflation. F/P', for the given

pricing function is inversely proportional to the foreign monetary expansion.

Hence, the current marginal utility of wealth measured in foreign goods, is

completely determined by the asset—pricing equation for foreign currency.

        Finally, it follows from (lOc) and (lOe) that for constant home output.

foreign output is increasing in foreign monetary expansion in the underconsumption

region. This is so because an increase in foreign monetary expansion decreases the

marginal utility of wealth measured in foreign goods. For the marginal utility of

consumption of foreign goods to fall, consumption and output of foreign goods must

rise. It can be shown (see Appendix A.3) that consumption and output of foreign

goods must rise also when home output is allowed to adjust. We conclude that

foreign output indeed rises with foreign monetary expansion in the

underconsumption region,

(lOf)           > 0                          (UM).

     This completes our examination of the effect on foreign output of a foreign

monetary expansion. Intuitively it is clear what is happening in the different

regimes. With full capacity, consumption and output of foreign goods are

restricted by the available capacity, and a foreign monetary expansion has no

effect. In the liquidity constrained regime, consumption and output is restricted

by real balances of foreign currency, and a foreign monetary expansion directly

relaxes the foreign—currency liquidity constraint and increases consumption and

output of foreign goods. In the underconsumption regime, increased transfers of

foreign currency due to the foreign monetary expanision are, partly at least,

spent on foreign goods.

    A more precise way to to understand the effect on foreign output is with
                                         12


reference to intertemporal substitution. A current foreign monetary expansion

implies that next period's foreign currency price of foreign goods increases. The

current foreign currency price of foreign goods is predetermined. As we shall see

in section IV below, perhaps somewhat surprisingly the foreign nominal interest

rate remains unchanged. Then current foreign goods are becoming cheaper relative

to next period's foreign goods; the foreign—good real rate of interest falls, and

there is substitution in favor of current foreign goods. A second interpretation

is to note that increased foreign inflation makes foreign currency real balances

less attractive to hold, so consumers spend some of their foreign currency real

balances on foreign goods.

        Next we need to understand the effect on home output of a foreign monetary

expansion. The three possible regimes in the home goods market, the full capacity

regime, the liquidity constrained regime, and the underconsumption regime, are

denoted by F, L and U. In the full capacity regime, home output is given by home

capacity, and there is no effect of foreign monetary expansion.

(ha)         Y =   y,   so   = 0           (F).

In the liquidity constrained regime, home output is constraind by home currency

real balances. By the same argument as above, these real balances are given by kw.

We thus have.

(lib)        Y = kw, so       = 0          (L).

and again there is no effect of foreign monetary expansion on home output. In the

underconsumption regime, finally, consumption and output of foreign goods is

implicitly given by the first—order condition

(lic)        uh(Y,YM) =      = A/w         (U).

The marginal utility of consumption of home goods equals the marginal utility of

wealth measured in home goods, X (the Lagrange multiplier of the budget constraint

(6) when the latter is deflated by the home goods price of home goods). (In

general the first—order condition is uh(Y.Y) = X + 1'h+ vh. where       and Vh are
                                          13



 the Lagrange multipliers of the home currency liquidity constraint (4a) and the

 home goods rationing constraint in (5).) By an argument symmetric to the one

 preceding (lOe), the marginal utility of wealth measured in home goods is

 inversely proportional to the home monetary expansion (the second equality in

 (lic)), and independent of foreign monetary expansion. It follows that the effect

 on home output of foreign monetary expansion is determined exclusively by how

 changes in consumption of foreign goods affects the marginal utility of

 consumption of home goods. Differentiating (lic), we can write

 (lid)      Y($E =   [uhf/(uhh)]Y                   (U).

Whether home output moves with or against foreign output has only to do with

whether the cross derivative uhf is positive or negative, that is, whether home

and foreign goods are Edgeworth—Pareto complements or substitutes.

       Finally, combining (10) and (lid) we can write

(12)        Y 0 if and only if Uhf         0        (U;L,U).
To sum up, when the home market is in the underconsumption regime, and the foreign

market is in the liquidity constrained or the underconsumption regime, the effect

on home output of a foreign monetary expansion is positive or negative depending

upon whether home and foreing goods are Edgeworth-pareto complements and

substitutes. In all other regimes, the effect is zero. In other words, there is an

effect of foreign monetary expansion on home output only if there is an effect on

foreign output. There is an effect on foreign output only when the foreign market

is in the liquidity constrained or in the underconsumption regime. Furthermore,

there is an effect on home output only when the home goods market is in the

underconsumption regime, that is when neither the liquidity constraint or the

capacity constraint is binding.

       Thus, the entire transmission of the effect of foreign monetary disturbances

on home output seems to take place' through the effect of a change in output and

consumption of foreign goods on the marginal utility of home goods. Then the
                                                   14


standard Mundell—Fleming result is contradicted if home and foreign goods are

Edgeworth-Pareto complements.

        In order to further clarify this result, we first note that whether goods are

Edgeworth—Pareto complements or substitutes depends on the difference between the

iritertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption and the intratemporal

elasticity of substitution. To see this, we consider the nested CES utility

function

(13a)       u(chcf) =        U(ch,cf)l     h/'a/(1 —   1/a).   a > 0, a   1, and

            u(ch.cf) =       log U(ch.cf) a = 1,        where

                                           +
(l3b)       U(ch.cf) =                         (l_T)cf11I5]1/1),          s > 0. s    1, and

             U(ch.cf) = ch Cf          . s = 1.
That is, a is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption, and s

is the intratemporal elasticity of substitution in consumption between home and

foreign goods. Then, as shown in the Appendix. the sign of the cross-derivative

Uhf is determined by the relative size of the intertemporal and intratemporal

elasiticities of substitution:

(14)         Sfl Uhf     =   sign   (a -   s).
If intertemporal substitution dominates over intratemporal substitution, goods are

Edgeworth—Pareto complements, otherwise they are Edgeworth—Pareto substitutes.

        Thus equipped, we can interpret our results. To understand the role of

intratemporal substitution, we note that the terms of trade p =                            fulfill
                                                                                   eP/Ph
(15)         p =   X/?   = (AM/A) (/WM),

where we have exploited that the terms of trade equal the ratio of the marginal
utility of real wealth measured in foreign goods to the marginal utility of real

wealth measured in home goods (the first equality in (15)). the expressions for

which we have derived in (lOd) and (l0e). Hence the terms of trade are

proportional to the ratio between home and foreign monetary expansion (the second
                                         15



eqaulity in (15)). Also, it is easy to see that the exchange rate8 will be

proportional to the ratio of the stocks of home and foreign currency and given by9

            e = (A   Ak9*)(M/*) =
(16)                                (Ak/Ak)(wM1/wNM1).
       From (16) it is clear that a foreign monetary expansion directly decreases

the exchange rate (appreciates the home currency). With predetermined goods

prices, the home country's terms of trade then improve in proportion to the

foreign monetary expansion, and home goods become relatively expensive. Consumers

substitute away from home goods, and demand for and output of home goods fall. The

amount of such intratemporal substitution away from home goods is measured by the

intratemporal elasticity of substitutions s.

       However, a foreign monetary expansion also leads to a proportional increase

in next period's foreign currency price of foreign goods, because of the pricing

behavior of foreign firms. Since, as mentioned before and shown in section IV, the

foreign nominal interest rate remains constant, the aggregate of next period's

goods becomes more expensive relative to current goods. This induces intertemporal

substitution away from next period's goods into current goods. This increases

demand for and output of home goods. The amount of such inter temporal substitution

into home goods is measured by the intertemporal elasticity of substitution a. The




     Note that this exchange rate is the one that rules on the asset market after
the goods market is closed. The terms of trade (15) are here defined from that
exchange rate although goods are actually not traded directly against each other
at relative prices equal to those terms of trade. (They are traded against
currencies).
     One can consider a different exchange rate   on a hypothetical currency
market that opens after the current state is known but before goods market opens.
A different definition of the terms of trade can then be used,    =
                                                                      "h'    In
regimes without rationing of consumers, the terms of trade so defined equal the
ratio of marginal utilities, uf(ch.cf)/uh(ch.cf). When both markets are in the
underconsumption region, the two exchange rates and terms of trade coincide. See
Svensson (1985a, Section 5) and Stockman and Svensson (1987) on the properties of
these alternative definitions of term of trade, and exchange rates.

     Note that with the serially uncorrelated shocks the log of the exchange rate
is a random walk.

net effect depends on the difference between a and s.

     In summary, a foreign monetary expansion has a first effect by appreciating

the home currency arid affecting the relative price of home and foreign goods. This

induces substitution away from home goods, and a fall in home output. This effect

is also present in the Mundell—Fleming model. In addition, a foreign monetary

expansion has a second effect by increasing foreign inflation and affecting the

intertemporal relative price between current goods and future goods (lowering the

foreign—goods real interest rate). which induces substitution in favor of current

goods. and an increase in home output. This effect is either missing in the

Mundell—Fleming model (when expenditure arid saving is assumed independent of the

real interest rate) or, if present, always dominated by the the first effect.

     The reason the second effect is always dominated in the Mundell—Fleming model

is that the decrease in the nominal interest rate caused by the foreign monetary

expansion increases demand for home currency. Home money market equilibrium then

requires a fall in home output (the transactions variable in the home money demand

function). In our case, as both the foreign and home nominal interest rates

remains unchanged (which will be demonstrated in section IV). we might expect the

money market equilibrium to enforce a constant home output. However, in the

underconsumption regime the home currency liquidity constraint is not binding and

home currency holdings do not stand in a one—to—one relation to home output.

     These results clearly demonstrate the payoff attached to the more careful

approach to microeconomic underpinnings of this paper. Explicit attention to price

setting and intertemporal decision-making has brought the intertemporal

substitution channel effectively ignored in the standard Mundell—Fleming model

into the foreground; a careful micro—based analysis of portfolio demand and asset

pricing has shown how the usual ad hoc money demand function used in the

?4undell—Flerning models arbitrarily restricts the results.

                              IV. Nominal and Real Interest Rates

     We first consider the effect of a foreign monetary expansion on nominal rates

of interest at home and abroad. One over one plus the nominal interest rate equals

the present value, measured in money terms, of a sure unit of nominal money paid

out next period (after goods markets close; bonds yield no liquidity services):

                                            and 1/(l+IM) =                          or
(17a)        l/(l+i) =
                         PE[X'/P]/(?JPh)                     f3E[?9'/P']/(X3*/P),
             1+1 =                        1+iE =
(lTh)                (X/Ph)/PE[X'/P];               (X/P)/j3E[X*'P'J.
Using the first—order conditions for currency holdings (lOd), and its analog for

home currency, we can write

(17c)        I =
                   E[/P]/E[X'/P];        i =   E['/P']/E[X3'/P'],
where .zh (p3f) is the liquidity services of home (foreign) real balances (the

Lagrange multiplier for the home (foreign) currency liquidity constraint).

     The nominal interest rate hence equals the ratio between expected future

liquidity services of money, E[ji/P]. and the expected utility of future nominal

wealth, E[\'/P]. The interpretation is straightforward: both money and a nominal

bond have an end—of—period value equal to one unit of money. During the holding

period, money alone yields liquidity services valued at E[ii/P]. To offset that

advantage, bonds need to pay interest of equal value, so market clearing requires

iE[X'/P] =    E[ç/P].         which immediately yields (17c).

     The effect of a foreign monetary expanions on nominal interest rates is most

easily derived by rewriting (17b) by using the pricing functions (7) and the

expression for marginal utility of wealth measured in home goods (llc) to

substitute for X and h' which gives

(isa)        l+i=
                     j3E[1/w'J
Similarly,
                          1
(18b)        l+i =
                      j3E[l/#']
so we get
                                                18



(19)         j   =i* O.
Both home and foreign nominal interest rates are independent of foreign monetary

expansion

       The explanation of this maybe somewhat surprizing result is easily seen from

equation (17). A temporary (that is. serially uncorrelated) foreign monetary

disturbance will affect next period's foreign price level one for one, since P' =

             this   will reduce the liquidity service of foreign (nominal) money next

period (E['/P'] =            E[ji'J/P').   but in the same proportion as it reduces the

marginal utility of nominal wealth measured in foreign currency (E[\M'/P'] =

E[?*']/P').      Hence the relative attractiveness of foreign nominal bonds and

foreign money remains unchanged and the nominal interest rate will not be affected

at all. The home price level depends on home monetary expansion only, so it will

not be affected by foreign monetary expansion; the argument therefore holds a

fortiori for domestic nominal interest rates.

       A different story emerges for real interest rates. Real rates can be derived

from the present value of a future unit of wealth measured in terms of home goods

or foreign goods, to derive home and foreign (own—good) real rates of interest.

respectively:

(20)         l+p = X/13E[X'] and H-pM = XM/pE[XM'].

Substitution for the marginal utility of wealth measured in home and foreign

goods, and using the expressions (18) for the nominal interest rates, we can write

(21)         H-p =   !.1..    1+pM   =

Since the rate of inflation is known once current monetary shocks have been
observed, the Fisher relation holds exactly, and one plus the real interest rate

equals one plus the nominal interest rate divided by the rate of inflation.°



10
     It is well known that when the rate of inflation is stochastic, the Fisher
relation does no longer hold exactly. See Svensson (19S5b) for an extensive
discussion of the Fisher relation in a monetary asset pricing model with random
inflation.
                                        19


       Since the nominal interest rates are constant, we can conclude that a foreign

monetary expanSiOn decreases the foreign real interest rate since it increases

foreign inflation, but that it has no effect on the home real interest rate since

it does not affect home inflation.

       Let us consider an aggregate real interest rate, the real interest rate that

corresponds to a price index.11 That real interest rate will be a weighted average

of the two real interest rates, and it follows that the aggregate real interest

rate falls in response to a foreign monetary expansion. We may then interpret the

intertemporal substitution discussed above as due to a decrease in the aggregate

real interest rate, triggered by the increase in next period's foreign currency

prices of foreign goods.

       However, these real interest rates do not necessarily equal the expected

marginal rates of substitution in consumption (minus one); that is, the real rates

of interest on asset markets do not necessarily equal the true consumption rates

of interest between goods markets at different points of time. The home and

foreign (own—goods) consumption rates of interest,     and M, are defined from the

marginal utility of consumption rather than that of wealth, hence'2

(22)        l+ = uh/PE[u] and l+pM = uf/PE[uf].
The aggregate consumption interest rate is a weighted average of these two

own—goods consumption interest rates. Temporary changes in the tightness of

capacity and liquidity constraints (measured by changes in the Lagrange

     The consumption interest rates refer to bonds that are completely liquid.
that is, bonds that are traded and mature at the beginning of the period, after
the current state is known but before the goods market opens. These bonds are not
perfect substitutes to bonds traded at the end of the period, and their interest
rates are hence different. See Svensson (1985b) for further discussion of this
issue.
     Giovannini (1987) discusses the importance of less than perfect liquidity of
bonds arid stocks for the effect on interest rates and stock prices of increased
uncertainty in output and monetary growth.

multipliers) drive a wedge between the consumption rates of interest and the real

rates of interest observed on asset markets.

     These distinctions between the the interest rates illuminates the different

spillover effects in different regimes. In particular it clarifies our surprising

result of zero spillover when foreign output is capacity constrained. On first

sight, foreign output capacity constrained should block the intratemporal

substitution effect, but leave the intertemporal one intact, implying a positive

spillover. The reason why that implication is incorrect is related to the

distinction between the real interest rates observed on asset markets and the

consumption interest rates in the following way. Increased demand for foreign

goods left unsatisfied because of a binding capacity constraint leads to a

temporary increase in the corrsponding Lagrange multiplier, i,.   This    increase is

temporary because shocks are serially uncorrelated. Moreover, the increase will

exactly offset the decline in    (since we have uf(Y.Y*) =   *+      in   the

full—capacity regime). But then the foreign goods consumption rate of interest 9E

remaines unchanged, even though the foreign goods real interest rate pM falls.

Temporary changes in the Lagrange multipliers of the capacity and liquidity

constraints drive a wedge between the consumption interest rates and the real

interest rates observed on the asset markets; this is what eliminates the

intertemporal channel in the case when the foreign capacity constraint is binding.

Feltenstein, Lebow and van Wijnbergen (19S7) provide empirical evidence of the

importance of the link between changes in the tightness of rationing constraints

and the consumption rate of interest.

     In the underconsumption regime (U;UM) the Lagrange multipliers on both

constraints equal zero; hence equality between consumption rates of interest and

the corresponding asset market real rates of interest obtains. Therefore the

foreign goods consumption rate of interest p declines in line with the foreign

real rate of interest p. As a consequence a foreign monetary expansion shifts
                                         21



consumption from the next period to the current one under this regime.

     This shift in consumption towards the current period also happens when the

foreign goods market is liquidity constrained (regime (U;L3*)). In that regime.

foreign monetary expansion not only lowers the marginal utility of wealth XM, but

it also lowers the Lagrange multiplier        associated with the liquidity
constraint. Both decrease the marginal utility of consumption of foreign goods. In

this case, therefore, the foreign goods consumption interest rate p defined by

(22) declines even more than the foreign real interest rate p( defined by (20).

                                 V. Conclusions

     In this paper we present a new framework for the analysis of international

transmission of policy disturbances. We then apply this framework to a study of

the effects of monetary policy both in the home country and in the rest of the

world.

     Our motivation is two—fold: First, a dissatisfaction with the structure of

existing international neoclassical business cycle models, with infinitely

flexible prices. Second. suspicion on spillover effects of monetary policy derived

in Keynesian sticky—price models without proper microeconomic foundation. In this

paper we focus specially on the result obtained within Muridell—Fleming models that

monetary disturbances have negative spillover effects on output. We show that this

result can be rationalized only under specific parameter values.

     The framework used is similar to some recent work on open economy

macroeconomics in that savings decisions are derived from optimimizing behaviour

in a full rational—expectations context. We also derive money demand and other

asset choices from maximizing behaviour within a specific transactions technology

(cash—in—advance), but without the counterfactual implication of constant velocity

characterizing many cash-in-advance models. This is achieved following earlier

work of Svensson (l9S5a).

     Moreover, we depart from much of the recent literature by explicitly
                                       22


incorporating the possibility of sticky prices, and excess demand and supply.

which possibility seems to us to be a potentially important aspect of the

transmission of macroeconomic disturbances. This puts us in line with the large

literature on open economy "disequilibrium" models, of which Mundell—Flemirig can

be considered as a special but rather dominating case. However, following recent

work on sticky prices, in particular Svensson (1986), we base price—setting

behaviour in an explicit monopolistic competition structure.

     We apply this framework to the analysis of the international transmission of

monetary policy, and find results that are markedly different from the standard

Mundell—Fleming predictions of negative spillovers on output. More specifically we

find that the response to home output of a foreign monetary expansion first of all

depends on what regimes the world markets for home and foreign goods are in, more

precisely whether they are characterized by full capacity, binding liquidity

constraints, or underconsumption. Which regimes the markets are in are determined

by the realization of the stochastic money growth rates and capacity levels in the

home and foreign countries. The underconsumption regimes are most similar to the

Mundell—Fleming setup with excess supply in both countries. In this regime a

foreign monetary expansion has basically two effects. First, it appreciates the

home currency, increases the price of home goods relative to foreign goods. This

induces intratemporal (within period) substitution away from home goods. depresses

demand for and output of home goods, and is hence a negative effect on home

output. This first effect is also present in in the Mundell—Fleming model. Second,

a foreign monetary expansion causes an increase in the future foreign price level.

which makes the aggregate of future goods more expensive relative to current

goods. Equivalently, increased inflation decreases the aggregate consumption real

interest rate. This results in intertemporal (between period) substitution in

favor of current goods, and into current home goods, which stimulates demand for

and output of home goods, and is hence a positive effect on home output. Which
                                       23


effect dominates is determined by the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in

consumption relative to the intraternporal elasticity of substitution. In the

Mundell—Fleming model, this second effect is either ignored (when expenditure and

saving for simplicity is assumed independent of the real interest rate) or always

dominated by the first effect.

     Hence, according to this story a monetary contraction in the United States

stimulates output in the rest of the world by the appreciation of the US dollar.

but it depresses output in the rest of the world by increased real interest rates.

With relatively strong intertemporal substitution, the depressing spillover may

dominate.

     We furthermore show that a permanent increase in the money supply (a serially

uncorrelated shock to the rate of growth of money) will lead to a fall in the own

real rate of interest of the good produced by the contry expanding its money

supply. The own rate of interest on the other good will not be affected. Also.

foreign arid domestic nominal interest rates are not affected. The latter result

follows from the fact that the serially uncorrelated monetary expansion does

neither affect the future liquidity services of money in the expanding country nor

the future marginal utility of nominal wealth measured in the expanding country's

currency; hence the relativ attractiveness of money and nominal bonds is not

affected.

     The results on interest rates confirm a point made by Lucas and Stokey

(1985). It is crucial for the effect on interest rates, and on asset prices in

general, what the information content is of current disturbances. Depending upon

that information content, for instance whether shocks are positively or negatively

serially correlated, asset prices may react one way or another. In our case,

shocks are serially uncorrelated, which means that the shocks have no information

content relevant to the nominal interest rates.

    There are some obvious technical limitations, that our analysis shares with
                                       24


similar international asset-pricing general equilibrium analyses. One is the the

assumption of identical home and foreign consumers and the corresponding reliance

on a perfectly pooled equilibrium. This means that home and foreign consumers, by

holding identical portfolios of all the available assets. including currencies.

are identically affected by all disturbances. Hence, wealth and welfare effects

are identical across the two countries.13 Removing the assumption of identical
                                                      14
consumers remains an urgent task for future research.    Nevertheless, it seems

that our result on the importance of intertemporal versus intratemporal

substitution should not critically depend on the assumption of perfectly pooled

equilibria.
     Also, for technical reasons we can so far only solve the model for serially

uncorrelated shocks. Whith regard to the comparision with the Mundel 1—Fleming

results this is less of a drawback —a serially uncorrelated shock to the growth

rate of money is equivalent to a permanent change in the level of the money stock,

which seems to be how the standard Mundell-Fleming experiment should be

interpreted. Nevertheless, allowing for serial correlation in the shocks remains a

desirable extension.

     Overall, we think this paper has demonstrated the positive payoff one can

expect from a more serious approach to intertemporal decision—making, asset

pricing and market structure. Our choice—theoretic approach to intertemporal

decision—making has brought out an intertemporal substitution channel effectively

ignored in the literature on international transmission of monetary shocks. This

channel, we have shown, can reverse standard results under entirely plausible

     This

          does not exclude capital flows in models with perfectly pooled

(based) assets change, which causes changes in the net foreign asset position of
home and foreign consumers. See Stockman and Svensson (1987) for details.

assets has shown how money demand functions commonly used in international

economics arbitrarily restricts results.

The equations/inequalities (A.6) and (A.S) provide the system of functional

equations that need to be solved.

    The regimes are specified in the following way. Let us consider the market
                                                28


F or home goods. We first define the critical levels of home capacity and             monetary
expansion. y(Y*) and w(YM). for which both the liquidity and             rationing   constraints

(A.6a) and (A.6b) are just binding, and for which hence the corresponding Lagrange

multipliers are zero. This gives

(A.9)                 =
                          A/uhG(YM).YE)
                                          and w(YM) =   y(Y+)/k.
which implicitly determines the point (y(Y9*),(Y*)) in (y,w)—space. Consider the

assumption

                 €uh(ch.cf)
(A.lO)       I
                              I<   1.
                     ech
where €y/cx denotes the partial elasticity (x/y)ay/ax. That is, the elasticity of

marginal    utility       of consumption of home goods with respect to home goods is less

than    unity.
        Under assumption (A.lO) the underconsumption regime, U, for the home goods

market is defined by the set of points (y,w) that fulfill the condition

w min(A/u(y.Y).w(YM)). The liquidity constrainted regime, L, is given by the

set of (y.) fulfilling the condition y               y(YM) and     Y*)   w ylk.   The full

capacity    regime,       F. is given by the set of (y,w) fullfilling the condition

"                                  The regimes for the foreign goods market are determined
    max(A/uh(y,Y3E).y/k).
analogously.

        Assumption (A.lO) determines the relative location of the regimes U, L and            F.

It is not necessary for any of the results in the paper. See Svensson and van

Wijnbergen (1986) for a more detailed analysis of the regimes and the solution,

including diagrammatic illustrations. See Svensson (1986) for details of the

solution when (A.lO) does not hold.

                                        A2. Pricing Behavior

        The solution of (A.6) and (A.S) gives rise to the output functions (9). where

the constants k and k* are included among the arguments. Now we shall derive the

pricing policy of firms, and, more specificly. explain what determines the
                                                   29


constants k and k3* in (9). As in Svensson (19S6), this is done by introducing

differentiated products and monopolistic competition along the lines of Dixit arid

Stiglitz (1977).

        Let there be a continuum of home and foreign firms. The set of home firms is

represented by the unit interval, and each home firm is indexed by j, 0               j   1.

Each home firm j produces a unique differentiated home product j. 0              J   1. The

home firms face perfectly correlated economy—wide shocks to their capacity. We

hence let y denote the capacity of each home firm as well as the aggregate

capacity of the home country (since J' 0ydj =           y).   Similarly, there is a continuum

of foreign firms, also represented by the unit interval, and foreign firm j,

o           1, produces foreign differentiated product j. with the (across foreign

firms) perfectly correlated foreign country—wide capacity yM.

        Let us now look more closely at the home firms. The consumers' preferences

for differentiated home goods are given by considering Ch in the utility function

(3) to be aggregate real consumption of home goods, an aggregate given by the CES

subutility function

of consumption Chi of differentiated home product j. We identify the home price

level       with the corresponding CES price index

(A.12a)      1'h =
                     Lij=0h             d]
where hj is the home currency price of differentiated home product j. It follows

by a standard derivation that per capita demand for home product j is given by

                                    h
(A.12b)      ch. =
                           hjh
     Let Y. < y denote actual (per capita) output of home firm j. We specify that

it is given by

(A.13)      Y. =
                     min(y.ch.).
                                                           30


that   is,   the minimum of capacity and demand. Furthermore, let                        denote the (per

capita) home currency stock market value of home firm j. It is given by the

asset—pricing equation

(A.14a)                   =                     +
                               j3E[X'7r(Q.
which can be solved to give

(A.14b)              =
                          P.E{M y]io,
where 6, the rate of time preference, is given by 13 =                    11(1+6). The expression for

XrM/XirM.
              the    marginal rate of substitution between nominal wealth in period t and

t+l, can     be   simplified using (7) and (A.6d) which yields:

(A.15)
                   Mi
              XirM

Then the stock market value of home firm j can be written

(A.l6)               =
                          p•   E[Y'./c.i']/ô.

Home firm j chooses P. to maximize (A. 16).15 In order to see what this implies.

let us define expected discounted sales g.(P./P.k.kw) by
                     P.
(A.17)       g.(Jikk.kw) = E[—-] =

                     h                           h     h
where we have used (A.13) and (A.12b). We now realize that maximization of (A.16)

implies that P. is chosen such that the elasticity of expected discounted sales

(A.17) with respect to the relativce price                      hj =   hj"h   is set equal to minus

unity. (This corresponds to choosing the marginal revenue equal to zero — recall

that marginal cost is zero.) Furthermore, all home firms have identical demand.

Hence they will all choose the same home currency price                               Then we have


15
     It does not matter whether the firm maximizes its nominal or real stock
market value since it perceives the price level in any currency as independent of
its actions.

       They will also chnnse the same output level. Y = Y, 0                      j    1, and in

hj'h The first—order condition (A.lSb) can by (A.17) be written as

By a completely symmetric argument, the first—order condition for foreign firms

can be written
                            Yw (   s .1<   k)
                                            dF( s)

                            gf(l ,k,k)
with   obvious notation.

       The first—order conditions (A.19) have an intuitive interpretation. The home

firm faces an ex post price elasticity of sales equal to ch when there is excess

supply, that is when Vh = 0. It faces an ex post price elasticity of sales equal

to zero when there is excess demand and full capacity, that is when                           > 0. Since

it must settle on a price for its output ex ante, it chooses the price so that the

price elasticity of expected discounted sales equals unity. The latter is a

weighted average of the cx post price elasticity when there is excess supply
                                                                                                    (ah)
and   the   ex post price elasticity when there is excess demand (zero). Thus, the

weight multiplying Uh on the left hand side of (A.19a) is the probability—weighted

share of expected discount sales with excess supply.

       Now the full equilibrium is determined. The system (A.6) and (A.8)

determines, for given k and k*, the output functions Y(s,k,k) and Y(s,k,k9*), and



equilibrium consumers will consume the same quantity of home differentiated
products, ch. =    =

these together with the firms first—order conditions (A.19) determine the

constants k and k.

                         A3. Derivation of Y in region (U,U)

      In region (U;U') the output functions are given by the system

(A.20a)    uh(Y.Y3*) = A/w and

(A.20b)    Uf(Y.Y3) =

It   is straight forward to derive the derivative

(A.21) Y = [_uhhA/()2]/A.
where the determinant A equals uhhuff -                      By concavity of the utility
                                                   uhfUhf.
function the determinant is positive and Uhh is negative, and it is clear that the

derivative Y is positive.
                                    A4. Derivation of (14)

      From (13) we have

                                                       Furthermore.
(A.22)     Uh =   U   11°Uh and Uf =   Ul'UUf.
(A.23)     Uh =   U"    Ch'1 and Uf =        Uh/5(1_r)cf_l'5.         Then

                                       + €Uh/ech and
(A.24a)     €Uh/eCh =   _(€U/cch)/a
(A.24b)     €;Uh/Cf = —(CU/€cf)/o + eUh/cf. where

(A.25)      U/ech = chUhI'U = ah and eU/ecf = C1Uf/U = af. ah + af = 1. Also
                                             - 1)/s = — af/s and
(A.26a)                  (Uh)'5  — 1/s =
                                                  (cr
(A.27b) Uh/cf =          (U/c)/s      =
                                          af/s.
Combining this gives

(A.28a) uh/ch = — ((7o          +
                                    Sah)/as.

(A.29b)     €Uh/Cf =          - s)/as.
which implies (14).
