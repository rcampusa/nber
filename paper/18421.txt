                                             ABSTRACT

This paper is about the effectiveness of qualitative easing; a government policy that is designed to
mitigate risk through central bank purchases of privately held risky assets and their replacement by
government debt, with a return that is guaranteed by the taxpayer. Policies of this kind have recently
been carried out by national central banks, backed by implicit guarantees from national treasuries.
I construct a general equilibrium model where agents have rational expectations and there is a complete
set of financial securities, but where agents are unable to participate in financial markets that open
before they are born. I show that a change in the asset composition of the central bank’s balance sheet
will change equilibrium asset prices. Further, I prove that a policy in which the central bank stabilizes
fluctuations in the stock market is Pareto improving and is costless to implement.

1       Introduction
Central banks throughout the world have recently engaged in two kinds of
unconventional monetary policies: quantitative easing (QE), which is “an
increase in the size of the balance sheet of the central bank through an
increase it is monetary liabilities”, and qualitative easing (QuaE) which is
“a shift in the composition of the assets of the central bank towards less
liquid and riskier assets, holding constant the size of the balance sheet.”1
    I have made the case, in a recent series of books and articles, (Farmer,
2006, 2010a,b,c,d, 2012, 2013), that qualitative easing can stabilize economic
activity and that a policy of this kind will increase economic welfare. In this
paper I provide an economic model that shows how qualitative easing works
and why it matters.
    Because qualitative easing is conducted by the central bank, it is often
classified as a monetary policy. But because it adds risk to the public balance
sheet that is ultimately borne by the taxpayer, QuaE is better thought of
as a fiscal or quasi-fiscal policy (Buiter, 2010). This distinction is important
because, in order to be eﬀective, QuaE necessarily redistributes resources
from one group of agents to another.
    The misclassification of QuaE as monetary policy has led to considerable
confusion over its eﬀectiveness and a misunderstanding of the channel by
which it operates. For example, in an influential piece that was presented
at the 2012 Jackson Hole Conference, Woodford (2012) made the claim that
QuaE is unlikely to be eﬀective and, to the extent that it does stimulate
economic activity, that stimulus must come through the impact of QuaE on
the expectations of financial market participants of future Fed policy actions.
    The claim that QuaE is ineﬀective, is based on the assumption that it
has no eﬀect on the distribution of resources, either between borrowers and
lenders in the current financial markets, or between current market partic-

ipants and those yet to be born. I will argue here, that that assumption is
not a good characterization of the way that QuaE operates, and that QuaE
is eﬀective precisely because it alters the distribution of resources by eﬀecting
Pareto improving trades that agents are unable to carry out for themselves.
    I make the case for qualitative easing by constructing a simple general
equilibrium model where agents are rational, expectations are rational and
the financial markets are complete. My work diﬀers from most conventional
models of financial markets because I make the not unreasonable assumption,
that agents cannot participate in financial markets that open before they are
born. In this environment, I show that qualitative easing changes asset prices
and that a policy where the central bank uses QuaE to stabilize the value of
the stock market is Pareto improving and is costless to implement.
    My argument builds upon an important theoretical insight due to Cass
and Shell (1983), who distinguish between intrinsic uncertainty and extrinsic
uncertainty. Intrinsic uncertainty is a random variable that influences the
fundamentals of the economy; preferences, technologies and endowments.
Extrinsic uncertainty is anything that does not. Cass and Shell refer to
extrinsic uncertainty as sunspots.2
    In this paper, I prove four propositions. First, I show that employment,
consumption and the real wage are a function of the amount of outstand-
ing private debt. Second, I prove that the existence of complete insurance
markets is insuﬃcient to prevent the existence of equilibria where employ-
ment, consumption and the real wage diﬀer in diﬀerent states, even when all
uncertainty is extrinsic. Third, I introduce a central bank and I show that
a central bank swap of safe for risky assets will change the relative price of
debt and equity. Finally, I prove that a policy of stabilizing the value of the
stock market is welfare improving and that it does not involve a cost to the
taxpayer in any state of the world.
   2
    This is quite diﬀerent from the original usage of the term by Jevons (1878) who
developed a theory of the business cycle, driven by fluctuations in agricultural conditions
that were ultimately caused by physical sunspot activity.


                                            2
2       The portfolio balance view
Much of the academic discussion concerning the eﬀectiveness of qualitative
easing has been conducted in the context of general equilibrium models where
rational forward looking agents are able to trade securities in a set of complete
financial markets. In this context, central bank asset swaps are irrelevant
because the existence of complete markets acts to transfer risk eﬃciently to
those who are most capable of bearing it.
    In a complete markets environment, the government cannot remove risk.
It can simply transfer that risk from the private balance sheet to the public
balance sheet. Since the public balance sheet is ultimately backed by the
tax liabilities of the private sector, the risk does not disappear; it is simply
relabeled. Rational agents, recognizing this legerdemain on the part of the
central bank, will readjust their financial positions to undo the central bank
intervention and the change in the central bank’s balance sheet will have no
influence on realized security prices. In this vision of the world, central bank
asset swaps are irrelevant.3
    The case for the eﬀectiveness of qualitative easing is attributed to To-
bin (1963, 1969) who argued that private agents form asset demands that
are functions of relative asset prices, much as the demands for commodities
depend on relative goods prices. Citing papers by Krugman (1998) and Eg-
gertsson and Woodford (2002) where the case is made explicitly, Woodford
(2012) argues that this so-called portfolio balance view is invalid, and, if cen-
tral bank asset purchases are to be eﬀective, their eﬀectiveness must rely on
their ability to alter the public’s expectations of future central bank policies.
In Woodford’s view, qualitative easing is a way of signalling to the public
that the Fed intends to act diﬀerently in future states that will occur once
the economy exits the zero lower bound.4
    3
    This view is sometimes referred to as Wallace neutrality, since it relies on arguments
made by Neil Wallace (1981).
  4
    That argument is not without merit and I have presented a simple model in my own



                                            3
    But although central bank asset purchases cannot influence relative prices
in theory, there is a growing empirical literature that finds significant eﬀects
of QuaE on asset prices in practice.5 The case is summarized by Joseph
Gagnon, who has made a number of notable contributions to this literature.

          The evidence shows that Fed purchases aﬀected the prices of
       a broad range of assets at once, not just the prices of those bonds
       being purchased directly. ... These eﬀects of Fed asset purchases
       are fully consistent with what would have been expected based
       on data from before the financial crisis, and with the portfolio
       balance view. Gagnon (2012).

    There is an apparent disconnect. According to modern economic the-
ory, economic agents are rational and hold rational expectations of future
prices. If markets are complete and frictionless, conventional economic the-
ory predicts that central bank open market swaps of risky securities for safe
securities cannot influence asset prices. But the evidence demonstrates that
central bank asset purchases do influence asset prices and that the eﬀects of
open market operations in risky securities “are consistent with the portfolio
balance view”.
    When the facts conflict with the theory, the wise course is to seek a way
to amend the theory in a way that maintains those assumptions that have
proven successful at explaining other aspects of economic behavior. In my
view, these include the assumptions of rational agents, rational expectations
and complete financial markets. In this paper I maintain all of these assump-
work (Farmer, 2013) that shows how and why qualitative easing can back up a change in the
policy rule once the interest rate has reached its zero lower bound. But although qualitative
easing may have eﬀects of this kind, the ability of QuaE to influence expectations is not
the primary reason why it is eﬀective.
   5
     Examples of recent empirical papers that find a significant eﬀect of Fed asset purchases
on asset prices include Krishnamurthy and Vissing-Jorgensen (2011); Gagnon, Raskin,
Remache, and Sack (2011); D’Amico and King (2010); Neely (2010); Li and Wei (2012),
and Hamilton and Wu (2012).

tions. But as in Cass and Shell (1983), I do not permit agents to trade in
financial markets that open before they are born.
    In this environment, I show that 1) a central bank that takes risk onto
its balance sheet, financed by issuing debt, can increase welfare and 2) there
is an optimal policy which is self-financing and does not result in a cost to
the taxpayer in any state of nature. When all uncertainty is extrinsic, the
optimal policy is for the central bank to stabilize the stock market so that
the return to the stock market is equal, in every state, to the return to a
one-period government bond.


3         Elements of a successful theory
This paper presents an example of a general equilibrium model where quali-
tative easing is eﬀective. The example is designed to illustrate the mechanism
involved in my argument. It is not meant to be a realistic description of an
actual economy.6
    The argument in favor of government intervention to stabilize asset prices
is based on the idea that ‘sunspots matter’. At a minimum, an example of a
general equilibrium model that displays this property must have the following
characteristics.

        • There must be at least two periods, one period in which financial assets
          are traded and one in which uncertainty is realized.

        • There must be at least two types of agents that participate in financial
          markets. This assumption is important because the goal of the argu-
    6
     For a realistic description of an actual economy, the reader is referred to Farmer,
Nourry, and Venditti (2012) which explores implications of the case for central bank in-
tervention in an infinite horizon model. We show, in that paper, that sunspots can have
large eﬀects on the financial markets in an economy where the degree of incomplete par-
ticipation is calibrated to match realistic birth and death probabilities. These eﬀects are
large because they influence the entire future path of interest rates, and that aﬀects the
human wealth, not only of the as yet unborn, but also of all of the households currently
alive.

                                            5
          ment is to show how sunspots can interfere with optimal risk sharing
          between agents.

        • There must be at least two commodities. This is essential because
          sunspots act by interfering with relative price signals.

        • Finally, there must be at least one type of agent that is unable to par-
          ticipate in the financial markets. It is this feature that it is responsible
          for the failure of complete financial markets to coordinate economic
          activity eﬀectively.


4         A one-period environment
I begin by describing a simple, one-period economy. There is a single good
which is produced from labor and capital.7 There are three types of agents.
Types 1 and 2 each own one unit of labor. Type 3 agents own one unit of
capital. Each of the types, 1 and 2, chooses labor  and consumption  , to
maximize utility

                         = (1 −  ) log (1 −  ) +  log ( )                (1)

subject to the budget constraint,

                         (1 −  ) +  ≤  +    ∈ {1 2}                   (2)

Here,  and  are the wage and the price of the commodity in units of
account and  is a real financial asset, denominated in units of the con-
sumption commodity, that satisfies the constraint
                                       X
                                                 = 0                             (3)
                                      ∈{12}

    7
     In this example the two goods, required for sunspots to matter, are consumption and
leisure.

                                                6
    The solution to the agent’s problem is represented by equations (4) and
(5).

                      (1 −  ) = (1 −  ) ( +  )                     (4)
                              =  ( +  )                            (5)

If we solve these equations for  and  and add them up over both types,
we arrive at the aggregate labor supply and consumption demand equations,

                                            

                                        

where

                        Λ=          = (1 − 2 ) 1                     (8)

I assume, without loss of generality, that 1 − 2  0 .
    Next I turn to type 3 agents, each of whom owns a unit of capital and
operates a technology of the form,

                                     ≤                                   (9)

where  is the output of commodities. Type 3 agents solve the problem

                                               
                               max Π =  −                                (10)
                                               

subject to (9), and they consume the profits. The first order condition for
problem (10) is the expression.

                                   =                                  (11)

   A competitive equilibrium for this economy is a price system { }, a
production plan { }, an allocation {   } for  ∈ {1 2 3} such that each

                                       7

   This system has a unique equilibrium which is computed by finding a real

Proposition 1 There are two numbers,   0 and   0 such that, for
      £      ¤
 ∈     the one period economy has an interior equilibrium. There
                                                £      ¤
exists a monotonically increasing function  :    → ̄ ⊂ + , such
that  =  () is the equilibrium real wage when type 1 agents have finan-
cial assets 1  type 2 agents have assets 2 = −1 and  is defined as
 = 1  (1 − 1 ) The equilibrium real wage is the unique solution to the
equation,
                                 (; ) = 0                         (21)

The equilibrium values of {   }, { } and  are given by the solution to

                                           8
equations (12)—(19).

   This proposition is proved in Appendix A. The initial conditions of the
economy specify that agents of type 1 owe a debt to agents of type 2. That
debt is measured by the variable 1  If 1 is positive, type 2 agents owe
consumption goods to type 1, if it is negative, type 1 agents owe consumption
goods to type 2. Because the two types of agents have diﬀerent propensities
to consume out of wealth, aggregate labor supply, aggregate output and
aggregate consumption will be diﬀerent for diﬀerent values of private debt.


5    A two-period environment
Next, I expand the model by adding an extra period. In period 1, agents of
type 1 and 2 meet and they trade financial assets. There are no commodities
produced in this period and no consumption. It is critical, for the existence
of sunspot equilibria, that type 3 agents are not able to participate in the
financial market.
    In period 2, there are two possible events;  and . These events have
no influence on the physical environment which is identical in the two states
of nature. They represent what Cass and Shell (1983) refer to as extrinsic
uncertainty or sunspots. But although the physical environment is identical
in both states, it is possible that relative prices may change. Type 1 and type
2 agents are able to insure against this uncertainty by trading in a complete
set of financial markets that I represent with two Arrow securities, one for
each state.
    An Arrow security is a promise to pay one unit of the consumption com-
modity in state  if and only if state  occurs: I denote its price by  ().
The symbol   is the probability state  occurs and  () is the number of
Arrow securities of type  purchased by an agent of type . The symbols  ()
and  () are the wage and the price of commodities in state  and  () and
 () represent labor supply and consumption in those states.

                                      9
   Given these assumptions, the problem solved by agent  for  ∈ {1 2} in

    Equation (23) is the budget constraint in the financial market that opens
at date 1 and Equation (24) is the state by state budget constraint that holds
in date 2. Since this economy has a complete set of financial markets, each
agent faces a single budget constraint that we can find by substituting for
 () and  () from Equation (24) into Equation (23). This leads to the
expression,                     ∙                      ¸

    Because agents of type 3 are not present at date 1, they are unable to
participate in the financial markets. It follows that they solve the same
problem as in Section 4, state by state. Hence, in each state  ∈ { } the
following equation holds,

Equation (33) puts the economy on its labor demand curve in each state.


6    Equilibrium in the two-period environment
Since the two states are identical, there is an equilibrium in which  () = 0
for both states and in which all prices and quantities replicate the equilibrium
of the one-period economy. The real wage in this equilibrium is the solution

                                           11
to the equation,

But because the agents of type 3 are not permitted to trade in the financial,
markets, there are also many other equilibria. In this economy; sunspots
matter.

Proposition 2 Let  ()  0 and  ()  0 be elements of    where
 and  are the numbers defined in Proposition 1. There exists an equi-
librium of the two period economy where the real wage in state  is a solution
to the excess demand equation,

                        ( ()   ()) = 0  ∈ { }                    (35)

and the variables { ()   ()} for  ∈ { } and  ∈ {1 2 3} and {  }
are given by the solution to equations (12) to (19). The Arrow security prices
 () and  () are given by the equations

                     1 ()        ()

Proof. The proof follows directly from the existence of equilibrium in each
state, which is a consequence of Proposition 1, and the budget constraints,
and Equation (32), which leads to the expression for  () in Equation (36).

    The existence of sunspot equilibria relies critically on the absence of type
3 agents from the financial markets in period 1. If those agents were allowed
to trade securities, they would solve the problem,
                                        X
                          max 3 =                  ( ())              (37)

                                          12
where  ( ()) is an increasing concave function. This problem is subject to
the constraints
                             X
                                   () 3 () = 0                      (38)
                                  ∈{}

and
                            3 () = (1 − )  () + 3 ()                             (39)

which can be consolidated into the single constraint,
                         X
                                  () [3 () − (1 − )  ()] = 0                     (40)
                       ∈{}


The first order condition for this problem requires that the security prices
across the two states should be equal to the ratio of marginal utilities for
type 3 agents,
                             ()       0 ( ())
                                  =                                    (41)
                             ()       0 ( ())
    Equation (41) provides an additional restriction on real wages across
states that rules out sunspot equilibria. This is most easily seen for the
case when type 3 agents are risk neutral which implies that  0 is a constant.
In that case it is obvious from Equation (41) that the ratio of the Arrow
security prices must equal the ratio of the probabilities,

                                         ()  
                                              =                                         (42)
                                         ()  

    But the argument is more general than this and Cass and Shell show that,
when utility functions are strictly concave, a sunspot equilibrium cannot exist
if all agents are free to participate in the financial markets.9
    9
      They argue as follows. Because the model with complete participation is an example of
a finite Arrow-Debreu economy, it must satisfy the first welfare theorem; every competitive
equilibrium is Pareto optimal. But agents are risk averse and would prefer a constant
allocation to a random allocation with the same expected value. Since all uncertainty is
extrinsic, the certain allocation is feasible and it follows that the sunspot allocation cannot
be a competitive equilibrium of an economy with complete participation.


                                              13
7     Debt and equity
This section moves away from the abstract notion of an Arrow security to
show how a sunspot equilibrium would be supported with the kinds of secu-
rities we see in the real world. Since there are only two states, we need only
two securities that I will define to be a debt security that pays (1 + ) in each
state and an equity security that pays (1 +  ()) where

                              () = (1 − )  ()                         (43)

   The term  () is the rental rate of capital and the returns to debt and
equity are related to the securities prices by the following equalities,

                                             1
                           (1 + ) =                                       (44)
                                        () +  ()

                                       1
                        1 +  () =           ∈ { }                   (45)
                                       ()
To replicate a financial equilibrium with Arrow securities prices  ()  and
net asset positions  ()  one agent would need to take a long position in
debt and a short position in equity. The second agent would reverse these
positions.
    To replicate a portfolio {1 ()  1 ()} agent 1 would take the position
{ −} in period 1 and agent 2 would take the position {− } where
agent 2 lends  units of the consumption good to agent 1 and uses the funds
to short  units of equity. Agent 1 borrows  units of the consumption good
from agent 2 and uses the funds to buy equity. In period 2, those positions
lead to net transfers between the two agents that correspond to the buying
and selling of Arrow securities.
    The relationship of the Arrow security holdings to the market payoﬀs in

period 2, is given by the equations,

                      1 () = (1 +  ())  + (1 + )                  (46)

                      1 () = (1 +  ())  + (1 + )                  (47)

Since the financial markets must clear in period 1, we have that

                                   +  = 0                              (48)

which implies that the portfolio positions of type 1 agents at date 2 in states
 and  are given by,

          1 () = − ( −  ())     and 1 () = − ( −  ())       (49)

and the positions of type 2 are given by,

            2 () =  ( −  ())    and 2 () =  ( −  ())        (50)

If state  is a high employment state, and  a low employment state then

                           ()   and  ()                         (51)

It follows that, in state , there is a payment from type 2 to type 1 and, in
state  the flow is reversed.


8    Qualitative easing in theory
Table 1 illustrates the positions taken by four diﬀerent agents, those of types
1, 2 and 3 and a government agent that I call a central bank. Initially, I
assume that the government agent does not intervene in the asset markets.
Although I refer to the government agent as a central bank, this is not a


                                       15
monetary economy and the asset market interventions I will describe could
equally well be thought of as activities undertaken by the Treasury.

    Table 1 illustrates the idea that type 1 agents borrow to buy equity and
type 2 agents short equity to buy debt. The net worth of type 1 and type 2
agents is equal to the net present value of their wage income. The net worth
of type 3 agents is equal to the net present value of their rental income. By
assumption, the central bank is inactive and has a zero net balance.
    Type 1 agents value consumption, as opposed to leisure, more highly
than type 2 agents. This is reflected in the assumption that 1  2 
Correspondingly, type 2 agents value leisure more highly than consumption
and their propensity to consume leisure, as a function of their wealth, is
higher than that of type 1 agents. This is reflected in the assumption that

    Table 2 shows how the asset positions of the various players are resolved
in period 2, after the resolution of uncertainty. By assumption, the real wage
is higher in state  than in state  In equilibrium, there is a positive wealth
transfer in state  from type 2 agents to type 1 agents. Because (1 − 2 ) is
greater than (1 − 1 ), a positive wealth transfer from type 2 agents causes
that group to reduce their consumption of leisure by more than type 1 agents
increase it. In aggregate, less leisure is consumed and aggregate labor supply
increases. In state  this eﬀect is reversed.
    Since the competitive equilibrium is Pareto inferior, it is natural to ask
if there is a policy, conducted by the government agent, that could restore
optimality. The reason to be optimistic that an asset market intervention
may improve social welfare is that government can potentially replace the
role of agents who are unable to participate in asset markets that open before
they are born. How would a Pareto improving intervention work?

    Table 3 illustrates the asset positions of the four agents in period 1 when
the central bank intervenes in asset markets by issuing debt, ̂ and purchas-
ing equity, ̂. The type 1 and type 2 agents hold the residual positions,
 − ̂ and  − ̂.
    Table 4 shows how these positions will resolve in period 1 in state . Let
us suppose initially, that the equilibrium real wage in each state,  () and
 () is unchanged by the central bank intervention and so the Arrow security
prices are also unchanged. In state , where  ()  , the bank will make a
profit from it’s portfolio. In the U.S., central bank profits are returned to the
Treasury and I assume that they are returned as lump sum transfers,  () 
to the public.
    I assume that there are equal numbers of agents in each group and that
one third of the transfer, is received by agents of each of the three types.
In state , where  ()   the bank will make a loss and the Treasury must
tax the public in the amount  () and use the resources to recapitalize the
central bank. In this case,  is a negative number and once again I assume
that a lump-sum tax is feasible.

    I have assumed, in constructing Table 4, that the tax-transfer scheme
treats agents symmetrically. This is an important feature of any real world
tax system since it is reasonable to assume that the government is unable to
distinguish between agents of diﬀerent types. An agent’s type depends on
private, unobservable characteristics. I will refer to a tax transfer policy that
treats all agents in the same way as an anonymous policy.
    An important consequence of the assumption of an anonymous tax-transfer
policy, is that an open market equity purchase by the central bank has dis-
tributional eﬀects. This follows from the fact that type 3 agents participate
in the tax-transfer scheme but they are unable to participate in the period 1
financial market.
    The following proposition demonstrates that the existence of distribu-
tional eﬀects invalidates the assumption that central bank asset purchases
will leave the relative prices  () and  () unchanged.

Proposition 3 A central bank open market exchange of debt for equity, fi-
nanced by anonymous lump sum taxes or transfers, will change the relative

                                       19
price of debt and equity.

    This proposition is proved in Appendix B. The proposition establishes
that central bank interventions in the financial markets are not irrelevant.
But can they restore Pareto optimality? The answer, in this environment, is
yes.
    The optimal financial market position is one where 1 () = 0 in both
states. That position leads to an equilibrium in period 2 where  () is the
same across states, which is the requirement for optimal risk sharing in a
world with no intrinsic risk. To mimic that position here, the central bank
must stand ready to make any open market swap of debt for equity whenever
the price of an equity contract is diﬀerent from the price of a risk free bond.
In practice, that policy could be implemented by buying a broad index fund
of market securities and paying for the purchase through issuing short term
Treasury debt.

Proposition 4 A policy where the central bank stands ready to purchase all
private equity, whenever  () 6=  () will restore Pareto Optimality. In
equilibrium, this policy has the property that  = ̂ = 0, and  = ̂ = 0.
Further, lump sum taxes and transfers in each state are equal to zero.

Proof.  () =  () implies that  () =  which is the pricing condition
required for Pareto optimality in a world of no intrinsic uncertainty. From
Proposition 1, the private demands and supplies of financial assets are equal
to zero when this condition holds which implies that the net asset position
of the central bank is given by the equations,

                                 ̂ =  = 0                              (52)

                                 ̂ =  = 0                              (53)

Since the central bank takes a zero net asset position, its net revenues and
its net transfer to the private sector are also equal to zero.

                                      20
   I have shown that it is possible to write down an economic model where
an unconventional policy that stabilizes asset prices is Pareto improving. The
skeptical reader may have a number of legitimate concerns before rushing to
apply the policy in practice. The following section addresses some of these
concerns.


9    Qualitative easing in practice
In this paper, I have abstracted from fundamental uncertainty. In the real
world, there is a considerable amount of idiosyncratic uncertainty that would
be expected to cancel out in aggregate by a simple application of the law of
large numbers. But there are also correlated events that may cause aggregate
stock market prices to fluctuate as a consequence of warranted optimism that
new technologies may raise the prospects of higher profits in all future states.
    Examples of fundamental aggregate shocks include the railroad boom of
the mid nineteenth century, the invention of the telephone and the discovery
of electricity in the late nineteenth century and the development of the au-
tomobile industry in the early twentieth century. In a world where there are
legitimate reasons for the value of the stock market to fluctuate, a policy of
equating the return on equity to the return on debt would not be the best
one could hope for.
    But although there are good reasons to think that stock market prices
should fluctuate, Shiller (1981) and Leroy and Porter (1981) have shown that
they fluctuate too much to be consistent with the observed price of future
dividends. The central bank should not stabilize all asset price movements.
But there are good reasons to think that some asset price movements are
excessive. The dot-com boom of the 1990s and the housing boom of the 2000s
were both predictable and predicted (Shiller, 2000, 2008) and they provide
good examples of real world situations where an asset price stabilization
policy could have prevented subsequent disaster.


                                      21
     The reader may be concerned that, although I have provided a theoret-
ical model where asset price stabilization is welfare improving, perhaps the
environment has little or no connection with the real world. We have many
examples of ineﬃciencies that can occur in theory but are not important in
practice. For example, dynamic ineﬃciency is a logical possibility in a model
of overlapping generations but Aiyagari (1985, 1988) has demonstrated that,
as the length of life increases, the set of equilibria in an overlapping gener-
ations model shrinks to the allocation that would be achieved in a Ramsey
growth model and Abel, Mankiw, Summers, and Zeckhauser (1989) have
shown that dynamic ineﬃciency is not a good characterization of the U.S.
economy.10 Hence, although dynamic ineﬃciency is a logical possibility, it
appears not to be important in practice.
     That is not the case in the model I have presented here. In new work,
Farmer, Nourry, and Venditti (2012) show that the argument I have presented
in this paper extends to an infinite horizon model of the kind popularized
by Blanchard (1985), where agents die with constant probability. Our model
does not rely on dynamic ineﬃciency and the ineﬃciencies that do occur do
not disappear when the model is calibrated to realistic values for length of
life and for rates of time preference of diﬀerent agents. In that environment,
the possibility that new agents may react diﬀerently in diﬀerent states has
real and important consequences for all existing agents.


10      Conclusion
An asset price stabilization policy is now under discussion as a result of the
failure of traditional monetary policy to move the economy out of the current
recession. Most of the academic literature sees the purchase of risky assets
  10
    Dynamic ineﬃciency is a situation in which the real interest rate is less than the
growth rate. Shell (1971) showed that dynamic ineﬃciency occurs in overlapping gener-
ations models because, although social wealth at equilibrium prices is unbounded, every
individual agent has finite wealth.


                                          22
by the central bank as an alternative form of monetary policy. In this view,
if a central bank asset policy works at all, it works by signalling the intent
of future policy makers to keep interest rates low for a longer period than
would normally be warranted, once the economy begins to recover. In my
view, that argument is incorrect.
    Central bank asset purchases have little if anything to do with traditional
monetary policy. In some models, asset swaps by the central banks are ef-
fective because the central bank has the monopoly power to print money.
Although that channel may play a secondary role when the interest rate is at
the zero lower bound (Farmer, 2013), it is not the primary channel through
which qualitative easing aﬀects asset prices. Central bank open market op-
erations in risky assets are eﬀective because government has the ability to
complete the financial markets by standing in for agents who are unable to
transact before they are born and it is a policy that would be eﬀective, even
in a world where money was not needed as a medium of exchange.
    I have made the case, in a recent series of books and articles (Farmer,
2006, 2010a,b,c,d, 2012, 2013), that qualitative easing matters. In this paper
I have provided an economic model that shows why it matters.

Appendix A
Proof of Proposition 1. Consider the function

                                                        1
                   ( ) =  ( ) = Λ +  −                        (54)

which is continuous and satisfies the properties that  → −∞ as  → 0
and  → +∞ as  → ∞. These properties imply that for all  ∈ ,
there is at least one value of  ∈ (0 ∞) for which  ( ) = 0. Since  is
monotonically increasing in , this value is unique. Since  6= 0, it follows
that a zero of  ( ) is also a zero of  ( ). Next we explore how 
depends on . Since  is monotonically increasing in , it follows from
the implicit function theorem that there exists a continuous, monotonically
decreasing function ˜ :  → +  such that

                                  = ˜ ()                              (55)

Notice that ˜ () → 0 as  → +∞ and ˜ () → +∞ as  → −∞ Now
define
                                       
                              () =                        (57)
                                      ()
where, from the properties of ˜,  is continuous, monotonically increasing
and  () → +∞ as  → +∞ and  () → −∞ as  → −∞ Using the
labor supply equation, (12) and the definition of , (4), it follows that agent
1 supplies 1 units of labor, where

                                    (1 − 1 )
                        1 = 1 −              () ≤ 1                  (58)

                                      24
Recall that 1  2 . Rearranging (58), follows that there is an lower bound
on    0, that is a solution to the equation
                            ¡ ¢
                             = − (1 − 2 )                          (59)

The existence of this solution follows from the inverse function theorem. A
symmetric argument shows that there is an upper bound on    0. This
follows from the inequality,

                                    (1 − 2 )
                        2 = 2 +              () ≤ 1                 (60)
                                    1 − 2

which implies
                             ¡ ¢
                              = (1 − 2 )                           (61)

The function  in Proposition 1 is the function ˜ restricted to the domain

Appendix B
Proof of Proposition 3. From Proposition 1; the equilibrium real wage
in state , is an increasing function of the net asset position of an agent of
type 1
                                   =  ()                              (62)

where  = (1 − 2 ) 1  Suppose, counterfactually, that the open market
purchase by the central bank is irrelevant. Define ∆1 () to be the change
in the net worth of type 1 agents in state , as a consequence of the central
bank open market operation. ∆1 () ≡ ∆1 () is given by the expression

                                                  ()
                   ∆1 () = − () ̂ + ̂ +         = 0              (63)
                                                   3




                                      25
From the requirement that the intervention be funded from lump sum taxes
or transfers we have that  () is equal to

                        () =  () ̂ () −  () ̂ ()               (64)

from which it follows that

                               2³                           ´
                   ∆1 () =      () ̂ () −  () ̂ ()             (65)
                               3

Since, by assumption, the initial equilibrium was one where sunspots matter,
and hence  () 6= , the intervention cannot leave the net asset position un-
changed. But from Proposition 2, the real wage is a monotonically increasing
function of  () and from Equation (36), the price of an Arrow security is a
function of the real wage. It follows that the real wage and the prices of debt
and equity cannot remain invariant to a central bank open market operation.
