                             Pensions and Mortality



                                      ABSTRACT



     Pensions and age specific death rates are intertwined in several

ways. Pensions provide a mechanism to remove the uncertainty about date

of death from consumption planning. Age specific death rates determine

the cost and value of pensions.

     In this paper, we use the Retirement History Survey to estimate reduced

form functions for the probability of having a pension when the person

reaches 65 and on the dollar amount of the pension. We also evaluate

the effect of 15% drop in age specific death rates from 1973 to 1979 on

the costs of a pension.

     We find that the probability of having a pension is related to edu-

cation, marital status, occupation, industry and assets. The probability

equation is very similar for males and females.

     We find that the sharp drop in death rates has only a marginal impact

on the cost of providing a pension.

     Pension and age specific death rates are intertwined in several ways. A

pension involves a trade of present for future consumption. The expected

value of the trade depends on age specific death rates since the individual

and perhaps spouse will continue to collect the pension while alive.

Decreases in death rates will increase the value of the pension to the worker

and the cost to the company. Individual differences In expected death rates

will also alter the expected value of a pension and may well affect the choice

of occupation and the distribution of current and future consumption.

     People do not know with certainty when they wIll die. Most people plan

to spend part of their life cycle retired during which their consumption will

be based. on past public and private savings. A pension is an asset that can

remove the uncertainty about date of death from consumption planning.

     The mortality and pension linakges are important currently for tw diffe—

rent reasons. First there has been a sharp and probably unexpected drop in

age specific death iates in the 1970's. Thus the cost and value of pensions

have changed. In this paper we will examine the implication of this mortality

decline on the present discounted value of pension benefits and the distri-

bution across certain groups. Second there are proposals for mandatory pen-

sion coverage. If the population currently drawing pensions is a selected

one, a mandatory pension plan could expect a different experience than history

provides. Thus in this paper, we will also examine the extent to which the

pension population differs from the total population in a given age cohort.

     We will begin by deriving and estimating pension reduced form equa-

tions. We will then estimate mortality equations. We will also see how

morbidity and mortality are related to pension coverage. Finally we will

examine the implications of recent and prospective mortality changes on. the

present discounted value of the pension benefits.



The Demand for Pensions

     In this section we will consider briefly the demand for pensions by

consumers. Pensions are a form of wealth with some important risk and safety

features. A pension is an asset which pays a stream of benefits beginning at.

some future date and terminating at the death of either the holder or the

holder and spouse. The expected stream of benefits need not be fixed but may

be indexed to the price level or depend on current earnings though most pen-

sions pay a fixed nominal or real benefit level (when both holder and spouse

are alive). A pension differs from an annuity in that the individual

purchases the annuity but receives the pension as part of his compensation for

working. Also a pension can be riskier than an annuity in that many pensions

require a minimum number of years of work before the individual is entitled to

any benefits. Moreover some pensions are not fully funded and will not pay

full benefits If the company goes bankrupt (unless the pension Is insured).

     A pension differs from a savings account or other assets in that a pen-

sion (in a non—bankrupt firm) guarantees a fixed budget level till time   of
death but does not provide a bequest. Other assets such as a savings account,



                                      2
can be used to finance consumption while retired and to provide a bequest upon

death, but with these assets the annual consumption stream will be reduced if

a person lives longer than he expects.

     A useful way to derive a demand for pensions is via the life cycle con-

sumption savings model of Modigliani, Brumberg, and Ando (MBA). We        will
initially construct this model in a world with no taxes, a fixed life span and

retirement date, and a single asset. We will then introduce uncertainty as to

the two dates and consider the impacts on the level and composition of assets.

     Assume that the consumer has an initial wealth endowment of A0, and will

receive labor earnings of Y In each year before retirement at T and zero

earnings thereafter.

     Then the Individual wishes to maximize his utility function subject to a

multiperiod wealth constraint.



         1)   Max U(C0,...,C,       B÷i)


        2) Subject to At =      A_i(1+r) + (Y — PCt)   t   =   l,...,T   < N and

               B+i   =
                         A

         A is wealth at the end of the year,

         B is bequests,

         C    is consumption,
         P is the price of consumer goods,
         r is the interest rate,
         T    is retirement date,

         N is date of death.



                                           3
     Maximization of (1) subject to (2) will yield first order conditions

which can be manipulated to obtain demand functions for C in each time

period. These are of the form:



         3) Ct =                 r, A0, Y, T, N)



En the original model, MBA assumed B =   r   A0 = 0.   They showed that with.   an
homogenous utility function, a person would consume an equal amount in each

period and this amount would be


                 T

                 N

                                N
(T/N)Y each year during his retirement.

     Once the dates of retirement and death are uncertain, an individual can

not be guaranteed of having enough resources to consume the amount given in 4)

in each year. The individual, however, can convert the uncertain streaa into

a certain stream by buying an annuity and life insurance to provide B. In. a

classic paper, Yaari shows that if an annuity pays an actuarially fair

interest rate and if the consumer's rate of time preference equals the

interest rate, then the consumer who purchases an annuity will have the same

constant consumption stream with mortality uncertainty as with no uncertainty.

     In an elegant examination of a problem equivalent to ours, Rosen and

Thaler demonstrate that the demand for the annuity (insurance) will depend on

the load factor which reduces the return below the actuarially fair return.



                                         4
In general risk adverse individuals will be willing to pay a premium to have

an annuity and reduce some of their risks. The demand will also depend on the

after tax rate of return.

    Annuities are not a commonly held asset in the U.S. while pensions are

widely held.2 Thus it may appear that the above focus is misspent. There are

however, two considerations which also bear on our specification of the demand

function. First most workers in the U.S. are eligible for Social Security

benefits, which is a public annuity/pension that nearly all workers are forced

to buy and which pays a high after tax rate of return.3 The low use of

private annunities may reflect the substitution of public for private

annuities. Second pensions are treated more favorably than annuities in. the

U.S. income tax laws since taxes on eligible pension contributions are

deferred until paid out as benefits when a person is usually in a lower tax

bracket.

     The above considerations suggest that expected social security benefits

should be included in the demand for annuities and the demand for pensions.

The second point is that a person's tax bracket should affect his demand for

pension.

     If pensions were vested instantaneously, then the demand for pensions

would depend on the same variables as in the annuity function. Most pensions

require a minimum service and age before the benefits are vested. While this

suggests the inclusion of a probability of being vested variable, this will

retirees.

not be done because we do not have the necessary data.

       The demand for pensions, thus, can be written as

                      tax is the person's tax bracket,

              SS      is the expected Social Security benefits.



The Supply of Pensions

       Employers currently are not required to provide pensions. Employers may

choose to do so for two distinct reasons: to maximize their own welfare and

to maximize the      expected worth of the firm.   Even for a married   person the
marginal      tax rate in the federal Income tax exceeds 50Z when taxable Income is

$60,000.      When the manager is the owner, he has strong Incentives to take much

of his pay In tax favored forms.4 Even In corporations In which ownership and

management are separated, the principal and the agent have incentives to use

pensions. In a competitive system, a worker may receive a conipensation rate

such   that




 Lewellen      demonstrates that managers in large corporations do this.

            P    is the price of goods or market product consumption.



        Since COM equals the after tax wage rate plus the after tax pension.

contribution and the tax on the contribution is deferred to retirement, the

firm can pay a smaller amount by using pensions.

        There is an important additional reason for firms using pensions. Firms

often make substantial investments in workers while training the worker and

obtaining information as to the abilities of each worker. Following Becker,

firm specific on the job training costs are borneby the employer who can have

his Investment wiped out by the employee leaving. Pensions based on length of

service encourage employees to remain with the firm.

        The above considerations will vary by position in the firm which we will

proxy by education, by occupation, and by industry. Thus the supply of pen—

sions can be written as



           7)    PEN = G(PPEI, ED, OC,   IND,   tax, taxH)

where


           tax is the average tax rate of employees,

           tax is the tax bracket of top employees.



                                           7
    Equating supply and demand, we obtain a reduced form equation for the

quantity of pensions which does not include the price of pensions but does

include all the other variables which are exogenous.

     If data on the price of pensions or the load factor were available,, it

would be possible to estimate 5) and 7) since there are exogenous variables

that appear in one and not the other. Our sample does not have such data. It

does have information which will permit us to estimate the person's ta brac—

ket late in life but not information during most of the period in which pen-

sions are accumualted. Thus tax and tax11 will be omitted.




Econometric Specification

     The model presented above obtains a reduced form equation for pensions.

We will estimate the model in two steps. First we will estimate a probit

equation for the probability of having or expecting to have a pension. Second

for those with nonzero pensions, we will estimate an OLS equation for the

dollar amount of the pension. Work of Heckman and others suggests that this

two stage procedure will yield baised coefficients for the demand for dollar

amount of pensions. We could use the inverse of the Mills ratio approach to

eliminate the bias, but since we use he same exogenous variables in both

equations and since we have no strong priors on the functional forms, identi-

fication is suspect.

     While these techniques used are straightforward, there are several, diffi-

culties to be faced. Persons choosing jobs generally have available to them

different mixes of wages and pensions for a given compensation rate. Some

people may have different risk preferences. Often such taste differences are

assumed to vary by education level which is aireadly included in our system



                                       8
and whose coefficients will be difficult to interpret uniquely. However if

tastes differ within education groups, the Thaler—Rosen analysis suggests that

people with different risk preferences will sort themselves by occupation and

that observed wage and pension packages partly reflect differences in prefer—

ences for risk. This also suggests that we should not include wage rates or

earnings as exogenous variables in our equations.



The Data

    The primary data to be used come from the Retirement History Survey

(RHS).5 The Retirement History Survey commenced in 1969. In that year a

random sample of some 11,000 men and women who were heads of hOusehold and

between the ages of 58 and 63 inclusive participated in a lengthy survey. The

major areas in which data were collected include current and past labor force

activity, current earnings and income, family structure, education, expendi-

tures of various sorts, and health and the availability of public and private

pensions. The same people or their widows were reinterviewed every second

year until 1979. We currently have the 1969, 1971 and 1973 waves.



Results

    We have estimated probit equations for the probability of (expecting to)

receive a pension and OLS regressions for the dollar amount of nonzero pen-

sions. The probability of receiving a pension is measured by- the answer to

the 1971 question "Which of the following sources of income do you expect to

receive money from (when you have stopped working or five years from now)?



  This sample is being used extensively in economics. For a full description
see Ireland. For some uses, see Boskin, Burkhauser, or Quinn.


                                      9
There are at least three difficulties with this question. First some people

in the sample do not expect to ever stop working and the above wording could

elicit a "no" answer to the expected pension question if the pension will

start later than 1976. To control for this problem, we have included a dummy

variable which has a value of 1 if people expect to stop working in the 5

years after 1971 when all the men will be at least 65 years old. However, one

of the reasons that people may expect to stop working is that they are in poor

health and have a shorter life expectancy.

     Second the pension question was asked first in 1971. Those who died in

1969 or 1970 could not answer the pension question and were excluded from the

analysis. Third in 1971 when they are at least 60 years old, some people may

not expect to receive a pension but qualify subsequently. We believe this to

be a minor problem.

     Results for men are given in Table 1. We find nearly every variable used

is statistically significant and only two have "t" statistics less thart 1.

Most of the coefficients seem quite reasonable. Based on the derivative of

the probability function evaluated at the means, married and single mert are

about 1OZ more likely to expect to have a pension than divorced men. Divorced

men in this age group have much worse, life expectancy prospects. Moreover

ongoing research by Bartel and Taubman suggests that those that many of the

divorced contract severe mental problems that affect earnings and quite

possibly job stability and thus risk loss of nonvested pensions.

     The more educated are more likely to have pensions. As noted earlier,

there are a number of possible reasons for this finding. It is of some

interest that this derivative is about 50% greater when industry is not

controlled for. Black men are about 14% less likely to expect a pensiom even



                                      10
when we control for industry and occupation and total wealth.

     To help capture the business supply of pensions we have included occu-

pation and industry dummies. The RHS obtains information on current and

longest occupation. We have used the longest occupation. The omitted occu-

pations are clerical and kindred, and sales and the few cases of no answer.

Once we control for industry, professionals (and technical) and blue collar

(and operators and farm laborers) workers have higher probabilities of recei-

ving pensions while nonfarm managers and technicians have a lower though

statistically insignificant probability. However when the industry variables

are omitted, the professional dummy is insignificant and the manager dummy is

significantly negative.6

     Self employed people are much less likely to have a pension in this time

period.7 Compared to those in mining, construction, wholesale and retail

trade, finance, insurance and real estate, the probability of receiving, a

pension is significantly higher for those in government, manufacturing,, and

utilities, and significantly lower for those in farming.

     Those who expect to stop working are 10% more likely to receive a pension

than those who don't. While this may simply mean that those who expect not to

retire don't have to have much private saving to finance old age consumption,

we believe that this variable either corrects for a deficiency in the pension



6
  Several people have suggested that there are many small stores with a few
employees and a manager. These managers may not receive pensions. We do not
have information on size of firms to test this proposition. We have data on
Social Security covered earnings in previous years. We ran some equations in
which we include the monthly benefits a pension s entitled to from Social
Security. The benefit variable is significant but its inclusion has little
impact on the coefficient on manager.

  This is before Keogh's were available, but such plans might logically- be
included in annuities rather than pensions.


                                      11
question asked or is a proxy for health. Omission of this variable has little

impact on the other variables except being single which becomes insignificant

and being a manager which becomes significant.8

     We have added together the midpoint of the holdings in the various cate-

gories for each asset and liability except pensions to obtain net assets. We

expect this variable to be quite noisy. It has, however, a highly significant

positive coefficient.

     We have estimated another equation in which we add the square of the

assets and the interaction of eduation with assets and its square. The

results are presented in Table 2. The three new variables are highly

significant with diminishing returns to assets and with education effects

growing for assets less than 1/3 of $1 million.

     The impact of longer life expectancy of pension companies depend on the

size of the pension holding of various groups. In Table 3 we present some OLS

regressions   for expected nonzero pension payments for five years hence for

those alive in 1971. We find far fewer variables are significant thart in the

probit equations.

     None of the marital status variables are significant. Professionals and

managers have significantly larger pensions than clerical, sales and blue

collar   workers. Government workers have much larger and the self—employed


8 For some purpose vested pensions and annuities might be considered near
perfect substitutes. We have reestimated the probit equation where the
dependent variable is 1 if you expect a pension of an annuity or both..
     There are no changes in sign of the coefficient. The extra
probabilities, calculated at the mean, are little changed except that the
coefficient on self—e&aployed is somewhat closer to zero and the coefficient on
assets is larger. Both changes are sensible since the self—employed could
treat annuities and pensions as near perfect substitutes and since the wealthy
may wish to convert non job related wealth into a safe asset for the
retirement period.


                                       12
much smaller pensions. The more educated and the wealthier also have larger

pensions.

     The RHS sample also contains Information on women who are heads of

household. About 22% of the women compared to 35% of the men expect to

receive a pension. While far fewer women than men expect to receive a

pension, the pattern of coefficients and derivatives at the mean are very

similar except that single and widowed women are more likely to have pensions

thna divorced women. See Table 4.

     The regressions for women with positive pensions are given in Table 5.

There are only 565 observations which may explain why the results differ so

from men and why so few variables are significant.



Self Selection Into Pension Plans

     In 1971 about 1/3 of the men and 1/4 of the women heads of household

expected to receive a pension. There can be a variety of reasons why most

were not vested. One possible reason is that people with shorter expected

lives would prefer, ceteris paribus to take jobs with higher current

earnings. In this section, we will explore some suggestive but Inconci*isive

evidence; however, we acknowledge at this point that even for the results

there Is an alternative explanation which is that severe health problems may

cause an individual to be ineligible for certain jobs or to remain at a firm

long enough to become vested.

     The RUS survey asks people how their health compares to others of the

same age. The possible answers are better, same, or worse. While subjective,

Taubman and Rosen argue that this variable behaves like one would expect an

objective measure to behave. For example, those in worse health in 1969 are



                                      13
several times more likely to die over the next 4 years than those in better

health.

       Of course the variable measures health in 1969 when the men were at least

58 years old. This variable need not be strongly correlated with health when

pension acquisition and occupation and industry decisions were made. However

the R2 between 1971 and 1973 health is about .6.

       We have included 1969 and 1971 health in some pension probit equations.

The two sets of health variables are intercorrelated and it Is difficult to

obtain sensible results when both sets are included. Our best results are

obtained using 1969 health. Those in worse health are significantly less

likely to expect to receive a pension 5 years after 1971. The derivative at

the mean of the variables is —.03. The coefficients on the other variables

are not greatly affected when health is added except that of widower which is

reduced in size but increased in significance.

       The social security benefits one is entitled to depend partly on past

earnings and thus health.9 When a retirement benefit variable Is calculated

on the basis of past earnings reported to Social Security Is included ia the

probit equations, the benefit variable becomes insignificant)0

       An alternative way to examine the self selectionissue is to compare the

pattern of results of age specific mortality rats and the probability of

having a pension. Table 6 contains the probit for 1969—1973 mortality for

men.

       There are several variables in Table 6 that are statistically


Tharte1 and Taubman show that certain diseases have very long run and: large
        on earnings.
   This positive coefficient is not consistent with the substitution of public
for private pensions. We have made corresponding runs for women when average
monthly benefits are added, it has a negative, significant coefficient of 6.7.


                                        14
significant. These include being married, age, planning to stop work, assets,

and longest industry being manufacturers. While some of these results are

interesting in explaining sources of differences in age specific death rates,

our concern here is whether people expecting pensions are less likely to

die. The only three variables significant in both Tables 1 and 6 are married,

stop work, and manufacturing. The first and third of these have opposite

signs in the two tables which is consistent with the self selection Idea. The

stop work variable maybe measuring several forces. Those who expect to work

have less need for pensions because they will not retire. Those in poor

health may be forced to retire because of pain and suffering.

     When prior health is added, the coefficients on better and worse health

are significant and have expected signs. Variables previously significant

remain so and do not change sign.

     These results suggest that many people in poor health around age 60 have

been in poor health for long periods of time and that these people either opt

for positions with higher proportion of compensation in current wages or poor

health forced them to change jobs before the pension was vested.

     Of course a comparison of the pattern of coefficients is not conclusive

evidence. It would seem that a better method would be to include the death

variable in the pension probit equation. Unfortunately since the pension

variable was asked In 1971, we must omit nearly half the people who died fron

the analyses.

     This death dummy variable has a positive sign but Is not significant when

included in the analysis. It may be argued that' the death rate variable is

insignificant because too many other variables are included.

     In Table 7 we present for those who died between 1971 and 1973 the



                                      15
proportion of people who expected to have a pension. In the sample, 34.8% of

the people have pensions. Thus for the period 1971—1973, a slightly higher

proportion of the people who died expected to have a pension.

     To check further on the relationship between pensions and death we decid—

ed to use the white males 65 and older in the 1973 CPS—SSA Exact Match Tape.

A description of this sample can be found in Taubman and Rosen. But briefly

the March 1973 ci's was matched to Social Security Administration records which

record date of death for those who died subsequent to the date the match is

made. In our version of the tape we have fairly complete death information

through 1976 and partial data for 1977.11 The pension data are taken from the

1973 source of Income questions.

     Our probit estimate (with t statistics in parentheses) for 5038 men is



    Prob of Pension = .41 + —.14 Age + .079 Died 7377
                     (2.0)   (5.1)      (1.7)




Once again those who died are more likely to have a pension and this time the

t value has risen to 1.7.

     In many instances a person must stop working for a company to receive a

pension from it. Poor health may induce a person to stop working and collect

his pension. People eligible for but not drawing a pension may be in very

good health. When a nonparticipation in the labor force in 1973 variable is

included, the coefficient on died decreases to .029 and the t statistic falls

to .62. Of course the labor force variable may represent other factors- than




   Taubman and Rosen indicate that the data on death for white males in this
age range are close to complete in this sample.

those just described, but in any event there is no direct evidence that those

with pensions have longer life expectancies.

Changes in Mortality and the Present Discounted Value of Pension Benefits

     The present discounted value of pension benefits obviously depend on

expected longevity. Recently the age specific death rates have changed sharp-

ly. In this section we will examine some of these trends and indicate some of

the redistributive effects of the changes.

     The 1973-79 percentage changes in death rates in various age intervals

are shown in Table 8. For those 45 and over the reduction is about 15% for

all age, race and sex groups though it Is a little lower than this In the 75

to 84 and a little larger in the 85 and over group. To evaluate the impact of

this change we rely on a study by Winkelvoss which Is summarized in the tables

9 and 10.

     The effects of unexpected changes in mortality on pension funds can be

measured by the change in the present discounted value of benefits paid:.

Winkelvoss provides such an estimate.

     He uses a standard plan in which the pension benefits are based on the

final 5 year average earnings. For those not retired, earnings grow 7% a

year. The nominal interest rate is 7%. Nonactive workers benefits are.

assumed fixed in nominal terms. Benefits are reduced actuarially for early

retirement. There are also vested benefits, disability benefits, and

surviving spouse benefits. However retirement benefits account for 77.9% of

the present discounted value of the benefit package.

     Winkelvoss has investigated the impacts of various mortality rate

changes. For example in Table 3, which along with the text is drawn from. his

Chapter 15, a mortality rate of .5 Indicates that all age specific mortality



                                        17
rates are reduced to 1/2 of their GAM level (but In all instances no one lives

beyond 110 years).

     The first column applies if only pre 65 mortality rates are changed, the

second if only post 65 rates are changed and the third if both pre and post 65

rates are changed. As shown in the table) changes In pre 65 mortality do not

have important monetary effects but the post 65 changes are more important. A

25% reduction at all ages will increase the present value of all the costs by

about 1OZ.3

     Suppose the death rates stay at their 1979 levels which are about 15%

below those in 1971. Interpolating from Winkelvoss the PDV of the benefits

rise by about 5%. Of course the change in the premiums required to make the

payments depend on whether the plan has been partially or fully funded.

Winklevoss and McGill, for example, report that in response to a 25% drop in

mortality, a 50% funded plan would have its costs rise an extra 3 1/2 percen-

tage points.

     Let us suppose that for those 65 and over that death rates continu.e to

decline at the rate of 2 1/2% per year.12 Then by the end of 35 years in

which the member of the current 25 to 34 year old cohort reaches 65, the

average annual death rate would decrease by nearly 60%, for example, for the

'all" category from 2.9% a year to 1.7%. Winkelvoss' table suggests an

increase in costs of about 20%. The corresponding reductions for the current—



   No adjustment is made to the mortality expectations for the spouse. The
surviving spouse who receives a pension will have a longer life and greater
payments if her life expectancy increases. However since this benefit only
accounts for 4% of the cost of the standard plan, the bias is small.

12 There are obviously better techniques to estimate a trend but the
intervening years clearly show the trend. For the types of results we pursue
here, the 2 1/2% per year figure yields correct orders of magnitude.


                                      18
ly 35—45,45—55 and 55 to 65 age groups are 47%, 32% and 12%. Approximate

costs estimates can be interpolated from tables 9 and 10.

     Vital Statistics classifies people by age) race and sex. It is known,

however, that age specific death rates vary by eduation and other personal

characteristics, Rosen and Taubman (RT), for example, have calcualted age

specific death rates for various education and marital status groups using

data for the 1970's and have compared their results with those from 1960

obtained by Kitagawa and Hauser (KU). The relevant information is summarized

in Table 11. For white males 65 and over, KH find no effects of education

while RT find the more educated have substantially lower death rates.

Interestingly when RT restrict their analysis to those 78 and older in 1973,

who are the survivors of the KB 65 and older group of 1960, RT still find the

most educated have a death rate about 60% of that of the least educated.

     Between 1960 and 1970, there was about a 10% drop in the overall death

rate in the 25—64 and 65+ age groups for white males. We have recalculated

the death rates in each year using the education distribution in the other

year. Using 1975 weights, the 1960 computed rate would differ by .001 from

the 1975 rate. Similarly using the 1960 weights, the recalculated value for

1975 differs by .002 from the 1960 actual figure. Thus if education is a

causative factor, much of the observed shift from 1960 to 1975 is attributable

to a shift in the educational attainment of the population.

     Both KR and RT find that widowed and divorced men have substantially

higher death rates than comparable married men. Using the marital status

distribution in 1960 and 1975, we have recalculated death rates with the other

year weights. For those under 65, the weights are similar and the recal-

culated numbers are unchanged. For those over 65, there would have been



                                      19
almost no change in the death rates if the weights had not changed, i.e., if

the percent of married had not risen sharply.

     If education is a cause of death differentials, the shift in the

educational distribution of the population will cause even further shifts in

the average age specific mortality level. For example if we take the Rosen—

Taubman death rates by education level for 1975 by individual age and impose a

trend decrease of 2 1/2% per year, the death rate in the 65—74 year age group

would decline about 70%. If, howver, the education distribution had not

changed the decline would have been 64%. Similar differences are found at

other age levels.



Conclusion

     The probability of having a pension is related to education, marital

status, occupation, industry and assets. Most varIables have the expected

sign though managers Is negative for males. The probability equation is very

similar for males and females.

     There is some indication that less healthy elderly people, who in general

are more likely to die sooner, are less likely to have pensions. However, in

both RHS and the CPS—SSA samples thOse with pensions are at least as likely to

die as those without.

     There has been a sharp drop in the age specific death rate in recent

years. Longer life expectancy will increase the present value of pension

payments. The extra costs, however, will only be large either if the trend

continues into the far future or if the especially sharp decrease among the

educated and married, who are more likely to have pensions and to have larger

amounts continue.
