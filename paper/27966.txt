Post COVID-19 Exit Strategies and Emerging Markets Economic Challenges

NBER Working Paper No. 27966

JEL No. F3,F33,F34,F41

                                          ABSTRACT

We outline two divergent exit strategies of the U.S. from the post COVID-19 debt-overhang, and
analyze their implications on Emerging Markets and global stability. The first strategy is the U.S.
aiming at returning to the 2019, pre-COVID mode of loose fiscal policy and accommodating
monetary policy. The short-term benefits of this strategy include faster economic growth as long
as the snowball effect – the difference between the interest rate on public debt and the growth rate
– is negative. This strategy may entail a growing tail risk of a deeper crisis triggered by a future
reversal of the snowball effect, inducing a deeper future sudden stop crises and instability of
Emerging Markets. We illustrate this scenario by evaluating Emerging Markets’ lost growth
decade during the 1980s, triggered by the massive reversal of the snowball effect in the U.S.
during 1974-1984. The second strategy entails a two-pronged approach. First, turning U.S. fiscal
priorities from fighting COVID’s medical and economic challenges, towards investment in social,
medical and physical infrastructures. Second, with a lag, promoting a gradual fiscal adjustment
aiming at reaching overtime primary-surpluses and debt resilience. We illustrate this scenario by
reviewing the exit strategy of the U.S. post-WWII, and its repercussions on the ‘Phoenix
Emergence’ of Western Europe and Japan from WWII destruction. The contrast between the two
exit strategies suggests that the two-pronged approach is akin to an upfront investment in greater
long-term global stability. We also empirically show how lowering the cost of serving public
debt has been associated with higher real output growth.

1. Introduction
      The pandemic of the new corona virus, COVID-19, wreaked havoc across the global
economy in 2020. To contain the spread of the virus, many countries shut down their economies
by halting the movement of people and goods in the spring of 2020, leading about one third of
the world population to experience constrained life conditions due to lockdowns. Consequently,
the world economy contracted significantly. According to the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), as of June 2020, the world economy’s GDP is predicted to shrink by 4.9% in 2020, the
largest shrinkage since the Great Depression of the 1930s. The economic toll is greater for
advanced economies (AEs), which may shrink by 8.0% throughout the year – especially, the
euro area and the United Kingdom that may both suffer a 10% reduction in their GDP growth
rates (Figure 1). Emerging market economies (EMEs) and developing countries are facing a
severe reality as well – their GDP as a group is forecasted to fall by 3.0%.
      To calm financial markets and avoid a possible free fall into a Great Depression, many
countries, especially AEs, mobilized policy resources. The stimulus packages among AEs have
amounted to about $4.2 trillion in 2020, leading these economies to run budget deficits of almost
17% of their GDP. Their central banks rapidly expanded balance sheets. According to the
Manhattan Institute, the U.S. alone will run a budget deficit of $4.2 trillion, or 19% of its GDP,
the largest share since the deficit peak occurring during WWII (Figure 2). 1 That would push the
U.S. national debt held by the public to $41 trillion or 128% of GDP by 2030. This level of the
national debt would exceed the level that occurred in 1946 (Figures 3a and 3b).
      With vaccinations for the virus possibly in sight, it is time to ponder an effective economic
exit strategy into the post-COVID era. The road the U.S. will take will have overarching
repercussions on the global economy given the size and the pivotal role of the U.S. dollar as the
anchor of the global financial system. To gain more insight on the road ahead, we compare two
divergent U.S. post COVID economic strategies. The first is just ‘kick the can down the road.’
That is, the U.S. government could delay implementing needed macroeconomic adjustments and
gamble for resurrection of the economy while continuing to run lax monetary and expansionary
fiscal policies. This choice may bring about short-term buoyancy to the U.S. economy, but will


1
 The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) latest September 2020 report projects a federal budget deficit
of $3.3 trillion in 2020, more than triple the shortfall recorded in 2019, and a cumulative deficit over the
2021–2030 period of $13 trillion.
                                                      1
more likely come with growing exposure to the risk of a future global crisis, possibly worse than
the 2008-2011 crisis.
      Alternatively, the administration could adopt a two-pronged policy, reallocating the fiscal
efforts first, while aiming at reaching a primary surplus overtime. Specifically, it could retrench
from expenditures oriented towards COVID-related challenges, and move towards expenses with
a high social payoff (e.g., upgrading K-12 education, investing in medical and physical
infrastructures, etc.). With a lag, the restructured fiscal policy together with a rise in tax
collection may reduce primary budget deficits, aiming to reach primary surpluses.
      We analyze these divergent policies in terms of their implications on the gap between the
interest rate paid to service government debt, dented by r, and the growth rate of the economy,
denoted by g. This gap, r – g, aka the “snowball effect,” is the exponential growth of the public
debt/GDP in countries with zero primary deficit. History has witnessed decades when the
growth rate of the economy was high relative to the interest rate on government debt, implying a
negative snowball effects, reducing over time the public debt overhang. In contrast, history also
witnessed decades when the snowball effect was positive and high, the economy was associated
with an accelerated rise in the public/GDP, inducing growing concerns about debt sustainability,
frequently ending with financial and banking crises. 2
      Specifically, we examine the interest-rate-growth differentials in the post-WWII period. In
the period of 1946-1956, the post-WWII period, U.S. fiscal policy facilitated global growth
where the U.S., Western European countries and Japan successfully grew while repressing the
interest rate. Their snowball effect, r – g, was often negative during that period. This helped to
load-off the public debt overhang associated with the war and reconstruction efforts. In contrast,
during 1974-1984, the snowball effect became unsustainably high for many EMEs, triggering a
series of financial crises. Next, we investigate whether and to what extent the cost of serving the

  Barro (1979), Ball and Mankiw (1995), and Bohn (2008) noted that some advanced-country
governments, notably the United States, paid down a substantial portion of their debt by exploiting the
differential between the interest rate on government debt and the growth rate of the economy. They
caution that a government running a debt-Ponzi scheme when r < g might be subsequently faced with a
sudden interest rate rise, necessitating a sharp and painful fiscal contraction. Calvo and Loo-Kung (2010)
raised sustainability concerns in the context of the recovery from the Global Financial Crisis. See also
Aizenman and Marion (2011), Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015) and Reinhart et al. (2015) for empirical
analysis of managing exits from public debt overhangs. Cordella et al. (2010) looked at debt overhang
versus debt intolerance, Ghosh et al. (2013) analyzed debt sustainability, and Blanchard (2019) focused
on the costs of debt and fiscal policy when safe interest rates are low.
                                                    2
public debt affected real output growth. The flow cost of serving debt is estimated by the
snowball effect times the public debt as a share of GDP. A higher flow cost of serving the debt
may lead investors to question debt sustainability, raising the interest rate and EMEs sovereign
spreads, reducing the growth rate, further increasing the snowball effect. This negative feedback
may induce costly market corrections, financial instability and crisis. The Emerging Markets’
lost growth decade during the 1980s, and the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis affecting mostly the
Southern Eurozone states illustrate vividly these dynamics.
      Section 2 focuses on the interest-rate-growth differentials in the post-WWII period. In
Section 3, we empirically investigate the impact of the cost of serving debt on real output
growth, illustrating the potency of these factors in accounting for Emerging Markets’ lost growth
decade during the 1980s. Section 4 concludes with an overview of the U.S. two-pronged
economic exit strategy from the WWII debt overhang, and the possible effects of a similar U.S.
exit strategy post the COVID pandemic.


2. Development of debt sustainability
2.1 Cost of serving debt
      The public debt accumulation over time can be approximated by: 3

      Bt+1 – Bt = (rt – gt) Bt + Dt

where Bt is the public debt at the end of period t, Dt is the period’s primary budget deficit, both
as shares of GDP, and rt and gt are the interest rate cost of public debt and the growth rate of the
GDP, respectively. From this equation, it follows that the interest-rate-growth differential, rt – gt,
(aka the snowball effect) times the public debt/GDP plus the primary deficit/GDP determine the
public debt accumulation path. 4
      We focus first on the interest-rate-growth differential. The simple correlation between
rt – gt and Bt+1 – Bt is found to be –0.060 for our full sample that is composed of mainly
traditional OECD economies, and Latin American and Asian EMEs during 1946-2019. Table 1
shows the proportion of changes in public debt/GDP (= the first difference of B) depending on

3
  See Escolano (2010) for detailed analysis.
4
  Blanchard (2019) argues that the primary balance is independent of r – g, and is not significant enough
to affect the debt accumulation. Wyplosz (2019) argues that the primary balance can be endogenously
affected by r – g, contributing to debt accumulation.
                                                     3
the sign of r – g. When the snowball is positive, it is more likely for the debt/GDP to rise (53.6%
of the time). When r – g < 0, the debt would more likely decrease. This characterization is more
distinct for the subsample of AEs compared with that of the group of developing and EMEs.
      This simple exercise suggests that the interest-rate-growth differential, r – g, can play an
important role in affecting the path of debt accumulation. When r – g < 0, the debt would be
more sustainable whereas r – g > 0 may lead the country of concern to experience an exponential
rise in public debt.
      Figure 4 illustrates the post-WWII development of the interest-rate-growth differentials
(r – g) for our sample, composed of 23 traditional OECD countries and 34 EMEs. The data
availability for the sample economies is presented in Appendix 1. 5 For the interest rate, we use
the 10-year government bond yields for the countries for which such data are available. The
long-term interest rate data is limited in the case of EMEs, especially those in Latin America and
East Asia. Hence, to maximize the country coverage, we also use the lending rate. 6 We measure
potential output growth (g) with the growth rate of potential nominal GDP in U.S. dollars for
which we use nominal GDP that is smoothed by applying the HP-filtering method. 7
      Figure 4 is a dual scale chart. It shows that the median interest-rate-growth differential,
r – g, is mostly low and in the negative territory during the 1940s and 1950s. Thereby, the U.S.,
Japan and Western European countries benefited from low costs of serving their public debt
during the post-WWII recovery decades. The snowball differential continues to be in the
negative territory through the 1970s. In the early 1980s, the differential rises up rapidly to the
positive territory and mostly remains there until 2000.
      The 75th percentile (dotted blue) line hovers at high levels in the 1980s and 1990s,
indicating that the top 25% of countries in the interest-rate-growth differentials faced very high
costs of serving their public debt. These countries include mostly Latin American states,


5
  In Figure 4, country coverage varies over the sample period. The data before the 1970s is available
largely for European traditional OECD countries.
6
  Using the data of the lending rate (usually with shorter maturities) can be more appropriate for many
EMEs because those economies were not able to borrow using long-term maturities during most of our
sample. The data for 10-year government bond yields is obtained from the International Monetary Fund’s
International Financial Statistics (IFS). We supplement the dataset with OECD’s database and the long-
term historical data from the Clio Infra project https://clio-infra.eu/index.html#about .
7
  The GDP data is extracted from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The WDI data is
available after 1960. For the period before 1960, we use the Global Prices and Incomes Database of the
University of California, Davis and extrapolated backwards to 1945.
                                                   4
experiencing debt crises and hyperinflation spells during the 1980s. In the mid-2000s, the
differential drops towards negative figures, but rises up again to the positive territory in the
2010s.
      The grey solid in in Figure 4 is the median growth rate of real GDP (in local currency),
measured by the right scale. A casual observation is that there is a negative correlation between
real output growth and the interest-rate-growth differential. The simple correlation between the
median of the real GDP growth rates and that of the interest-rate-growth differential is –49.5%.
When an economy experiences higher real output growth, its debt-serving cost tends to decrease,
which is not surprising because r – g includes output growth.
      Next, we investigate the variation patterns between the interest rate (r) and the snowball
effect, r – g. Specifically, we regress the interest-rate-growth differentials (r – g), on the interest
rate (r):


                𝑟𝑟_𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


where 𝑟𝑟_𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the interest-rate-growth differential and 𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the nominal interest rate. Figure 5
reports the estimated 𝛽𝛽 coefficients for the full sample, the subsamples of AEs, EMEs, and non-
EME developing countries. Expecting the estimated coefficient to vary over time, we run the
regressions for the following subsample periods:


        1946-1969 – This is the Bretton Woods (BWs) period where most countries imposed
capital controls and fixed their currency to the U.S. dollar. Regulating domestic financial markets
was prevalent. Tight capital controls and domestic financial regulations induced financial
repression, inducing lower real interest rates. These policies and moderate inflation reduced the
debt overhang of AEs riddled during the post-WWII reconstruction effort [see Reinhart and
Sbrancia (2015) for detailed analysis]. Even when the interest rate went up, the net cost of serving
debt frequently rose less proportionally due to favorable environment for output growth.
        1970-1979 – The BWs system collapsed in the beginning of this decade, leading many AEs
to pursue exchange rate flexibility. Developing countries continued to peg their currencies to hard
currencies, namely, the U.S. dollar. Some EMEs, especially those in Latin America, implemented
partial financial liberalization; and their governments issued sovereign bonds in international

                                                     5
financial markets at times when the saving glut associated with elevated petro-dollar revenue
reduced the interest rate. These economies experienced influx of capital and investment boom, co-
funded by higher public debt, most of which was issued in U.S dollar.
      1980-1989 – After the U.S. greatly tightened its monetary policy to rein its own rising
inflation during the late 1970s, Latin American economies and South Korea experienced sudden
stop and debt crises. Consequently, several Latin American economies experienced hyperinflation,
a rapid rise in the interest rates, and deep recessions. In these circumstances, one expects rising
correlations between the interest rate and the flow cost of serving sovereign debt.
      1990-2009 – In the early 1990s, EMEs, including Asian ones, liberalized financial markets,
mostly creating offshore markets allowing the private sector to have access to foreign capital, and
experienced investment and output booms. The resultant higher growth was halted by the Mexican
sudden stop Crisis (1994-5), the Asian financial crisis (1997-98), followed by the crises in Brazil,
Russia, Turkey, and Argentina. Despite these crises, EMEs continued to increase their financial
openness. AEs enjoyed lower inflation, and lower perceived risks associated with the “Great
moderation.” The rapidly declining cost of risk, along with financial deregulation and laxer
leverage policies led the U.S. and growing share of European economies to experience the housing
bubbles in the mid-2000s. The U.S. housing bubble busted in 2007-2008, and the Global Financial
Crisis (GFC) of 2008-2010 broke out.
      2010-2019 – In response to the GFC and the Eurozone 2010-2012 crisis, AEs implemented
expansionary monetary policy. The U.S. policy interest rate dropped to zero, and three rounds of
quantitative easing (QE) reduced the shadow policy interest rates below zero [Wu and Xia (2015)].
With a lag, the euro area and Japan have implemented their own sizable QE polices, inducing
negative interest rates on growing share of their sovereign debt. With the rate of returns falling
among the AEs, investors searched for higher yields, resulting with massive capital inflows to
EMEs. Many EMEs allowed their currency values to fluctuate and let capital influx feed currency
appreciation. Currency appreciation and the low interest rate in the advanced world made it much
easier for EMEs to borrow capital from overseas in the hard currency. These EMEs became highly
indebted by the second half of the 2010s. In these circumstances, the lower and more stable interest
rate induces lower correlations between the interest rate and the flow cost of serving sovereign
debt. EMEs in general took advantage of the declining severing spreads, and increased
significantly their external borrowing.

                                                 6
        Issuing debt in foreign currencies can make a country more vulnerable to external shocks
due to growing currency mismatch. This growing exposure to financial instability reflect the
“original sin” syndrome (Eichengreen et al., 2002; Hausmann and Panizza, 2003, 2010; Ize and
Levy-Yeyati, 2003). Remarkably, the search for yield by OECD savers during the 2010s
increased the demand for local currency bonds issued by investible EMEs, contributing to the
partial redemption of the “original sin.”
      These changing regimes are traced by the inverted U-shape estimated 𝛽𝛽 coefficients
reported in Figure 5. The interest rate and the interest-rate-growth differential are positively
correlated in both the full sample and the subsamples of different country groups. As we
expected, the interest-rate-growth differentials are least responsive to the interest rate during the
1946-1969 BWs period for AEs and EMEs. The responsiveness rises and peaks in 1970-1979 for
AEs and non-EME developing countries. EMEs experience the peak of the positive correlation in
the 1980s, the period of the Latin American debt crisis. The magnitude of the estimated 𝛽𝛽
declines toward the end of the sample period among all the country groups. 8 However, even in
the last two subsample periods, the magnitude of remains mostly larger for EMEs and
developing countries.
2.3 Illustration of Gross and External Public Debt
      Figure 6 illustrates the size of gross public debt as a share of GDP for our sample since
1945. The dotted line reports the full sample, the red solid line traces the AEs sub-sample, and
the blue solid line plots EMEs and developing countries sub-sample. 9 Notably, countries reduced
the debt-GDP ratio significantly after the end of WWII. After the mid-1970s, both AEs and
EMEs increase their debt ratios gradually, at rates greater for AEs than for Developing and
EMEs. After the GFC of 2008, the debt-GDP ratio further goes up for AEs, reflecting the
bailouts and the fiscal policies associated with the GFC and the Eurozone crisis. The ongoing
COVID-crisis will keep contributing to a bigger rise in the debt-GDP ratios of both groups,
probably pushing the debt overhang of AEs well above levels reached at the end of WWII.


8
  For the sub-sample, the estimated coefficient for the interest rate is found to be greater than one in the
2010-2019 period. This result is driven mostly by outliers. Once Greece is removed from the AEs
regression, the estimated coefficient for the AEs falls to about 0.7, as is illustrated by the striped green
bar.
9
  It is calculated by dividing the aggregation of gross debt values of the sample countries by the
aggregation of nominal GDP in U.S. dollars.

      Figure 7 illustrates the gross and external public debt for our sample of EMEs. 10 The
external debt/GDP is high through the mid-1980s. Since 2000, the external debt/GDP has been
dwindling. Notably, the difference between the solid blue line and the dotted red line, that
represents domestic public debt, has been moderately increasing, indicating partial redemption of
the “original sin.”

  Gross government debt is the total amount of debt the government has issued. The external gross public
debt is composed of the public debt liabilities to foreign parties, covering both foreign and local currency
debt. The gross debt ratio in this figure is recalculated so that it is comprised only of the countries for
which the external debt data exists. Hence, the debt ratio for EMEs in this figure does not appear the same
as the one shown in Figure 6. The data for external debt is extracted from the International Debt Statistics
database.

Rodrik (1999), we also examine the impact of institutional factors on economic growth.
           While the above estimation looks into the impact of the change in the cost of serving gross
public debt on real per capita output growth, we also investigate how changes in the cost of
serving the domestic and external debt may affect output growth. For that, we estimate the
following model:

11
   We measure 𝑟𝑟 by either the 10-year government bond yields or other comparable interest rates that
represent the cost of borrowing from the financial markets.
12
   For the domestic gross debt, we use the difference between the gross public debt (from Abbas, et al.
(2010) and the IMF World Economic Outlook (October 2019)) and external debt stock (from the World
Bank’s International Debt Statistics). Here, we assume all domestic debt is denominated in the local
currency, which is a safe assumption for EMEs.
                                                                              9
of hard currencies (𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ). For 𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 , we use the “average interest on new external debt
commitments for the official sector (%)” from the International Debt Statistics database. We
measure hard-currency-denominated potential GDP with HP-filtered nominal GDP in U.S.
dollars. 13 The interest-rate-growth differential (𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 − 𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ) is again first-differenced and
                                                                                                               𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻
multiplied by external debt denominated in U.S. dollars �𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷�𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡 �. 14 Strictly speaking, for
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷� 𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 , we should use external debt of the public sector denominated in a basket of hard
         𝑌𝑌𝑡𝑡
currencies. However, most of our sample countries issue international debt in the U.S. dollar.
Thereby, the use of nominal GDP in U.S. dollar to normalize the external debt is appropriate.
                                                           𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻
The term ∆(𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 −𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡𝐻𝐻𝐻𝐻 ) × �𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷�𝑌𝑌�𝑡𝑡 has the same lag structure as the domestic counterpart.
            For the first estimation model, we apply equation (1) to the full sample of 57 countries,
including both AEs and EMEs, covering 1961 through 2019. Due to limited availability of
external debt series, estimating equation (2) covers only 35 EMEs in the period from 1970
through 2019. Some of the countries in this sample experienced hyperinflation spells, resulting
with spells of extreme values for changes in the cost of serving their debts. We therefore remove
the observations of Δ(Cost of gross debtt-k), Δ(Cost of domestic debtt-k) or
Δ(Cost of external debtt-k) where there are notable large outliers. 15
            Column 1 of Table 2-1 shows that higher cost of servicing gross public debt dampens the
per capita real output growth. The impact is found in all the three lagged variables, thereby
having persistent impacts on economic growth. More developed economies (in terms of the
relative level of per capita income to the U.S.) tend to grow at slower rates. Given that we deal
with a sample of diverse countries, we add country-fixed effects in Column 2. The results are
intact, except of magnifying the absolute value of the relative income variable.

   Using dollar-denominated nominal GDP may not be appropriate for countries that borrow in non-U.S.
dollars such as Eastern European countries. However, our sample for this regression exercise (shown in
Appendix 1) predominantly consists of Latin American and East Asian countries all of which are highly
dependent on the U.S. dollar for most of financial transactions.

      To put the results in perspective, we standardize the coefficients of the explanatory
variables of Column 1. The coefficients in Column 3 show by how many standard deviations the
per capita real output growth rate moves when one of the explanatory variables increases by one
standard deviation, ceteris paribus. 16 The relative income variable has the largest significant and
negative impact on per capita output growth. Among the variables dealing with the change in the
cost of serving gross public debt, the impact of the year (t-1) is the largest, followed by that of
t-3 and that of t-2. Next, we add a dummy for East Asian countries, finding consistently positive
estimates for the dummy, which confirms that Asian specific factors have contributed to higher
output growth. 17
      To gain insight about the impact of governance, we include LEGAL as a measure of
legal/institutional development – the first principal component of law and order (LAO),
bureaucratic quality (BQ), and anti-corruption measures (CORRUPT). 18 Legal and institutional
factors have a positive impact on economic growth (column 4). Among the three factors
represented by LEGAL, the level of bureaucratic quality and the retaining of law and order are
important positive contributors to economic growth (columns 5-7). EMEs with more stable
governments tend to experience higher economic growth, while the lack of military involvement
in policy decision making does not matter (columns 8-9). Notably, governments’ democratic
accountability contributes negatively to economic growth.
      The estimation so far includes both AEs and EMEs. Developing and EMEs have been more
reliant on external debt and hard currencies debt, whereas AEs may rely more on their deeper
domestic markets and domestic currency debt. Therefore, we also estimate the subsamples of
AEs and Developing and EMEs, reporting the results in Tables 2-2 and 2-3, respectively.
Overall, the estimation results are similar between the two groups, with several subtle
differences. For the AEs, all the three lagged variables matter whereas the second lag matters
less for the group of Developing and EMEs. All the institutional variables, except for the military
in power and democratic accountability, have positive impacts on real output growth for AEs.



16
   These beta coefficients show the level of relative importance among the explanatory variables. In the
estimation, we do not include country-fixed effects.
17
   From Column 4 on, we do not include country-fixed effects, and do not report standardized variables.
18
   LAO, BQ, and CORRUPT are from the ICRG database. Higher values of these variables indicate better
conditions. Because the ICRG data is only available after 1984, from here on, the sample period for the
regression becomes 1984-2019.
                                                   11
For Developing and EMEs, bureaucratic quality and law and order positively contribute to output
growth. Importantly, the lack of military in power has a positive impact on output growth for
EMEs sub-sample.
      The estimation model based on equation (2) provides more detailed insight on the dynamic
impacts of changes in the cost of serving domestic and external debt. The EMEs results are
reported in Table 3. Column 1 of Table 3 indicates that an increase in the domestic debt burden
is associated with economic slowdown in the following year. The impact of higher cost of
serving external debt takes more time to materialize; an increase in the external debt burden is
associated with economic slowdown two years later. An increase in external debt burden three
years ago is also associated with negative per capital economic growth effects. The estimation
with country-fixed effects yields similar results to the basic estimation model (column 2). When
we lengthen the lag structure to t – 4, the results are not affected, and the estimates of the fourth
lag are not statistically significant (not reported). 19 EMEs with better bureaucracy, more
established law and order, and more stable governments tend to experience higher economic
growth. Including the variables for these institutional factors in the regression does not affect the
negative contributions of domestic or external debt. Thus, institutional factors continue to matter
for economic growth among EMEs.


3.2 Stability of the estimated coefficients
      We test now the stability over time of the results reported in Tables 2 and 3. We first
include dummies for the time periods identified in the previous section: 1970-1979, 1980-1989,
1990-2009, and 2010-2019. We also interact them with the lagged variables for the cost of debt
burden, which we found to be significant in Tables 2-1 and 3. It turned out that only the
estimated coefficient on Δ(Cost of gross debtt-1) from Table 2-1 may not be stable over years. 20
Before the 1980s, faster change in the cost of serving gross debt was associated with larger
negative impact on output growth (Figure 8). 21 Thereby, if the cost of serving gross debt drops,



19
   The fourth lag is never significant for the other estimations reported in Table 1. When the lag is reduced
to t – 2, the estimation results remain intact, though the goodness of fit declines significantly. These
results suggest that the lag length of three is appropriate.
20
   These results are available from the authors upon request.

   The baseline impact of a change in the cost of serving gross debt is shown as (𝛽𝛽 �1 ) for the 1961-1969
                                                                                   �
period. For the other subsample periods, the estimated impacts are obtained by 𝛽𝛽1 + 𝐷𝐷′𝐵𝐵�.

like in the case of AEs before the 1970s, that would be associated with greater output growth.
The magnitude of this effect is the highest during the BWs system. Then, it falls in absolute
values, more drastically after the 1970-1979 period. The impact becomes the smallest in the
1990-2009 Great Moderation period, followed by a small rise in the last decade. Panels (b) and
(c) reports the results for the AEs, and for Developing & EMEs, respectively. 22 Notably, the
changes of the estimated coefficients over years do not differ so much among the three sub-
samples, except for that the estimated coefficient is the smallest in the 1980-1989 period for the
AEs, and in 1990-2009 for the Developing-EMEs group.

        Panel 9 (a) shows that before 1970, the median level of the change in the cost of serving
gross debt would contribute positively to real annual output growth by about 0.2 percentage
points. A fall in the cost of serving gross debt represented by the 25th percentile change in the
cost of serving gross debt would lead to higher annual output growth rate by 0.5 percentage
points. When interpreting these numbers, one should keep in mind that a rise in the cost of
serving debt would lead to output growth slowdown with lags of one to three years. Once the
lagged impacts are incorporated, the actual contributions to output growth of changes in the cost
of serving debt would be much larger.
         In the decades of 1970-79 and 1980-89, and the last decade of our sample, the median
change in the cost of serving gross debt contributes negatively to output growth. In the Great

subsample, both the Δ(Cost of gross debtt-1) and all of its interaction terms with the time period dummies
are insignificant.
                                                                         13
Moderation period, the median change in the cost of serving gross debt barely contributes to
output growth.
        Among most of the AEs, during the pre-1970s period, a change in the cost of serving gross
debt contribute positively whereas among developing and EMEs, changes in the cost of serving
gross debt hardly impacted output growth. Interestingly, among developing and EMEs, a median
change in the cost of serving gross debt during the 1980s contributed negatively to output growth
by over 0.2 percentage points. A 75th percentile increase in the cost of serving gross debt lowered
real output growth by more than 0.6 percentage points during the same decade.

American countries. The bars in the figure show the actual contributions to the growth rate of per

divided into two subsamples (e.g., 1980-84 and 1985-89 instead of 1980-89, etc.). Figure 9 (e) is
created in the same manner for Asian countries. 23
        According to Figure 9 (d), the negative contributions to the annual real output growth of
rises in the cost of serving gross public debt are greater in 1975-79, 1980-84, and 1985-89,
ranging 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points. In the 1980-84 period, the 75th percentile increase in the
cost of serving gross debt would lower annual real output growth by at least 2.9 percentage
points, adding up to cumulative output drop by 14.5% during the peak of the lost growth
decade. 24 We need to keep in mind that a rise in the cost of serving debt would have a lasting
negative impact on output growth for the next two to three years. These observations account for
the devastating growth impact of the U.S. disinflation of 1980-82 on most Latin American
countries during the 1980s, aka the Lost Growth Decade.
        Asian countries were significantly less exposed to the spike of the snowball effects than
LATAM (Figure 9 (e)). The 1980-84 period is associated with a mild impact of the rising cost of
serving debt to lowering output growth. Even in the 1990-99 period, which includes the Asian

financial crisis period, the negative contribution is rather small (about 0.2 percentage points for
the 75th percentile). Notably, unlike Latin American economies, the blue stars are consistently
scattered at low values in absolute values, meaning that Asian economies tend to face small
“snowball” effects and smaller debt-GDP ratios. 25
      Overall, these findings indicate that higher flow costs of serving gross public debt can have
economically significant impacts, accounting for the dramatic decline in the growth rates of most
Latin American countries during the debt crises in the 1980s.


3.2 Interactions with other variables
      The dynamic impact of the cost of serving debt on output growth may also depend upon
other macroeconomic and policy variables, including the real exchange rate, financial openness,
financial development, current account and international reserves. We examine these issues by
interacting these variables with the variables that represent the cost of serving debt.
      We repeat the estimations of the models in columns (1) and (4) of Table 2-1, as well as the
estimations of the model of columns (1) and (4) of Table 3. The former focuses on the cost of
serving gross debt and uses the full sample while the latter focuses on external debt only for the
EMEs due to data availability. 26
Real effective exchange rate
      Adverse shocks may induce currency depreciation and stagflation pressures, impacting the
real effective exchange rate (REER). These forces in turn may affect the burden of external hard
debt. Real depreciation of the domestic currency can impact output growth positively or
negatively depending on whether the effect goes through trade or financial channels. Hence, it
should be interesting to see how the cost of serving debt affects output growth is impacted by
REER movements.
      In Table 4, we include the REER rate of change at time (t) and interact it with
Δ(Cost of gross debtt-k) for the three lags. 27 In columns (1) and (2), the estimate of the


25
   Arguably, these effects were modest for Asian countries during the 1980s reflecting their lower reliance
on outside funding than LATAM countries, and the lower dependence of Asian countries on volatile
commodity exports.
26
   For the second estimation model, we interact the variables of our interest only with the variable for
changes in the cost of serving external debt.
27
   A rise in the REER index means real currency appreciation. The data is extracted from the World
Bank’s Global Development Indicators.
                                                    15
Δ(Cost of gross debtt-1), is significantly negative while the estimate on its interaction with the
rate of change in REER, ΔREER, is significantly positive. Thus, a faster rise in the cost of
serving gross debt has a negative impact on output growth, the impact is dampened if the country
experiences real appreciation since it reduces the debt burden. 28
      Similar patterns for Δ(Cost of external debtt-3) and its interaction with ΔREER apply when
we focus on EMEs (columns (3) and (4)). Including the LEGAL variable does not change the
results except that the estimate on the interaction with the third lag becomes marginally
significant (p-value=11%).
Interactive effects of financial openness
      The impact of the cost of serving debt on output growth may depend on financial openness.
We use the Chinn-Ito (2006, 2008) index of financial openness and assign the dummy with the
value of one if the index of the concerned country is greater than the sample median. We also
interact it with the three lagged variables for the change in the cost of serving gross or external
debt. The estimated coefficient on Δ(Cost of gross debtt-i) or Δ(Cost of external debtt-i) is the
impact of a change in the cost of serving gross or external debt on output growth for financially
closed economies, whereas the estimated coefficient on the interaction with the financial
openness dummy represents the impact for financially open economies.
      Table 5 shows that financially closed economies are negatively affected by a more rapid
increase in the cost of serving gross debt with lags of one and three years. In contrast, financially
open economies might perform better in terms of output growth even with a rise in the cost of
serving gross debt from the previous year. However, when it comes to the impact of a faster rise
in debt-serving cost three years ago, it would be more negative. These mixed results can be
attributed to sample heterogeneity, and can be untangled by disaggregating the full sample into
the subsamples of AEs and developing and EMEs.
      For the AE subsample, all the three interactions are significantly negative (not reported),
suggesting that a faster rise in the cost of serving public debt would have an additional negative
impact on output growth if the economy of concern is more open to overseas financial markets.
For the subsample of developing and EMEs, the interaction terms with the first- and third-lags


28
  The interaction term between Δ(Cost of domestic debtt-3) and ΔREERt is found to be negative, but the
magnitude of the estimate is smaller than that of the interaction between Δ(Cost of gross debtt-1) and
ΔREERt.
                                                   16
have positive impact on output growth. Unlike AEs, greater financial openness would dampen
the negative impact of a rise in the debt serving cost on output growth. Greater financial
openness in EMEs may signal higher levels of credibility and market-friendliness, mitigating
sudden stops concerns. Columns (3) and (4) show that only financially open EMEs would
observe a rise in the cost of serving external debt two years ago affecting output growth
negatively, while the impact of a rise in the debt-serving cost from three years before affect only
financially closed economies.
Interactive effects of financial development
     Table 6 shows the estimates with three interaction terms with financial development (FD),
reporting significant negative coefficients. Thereby, financially developed economies tend to
have greater negative impacts on output growth from a rise in the cost of serving public debt.
The impact is identified for all the lag lengths. Financially developed economies also have
negative impacts on output growth from a rise in the debt-serving cost one or three years ago.
The significantly negative estimates on the interactions means that the negative impacts are
greater for financially developed countries.
     For the second set of estimations, which are only applied to developing and EMEs, two of
the interaction terms for t-2 and t-3 are found to have significantly negative estimates, mostly
consistent results to columns (1) and (2).
Interactive effects of current account
     The impact of a rise in the cost of serving debt on output growth may differ between net
capital exporters and importers. Table 7 includes the dummy for the country-year’s with current
account deficit and interact it with the variables for change in the cost of serving debt.
Interestingly, in the first model, the interaction variables for t-3 are significantly positive while
the estimated coefficients of Δ(Cost of gross debtt-3) are significantly negative. That is,
economies that run current account deficit, i.e. capital importers, would experience a smaller
impact on output growth even when they face a rise in the cost of serving gross public debt. To a
lesser extent, we observe similar pattern for Δ(Cost of external debtt-2) and interaction with the
current account deficit dummy (column (4)). Thereby, access to capital overseas matters - a
sudden stop can induce the country to run current account surplus, and the rise in the cost of
serving external debt could have a larger negative impact on its output growth.



                                                  17
Interactive effects with international reserves (IR)
      A series of financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s have led many central banks in EMEs to
increase their international reserves (IR), viewing these reserves as an effective buffer that
mitigate exposure to financial instability. Thereby, holding more IR may dampen the negative
output growth of the rising debt serving cost. Table 8 report the estimations, where we include a
dummy for an economy that experiences an increase in the volume of IR holding during period
t-1 (D if ΔIRt-1>0), and interact it with the three lagged variables for the cost of serving gross or
external debt. While the estimates on three Δ(Cost of gross debtt-k) are significantly negative in
columns (1) and (2), the estimate on the interaction term between Δ(Cost of gross debtt-2) and the
dummy for increasing IR is significantly positive. The same observation can be made for
Δ(Cost of external debtt-2) and its interaction (columns (3) and (4)). These findings imply that
the negative growth effect of a rise in the cost of serving debt could be mitigated in countries
experiencing a rise in IR holding. This applies also to EMEs sub sample.
Interactive effects with the sign of the change in the cost of serving debt
      We close this section by testing the possible asymmetric effect of a rise versus a drop in
the interest-rate-growth differentials, r – g. We create a dummy that takes a value of one if

∆�𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 −𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 � × �𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷�𝑌𝑌� > 0, where “debt” can mean either gross debt like in the case of
                               𝑡𝑡

equation (1) or external debt like in the case of equation (2). We also interact this dummy

variable with the variable ∆�𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡 −𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡 � × �𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷�𝑌𝑌� .
                                                                  𝑡𝑡
                                                                                                    𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈
                                                              𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈
      Table 9 presents interesting results. While ∆�𝑟𝑟𝑡𝑡−1 −𝑔𝑔𝑡𝑡−1   � × �𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑�𝑌𝑌�            takes a

also takes a significantly negative coefficient (columns (1) and (2)). This means that a change in
the cost of serving gross debt affect output growth negatively, but that the impact of a rise in the
cost of serving gross debt is larger when the debt serving cost is rising. There pattern reflects the
asymmetry in the impact of a rise versus a fall of the debt-serving cots. The estimation also
shows that a change in the debt-serving cost from three years can also have a negative impact on
real output growth if the country of concern experienced a rise in the debt-serving cost in the
previous year.



                                                             18
      Such an asymmetry can be also observed when we disaggregate the cost of serving gross
debt into that of domestic and external debt. The estimated coefficients of the interaction terms
for (t-1) and (t-3) are found to be significantly negative. Thereby, the cost of serving debt,
whether gross or external, contribute negatively to output growth, and the impact is worse when
the debt-serving cost is rising.


4. Concluding remarks
      Our analysis validates that a rise in the cost of external debt has been associated with EMEs
output growth slowdown. A faster rise in the flow cost of serving external debt has a negative
impact on output growth, and this effect is dampened if the country experiences real
appreciation. Consequently, U.S. post COVID exit policies reducing the odds of rapid increase
in snowball effects may reduce future volatility, stabilize and increase the global growth rate.
      It is tempting to presume that the new normal for the future comprises negative snowball
effects associated with secular stagnation. Yet, there are several concerns to keep in mind. First,
the past performance of the U.S. as the safe anchor of the global financial system does not
guarantee maintaining the “exorbitant privilege” status into the future [see Gourinchas et al.
(2010), Eichengreen (2011) and Carney (2019)]. The two-pronged U.S. post COVID exit
strategy discussed in our paper may mitigate the growing discontent with the dominance of the
U.S. dollar. Greater attention on the part of the U.S. to scaling down overtime its public debt
overhang will mitigate the present centrifugal forces working towards multipolar global
currencies discussed by Carney (2019). An additional concern is that the record of predicting
future changes of the snowball effects is mixed, at best. 29 Presuming that the new normal is a
negative snowball effect may increase overtime the risk of a deeper future crisis, as was the case
in the late 1990s and early 2000s when the presumption of an enduring ‘Great Moderation’
permeated policy makers.
      The history of the U.S. after WWII provides a vivid example of the success of a two-
pronged approach in facilitating the exit from a public debt overhang, stabilizing the global
economy, and solidifying the global role of the dollar. The rapid decline in public debt/GDP

29
  While ‘Secular stagnation’ gained prominence following Summers (2013) analysis, it occurred five
years after the Global Financial Crisis, providing a backward-looking perceptive interpretation of the
‘great moderation’ and the on-set of demographic transitions, at times when concerns regarding the future
of the dollar system were muted.
                                                   19
from 1946 to 1955, exhibited in Figures 3a and 3b, was accommodated by financial repression
inducing lower r, mild inflation (~ 4.2%), higher taxes and robust GDP growth [Aizenman and
Marion (2011), Reinhart and Sbrancia (2015), Reinhart et al. (2015)]. Figure 10 shows vividly
the sharp drop of WWII U.S. fiscal revenue mobilization from 50% GDP points in 1944 towards
20% by 1946. Starting in 1947, this large revenue contraction was followed by an upwards trend,
increasing the fiscal revenue/GDP to 35% in the 1970s. Remarkably, Figure 11 shows that the
US government was running mostly primary surpluses during that period. These policies
supported a solid economic growth, reducing the public debt/GDP from 106% in 1946 to 23% in
1974.
        This post WWII success illustrates the feasibility and gains from a two-pronged fiscal
strategy. Looking forward, reallocation of fiscal spending from fighting COVID’s medical and
economic challenges towards physical, medical and social infrastructures may provide a
welcome bust to future growth. With a lag, following the resumption of robust growth,
increasing taxes and reaching a primary surplus may stabilize the U.S. and the global economy.
Such a trajectory may solidify the viability and credibility of the US dollar as a global anchor,
stabilizing thereby Emerging Markets economies and global growth.

thereby from the figure due to scaling consideration. This effect translate to cumulative output drop of 14.5% GDP during that period.
