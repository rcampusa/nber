                 PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND LABOR MARKETS




          Differences in labor compensation across 31 large public
library   systems are examined based on the author's interview survey.

Salaries for recruit clerical workers, recruit librarians, and

librarians with five years' experLence are compared along with hours

of work per week and fringe benefits. Cost of living differences in

metropolitan areas and collective bargaining are found to be strongly

associated with differences in labor compensation. The collective

bargaining differential for experienced librarians seems to be about

13.5 percent.

                     PUBLIC LIBRARIES AND LABOR MARKETS


    Labor expenses dominate library budgets although they are a smaller frac-

tion of library expenditures than of many local government services. Labor

expenditures constitute about 63 percent of total library operating budgets,

on an average, a fraction that is substantially smaller than that for police

or fire fighting.1

     The rates of compensation for library employees are very important in

determining the character of library service. In an earlier essay, a statis-

tically significant negative association was found between librarian compen-

sation levels and the number of hours cf service in branches: libraries with

high labor costs seem to economize by reducing hours. Therefore, it is appro-

priate to investigate the pattern of compensation levels for library employees

across library systems in order to understand the forces shaping library ser-

vices.

     The essay first discusses the measurement of compensation and possible

sources of variation in compensation. The essay then presents some evidence

on the influences of collective bargaining, the cost of living, and city

finances on compensation levels.


                        NEASURING LABOR COMPENSATION


     The central component of labor compensation is salary. Because salaries

differ with skill, experience and responsibility, it is necessary to compare

salaries for comparable positions. Three benchmark positions are used for

comparison purposes here: a recruit clerical worker, a recruit librarian,
                                                                            2




and a librarian with five year's experience. These three benchmark positions

represent three different points on the range of skills employed in the li-

brary. The other elements of compensation are the hours in the work week and

the value of fringe benefits on average relative to base salary.

    The job descriptions for the three benchmark positions may differ some-

what from library to library but some effort is made to identify uniform char-

acteristics across systems. Usually, a recruit librarian is called a librarian

I. Most libraries require a Master of Library Science degree from a school of

librarianship accredited by the American Library Association.2 Because for

any opening for a librarian, there are likely to be 30 or 40 applicants, any

public library can hire master's degree holders in library science.3 Of course,

those systems that pay more will be able to select from better quality appli-

cants than those paying less, other things equal, because not all recruit

librarians are the same. Because of an over production of trained librarians,

some masters degree librarians may hold positions in libraries not requiring

advanced training, that is, clerical positions. They may be given some pre-

ference when positions for librarians become vacant.

     The mean salary for a recruit librarian was $11,636 with no statistically

significant difference across the geographic types as indicated in Table 1.

This compares with the average of $10,929 for new librarians employed in

public libraries reported in the Library Journal survey for l977. The large

urban public libraries surveyed pay somewhat more than the average public

library. Among surveyed libraries, the annual salary for a recruit librarian

varied from $8,820 in San Antonio to $13,906 in Hennepin County, Minnesota.

     The second benchmark position is that of a librarian with five years

experience and receiving normal promotions. Usually, this is taken to be

the third salary step for a librarian II position, although salary schedules

vary in design. The mean salary observed for librarians with five years

experience was $14,209. The annual salaries ranged from a low of $10,180 in

Nashville to a high of $18,635 in Minneapolis. Experience seems to be impor-

tant in librarian compensation.

     The third benchmark position is that of the recruit clerical worker,

usually called a clerk I position. The average salary for the recruit cler-

ical worker was $6,909 across the 31 library systems interviewed in 1978. The

annual salaries range from under $5,500 in Nashville and Pittsburgh to over

$9,100 in Philadelphia and Contra Costs County, California. There is no

statistically significant difference across the geographic groupings of the

libraries as indicated in Table 1.

     The cost of employing an additional worker in a public library system

includes the provision of fringe benefits. The interview asked for the value

of fringe benefits relative to base salary. The response is an average, or

the figure that applies to a recruit librarian. Fringe benefits may not be

in the same ratio to salary for all employees. Fringe benefits average

20.76 percent of base salary across the 30 systems reporting this information.

The figure varies from 8.5 percent in Atlanta to 32 percent in Brooklyn.

Eighly percent of the systems participate in social security, Atlanta was

not among them.

     The number of hours of work per week also is important to understanding

compensation levels. If compensation levels are to be compared across systems,

differences in hours of work must be accounted for. In some systems the work

week differs between white and blue collar workers: white collar hours are

examined here. The mean   hours   worked per week was 38.73 for the systems

interviewed. There seems to be some weak tendency for the central city

systems to have shorter work weeks than the metropolitan and suburban systems.
                                                                              5



Twenty of the 31 systems have 40 hour weeks; Boston, Buffalo, Brooklyn, New

York and New Orleans have 35 hour weeks; another 6 have 37.5 or 38 hour weeks.


                             LABOR MARKET ISSUES


     The comparison of the important features of employee compensation across

the large public library systems reveals substantial variation in the elements

of compensation. While the range of variation is not as great as that found

for fire fighters, it is important enough to induce changes in the operation

of libraries.5 Therefore, we are interested in learning more about the

sources of variation in compensation.

     Six labor market issue areas seem important in examining patterns -of

compensation of library employees. Each is mentioned briefly here, and dis-

cussed in more detail below. First, the terms of employment may condition

compensation, as for example, when residency in a jurisdiction is required.

Second, professionalism may play a role, as for example in the responsibili-

ties given to masters level librarians. Third, the sex ratio of employment

may be of significance. The Library Journal survey shows female recruit

librarians earning somewhat less than males on average.6 Fourth, the nature

of the local labor market may have some influence. If compensation levels

are high in jobs of comparable skill in the metropolitan area, the library

may have to pay more to attract workers.   Fifth, the nature of the local

government finances may have a bearing. Cities that spend a lot on other

services, may have less to spend on libraries and so may pay less in compen-

sation to library employees. Sixth, 'employees may participate in collective

bargaining, and the determinants of compensation levels may   differ   with col-

lective bargaining.
                                                                             6




Terms of Employment

     Just under half of the city and metropolitan library systems studied

require that their employees live in the jurisdiction. None of the suburban

systems have such requirements. To the extent that employees would rather

live elsewhere than in the jurisdiction and labor markets are competitive,

the library system would be expected to have to pay more in order to induce

such workers to accept employment. Because there are many applicants for

most library positions, the library may use the residency requirement as a

partial screening criteria. The residency requirement may therefore have

little association with salary.

     There may be other terms of employment that influence compensation.

If pensions are funded and vested they may be more valuable. Workers may

view their jobs differently if they have civil service protection. The value

of vacation, sick leave, and holidays may not be reflected in the value of

fringe benefits, and so may influence compensation levels. Of these items,

only the residency requirement is examined in this study.


Professionalism

     The successful operation of a library takes skill. As with many pro-

fessions, library workers historically gained their skill through experience

in operating libraries. Then, formal education became a prerequisite for

employment and substituted to some degree for job experience.7 In most li-

braries at the present time, a masters in library science degree is a pre-

requisite to employment as a librarian. Since formal education in librarian-

ship and experience in libraries are both important to libraries, we would

expect compensation levels to be higher for librarians with both more educa-

tion and experience. Examining salaries for recruit librarians and for
                                                                             7




librarians with five years experience should control for the main differences

in entrance qualifications and experience.

    The skill requirements of library work, however, may play another role.

Experience in a library setting may be important in promoting a career in

library work. Experience In a more sophisticated library operation may be

more valuable career—wise than experience in a routine library position.

Therefore, librarians might accept somewhat lower compensation in an entry

level position in library systems that offer more professional development

and promotion opportunities than another, just as assistant professors are

paid less are very prestigous universities. It is possible, for example,

for a subject area specialist in the main library in a large system to move

into an important position in an academic library, or vice versa. The strong

career potential of otherwise similar entry positions in the public libraries

would be expected to be associated with lower salaries for recruits,

     On the other hand, the skills of masters degree librarians may be sub-

stantially underutilized in many library systems. A system with a large

proportion of employment of professionals may have professionals performing

tasks that are performed just as well by non—professionals in other systems.

For example, masters degree librarians mount microfilm reels for patrons in

one library system. They may also perform routine clerical chores in some

systems. Thus, the specific duties of jobs with similar descriptions and

education—experience prerequisites may differ across systems. The recruit

professional librarians in systems with a higher proportion of professionals

seem likely to have less responsibility, and to perform more tasks for which

their education is not required than recruits in a system with a smaller

proportion of professionals. If compensation reflects actual job require-

ments, lower compensation for recruit librarians might be found in systems
                                                                                8




with a higher proportion of professional employees.

      Some library systems have designated some positions for paraprofessionais,

persons with librarianship training short of the masters degree. Presumably,

systems with more paraprofessionals employ fewer professionals. The profes-

sionals concentrate on tasks that require their more specialized skills.

Systems with more paraprofessionals would be expected to pay recruit librarians

more than systems with more professionals. The study has not examined para—

professionals separately.

      Professionalism suggests that compensation will be lower at the recruit

level, but be higher for librarians with more experience in libraries with

more professionals. Entry positions that offer better on the job training

experiences and opportunity for career advancement should receive lower pay

for that reason. Systems that use persons in professional positions for

tasks that do not require professional training might be paid less reflecting

lower productivity. At the senior ranks, higher compensation would be ex-

pected where supervision of more professionals is found, and more sophis-

ticated library skills are required. The role of professionalism in deter-

mining compensation levels may be difficult to distinguish because causality

may   also   run the other way. High rates of compensation might induce a li-

brary to substitute non—professional for professional job positions, for

example, paraprofessionals. The proportion of employees working in public

services who are professionals is taken as a rough indication of the profes-

sional orientation of the library.


Sex Ratio of Employment

       There are many more female librarians than males. Males constitute

roughly 22 percent of the graduates of library schools in recent years.
                                                                            9




Historically, female dominated occupations have had lower compensation levels

than male dominated occupations with similar skill requirements. It is dif-

ficult to distinguish the extent to which this pattern is due to discrimina-

tion from the extent to which it may be due to other causes. The purpose

of this study, however, is not to compare the compensation of librarians

with that of other occupations, but rather to examine differences in the

rate of compensation of librarians in different public library systems.

     While salary levels are somewhat lower in public libraries than academic,

school or other libraries on average, the sex ratio of recruits is about the

same, roughly 22 percent.8 The public libraries as a group do not seem to

have exhibited any particular tilt with respect to sex in recruitment of new

librarians. On the other hand, many fewer than half of the directors of the

libraries interviewed were female; thus perhaps promotion prospects differ

by sex actoss the libraries. It is still possible that individual public

libraries recruit only female librarians in order to pay less. The causality

may run the other way as well, however: libraries paying less may find that

they hire a higher proportion of females because female job alternatives

also pay less. This particular issue is not addressed because the determi-

nation of sex ratio and salary levels are likely to be simultaneous.

     There is some evidence that the earnings of males is lower in metro-

politan areas where female job opportunities are better. Apparently, house-

holds maximize family welfare jointly, and so one spouse may accept lower

earnings if job prospects for the other partner are better.9 Salary levels

may, therefore, be higher in a female dominated occupation like librarians,

 in metropolitan areas where there are more female jobs of all kinds. While

 other jobs for females are not perfect substitute positions for librarians,

 many persons with library training do hold non—librarian jobs. Consequently,
                                                                             10



the nature of alternative job opportunities for females may Influence the

salary levels for librarians in public libraries. The proportion of employees

in the metropolitan area who are female is used to indicate the extent of

female job opportunities in the area.


Local Labor Market

    While librarians have specialized training and skills, the salary levels

may be influenced by local labor market conditions. The cost of living varies

across metropolitan areas such that libraries have to pay more in areas where

living costs are higher. The Bureau of Labor Statistics prepares an index of

the cost of living for each of 39 metropolitan areas across the country.

     Compensation levels in occupations with similar skill levels may also

influence salary determination. On the one hand, in a competitive labor

market, the compensation in comparable occupations may reflect labor market

conditions and opportunities for library employees. In a collective bargaining

environment, levels of compensation in comparable occupations may serve a

pattern setting role. It is difficult to know what occupations might be

viewed as comparable, but independent of librarian salaries. Area Wage

Survey hourly earnings figures are used. The earnings of secretaries,

accountants, draftsmen, and computer operators were considered. Of these,

draftsmen proved to be available from the Area Wage Surveys for most cities.

The weekly earnings of draftsmen, normalized to a forty—hour week, and the

hours worked per week by draftsmen are used to indicate the earnings in the

local labor market.

     The metropolitan area might be viewed as the relevant labor market for

librarians. If the public library system employed a substantial proportion

of the librarians working in the metropolitan area, it might have some
                                                                             11



monopsony power in hiring. If the library recognized that it would have to

raise the earnings of all present workers in order to hire an additional

worker, it would have monopsony power. With monopsony power, the library

might choose to keep salary levels below what might be required to fill va-

cancies.

     Comparing the employment of professional librarians in the surveyed

systems with the number of librarians found in the metropolitan area in the

1970 census of population reveals that the systems on average employ about

11 percent of the librarians living in the metropolitan area. The inetropoli—

tan systems average over 17 percent. The highest figure is near 26 percent

in Indianapolis. Even 26 percent seems too small a proportion of the librarians

to give the public library significant monopsony power, and so, this hypothesis

is not explored further. Fairfax County, Virginia employs only about 2 per-

cent of the librarians living in the District of Columbia metropolitan area.

     Perhaps the most important opportunity for a library's professional

employees are other librarian positions. In the District of Columbia area,

the federal salary scale for librarians may have a substantial impact on

compensation levels of librarians in that metropolitan area either through
                                                                                  /



competition   in the market place or as a pattern setter in collective bargain-

ing. In other areas, the school systems may be the next largest employer

of librarians. Many school librarians, however, may not have masters de-

grees in library science, and so skill levels may not be strictly comparable.

Nevertheless, it might be appropriate to try to explore the relationship

between the average salary of recruit masters degree librarians elsewhere

in the metropolitan area with those of the public library. If public library

employee salaries were tied to the salary scale of the public school system,

the pattern of library salaries might be different than the present pattern.
                                                                               12




I have no information that there is such a link. No ready source of such de-

tailed   salary information is available, however, and so this hypothesis is
not   pursued.


Local Fiscal Circumstances

       The local government's fiscal circumstances may influence the salary

levels of public library employees, but the relationship may be complex. On

the one hand, higher levels of expenditures on other services might indicate

a greater willingness to support local government by taxpayers. Some cities

may be "big spenders" that buy more of all services and pay public employees

higher salaries. Perhaps the nature of the local political system encourages

expansion of activities.

       On the other hand, higher levels of spending on other services may reduce

the funds available for the library. If all the services feed from the same

public trough, more for police, education, and streets may mean less for the

library. The nature of the local political process and the interaction among

agencies competing for local tax dollars is too difficult to characterize to

make any detailed investigation possible. Per capita expenditures from local

sources on services other than libraries are related to library labor com—

pensation to make a small step in understanding the relationship of libraries

to the local fiscal scene. Own expenditures averaged $350 per capita in the

1972 census of governments in the areas surveyed.

       In addition to raising funds locally, local governments receive funds

from senior levels of government. Such intergovernmental transfers may

influence salary levels in public libraries. Higher levels of intergovern—

mental transfers might allow public library employees to be paid higher

salaries along with other public employees. Many intergovernmental transfers
                                                                              13




are tied to particular functions, and may impose a variety of restrictions

on their use. For example, state aid to education may require the matching

of local funds. A high level of such aid may induce a larger share of local

funds to go to education than would otherwise be the case. In this environment,

a high level of intergovernmental transfers——matching aid to education——may

cause library expenditures to be lower than otherwise. Some intergovernmental

transfers may be tied to library expenditures. Some states have per capita

grants to localities for the operation of public libraries. Such funds might

induce library expenditures to be higher, and allow libraries to pay higher

salaries. The census of governments does not provide detailed information

about the restrictions on intergovernmental aid, and so detailed hypotheses

about the role of intergovernmental transfers can not be explored very easily.

Nevertheless, per capita intergovernmental transfers are related to salaries.

Intergovernmental transfers averagd $178 per capita.

     Other features of local government might also have some impact on

salaries. Libraries that are autonomous may have more flexibility in salary

determination than libraries that are departments of city government, but

not necessarily. Libraries with earmarked taxes may have less interaction

with the rest of local government, and so may be immune from losses at the

expense of other agencies, but not necessarily. If the earmarked funds do

not provide the full cost of the library, the main shape of the library's

expenditures may come from the effort to seek incremental dollars from the

local general budget. The characterization of the local fiscal scene used

here is quite primitive.


Collective Bargaining

     The librarians in 13 of the 31 libraries interviewed are covered by
                                                                             14




collective bargaining agreements. Blue collar workers may be covered by

separate collective bargaining agreements, and somewhat more systems may

bargain with blue collar workers than with white collar workers. Collective

bargaining may allow workers to induce employers to pay higher levels of

compensation than would otherwise e the   case.
     The public library is frequently part of a city—wide bargaining unit

covering both clerical and profess:ionai employees. The library employees may

have no direct contact with library management in salary negotiations when

a city—wide labor contract is formed. Jobs in the library may be linked to

other city positions via job class:fication systems. The existence of col-

lective bargaining may forge those links. The salary levels in the library

may then largely be given to the library by the city. Civil service rules

may have something of the same affect even without collective bargaining.

     There have been few instances of job actions by library employees. In

general, the library employees seem less militant than police, fire fighters,

and teachers. The closing of the public libraries due to a strike poses less

threat to public health and safety than strikes by sanitation workers or

fire fighters. This fact may help explain both the lower profile of library

union activity and the formation of city—wide bargaining units. The threat

of a city—wide strike by white collar workers is more significant than the

threat of a library strike.


                              LABOR MARKET FINDINGS


     Some of the relationships among labor maiket variables are examined by

means of simple correlation coefficients as in Table 2. The correlations

among the three salaries are significantly positive. Libraries that pay high

salaries in one position, tend to be paying higher salaries across all

categories. Hours of work and the fringe benefit rate show only a weak asso-

ciation with salaries. All of the elements of compensation show a significant

correlation with the cost of living except the salary of librarians with five

years experience. Compensation rates to draftsmen in the metropolitan area,

and the presence of collective bargaining show expected strong correlations

with library compensation. The residency requirement and the percent of em-

ployment in the metropolitan area that is female show little correlation with

library compensation levels.

     Simple correlations are difficult to interpret because the correlations

may result from a variety of factors. For example, since collective bargaining

tends to be found in cities with high costs of living, the simple correlation

between salaries and cost of living may reflect in part the influence of col—

lective bargaining. It is more revealing to try to control all the separate

influences at once in order to isolate the affect of each given the others.

Therefore, the five elements of compensation are related to explanatory vari-

able in multiple regressions in Table 3.

     Some of the hypotheses discussed above are examined in the regressions.

The residency requirement shows no statistically significant relationship with

salaries, but does show the expected relationships with hours of work and

fringe benefits. Why the affect should be limited to the non—salary items

is unclear.

     Professionalism was predicted to be associated with lower salaries for

recruits and higher salaries for experienced librarians. The proportion of

public service employees who were professional librarians was included in the

regressions and showed no statistically significant relationship with any

of the elements of compensation and did not change either the coefficients of

the other variables or the overall explanatory power of the regressions very

much. There seems to be no support here for any professionalism impact on com-

pensation. The percent professional variable is excluded from the reported

regressions for two reasons. First, the percent professional may be viewed as

an endogenous variable. That is, the level of compensation of library em-

ployees may influence the proportion of employees who are professional as well

as the other way around; thus the direction of affect may be unclear. Second,

the sample size for the analysis is relatively small, and the inclusion of a

questionable variable reduces the number of degrees of freedom.

     The sex ratio of employment in the metropolitan area is generally unre-

lated to differences in the compensation of librarians, except for fringe

benefits. Fringe benefits are generally lower in libraries in areas with

more female relative to male workers. Why the affect should be limited to

fringe benefits is unclear. A better test of the hypothesis would use the

sex ratio of professional or white collar employment because such jobs are

more likely to be relevant to the decisions of librarians and their families.

     Conditions in the local labor market are indicated by the cost of living

index and by the weekly compensation of draftsmen. When other factors are

accounted for, the cost of living index is found to be associated with the

salaries paid recruit clerical workers, with hours of work and with fringe

benefits. The strongest affect is for fringe benefits. The $53.43 salary

increment for each point on the price index is somewhat less than a one per-

centage point increase in salary for the average recruit clerical worker.

The compensation of draftsmen is found to be related to the earnings of li-

brarians with five years experience; and the hours of draftsmen are related

to the hours of library white collar workers. Overall the compensation of li-

brary employees is not as strongly linked to local labor markets as might be

expected. Perhaps a more detailed characterization of librarian compensation
                                                                                19




in the area but other than in the public library would be important in ex-

plaining differentials in compensation paid by public libraries.

    The fiscal circumstances of the local government show no association with

compensation levels except for the salary of librarians with five years ex-

perience. Higher levels of both own expenditure and of intergovernmental aid

per capita are associated with lower salaries for experienced librarians.

There is no evidence that "big spender" cities spend more on libraries as well

as on other services, and spend more on salaries as well as in buying more

service. Rather the cities that spend more per capita on other services seem

to pay somewhat lower salaries to experienced librarians. This evidence is

consistent with Increases in spending on other services crowding the library

budget. In another essay, however, per capita library expenditures in 1972

were found to be positively associated with expenditures on other activities)0

The evidence on inter—function competition is not overwhelming.

     Intergovernmental transfers per capita also show a negative assoc:Lation

with salaries for experienced librarians just as they did with per capita

library expenditures. This result is consistent with restrictions on inter-

governmental aid on balance drawing funds away from library budgets and

salaries. Obviously more detailed information about intergovernmental trans-

fers and the limits on their use are necessary to test this hypothesis con-

clusively.

     Libraries with collective bargaining pay statistically significantly

higher salaries to recruit clerical workers and to experienced librarians.

No association is found with recruit librarian salaries and with hours or

fringe benefits. The impact of collective bargaining on clerical workers

may reflect the importance of city—wide bargaining for clerical workers.

The differential importance of collective bargaining for experienced librarians
                                                                                20




relative to recruits may reflect the fact that employees with more seniority

may carry more influence in bargaining than new workers who have no voice in

bargaining.

     The $1928.84 estimated collective bargaining differential for experienced

librarians amounts to 13.5 percent of the average salary of librarians with

five years experience. The $856.92 differential for recruit clerical workers

is about 12.4 percent of their average salary. If the $536.97 coefficient

for a recruit librarian were accepted as correct, even though it is not sta-

tistically significantly different than zero, it might be compared with the

mean salary for recruit librarians. It is about 4.6 percent of average re-

cruit salary. Thus collective bargaining seems to have yielded significant

gains in salary for certain categories of library employees.

     Overall, the explanatory power of the regressions is substantial. Only

the regression for the recruit librarian salaries is not statistically sig-

nificant overall. Factors other than those measured must be important in de-

termining the salaries of recruits. Perhaps the salaries paid recruit li—

brarianselsewhere in the metropolitan area are especially important for

this entry level position.


                                   SUMNARY


      Compensation levels of library employees vary across library systems in

ways that conform to expectations. Differences in labor market conditions and

 cost of living differences across areas are important. The fiscal circumstances

 of local government, while not observed in much detail, do bear some relation-

 ship to compensation levels. Collective bargaining is associated with higher

 salaries for both clerical workers and experienced librarians. These forces are

 important in shaping library costs and in inducing changes in library operations.

     'The expenditure information from libraries is from the author's survey.

The comparison of expenses across library systems may be a little misleading

because some library budgets exclude capital, maintenance, or fringe benefit

expenses.

     2Standards for library schools, first set in July, 1925 and revised in

1933 recognized both bachelors and masters degree programs in library science.

In 1951 the American Library Association adopted Standards for Accreditation

specifying that accredited librarianship programs would be at the masters

level. In 1975, there were 58 accredited schools in the United States and 7

in Canada. In addition there were about 316 other recognized training pro-

grams with course work short of the masters level       oriented primarily

toward state certification of school librarians. Encyclopedia of Library and

Information Science Vol. I (1968, Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York) p. 277.

     3Some persons who hold positions as librarians may have received training

in bachelors programs before the American Library Association specified that

only master's degree programs could be accredited. The Houston Public Library

reported a substantial number of bachelors degree librarians.
