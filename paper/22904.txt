                                         ABSTRACT

The distinct mission and open-access nature of community colleges and the diverse goals of the
students they serve make it difficult to assess differences in quality across community college
campuses. In this paper, we investigate institutional differences in both the extensive and
intensive margin of the transfer function across California's 108 community college campuses.
Importantly, due to the richness of our dataset, we are able to adjust our estimates for a host of
observed student differences, including scores on 11th grade math and English standardized tests.
Results show there is significant variation in community college quality for both the probability
of transfer as well as outcomes measuring how well students perform after transferring.
Additionally, we examine whether any observable characteristics of the community college are
significantly correlated with transfer productivity.

           Community colleges are the primary point of access to higher education for many

Americans. Over 40 percent of all undergraduates attend a community college (College

Board, 2014). In recent years, the Obama Administration has focused heavily on

community colleges as critical drivers in the effort to increase the supply of college

graduates in the U.S. Moreover, the push for free community colleges proposed by the

White House, modeled after programs such as the Tennessee Promise,1 has also captured

the attention of policymakers and the public at large.

           Despite a relatively rich literature on the community college pathway, the

research base on the quality differences between these institutions has been decidedly

thin. The distinct mission and open-access nature of community colleges and the diverse

goals of the students they serve make it difficult to assess differences in quality across

campuses. Many suggest it is too difficult to identify which outcomes should actually be

measured (Bailey, Calcagno, Jenkins, Leinbach, and Kienzl 2006). Nevertheless,

strengthening outcomes at community colleges has been a large part of the national

conversation about higher education accountability. Given the importance of the transfer

pathway, it is critical to better understand institutional determinants of transfer success.

Although several papers have explored the potential quality differences across

community colleges, to our knowledge, no paper has explored differences in institutional

quality in the preparation for transfer, tracking students from the two-year to the four-

year sector.

           In this paper, we investigate institutional differences in both the extensive and

intensive margin of the transfer function across California's 108 community college

campuses. Specifically, we start with the extensive margin as in Kurlaender, Carrell and

                                                                                               2
Jackson (2016) by examining whether some community college campuses are

significantly better (or worse) at producing students who transfer from the community

college to a four-year college. Next, we examine the intensive margin of the transfer

function by asking whether some community college campuses are better (or worse) at

preparing students once they transfer to a BA granting institution. Importantly, due to the

richness of our dataset, we are able to adjust our estimates for a host of observed student

differences and potential unobserved determinates that drive selection. Most notable is

the fact that our student-level college outcomes are linked to California high school

records, which include scores on 11th grade math and English standardized tests. We

are also able to control for unobservable differences that drive selection by controlling for

four-year college fixed effects.

       Additionally, we examine whether the community colleges, which are relatively

more (or less) productive on the extensive margin of the transfer function, are also those

colleges who are more (or less) productive on the intensive margin. Finally, we examine

whether any observable characteristics of the community college are significantly

correlated with transfer productivity.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section I we provide a brief

background, reviewing some of the prior work on the transfer function and on community

college quality; in Section II we describe the setting, data and methodological approach

we employ for this analysis, in Section III we describe the findings, in Section IV we

discuss mechanisms, and in Section V we conclude, providing a discussion of our

findings and offering policy implications.

I. BACKGROUND AND SETTING

Background

         The multiple missions and goals of community colleges have been well

documented in the academic literature (Bailey, Jaggars and Jenkins, 2015; Rosenbaum

2001; Dougherty 1994; Grubb 1991, 1996; Brint and Karabel 1983). The majority of

community college systems are balancing at least three goals: basic skills instruction,

career-technical education programs, and baccalaureate transfer pathways. Rising tuition,

admissions standards and capacity constraints have limited access at many four-year

universities making community colleges the primary pathway to a baccalaureate degree

for many students.

         The transfer function is one of the most important and scrutinized indicators of

community college success (Long and Kurlaender, 2008; Melguizo, Kienzl, and Alfonso,

2011). On the one hand, community colleges offer an open pathway to the BA for those

for whom a four-year BA granting institution may be out of reach (for financial,

academic, or other reasons). However, the greater flexibility in enrollment afforded by

community colleges (e.g. late entry, part-time, combining employment with schooling)

may be detrimental to a student’s academic progress, and lower their chances of

transferring to a four-year college (Grubb, 1991; Brint and Karabel, 1989; Dougherty,

1994).

         Much has been written about who utilizes the transfer route from community

colleges and about the individual determinants of transfer success. Several papers have

concluded that those who transfer from a community college to a four-year college are of




                                                                                            4
a higher social class, have higher academic preparation, are less likely to be minority, and

less likely to be female compared to the typical community college student (Gross and

Goldhaber 2009; Dougherty and Kienzl, 2006; Adelman, 2006; Lee and Frank, 1990;

Dougherty, 1987, 1994; Whitaker and Pascarella 1994; Grubb 1991). In fact, early work

on the community college transfer route found that the socioeconomic status of the

transfer group closely resembled the average social class of the original four-year college

group (Dougherty 1994). Students’ intent to transfer (Horn, 2009; Bradburn and Hurst

2001), need for developmental courses (Bettinger and Long 2009) and course enrollment

patterns while at community college (Doyle 2009; Roksa and Calcagno 2010) are also

key predictors of community college transfer. Among those who do transfer to four-year

institutions and complete their degrees, community college students attain similar if not

the same educational and occupational rewards (Melguizo and Dowd, 2008; Kane and

Rouse 1995; Whitaker and Pascarella, 1994).

       Far less is known about institutional differences in transfer success, specifically

quality differences in the preparation community colleges offer students that transfer to

BA-granting institutions. In a prior paper, we investigated institutional quality differences

among community colleges and find meaningful differences in student outcomes across

California’s community colleges. For example, after adjusting for differences in student

inputs, our lower bound estimates show that going from the 10th to 90th percentile of

campus quality is associated with a 3.32 (34.3 percent) increase in student transfer units

earned, a 0.07 (9.6 percent) increase in the probability of persisting to year two at the

community college, a 0.09 (40.7 percent) increase in the probability of transferring to a




                                                                                             5
four-year college, and a 0.08 (27.1 percent) increase in the probability of completion of a

two-year degree (Kurlaender, Carrell, and Jackson 2016).

       Clotfelter and colleagues (2013) explored variation in success measures across

North Carolina’s 58 community colleges, and find that conditional on student differences,

colleges were largely indistinguishable from one another in degree receipt or transfer

coursework, save for the differences between the very top and very bottom performing

colleges (Clotfelter, Ladd, Muschkin, and Vigdor 2013). Similarly, Cunha and Miller

(2014) examine institutional differences in student outcomes across Texas's 30 traditional

four-year public colleges. Their results show that controlling for student background

characteristics (e.g., race, gender, free lunch, SAT score, etc.), the quality of high school

attended, and application behavior significantly reduces the mean differences in average

earned income, persistence and graduation across four-year college campuses.

       Several other papers have also looked at the role of different institutional inputs as

proxies for institutional quality. In particular, Stange (2012) exploits differences in

instructional expenditures per student across community colleges and finds no impact on

student attainment (degree receipt or transfer). Calcagno and colleagues (2008) identify

several institutional characteristics that influence student outcomes: larger enrollment,

more minority students, and more part-time faculty are associated with lower degree

attainment and lower 4-year transfer rates (Calcagno, Bailey, Jenkins, Kienzl, and

Leinbach, 2008).

II. RESEARCH DESIGN

Setting

California is home to the largest public higher education system in the nation. The 1960

Master Plan articulated the distinct functions of each of the State’s three public

postsecondary segments. The University of California (UC) is designated to as the state’s

primary academic research institution and is reserved for the top one eighth of the State’s

graduating high school class. The California State University (CSU) is primarily to serve

the top one-third of California’s high school graduating class in undergraduate training,

and graduate training through the master’s degree, focusing primarily on professional

training such as teacher education. Finally, the California Community Colleges are to

provide sub-baccalaureate instruction for students through the first two years of

undergraduate education (lower division), as well as provide vocational instruction,

remedial instruction, English as a Second Language courses, adult noncredit instruction,

community service courses, and workforce training services.

          Although the vision of the Master Plan and its legacy have been heavily debated

among scholars and policymakers, the result is that the state has invested heavily in its

postsecondary schooling systems, and today, 84% of California postsecondary students

attend a public two-year or four-year college. In addition to building coherence across

the State’s public higher education institutions, the Master Plan is also often applauded

for strengthening the importance of universal access to postsecondary schooling through

the community colleges. Two-thirds of all college students attend a community college

in California; in 2015 the Community College system served over 2.1 million students




                                                                                            7
across 113 colleges, representing 20 percent of the nation’s community college students.

Students enrolled at community colleges represent enormous diversity in their

backgrounds and educational goals; however, the far majority of community college

enrollees intend to transfer to a four-year BA granting institution.

        A central component of California’s Master Plan is the articulation of transfer

pathways from the community colleges to the state’s BA-granting institutions though

specific general education coursework. This was recently strengthened through

California’s Senate Bill 1440 knows as the Student Transfer Achievement Reform Act,

which further reinforced articulation between the California Community Colleges and the

California State University. The legislation required the community colleges to

collaborate with the CSU to develop specific Associate Degrees for Transfer based on

specified general education and lower division coursework at the community colleges to

translate to junior standing at the CSU upon transfer. The primary goal of the legislation

was to reduce unnecessary course taking and shorten time to degree.

        The architects of the Master Plan for Higher Education envisioned an efficient

process for students who start their postsecondary schooling at a community college to

obtain a baccalaureate degree. Researchers, higher education leaders, and state

policymakers alike have discussed and debated the community college transfer function

for over half a century. Much of these discussions have focused on the importance of the

transfer pathway for ensuring access, given capacity constraints at four-year institutions

(Hill, 2006). However, to date, we know very little about how institutions fare in meeting

their transfer function role.




                                                                                             8
        The California Community College Chancellor’s Office calculates transfer rates

for first time freshmen enrolled at community colleges based on two criteria: (1) 12 units

earned and (2) attempt of a transfer level math or English course. Based on this

definition, the transfer rates within five years of entry at a California community college

are about 41% systemwide and vary widely from college to college.2 Other estimates are

much lower and suggest that only 26 percent (Sengupta and Jepsen, 2006), or even 18

percent (Shulock and Moore, 2007) succeed in transferring to a four-year university or

earn an associate’s degree within six years. Horn and Lew (2007) compare California

community college transfer rates across different denominators that define transfer

seeking, and find very similar rates. Transfer rates also vary considerably by

race/ethnicity. The raw gap in transfer rates between Hispanics and whites is 11.8

percentage points and between African Americans and whites 7.7 percentage points

(CCCCO, 2011). National statistics—albeit somewhat dated—on the racial/ethnic gaps in

transfer rates among BA intending students that are enrolled in 12 or more credit hours is

only five percentage points between whites and African Americans and non-existent

between whites and Hispanics (Bradburn and Hurst, 2001).

        The community college students in California that do successfully transfer to a

four-year college, overwhelmingly (about 80 percent) enroll at one of the campuses of the

California State University (CSU) system. The 23-campus CSU system is the largest

public four-year higher education system in the country, educating about 1 in 10

California high school graduates, roughly 5.5 percent of the undergraduates enrolled in

                                                                                               9
public four-year colleges in the entire nation.3 The CSU system enrolls the largest

majority of California community college transfer students. Among those that transfer

nearly 90 percent apply to only one CSU, and 80 percent enroll in the CSU that is closest

to their community college (home).

       California is an ideal state in which to investigate institutional differences at

community colleges because of the large number of institutions present. Moreover,

articulation between the public two-year and broad access four-year colleges offers a

unique opportunity to explore the transfer route more directly. California’s public two-

year and four-year colleges are situated in urban, suburban and rural areas of the state,

and their students come from public high schools that are both among the best and the

worst in the nation. Thus, the diversity of California’s community college population

reflects the student populations of other states in the U.S. and the mainstream public two-

year colleges that educate them. As such, we believe that other states can learn important

lessons from California’s public postsecondary institutions.



Data

       To explore institutional differences between community colleges in their transfer

role, as well as BA completion, we constructed two administrative datasets that linked

cohorts of California high school juniors to both the California Community College and

the California State University campus they attended. These data were provided by the




3 This calculation is based on a published CSU enrollment of 437,000 students

(http://www.calstate.edu/pa/2013Facts/documents/facts2013.pdf) and enrollment of 7.9 million

(http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013008.pdf).


                                                                                            10
California Community College Chancellor’s Office, the California State University

Chancellor’s Office, and the California Department of Education.

         First, to examine the extensive margin of the transfer function (the probability of

transferring to a four-year college), we linked all transcript and completion data for four

first time freshmen fall-semester cohorts (2004-2008) age 17-19, enrolled at a California

community college with the census of California 11th grade students with standardized

test score data. The match, performed on name and birth date, high school attended, and

cohort, initially captured 69 percent of first-time freshmen age 17-19 enrolled at a

California community college (consistent with similar studies conducted by the

California Community College Chancellor’s Office matched to K-12 data).4

         We restrict the sample for our study to first time freshman at the community

college, of traditional age. We built cohorts of students who started in the summer or fall

within one year of graduating high school, who attempted more than two courses (six

units) in their first year, and had complete high school test and demographic information.

This sample contains 389,187 students across 108 California community college

campuses.5

         Second, to examine the intensive margin of the transfer function (how well

students perform after transferring to a four-year college), we linked transcript level

records of four cohorts (2005-2008) of California State University students who had


4
  Our match rates may be the result of several considerations. First, the name match occurred on the first
three letters of a student’s first name and last name, leading to many duplicates. Students may have entered
different name or birthday at the community college. Students may have omitted information at either
system. Second, the denominator may also be too high; not all community college students attended
California high schools. Finally, students who did attend a California high school, but did not take the 11th
grade standardized tests were not included in the high school data.

  We excluded the three campuses that use the quarter system, as well as three adult education campuses.
Summer students were only allowed in the sample if they took enough units in their first year to guarantee
they also took units in the fall.


                                                                                                          11
transferred from a California Community College to their California High School records

provided by the California Department of Education. Similar to the Community College

data match, we linked the data on name, birth date, and gender. Using these identifiers

we were able to successfully match 70% of all CSU transfers. Importantly, these data

from the CSU system record whether the student transferred from a California

Community College (CCC) and from which campus specifically. Additionally, these

data include information on academic performance (GPA), persistence at the CSU,

graduation, and time to degree.



Measures

       To examine institutional differences across community colleges in transfer and

BA completion, we use multiple outcome measures. First, we with start with the

extensive margin by examining the probability that a student transfers from a California

Community College to any four-year college. Using National Student Clearinghouse

data provided by the CCC Chancellor’s office and linked to their own data records, we

are able to tell whether a student transferred to a four-year college at any point after

attending a California community college. As shown in Table 1, 27 percent of first time

freshman at a CCC eventually transfer to a four-year school. We then split this outcome

by whether the student transferred to a CSU campus or a University of California

campus.

       To examine the intensive margin of the transfer function, we next focus on what

happens to students once they transfer to the CSU. We focus on the CSU because 52

percent of students in our sample, who transfer to a BA granting institution, transfer to




                                                                                            12
one of the twenty-three CSU campuses, while only 15 percent transfer to one of the nine

UC campuses. Specifically, we measure first-term GPA, persistence rates to year two,

BA degree completion, and time to degree as measured by the probability of graduating

within two or three years of transfer. Tables 1 & 2 show summary statistics for these key

outcome measures at the individual and college level. The average transfer student earns

a 2.78 GPA during their first term at the CSU (on a 0 to 4 point scale). A vast majority of

transfer students persist to the second year at CSU, with persistence rates over 90 percent

in our sample. Graduation rates among transfer students are relatively high at 71 percent.

Finally, the average time to degree in our sample is just over three years while 34% and

71% of students graduate within two and three years of transfer, respectively.

       Our data are unique in that we have the ability to connect a student’s performance

and outcomes at the community college and CSU with their high school data. As

community colleges are open access, students do not submit transcripts from their high

school, and have not necessarily taken college entrance exams such as the SAT or ACT

to enter. As a result, community colleges often know very little about their students’

prior educational backgrounds. Researchers interested in understanding the community

college population often face the same constraints. Examining the outcomes of

community colleges without considering the educational backgrounds of the students

enrolling in that college may confound college effects with students’ self-selection.

Likewise, students who transfer to the CSU are also not required to take the ACT or SAT.

       To address these selection issues, we are able to adjust our estimates of quality by

including, first, important background information about a student’s high school

academic performance. We measure a student’s performance on the 11th grade English




                                                                                         13
and mathematics California Standardized Tests (CSTs).6 We are also able to determine

which math course a student took in 11th grade. In addition, we measure race/ethnicity,

gender, and parental income.7 To account for high school quality, we include the

Academic Performance Index (API) of the high school attended (California’s school

accountability metric). Importantly, as students are enrolling in community college, they

are asked about their goals for attending community college. Students can pick from an

extensive list of 15 choices, including: transfer with an associate’s degree, transfer

without an associate’s degree, vocation certification, discover interests, improve basic

skills, undecided, and others. We include students’ self reported goals as an additional

covariate for their postsecondary degree intentions. Lastly, we add additional controls for

college-level means of our individual characteristics (eleventh grade CST math and

English scores, race/ethnicity, gender, parental income, API, and student goal). Table 1

includes descriptive statistics on all of our measures at the individual level and Table 2

includes descriptive statistics at the college level.8



Empirical Methods

         We begin by visually examining the raw outcome measures across the community

colleges in our sample. Figure 1 presents the distribution of Proportion Transfer from

  We include CST scaled scores, which are approximately normally distributed across the state.
7 Our community college dataset contains information regarding whether the student was eligible for
free and reduced priced lunch. Our CSU data file contains self-reported parental income measures.
8
  Unlike the four-year college quality literature, we do not account for students’ college choice set since
most community college students enroll in the school closest to where they attended high school. Using
nationally representative data, Stange (2012) finds that in contrast to four-year college students, community
college students do not appear to travel farther in search of higher quality campuses, and, importantly,
“conditional on attending a school other than the closest one, there does not appear to be a relationship
between student characteristics, school characteristics, and distance traveled among community college
students,” (Stange 2012: p. 81).



                                                                                                          14
CC, first-term GPA at CSU, Proportion Persisting to Year 2 at the CSU, Proportions

Completing a BA, and Time to Degree across the 108 community colleges. This figure

shows considerable variation across community college campuses in four of the five

outcomes. The one exception is persistence to year 2 at the CSU, where a vast majority

(95%) of students persist to year two. To further examine the amount of variation in the

four post-transfer CSU outcomes (first term GPA, persistence, graduation, and time to

degree), in Figures 2 we plot the variation in these outcomes by community college

campus and CSU campus. Each CSU (receiving institution) is plotted along the X-axis

with the corresponding sending community colleges plotted by size. These figures show

two important facts. First, within each of the 23 CSU campuses, students transfer from

many different community colleges. Specifically, the average CSU campus in our

sample period received transfer students from 79 different CCCs. Second, there is

considerable variation in the average outcomes across these community colleges from

which the students transfer within each CSU campus.

       Although there appears to be considerable variation in average outcomes within

CSUs and across CCC's, we note that our figures are unadjusted by student inputs.

Therefore, to motivate the importance of accounting for student inputs, we next plot each

outcome against students’ eleventh grade math test scores at the college level (Figures 3).

From these simple scatterplots it is clear that higher average student test scores are

associated with better average CSU outcomes among transfer students, save for

persistence. We also note that there is considerable variation in the average outcomes for

students with similar high school test scores across the community colleges.




                                                                                         15
        To examine whether there are significant causal differences in the extensive

transfer margin (i.e., the probability of transfer) across community college campuses, we

start by estimating the following linear random effects model as in Kurlaender, Carrell,

and Jackson (2016):

              𝑌𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! 𝑥𝑖 + 𝛽! 𝑥𝑐𝑦 + 𝛽! 𝑤𝑠 + 𝜆𝑡 + 𝜙𝑦 + 𝜁𝑐 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦               (1)

where 𝑌𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦 is our outcome variables of interest (transfer to any four-year institutions,

transfer to a CSU, or transfer to a UC) for individual i, from high school s, who is a first-

time freshman enrolled at community college c, in term t in year y; 𝑥𝑖 is a vector of

individual-level characteristics (race/ethnicity, gender, parental education, and eleventh

grade math and English language arts test scores), 𝑥𝑐𝑦 are community college by cohort

means of 𝑥𝑖 , and 𝑤𝑠 is a measure of the quality of the high school attended (California’s

API score)9 for each individual; and 𝜀𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦 is the individual-level error term.

        The main parameter of interest is the community college random effect, 𝜁𝑐 .10 We

estimate 𝜁𝑐 using an empirical Bayes shrinkage estimator to adjust for reliability. The

empirical Bayes estimates are best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) of each

community college’s value added, which takes into account the variance (signal to noise)

and the number of observations (students) at each college campus. Estimates of 𝜁𝑐 with a

higher variance and a fewer number of observations are shrunk towards zero (Rabe-

Hesketh and Skrondal 2008).


9
  The Academic Performance Index (API) is a measure of California schools’ academic performance and
growth. It is the chief component of California’s Public Schools Accountability Act, passed in 1999. API is
composed of schools’ state standardized test scores and results on the California High School Exit Exam;
scores range from a low of 200 to a high of 1000.
10
   We use a random effects model instead of fixed effects model due to the efficiency (minimum variance)
of the random effects model. However, our findings are qualitatively similar when using a fixed effects
framework.


                                                                                                        16
       The empirical Bayes technique is commonly used in measuring the quality of

hospitals (Dimick, Staiger and Birkmeyer 2010), schools or neighborhoods (Altonji and

Mansfield 2014), and teachers (Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger 2008; Carrell and West 2010).

In particular, we use methodologies similar to those recently used in the literature to rank

hospital quality, which shows the importance of adjusting mortality rates for patient risk

(Parker et al. 2006) and statistical reliability (caseload size) (Dimick, Staiger, and

Burkmeir 2019). In our context, we similarly adjust our college rankings for “student

risk" (student preparation, high school quality, and unobserved determinants of selection)

as well as potential noise in our estimates driven by differences in campus size and

student population.

       Next, to examine whether there are significant differences in the intensive transfer

margin (i.e., how well students perform after transfer) across the cross community

college campuses, we estimate the slightly modified linear random effects model to

account for selection into the CSU:

         𝑌𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦𝑢 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! 𝑥𝑖 + 𝛽! 𝑥𝑐𝑦 + 𝛽! 𝑤𝑠 + 𝜆𝑡 + 𝜙𝑦 + 𝜁𝑐 + 𝜎𝑢 + 𝜀𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦𝑢      (2)

where 𝑌𝑖𝑠𝑐𝑡𝑦𝑢 are the post-transfer outcome variables of interest (first term GPA,

persistence, graduation, and time to degree) for individual i, from high school s, who is a

first-time freshman enrolled at community college c, in term t in year y at CSU campus u.

All other variables in the model are the same as in equation (2) and 𝜎𝑢 are CSU campus

fixed effects. Importantly, the CSU fixed effects controls for all unobserved (fixed)

variation at the CSU campus level, for example, professor experience and teaching

quality, level of support services, and other unobservable differences across the CSU

campuses that influence post-transfer outcomes. Importantly, the CSU fixed effects also



                                                                                         17
control for individual unobservable differences that drive selection into college selection

and choice.



III. RESULTS

Extensive Margin Transfer Outcomes

       We start by examining whether there are significant differences across community

colleges in the probability of transferring to a four-year college as in Kurlaender, Carrell,

and Jackson (2016). To do so, we examine whether there is significant variation in our

estimates of 𝜁𝑐 ’s for our three transfer outcomes of interest. Table 3 presents results of

the estimated standard deviation, 𝜎𝜁 , in our college effects for various specifications of

equation (1). High values of 𝜎𝜁 indicate there is significant variation in the probability

of transferring across community college campuses, while low values of 𝜎𝜁 would

indicate that there is little difference in student transfer outcomes across campuses.

       In Specification 1, we start with the most naïve estimates where we include only

year and term indicator variables. Results show that a one-standard deviation change in

campus quality associated with a 0.072 percentage point increase in the probability

transfer. This effect is quite large, representing a 27% increase from the mean in the

probability of transfer. However, these unadjusted estimates are analogous to comparing

simple means in student transfer rates across college campuses and likely overstate the

true value-added of college campuses.

       To adjust our estimates for differences in student-level inputs in Specifications 2 -

4 of Table 3 we sequentially adjust our estimates of 𝜁𝑐 for a host of student-level

covariates. This procedure is similar to the hospital quality literature that calculates risk


                                                                                              18
adjusted mortality rates (Dimick, Staiger and Birkmeyer 2010). Importantly, starting in

Specification 2, we include scores from the 11th grade California State Test (CST).

Doing so likely removes a significant amount of potential bias in our estimates as the

teacher quality literature has previously shown that teacher value-added estimates are

unbiased when conditioning on prior year test scores (Kane & Staiger, 2008). In

Specification 3 we add individual-level demographic characteristics (race/ethnicity,

gender, and parental income level). In Specification 4 we control for the student's goal for

attending community college. In Specification 5 we add California's API scores for each

student's high school to control for differences in high school quality.

        Results in Specifications 2-5 indicate that even after controlling for student level

observable characteristics there is considerable variation in transfer rates across

California's community colleges. For Specification 5, a one-standard deviation increase

in community college quality is associated with a 0.039 percentage point (14.4%)

increase in the probability of transferring to a four-year college.

        In Specification 4 we add campus by cohort means of our various individual

demographic variables to address concerns with selection on unobservables (Altonji,

Elder, and Tabor 2005) as suggested Altonji and Masfield (2014), and to control for

differences in peer quality, which has been shown to affect transfer outcomes (Smith and

Stange, 2016). Doing so likely provides a lower bound of the estimated variance in the

campus quality effects.11 In this fully specified model, our estimate remains unchanged




11
  Altonji and Mansfield (2014) show that, under reasonable assumptions, controlling for group means of
individual-level characteristics “also controls for all of the across-group variation in the unobservable
individual characteristics.” This procedure provides a lower bound of the school quality effects because
school quality is likely an unobservable that drives individual selection.


                                                                                                        19
with a one standard deviation increase in campus quality associated with a 0.039

percentage point (14.4-percent) increase in the probability of transferring.

       In Columns 2 and 3 we present results when we split the outcome by whether the

student transferred to a CSU campus or a University of California campus. Results show

substantially higher variation across community college campuses in the probability of

transferring to a CSU compared to a UC. Specifically, in our fully specified model, a one

standard deviation in the community college effect is associated with a 2.7 percentage

point increase in the probability of transferring to a CSU and a 1.8 percentage point

increase in the probability of transferring to a UC.



Intensive Margin Transfer Outcomes

The previous results show significant variation across community college campuses in

the probability of transferring to a BA granting institution. However, a natural follow-up

question is whether some campuses produce students who perform better once they

transfer? This question is analogous to the recent teacher quality literature that examines

how teachers affect both contemporaneous academic achievement as well as longer term

outcomes, such as later academic performance and labor market outcomes (Chetty, et. al,

2014; Carrell & West, 2010). To answer this question, we next present results for our

intensive margin outcomes that measure first-term GPA at the CSU, persistence to year 2

at the CSU, BA degree receipt, and time to degree as measured by the probability of

graduating within two or three years at the CSU. As previously discussed, to overcome

selection issues in college choice, we include CSU fixed effects in all our specifications,

with results presented in Table 4.




                                                                                         20
           Analogous to our previously presented results, we start with a naive model that

includes only year and term effects and well as CSU campus fixed effects. We then

sequentially add control variables to the model. While the addition of control variables

reduces the variation in the campus effects, significant variation in outcomes across

community college campuses persist. Results for the fully specified model (Specification

5) show that a one standard deviation increase in community college campus quality is

associated with a 0.066 (2.3 percent) increase in first-term GPA at the CSU, a 0.009

percentage point (1 percent) increase in the probability of persisting to year two, a 0.025

percentage point (3.6 percent) increase in the probability of BA completion, and a 0.028

percentage point (8.2 percent) increase in the probability of graduating within two years

of transfer and a 2.3 percentage point (3.2 percent) increase in the probability of

graduating within three years of transfer.



IV. MECHANISMS

Understanding why some colleges are more successful than others in the transfer function

(or in other outcomes) is of critical importance, and one that has captured the recent

attention of higher education leaders in discussions about college quality prompted, in

part, by the U.S. Department of Education’s College Scorecard.12 Although there are

many factors that may influence productivity, we explore this question by regressing the

community college campus effects (BLUPs) that we estimate in Tables 3 and 4 on

observable characteristics of the community college. Specifically, we explore whether

the following attributes at the community college are correlated with the effectiveness of

the college's transfer function outcomes: 1) tenured to adjunct faculty ratio, 2) female to

12   See: https://collegescorecard.ed.gov


                                                                                             21
male faculty ratio, 3) faculty to student ratio, 4) support staff to student ratio, 5) faculty

experience, 6) distance to the nearest CSU, 7) school size, and 8) the fraction

degrees/certificates conferred that are vocational (career technical) education.13

        Although we cannot claim the causality of the estimates, results show suggestive

evidence that community colleges that are closer to a CSU, larger in size, have more

female faculty, and have a lower fraction of students pursuing vocational education

degrees are associated with better student transfer outcomes (Table 5).

        For example, a one-mile increase in the distance to the CSU is correlated with a -

0.02 percentage point decrease the probability of graduation (p=0.052). Likewise, a

1,000 student (0.18 standard deviations) increase in the size of the community college is

associated with significant increases in first term GPA (0.37 grade points), persistence to

year two (0.03 percentage points), and graduating with a BA (0.08 percentage points).

        As previously discussed, community colleges often have multiple missions. As

such, it is not surprising that we find a negative correlation between our campus effect

measuring the probability of transfer and the fraction of degrees and certificates conferred

that are vocational. Specifically, we find that a one-percentage point increase in the

fraction of vocationally oriented degrees/certificates awarded is associated with a nearly

9-percentage point decrease in the probability of transferring.

        Finally, faculty characteristics appear to be potentially related to student

outcomes. Although imprecisely estimated, results show that a 0.10 point increase in the

female to male faculty ratio is associated with a 0.42 increase in GPA (p=0.14) and a

0.016 percentage point increase in the probability of graduating within two years of

13We also examined financial indicators such as faculty salaries and institutional spending; however,
these data were only available for a subset of our colleges (67 of 108). Within this subset of schools,
we found no significant correlations between our estimated college effects and financial indicators.


                                                                                                    22
transfer (p=0.17). Several experimental and quasi-experimental studies have explored

specific faculty characteristics and institutional practices and programs, and their impact

on persistence and degree attainment. Studies exploring faculty characteristics have

shown that professor gender, race/ethnicity, rank, education, and experience can

significantly influence course performance, choice of major, and graduation (Carrell &

West, 2010; Carrell, Page, & West, 2010; Fairlie, Hoffman, & Oreopoulos, 2013;

Hoffman & Oreopoulos, 2009). However, it is unclear exactly why professor

characteristics are correlated with student achievement.

           A natural follow-up question is whether the community colleges that are

relatively successful (or unsuccessful) in having their students transfer to a four-year

college are the same community colleges that produce students who are relatively

successful (or unsuccessful) at the four-year college after transferring? To explore this

relationship, in Figure 5, we plot each community college's extensive margin effects

against their intensive margin effects.14 The pattern of results suggests that there is a

small positive relationship between the probability of transfer and student performance

after transfer. That is, the community colleges that are more (or less) successful at

producing students who transfer to a four-year college also produce students who tend to

perform better (or worse) after transferring (in terms of GPA, graduation, and time to

degree).



V. CONCLUSION




14   We plot the Best Linear Unbiased Predictors (BLUPs) of each community college's random effects.


                                                                                                  23
        To our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to examine how

institutional differences across community colleges affect both the extensive and

intensive margin of the transfer function. Results show there is significant variation in

community college quality for both the probability of transfer as well as outcomes

measuring how well students perform after transferring.

        Overall, our results show significant differences across community colleges in

both the intensive and extensive margin of the transfer function. Specifically, after

adjusting for observable student differences and unobservable factors that drive selection,

we find that some community colleges are relatively more (or less) efficient in producing

students who are more likely to transfer and to achieve at a higher level at their post-

transfer institutions.

        There is a small positive relationship between the extensive and intensive margin

outcomes, indicating that the schools that are better at producing students who transfer

also produces students who, on average, perform equally or better at their four-year

institutions, post-transfer. We find some evidence that observable characteristics of the

community colleges are correlated with transfer productivity. Specifically, larger

community colleges, colleges closer to a CSU and colleges with more female faculty are

associated with more positive transfer outcome. (In ongoing work we also examine

productivity by student type: academic preparation, income and race.)

        Of course there may be a host of factors we don’t observe that make some of

these institutions more effective at the transfer function than others. The transfer process

is complex and navigating it successfully requires an understanding of the requirements

to do so—at two different institutions (i.e. the sending community college and the




                                                                                            24
receiving CSU). Thus, it is likely that colleges vary greatly in their ability to direct

students along this pathway (for example, through improved information, counseling,

course articulation, or even scheduling).

       To date, much of the research on college quality has focused largely on more

selective four-year colleges and universities. Yet, the increased policy focus on

community colleges demands careful attention to quality differences among these open-

access institutions, particularly in facilitating transfer and degree completion. In this

paper we leverage rich administrative data from two of the largest public higher

education systems to investigate institutional quality differences across community

colleges in their efforts to prepare and pave the road for transfer students in pursuit of the

BA.
