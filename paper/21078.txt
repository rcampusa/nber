A defining characteristic of charter schools is that they introduce a strong market element into public
education. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the charter school sector in North Carolina between
1999 and 2012 through the lens of a market model. We examine trends in the mix of students enrolled
in charter schools, the racial imbalance of charter schools, the quality of the match between parental
preferences in charter schools relative to the quality of match in traditional public schools, and the
distribution of test score performance across charter schools relative those in traditional public schools
serving similar students over time. Taken together, our findings imply that the charter schools in North
Carolina are increasingly serving the interests of relatively able white students in racially imbalanced
schools.

I. Introduction

       Since their birth in Minnesota in the early 1990s, charter schools have represented a

growing component of the K-12 education policy landscape in many U.S. states. Such schools

share features of both public and private schools. In return for public funding they are not

allowed to charge tuition, must admit students through a lottery if they are oversubscribed, and

are subject to the same accountability standards as regular public schools. They are similar to

private schools in that they are operated by nongovernmental entities, are relieved of many

restrictions on their use of inputs, and are schools of choice in that no students are assigned to

attend them. In contrast to private schools, they require a charter to operate that is subject to

periodic state-mandated review.

       The right to establish charter schools, where it exists, is based on state, not federal,

legislation. As a result of different charter school laws and educational contexts across states,

charter schools have proliferated at different rates in different states and with different

consequences. As of 2013, more than 40 states had at least one charter school, with California

having more than 1000, and Arizona and Florida each having more than 500. 1 North Carolina,

which is the subject of this study, ranked 14th in 2013 with its 107 charter schools.

       A defining characteristic of charter schools is that they introduce a strong market element

into public education. In a standard private sector market with differentiated products, new firms

enter a market in response to profit-making opportunities. Over time, the firms that are well run

and that satisfy consumer preferences will tend to expand or be replicated while those that are

less successful—perhaps because they are not well managed or because they misjudged the

                                                  1
nature of the demand—will not attract and keep customers and consequently have to go out of

business. As a result of this Darwinian process of entry and exit, one would predict that the firms

that survive in a newly established market space would, as a group, become more successful over

time in delivering what customers want. If we apply this reasoning to the market for schooling,

more choice should produce a better educational fit between what schools offer and what parents

want for their children and ultimately lead to better outcomes, at least in terms of the outcome

most widely valued and readily measured, standardized test scores.

       In this paper, we examine the extent to which a similar market process has emerged in the

charter school sector in North Carolina, an examination that builds on similar research by Baude

et al. (2014) in Texas. In doing so, we take careful note of some significant features of the

charter school sector. For example, while entry into the sector is far freer for charter schools

than for traditional public schools, entry is still constrained by the requirement that each charter

school must first obtain a charter from the state. Thus, state policies toward charters, including

the procedures of the chartering agency or agencies, are likely to influence how the market

evolves. Another relevant feature—one that emerges clearly from extensive prior research on

parental choice of school in a variety of contexts and one that applies to traditional public

schools as well—is that in choosing schools, parents care not only about the quality of the

education being offered but also about the mix of students in a school. This feature means the

market will be subject to externalities, in the sense that the decisions of some parents affect the

value of schooling available to others. In addition, this feature and other considerations are likely

to affect who benefits and who loses from the introduction of market forces in education.

Because schooling is so important to the life chances of children, this attention to winners and

losers has considerable policy significance. Thus an evaluation of the charter school sector

                                                  2
requires close attention to whether the charter school sector serves the needs of those who are not

well served by the traditional public school sector.

       This paper proceeds as follows. In section II, we describe the charter school context in

North Carolina, and provide descriptive information on the sector’s growth over time. In section

III we explore the extent to which charter schools appear to be satisfying the preferences of the

families who enroll their children in them, with attention to whose preferences are being

satisfied. In section IV, we use value-added models to compare the distribution of test score

gains in charter schools to the distribution of gains for comparable students in the larger public

school sector, and in sections V and VI we explore possible explanations for those trends.

Although most of the analysis in the paper is descriptive, we provide some plausibly causal

estimates of charter school effects in section VI. In Section VII, we conclude.

       Except where noted, all the data in this paper come from the North Carolina Education

Research Data Center (NCERDC). The center provides data from the NC Department of Public

Instruction on all students in the state on a confidential basis to researchers. All identifying

information has been removed.

II. North Carolina Context and Charter School Trends

       When Republicans in North Carolina first raised the possibility of charter school

legislation in the mid-1990s, advocates for poor and minority students were strongly opposed.

This opposition may have reflected the state’s historical experience with school choice during

the 1960s when “freedom academies” were established to provide a way for white students to

avoid integrated schools (Myers 2004). Eventually Democrats agreed to support charter school

enabling legislation out of concern that the alternative form of choice being pushed by

Republicans, vouchers for private schools, would be even more detrimental to the interests of

                                                  3
disadvantaged students.2 Thus the state’s 1996 charter school enabling legislation was a

compromise solution to the politically contentious issue of parental choice and its racial

implications. This brief historical context helps to explain the significant differences between the

charter school movement in southern states such as North Carolina and northern states such as

Massachusetts and Michigan, where debates about charters focused less on race and more on

unions, accountability, and the use of charters as a mechanism for helping the poor (Bettinger,

2005, Fuller et al. 1996).

        The original North Carolina legislation specified goals related to student learning,

teachers, and parents. The first two goals were to improve student learning and to increase

learning opportunities especially for students at risk of academic failure or academically gifted.

The next two were to encourage new teaching methods and to create new professional

opportunities for teachers. Another was to give parents more choice of schooling options. Finally

the legislation made it clear that charters were to be held accountable for measurable student

achievement results. Of primary interest for this study is the role of parental choice and the focus

on measurable student learning.

        The original legislation explicitly stated that charter schools could not discriminate on the

basis of race or ethnicity. In addition, the legislation stated that within a year of opening, the

population of the school “shall reasonably reflect” the racial and ethnic mix of the community in




2
  A charter school bill was initially introduced in the House by a Republican and in the Senate by a
Democrat in 1995 but it failed to pass. The following year the North Carolina Family Policy Council
worked closely with the original sponsors to draft a compromise proposal that passed in 1996. For a brief
legislative history of charter schools, see article by Will Schultz of the North Carolina History Project,
10/26/14.

                                                    4
which it is located.3 Further, the State Board of Education was encouraged to give preference to

applications that demonstrated the capability of serving students at risk of academic failure (GS

115C-238-29D). It also required charter school operators to develop a transportation plan so that

transportation would not be a barrier to any student who lived within the district of the charter

school. In return for public funding, the charter schools were not allowed to charge tuition or

fees, but they were permitted to raise funds from other sources.

       The 1996 law gave state officials somewhat more control over the establishment of

charter schools than was the case in other states (Bifulco and Ladd, 2006 and 2007). The ultimate

authorizing power for all charters was given to the State Board of Education. The number of

charter schools statewide was capped at 100, no more than five charters could be authorized in a

single district in any one year, and local districts were given the opportunity to provide input

before charter applications were approved. In other ways the legislation was relatively

permissive in that it allowed any group or individual to apply for a charter and to operate as an

independent nonprofit corporation with far more autonomy over the use of for-profit

management companies and personnel policies than was the case for traditional public schools.

       Despite significant growth in the state’s population and periodic efforts by charter

proponents to increase the number of charter schools, the cap remained at 100 until 2011. In

2010, the state secured $400 million in federal Race to the Top funds by promising, among other

things, to raise the charter school cap. In 2011, a Republican controlled legislature completely

eliminated the cap and made it possible for existing charter to expand their enrollments by 20

percent per year without approval from the State Board. Two years later, the legislature loosened

3
  See the 1996 legislation (115C-238.29F) section G (admissions requirements) part 5. That language was
changed in 2013 to read, the charter school “shall make efforts for the population of the school to
reasonably reflect the racial and ethnic composition of the community.”

                                                   5
the regulations further and created an even more charter friendly environment by creating a new

North Carolina Charter Schools Advisory Board, made up of charter supporters. Specifically the

legislation stated that: “All appointed members of the Advisory Board shall have demonstrated

an understanding of and a commitment to charter schools as a strategy for strengthening public

education.”4

        Figure 1 (which is based on appendix Table 1) shows the growth in the state’s charter

schools over time.

                                                [Figure 1: ]

Thirty-three charter schools were operating in the 1997-1998 school year (all academic years in

the figure and throughout the paper are designated by the final year). The number had risen to 97

by 2005, through a combination of new entrants and a few exits, and to the maximum allowed,

100, by 2012. After the cap was removed the number of charters in the state grew rapidly—nine

new charter schools opened for the 2012-2013 school year and 23 more for the 2013-14 school

year, although five schools also closed during that period. Another 26 schools were granted

charters for the 2014-15 school year. The arrival of 71 new applications for the 2015-16 school

year, which is shown by the dashed line in the figure, created great concern among charter school

skeptics. Counter to the hopes of charter school proponents, however, the charter school advisory

board in 2014 recommended that only 11 of them be granted a charter.5




4
  Senate Bill 8 in 2013 enabled additional expansion by permitting charter schools to add one grade
higher or lower than it currently offered without the approval of the State Board. The bill also reduced the
proportion of charter school teachers in grades K-5 who had to be certified from 75 % to 50% and
removed the right of districts to submit impact statements with charter school application and set up a fast
track approval process.
5
  This low approval rate led to criticism by the state legislature, which has indicated interest in using the
newly established fast track procedure to set up more charters.

                                                      6
       As of 2014, charter school students accounted for 3.6 percent of all public schools

students in the state, with the percentage of K-8 students (4.2%) being twice that of 9th to 12th

grade students (2.1%). Although the overall percentages are low, they are far higher in some of

the urban districts—currently, charter school students account for 15.1% of all students in

Durham, 4.7% in Winston-Salem, 6.1% in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, and 4.9% in Wake County

Schools.

       Table 1 compares the characteristics of students in charter schools to those in traditional

public schools over time. This table—and many of our other analyses—uses data only for

students in grades 4-8, given the comparative abundance of data, including student test scores,

available in these grades.

                                              [Table 1]

The trends in the racial mix of students tell a clear story. In the early years, black students were

substantially overrepresented and white students were underrepresented in the charter schools

relative to traditional public school enrollments. In other words, contrary to the fears of charter

school opponents that charters would become havens for white students trying to avoid minority

students, the charters initially served a disproportionate share of black students. Over time,

however, that pattern has changed. The white share of charter school students increased from

58.6 percent to 62.2 percent over the full period, while their share of traditional public school

student declined, from 64.1 percent to 53.0 percent. Thus, by 2012, white students were

significantly overrepresented in the charter school sector. During this same period, Hispanic

students increased from 0.8 percent of charter students to 5.5 percent in 2012, still well below

their 13.5% share of traditional public school students. Combining these two minority groups, we

find that, as of 2012, charter schools served a disproportionately small number of minority

                                                  7
students; black and Hispanic students accounted for 31.8 percent of the charter school students in

this grade range, which was well below their 39.2 percent share of traditional public school

students.6

        This marked change in the racial composition of charter schools largely reflects two

complementary trends: the closure of charter schools with relatively small proportions of white

students and the opening of charter schools with high proportions. To illustrate this uneven

turnover of charter schools, we compared the racial composition of charter schools to the racial

composition of their surrounding school district. Of the 12 charter schools that closed between

2005 and 2012, for example, all but one had a lower percentage of white students than the white

percentage in the corresponding school district. In contrast, of the 19 charter schools that opened

between 2005 and 2012, 13 had white percentages higher than their corresponding district.

Where there was once a sector that included many heavily-minority schools, the charter school

sector in North Carolina has over time become one that includes many more schools with

relatively high percentages of white students.

        The second panel in Table 1 documents that in 1998 and 2005, students whose parents

have at least a college degree were overrepresented in charter schools relative to the traditional

public sector. In 1998 close to 43 percent of the charter school parents had college degrees in

contrast to only 25.8 percent of those in traditional public schools. 7 This overrepresentation of

students with college-educated parents should not be surprising. Despite the fact that charter

6
  A similar analysis for students in the broader 3-12 range of grades provides a comparable picture, albeit
one that shows slightly stronger trends. For the broader grade range, black students were overrepresented
in charter schools relative to traditional public schools in 1998 ( 41.3 % to 29.1 % ) but by 2012 were
underrepresented (24.9% to 27.3% .) Correspondingly, the white underrepresentation in charter schools
relative to traditional public schools in 1998 (54.7% to 64.9%) turned to an overrepresentation ( 64.3% to
53.7 %) by 2012.
7
  Because the state stopped collecting information on parental education in 2008, we are not able to
extend the data to 2012.

                                                     8
schools are often billed as a way to expand options for disadvantaged students, parents must

gather information and take the initiative to seek out a charter school, actions that are easier for

college educated parents than for those with limited education.

       The entries in the bottom two panels are average reading and math scores for all students

in the two sectors. All the test scores are normalized by subject and grade by year across the state

to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. For that reason, the averages for the bulk of

students, namely those in the traditional public schools, are close to zero. One must be careful in

comparing the entries for charter schools to those from traditional public schools. The

differences between the two school types reflect some unknown combination of selection (that is,

who selects into the charter school sector) and the relative effect of being in a charter school. In a

subsequent section we explore the achievement of students in charter schools in some detail, and

look more carefully at the test scores of the students who select charter schools. At this point, we

simply use these average test scores to characterize the students in the charter sector relative to

those in traditional public schools by grade and over time.

       With one exception (grade 6 students) the children in charter schools in 1998 were

performing at lower levels than their counterparts in traditional public schools. The most obvious

interpretation of that pattern is that the initial charter schools attracted low-performing students.

By 2012, however, charter school students were outperforming their counterparts by substantial

amounts at all grade levels. That improvement could indicate that higher achieving students

moved into the sector over time, an interpretation that would be consistent with the rising share

of white students and overrepresentation of children with a college educated parent in charter

schools. Alternatively, it could indicate a charter school sector that improved over time in its



                                                  9
ability to raise students’ achievement. We return to the topic of improvement versus selection in

Section VI.

       Given the salience of race to the policy discussion surrounding charter schools in North

Carolina, we end this descriptive section with information on the racial mix of students within

individual charter schools and how that has changed over time. The fact that there are a large

number of black and Hispanic students—albeit a declining share of all charter students—in the

charter school sector as a whole need not mean that the charter schools themselves are racially

balanced. In fact, as shown in Figure 2a, that is far from the case.

                                            [Figure 2a]

                                            [Figure 2b]

The shaded bars represent the patterns in 2014 and the outlined boxes the pattern in 1998. In both

periods, most charter schools were racially imbalanced, in that they were either predominantly

white (less than 20 percent non-white students) or predominantly minority (more than 80 percent

nonwhite). In other words, few charter schools had racially balanced student bodies. Over time

this racial imbalance has intensified, with the share of students in predominantly white charters

nearly doubling, from 24.2 to 47.1 percent. With a declining overall share of minority students in

charter schools, the share of students in predominantly minority schools has declined somewhat

but has become more concentrated in schools that are more than 90 percent minority. These

patterns are strikingly different from the racial mix of students in traditional public schools,

shown in figure 2b.

       For the early years of North Carolina’s charter school program, the racial imbalance in

charter schools reflects choices made by both black and white families. Studying 4th through 8th

graders who switched into the charter school sector, Bifulco and Ladd (2007, Table 2)

                                                 10
documented that students from each racial group gravitated to charter schools containing more of

their own group than the school they were leaving. Black students moved out of traditional

public schools that were on average 53 percent black to charter schools that averaged 72 percent

black, White choosers left schools that were on average 28 percent black in favor of schools that

averaged less than 18 percent black. Conditional logit models designed to infer the preferences

of charter school choosers confirmed that black and white parents had very different preferences

with respect to a school’s racial composition. In particular, the preferred mix for black parents

was a school that was between 40 and 60 percent black while the preferred mix for white parents

was 20 percent black. Not surprisingly, these preferences are often incompatible with racial

balance. Even though black parents might prefer racially balanced schools, the fact that white

parents prefer schools with far lower proportions of black students sets up a tipping point. Once a

school becomes “too black,” it becomes almost all black as white parents avoid it.

       These patterns and trends hint at the major factors influencing the operation of the charter

school sector over time: the rising proportion of white children attending charter school and the

fact that many of them are in schools that have very few minority students. We return to the

implications of these trends in a later section of the paper.

III. Patterns and Trends in the Relative Match Quality of Charter Schools

       As noted above, a central feature of private sector markets is that firms have the

autonomy and incentive to respond to consumers’ demands. Because charter schools have more

autonomy than traditional public schools, are small enough to be able to tailor their offerings to

specific groups of students, and enroll only students who have chosen to be there, we would

expect parents of charter school students to be more satisfied with their children’s schools than

they would have been with traditional public schools. Moreover, the market model would predict

                                                  11
that, over time, the charter school sector would become increasingly successful in satisfying the

educational preferences of the families whose children they serve. That is the case because in the

early years of charter schools (or of any specific charter school), the schools may still be learning

how to operate and parents may still be gathering information about specific schools.

       One way to determine whether remaining charter schools are in fact providing what

parents want would be simply to ask parents how satisfied they are with the schools their

children attend. The researchers who have done that typically find that parents with children in

charter schools report greater satisfaction than those with children in traditional schools, and that

charter school parents report being more satisfied when their children are in charter schools than

when they were in in traditional schools (Schneider, Teske, & Marscha 2002; Buckley &

Schneider 2006. One limitation of that approach is that the survey respondents are typically

limited to those who have kept their children in a charter school.

       In this paper, we take a different approach. We infer the quality of the match between

parental preferences and the school by using information from the NCERDC on whether students

return to a school the following year (provided the school offers the subsequent grade). This

proxy for match quality—which, for convenience, we often refer to as “parental satisfaction”—

reflects a combination of parental satisfaction with the school and movement out of the school

for other reasons. Some parents, for example, may withdraw their child from a school for

reasons unrelated to the perceived quality of the school such as a job-related move. In addition,

schools themselves may either dismiss a child or send a signal that the school is not the right one

for the child. Regardless of whether the departure from a school is initiated by the parent or the

school, high departure rates most likely signal a poor match between the parents’ educational

expectations and the offerings of the school.

                                                 12
       We estimate models at the individual level in which the dependent variable, Rist, takes on

the value 1 if the student i in year t returns to the school s in year t+1 (regardless of whether she

advances to the next grade or is retained in grade) and the value 0 if she leaves the school. The

sample is all students in both charter and traditional public schools in grades 4 through 8,

provided the school is open the following year and offers the next grade for that student. The

model takes the following form:

Rist = β0 + β1 Xi + αs+ γgt+ εisgt                                                                    [1]

where Xi is a vector of student characteristics such as the race and gender of the students, free

and reduced price lunch status, math and reading test scores, special needs or gifted status, and

number of years the student has been in the school. Controlling for these student characteristics

is important because some types of students are far more likely to transfer among schools than

are others. It is well documented, for example, that children from low income families in urban

areas often move from school to school as their families adjust to changing circumstances and

housing arrangements. The grade by-year fixed effects control for differences in average

movement rates across grades by year.

       The charter school fixed-effects are central to this analysis. Their coefficients represent

the average rate at which the students in each charter school remain in the school relative to

similar students in traditional public schools (which is the left out category, and is captured by

the constant in the model). A positive coefficient for a specific charter school signifies that the

school is better matched to the preferences of the parents than are the traditional public schools.

A negative coefficient signifies that the charter school is le less well matched to parents’

preferences. For the state as a whole, we would expect charter school parents to be more



                                                  13
satisfied on average than parents whose children attend traditional public schools, simply

because those charter parents had to make an active decision to put their child in a charter school.

        In light of the significant degree of racial imbalance across charter schools that we

documented in figure 2, we are interested in whether the quality of the match differs by the racial

mix of students in the charter school. Figures 3a and 3b summarize our findings for an early and

a recent period. They depict the coefficients on the charter school fixed effects (that is, the

average return rate for each school, after statistically adjusting for the characteristics of the

students) relative to the return rate for comparable students in traditional public schools.

Although we did the analysis for four separate 3-year time periods starting in 2003, we present

graphs only for an early period (2003-2005) and the most recent period (2009-2011). Our results

confirm first that charter schools appear to be a better match than public schools for

demographically similar students as is evident from the large number of points above the

reference line for traditional public schools (at 0) in Figures 3a and 3b.

                                             [Figure 3a]

                                             [Figure 3b]

        The concentrations of schools at the far left and the far right of the graphs reflect the U-

shaped distribution of the charter schools by the racial mix of their students shown earlier in

figure 2a. Of interest here is that for both sets of years the charter schools disproportionately

serving white students (those on the left) appear to be somewhat more successful in meeting the

expectations of parents than are the schools serving concentrations of minority students (those on

the right). Indeed, a simple correlation confirms this relationship, with the return rate and the

percentage minority in the school having a correlation coefficient of about -0.3 for both time

periods. At the same time there is no clear trend across the two time periods, other than the

                                                  14
decline in the number of schools with racial compositions between 40 and 80 percent minority

students.

       One potential concern with this analysis is that it compares the match quality of charter

schools to the match quality for comparable students in any public school in the state, including

schools in rural areas where there may be no charter schools. Although our many student-level

statistical controls help to address that concern, one might argue that it would be preferable to

compare the match quality of charters to that for other schools in the same district where the

charter school is located. Hence, we also estimated alternative models, restricted to counties

containing at least two charter schools.

       We show in figure 4 the patterns for three counties, the state’s two largest counties,

Mecklenburg (which includes the city of Charlotte) and Wake (which includes Raleigh, the state

capital) and also for Durham County, which has the largest share of charter school students in the

state and features a large black and Hispanic student population that accounts for 75 percent of

the district’s students. In all three districts, charter schools are racially imbalanced. Moreover,

although not shown in the figure, the predominantly white schools are generally larger than the

predominantly minority schools in each of the three districts.8 In contrast to the statewide pattern,

the few high minority schools in Mecklenburg appear to be equally successful in satisfying

parental expectations relative to the public schools as the predominantly white schools. In Wake

County, the charter schools that serve predominantly white students appear to be more successful

in satisfying parents than the traditional public schools, as indicated by the lower retention rates

in high-minority schools, perhaps because those charter schools are less racially balanced than
8
 Based on the 2011 enrollment used for the analysis in the graphs, the largest charter school in
Mecklenburg is Lake Norman with 929 students, Franklin in Wake County with 623 students and
Voyager Academy in Durham with 605 students. All three of these schools primarily serve white students
and are far larger than any of the charter schools serving black and Hispanic students.

                                                  15
many of the traditional public schools in the district. Durham, with its heavily minority

population, has three charter schools that appear to be satisfying the wishes of parents, as

indicated by their high retention rates; these schools are far whiter than the district average and

the whitest of them, Voyager Academy, is substantially larger than all of the other schools. The

five charter schools in the district serving mainly minority students do only slightly better than

the traditional public schools in retaining their students.

                                             [Figure 4a]

                                             [Figure 4b]

                                             [Figure 4c]

       One takeaway from this analysis is that, as a market model would predict, parents in

charter schools seem generally more satisfied with their schools—as evidenced by their

willingness to remain in these schools when that option is available—than parents of comparable

students in traditional public schools. Importantly, however, this relative satisfaction may reflect

factors other than simply the quality of education the school delivers. The finding that families

with children in the predominantly white charter schools appear to be more satisfied with their

schools than are the families whose children are in other charter schools may simply mean that

the white parents who want their children to go to mostly white schools are able to achieve that

goal by enrolling them in charter schools. In sum, the charter school sector as a whole may be

doing more to satisfy the preferences of white families for predominately white schools than it is

in providing better options for large numbers of minority students. In light of the state’s history

of segregation academies in the post-Brown years, in which parental choice was used to keep

white students apart from minority students, this pattern is cause for concern (Myers 2004).



                                                  16
IV. Trends in Test Scores: Charter Schools versus Traditional Public Schools.

        In tracing the evolution of charter schools since their introduction, we seek to compare

trends in student test scores in charters and traditional public schools. Although many factors

other than schools influence student test scores, we focus on this measure because of its policy

salience and because North Carolina’s initial charter school legislation specifically mentioned

the intent to hold charter schools accountable for measurable student learning.9

        To make this comparison, we estimate models that generate average gains in test scores

in each charter school and in each traditional public school serving students in any combination

of grades between 4 and 8. We estimate the models separately for each year from 1999 to 2012

and control statistically for the demographic backgrounds of the students, their grade level and

whether they are new to the school. Once we have our school-specific average gains for each

year, we can compare the distributions for each type of school over time. Our approach is similar

to that used by Baude et al (2014) in their study of the evolution of charter schools in Texas.

        Although the average test score gains for each school are derived from value added

models that are similar to those often used to measure the effectiveness of individual teachers

(e.g., Hanushek and Rivkin 2010), we caution against interpreting our measures as indicators of

school quality or school effectiveness. Instead, they simply indicate how well the students in

each school perform on state level tests, given their prior achievement levels and their

demographic characteristics. Strong performance of a school’s students might indicate the school




9
  The legislation did not specifically mention that the accountability criterion would be gains in student
test scores, based on the state’s standardized tests. In fact, it left open the possibility that some charters
might want to develop other measurable accountability measures. In practice, however, the only charter
schools that were approved were those that agreed to be held accountable based on the state’s tests.

                                                       17
has effective programs. It might well reflect, however, the school’s success in attracting able and

motivated students.

         The basic model (see equation 2) takes the following form for student i in grade g and

school s (with no year indicator because we run separate models for each year).10

     =    + β      +     +      +                                                                   [2]

The dependent variable,        , is an individual student’s performance in a given subject (math or

reading). Xi is vector of individual-level background covariates,        is a vector of grade fixed-

effects, and    is a vector of school fixed effects (our parameters of interest). In      we include:

free/reduced lunch status, gifted status in reading and math, race/ethnicity (indicators for black,

Hispanic, and other), whether the student is new to the school, whether a student is exceptional,

and individual students’ lagged math and reading scores. The lagged test scores are included

because our goal is to estimate average gains, rather than levels, of test scores for each school.

We have intentionally not included peer composition variables in equation [2], such as the

percent of students who are eligible for free or reduced lunch or who are minorities in a student’s

school-grade. A long literature has documented that peers may have either positive or negative

spillover effects on student achievement (e.g., Hanushek et al. 2003; McEwan 2003). Moreover,

student composition may play a role in attracting (or deterring) high quality teachers who are

able to produce achievement gains (Clotfelter et al. 2006; Lankford et al. 2002). Given our




10
  We cluster our standard errors to the school level, to address possible intra-school correlations in
student performance. Combining this with a school fixed effect likely means that our standard errors are
conservatively estimated.

                                                   18
interest in comparing average achievement gains across schools, however, it would not be

appropriate to control for any school level variables such as peer characteristics.11

        To estimate the school value-added coefficients, we use a procedure suggested by

McCaffrey et al. (2012).12 This increasingly-common approach to estimating a large number of

fixed effects adds an additional assumption—that the fixed effects sum to 0—to standard fixed

effects models. This assumption allows us to produce estimates for all school fixed effects, both

charter and traditional public schools without leaving out any of the fixed effects. As such, the

constant in these models (      ) shows the “grand mean.”13 Thus, the value-added coefficients can

be interpreted as deviations from the overall mean of school fixed effects, in standardized units.

For example, a fixed effect value of 1 means that the school is 1 standard deviation above the

overall mean of school value added estimates.

        We note that the results we report below are not adjusted for Bayesian shrinkage, an

adjustment that is often used in the estimation of value added measures for teachers (Chetty,

Friedman, and Rockoff, 2013; Kane and Staiger, 2008). That type of adjustment is less relevant

in the context of schools than of teachers because of the larger samples of students in schools

than in a teacher’s classroom. 14

         The objective of our analysis is to compare the distribution of the school fixed effects,

the    ’s, across charter and traditional public schools (TPS). We are particularly interested in the

11
   As it turns out, including a set of peer characteristics in our value-added models does little to change
the conclusions we outline below.
12
   McCaffrey et al. (2012) outline several ways of estimating many fixed effects. Our approach utilizes
the “xtreg” command, followed by the “predict, u” post-estimation command in STATA.
13
   For more of this standard approach STATA utilizes, see:
http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/statistics/intercept-in-fixed-effects-model/
14
   We made the adjustment in some of our early analyses and concluded that it made very little difference
to our results. In light of the small effect and the computation time needed to back-out the standard errors
for each of the fixed effect estimates from our estimation procedure, we chose not to implement this
adjustment.

                                                     19
extent to which the two distributions converge over time as would be predicted by a market

model.

         Figures 5a and 5b portray the distributions for reading and math in our estimates for

charter and traditional public schools for selected years (with all school level estimates weighted

by the number of students in the school). Table 2 reports the comparable means of the

distributions for each sector for each year. The figures show that in the early years (1999-2003),

the distribution of gains across charter schools was below that for traditional public schools, and

that was true for both math and reading. These shortfalls in the charter sector in the early years

are fully consistent with the findings reported by Ladd and Bifulco using a different

methodology more specifically designed to get at charter schools effects (a student fixed effects

approach that relies on switchers between the traditional public school and charter sectors), the

North Carolina results from the CREDO study of charter effects across the United States (2013),

and preliminary results by Baude et al. (2014) in Texas.

                                            [Figure 5a]

                                            [Figure 5b]

Over time, however, student achievement in the charter school sector has improved, by this

measure, relative to that in the TPS. During the 13 years that we include in our analysis, the

mean charter school gain in reading rose by 0.081 σ (from -0.078 to 0.003) and in math by 0.105

σ (from -0.056 to 0.045), while the TPS sector distribution remained relatively unchanged over

that same time period. In recent years, the average achievement gain in charter schools has

surpassed those in the traditional public schools serving demographically similar students. This

shift occurred as early as 2003 for reading but not until 2009 for math. By 2012 average



                                                 20
achievement gains in the charter schools exceeded the average achievement gains of students in

the traditional public schools in both subjects. 15

        We are also interested in the variation in the gains estimates across schools within each

sector. Table 2 shows that the variation across schools (as measured by the standard deviation) in

the charter sector greatly exceeded that in public sector until the most recent few years when the

variation across sectors became approximately the same in both subjects. The declining variation

across schools in the charter sector is generally consistent with what one would expect to observe

in a maturing market responding to market pressures. It may also reflect, however, improvements

in the way the state has regulated and supported charter schools over time.

                                               [Table 2: ]

        In sum, the trend is clear; in the early years of charter schools, the students in those

schools were performing at lower levels, given their demographic characteristics and prior

achievement levels, than their counterparts in the traditional public schools. Over time, however,

that relationship changed, with the change coming sooner for performance on reading tests than

on math tests. By the final year, 2012, charter school students were outperforming students in the

traditional public schools in both subjects. Moreover, over time, the variation in average student

performance across charter schools has declined and is now no greater than that across traditional

public schools.

        In the following sections, we explore two potential contributors to the observed pattern.

One relates to the entry and exit of charter schools during the period. The other focuses on

changes over time in the type of students who enroll in charter schools.


15
 The improvement in the last few years is also consistent with the recent changes reported in the
CREDO study (2013) for North Carolina. .

                                                      21
V. Charter School Entry and Exit

       In a typical private sector market with differentiated goods, one would predict that market

forces would induce weak firms to exit the market and strong firms to enter it, resulting in

improved average performance over time. The analogue in this case, is that charter schools

whose students are performing poorly would shut down, those whose students are doing well

would remain (or “persist”) in the market, and new schools would seek to enter the market and

do well enough to survive. The one difference in the charter school case is that the decision to

enter or exit the sector is not solely up to the schools themselves, but is also a function of the

state granting a charter to operate.

       Figure 6 portrays the student-weighted distributions of school value-added estimates by

the three categories—“entrants”, “persisters”, and “exiters”—over the entire period. A clear

pattern emerges: the test score gains of the students in the schools that exit are typically lower

than those in charters that remain open, and the test score gains of the students in charters during

their first year of operation are lower than those of students in the schools that persist, albeit only

slightly higher than schools that eventually exit. Thus, even though poor academic performance

is typically not the reason for revoking a charter in North Carolina, the process of entry and exit

nevertheless has much the same effect—the closing of schools whose students are not

performing well.

                                              [Figure 6]

       In Table 3, we shed light on the changes over time by examining the average test scores

gains of the three types of schools in two periods: the early period of charter schools (1999-2005)

and the more recent period (2006-2012). The larger number of new charters entering the market

in the early period relative to the later period reflects the rush to open charter schools in the early

                                                  22
years before the cap was binding. In later years, as the state’s charter school cap was approached,

entry of new charter schools into the charter school market became less common. 16

                                                [Table 4]

        In both periods, we see that the schools that exit are those with the lower test scores

gains, and that is true for both subjects. The new charter entrants, however, appear to have

improved over time. In the early period (1999-2005), new charter schools featured lower average

test score gains than the persisting schools, although they still exhibited higher gains than exiting

schools. During the 2006-2012 period, in contrast, the test scores gains of students in the newly

entering charters were higher than those in the persisting schools. This change is likely the result

of a significant policy change that took effect in November in 2006. Starting in that year, all new

charters were required to delay a year after approval before they could admit students. That

permitted the state’s Office of Charter Schools to make sure that they were ready to open, and to

provide technical support as necessary.

        Thus, the overall gains in achievement of charter school students relative to traditional

public school students described in the previous section reflect a combination of the departure in

both periods of charter schools with relatively low achievement gains and, in the recent period,

the entrance of schools demonstrating relatively larger achievement gains.

VI. Student Selection into Charter Schools

        In this section we shift the focus away from the charter schools themselves to the trends

in the mix of students entering the charter school sector. One possibility is that the rise in test


16
  These numbers reflect the number of observations in our analyses. These will be lower than the
numbers reported in Figure 1 for two reasons: first, because we only include charter schools with grades
4-8 and second, because of list-wise deletion in our models that occurs due to the sporadic missingness in
some of our model controls.

                                                    23
score gains in the charter school sector relative to those in the public sector is mainly attributable

to the entry of increasingly able students in recent years. The rising proportion of white students

in charter schools that we documented in Table 2 could be consistent with this possibility but, by

itself, says nothing about trends in the academic ability of the entering students. An alternative

possibility is simply that the charter schools themselves are doing an increasingly good job of

raising the test scores of the students that they enroll.

          We begin by comparing the average prior-year test scores, and also the number of

absences as a measure of student motivation, for students entering the charter school sector to

those of students who stayed behind in traditional public schools for selected years (see Table 4).

We focus on students entering charters in grades 6, 7 and 8 because far more students transfer to

charters in those grades than in the earlier grades. 17 The test scores are all normalized by year

and grade to have a mean of 0. The use of lagged test scores and absences assures that our

measures of student achievement and behavior are prior to the year students enroll in a charter

school.

          Table 4 provides clear evidence of the first possibility, namely that the charter schools

have been attracting a relatively more able group of students over time. This trend is evident for

both reading and math test scores in grades 6, 7, and 8’ grade. In each of the early years, the

entering students were typically less able than their counterparts who remained in traditional

public. In the more recent years, however, the situation changed quite dramatically. In these

years, the average test scores of the new charter school students exceeded those of their former

public school peers by more than 0.2 standard deviations in reading and about 0.15 standard

deviations in math. Although we do not have data on student absences for the early years, the

17
     Sample sizes would only be about 600 in the recent years for grades 4 and 5.

                                                     24
absence data for the later years indicates that, consistent with their higher test scores, the new

entrants to charter schools had about 20 percent fewer absences on average than those who

stayed behind. Given the importance of absentee behavior for student performance, this pattern

provides additional support for the possibility that the rising test score gains for charter schools

over time is largely attributable to the changing mix of students they attract, rather than the

quality of the programs they offer.

        Further support for that conclusion emerges from our efforts to determine how enrollment

in a charter school affects student achievement. Following the approach used by Bifulco and

Ladd (2006), we have estimated student level achievement models of the following form: .

Aigst = αCist + γi + ηgt + εigt                                                                         [3]

The outcome of interest remains achievement for a given student (Aigst). The variable of

interest—Cist—indicates whether student (i) attended a charter school (s) in year (t). Also

included in the model are student fixed effects (γi), and grade-by-year fixed effects (ηgt).18 The

use of student fixed effects means that we are comparing the achievement of students once they

are in a charter school to the achievement of the same students while they were in a traditional

public school. The advantage of this approach is that it controls for both the measureable and

unmeasurable characteristics of students, which provides strong protection against any selection

bias associated with additive, time-invariant characteristics of students.19 Thus, these estimates

represent plausibly causal estimates of the impact of charter schools on student achievement.


18
   The results do not change significantly or substantively if we include other controls for when the
student enters the charter school.
19
   One potential concern with such models is that they do not account for relevant individual-level
characteristics that vary over time, such as previous test score performance. One might be concerned, for
example, that charter school student might have a pre-entry dip in test scores and then a reversion to mean
performance levels. Our examination of patterns in student test scores prior to entry provides no evidence
to support a pre-entry dip and hence no evidence of regression to the mean. .

                                                    25
The limitation is that we obtain estimates only for the students whom we observe in both the

public and the charter sectors.

        We estimate the models for two time periods, 2003-2007 and 2008-2011, to highlight the

trends over time. The findings, which are displayed in Table 5, are quite clear. For both math

and reading test scores for 4th through 8th graders, the estimated charter school effects are

negative (although not always statistically significant) in both periods and are more negative in

the earlier period than in the later period. The trends in the coefficients are consistent with the

state’s efforts during the more recent period to improve the quality of charter schools. At the

same time, the absence of positive coefficients implies that the charter schools are no more

effective than the traditional public schools in raising student achievement .In light of these

findings, we conclude that the patterns of test score gains in the charter schools relative to

traditional public schools in the recent years is mainly attributable to the success of charter

schools in attracting more able and more well behaved students away from the traditional public

schools. .


VII. Conclusion and Extensions

        A defining characteristic of charter schools is that they introduce a strong market element

into public education. In this paper, we have examined the evolution of the charter school sector

in North Carolina between 1999 and 2012 with attention to three market-related considerations.

First, we find that the state’s charter schools, which started out disproportionately serving

minority students, have been serving an increasingly white student population over time. In

addition, during the period, individual charter schools have become increasingly racially

imbalanced, in the sense that some are serving primarily minority students and others are serving


                                                  26
primarily white students. The resulting market segmentation in the charter school sector reflects

a major difference between charter schools and the typical textbook version of a private sector

market. In the case of schools, consumers—in this case, parents—care not only about the quality

of a school’s program but also the mix of students in the school. As a result, market forces will

tend to lead not only to more satisfied consumers, but also to market segmentation, which in the

case of schools is typically by the race of the student.

       Second, we find that, as would be predicted, the quality of the match between parental

preferences and the offering of the schools is in general higher for charter schools than for

traditional public schools, where our proxy for match quality is the demographic-adjusted

proportion of parents who keep their children in the charter school the next year relative to

similar parents whose children are in traditional public schools. Importantly, however, we

conclude that the charter school parents whose children are enrolled in predominantly white

charter schools are more satisfied than those whose children are in predominantly minority

charter schools. Although we have no way to test explicitly for motivation, this difference in

apparent satisfaction is consistent with the view that many white parents are using the charter

schools, at least in part, to avoid more racially diverse traditional public schools.

       Third, we document that the charter schools as a group initially started out behind the

traditional public schools in terms of the test score gains of their students. Over time, however,

the distributions across schools in the two sectors converged and now charter school students

tend to have higher test score gains than those attending the traditional public schools. This

finding reflects in part the winnowing out of charter schools whose students performed poorly,

and, in recent years, the entry of schools whose students performed better, a process that is

consistent with predictions that market forces would drive under-performing schools out of

                                                  27
business. The apparent success of the charter schools entering after 2006 has likely been

enhanced by a policy change in that year that required charter schools to delay opening for a year

after their charter was approved, and the associated support provided by the state’s Office of

Charter Schools during and after that year.

       An additional explanation for bigger achievement gains among charter school students

would focus on the changing clientele of charter schools. Our analysis of the changing mix of

students who enroll in charter schools over time leads us to believe that a major factor

contributing to the apparent improved performance of the charter schools over the period may

have as much or more to do with the trends in the types of students they are attracting than in

improvements in the quality of the programs they offer. Our analysis of changes over time in the

prior-year test scores of the students entering charter schools in grades 6, 7 and 8, for example,

shows a dramatic shift over time: In the early years, the new students in charter schools tested at

lower levels than their peers who remained in traditional public schools, but, by the end of the

period, the new charter school students were apparently far more able (as measured by their prior

year test scores) than their peers who remained in the public schools. At the same time our

analysis of student achievement using student fixed effects shows that charter schools are no

more effective than traditional public schools in raising the achievement of students who switch

into public schools. Hence, we conclude that the apparent gains in the test scores of charter

school students over time have far more to do with selection than with the quality of the

programs they offer. Taken together, our findings imply that the charter schools in North

Carolina have become segmented over time, with one segment increasingly serving the interests

of middle class white families.

        Moving forward, the charter school sector in North Carolina is likely to grow

significantly, although probably not as fast as its proponents would like. On the one hand, the

2011 removal of the 100-school cap, the 71 applications for new charters in 2014, and legislative

changes that make it easier for existing charter schools to expand without specific approval all

point to large increases in the size of the sector over the next few years. On the other hand, by

recommending that only 11 of the 71 new charter applications be forwarded to the State Board

for approval, the Charter School Advisory Board has put a bit of a damper on the rate of growth,

at least in the short term. Not happy with this outcome, however, the Legislature has now

approved a “fast-track” option for charter school operators that have experience operating

successful schools and want to replicate them. Such schools would not have to go through the

typical planning year, and could open months after their approval at the start of the following

academic year. As the state’s charter sector grows, we would expect to see a continuation of the

trends that we have documented here, with the possibility that new entrants may once again

struggle as the proliferation of new schools exceeds the limited capacity of the Office of Charter

Schools to oversee and support them during their start-up periods.

        In this paper, we have said nothing about how the growth of charters in particular districts

is likely to affect the ability of those districts to provide quality schooling to the children in the

traditional public schools. That issue is currently an urgent concern in the Durham County, for

example, where the rapid growth of charters has not only increased racial segregation, but also

has imposed significant financial burdens on the school district. One recent study found that the

net cost to the Durham Public Schools could be as high as $2,000 per student enrolled in a

charter school, although the precise amount differs based on the assumptions (Troutman, 2014).

Major contributors to this burden are the fact that the charter schools serve far lower proportions

                                                   29
of expensive-to-educate children than the traditional public schools and that the district cannot

reduce its spending in line with the loss of students because of its fixed costs. In ongoing

research we plan to investigate further the evolving financial and other implications of charter

schools on districts’ traditional public schools.

       In another line of inquiry we are exploring the extent to which the goals of charter

schools have been changing over time. One approach is to compare the goals stated in the charter

school applications of charters approved at different points over time to examine changes in the

types of students they intend to serve (e.g. low income and minority, disabled students, or all

students), their subject focus (e.g. STEM, general purpose, or other) and their pedagogical

approach (e.g. normal grade format, mixed grades, or Montessori). Another approach is to

examine the backgrounds of charter school board members over time to tease out the extent to

which charters are becoming more of a business proposition and less of an innovative way of

providing education.

       As would be predicted by the standard market model of competition, the charter school

sector in North Carolina will undoubtedly continue to evolve. In this case, however, state policy

makers have both the power and the responsibility to influence that evolution. In particular, they

have the authority to limit the number of entrants or to alter the authorization and review

processes. The question is whether they will use that authority to assure that the sector serves the

public interest and not just the private interests of those who send their children to charter

schools.

Notes: Racial composition is based on students for whom race/ethnicity is observed. The percentage for each type of school is calculated by dividing the number
of students in an ethnic group by the total number of students in that type of school (charters or TPS) in a given year. Similarly, percentages for parental
education are based on students for whom parental attainment (for the highest-attaining parent) is reported. In the early years, parent education does not have a
category for high school +, jumping from high school graduate to trade school/community college. 2008 was the last year information on parent education was
collected. All reading and math scores have been standardized by grade and year to have mean zero and standard deviation of 1.

Notes: Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for our school value-added estimates. In it we report the mean and the standard deviation
of performance (S.D. in parentheses). These statistics are based on student-level estimates, to correspond with the student-level unit of
analysis in our value-added models. Thus, these are analogous to frequency weighted school-level estimates. Non-weighted estimates
produce similar results. A negative difference between the charter and the TPS mean signifies that the charters exhibit lower average
gains in test scores than the traditional public schools. 2008 is excluded so as to make the models similar across year; the 2008 data
does not have the Free Reduced-Price Lunch variable, a key predictor in our models.

Notes: The table compares the mean values of the three outcomes for those who were observed in the traditional public school in the prior year and in a charter
school in the specified year with those who remained in the same traditional public school from the prior year to the specified year. The entries are the values of
test scores and absences in the prior year, that is, before the students enrolled in a charter school. All reading and math scores have been standardized to mean zero
and standard deviation of 1. N is the number of reading observations we have—the other two variables are similarly populated, with some missing observations.
Absences were capped at 50 to minimize the effect of outliers.
