           Consumer Durables and the Real Interest Rate



                             Abstract



      One important channel through which real interest rates

affect aggregate demand is consumer expenditure on durable
goods. This paper examines empirically the link between
interest rates and consumer durables. Solving for the decision
rule relating income and interest rates to consumer demand is
an   intractable task. This paper avoids this problem by
examining the first—order conditions necessary for maximization
by the representative consumer. Structural parameters of the
representative   utility function are thus recovered. The
estimated model suggests that expenditure on consumer durables

is far more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than is
expenditure on nondurables and services.

I. Introduction


        Restrictive monetary policy reduces aggregate demand           by
raising the real interest rate. Government spending crQwds

out private spending also by raising the interest rate; the
more interest sensitive is private demand, the greater is the
crowding OUt, and the lower is the multiplier. Consumer
expenditure      on   durable goods is one important chaxinel of
theseeffects. The purpose of this paper is to examine
empirically the linkage between interest rates' and consumer
durables.
        There   has been relatively little recent work, on con—
suiner durables. The studies that do exist largely ignore the
effects of interest rates. In my 182 paper, I examine the
implications of the permanent income hypothesis for dura.ble

goods.    Although the theory      is   soundly   rejected, the test
assumes   a constant real interest rate. Bernank&s            (1982)

recent paper emphasizes the role of adjustment costs. Ee too
rejects the permanent income hypothesis, yet he cannot solve
his model allowing for a variable and uncertain real rate of
return. The rejections reported in these papers are possibly
due to unwarranted assumptions regarding the           real interest
rate.   Indeed, expenditure on durables is often thought to
be very interest sensitive. The model presente.d and estimated
in this paper directly measures the interest sensitivity of
                                                                    2.




consumer expenditure both on durables and on nondurables and

services.
     Lucas (1976), in his now famous critique of econometric
policy evaluation, cogently criticizes the use of a standard

reduced form consumption function. A new approach, which began
with Hall (1978), has evolved in an attempt to estimate struc-

tural parameters while avoiding the problems Lucas points out.
Instead of estimating the decision rule relating income and

interest rates to consumer demand, only the first-order conditions
necessary for an optimum are examined. Grossman and Shiller

(1981), Hall (1982) , Hanson and Singleton (1983) , Mankiw (1981)
Runkle (1982), Shapiro (1983), Shiller (1982) and Summers (1982)

all use this approach to study consumption and asset returns
in the case of nondurable goods. In my 1982 paper with Roteniberg
and Summers, we examine the intertemporal substitution in both
consumption and labor supply. All these studies ignore durable
goods. This paper therefore extends this new methodology to
model the demand for consumer durables.
     The estimated model suggests that expenditure on durables
is far more sensitive to changes in the interest rate than is

expenditure on nondurables and services. In particular, a
temporary one percentage point increase in the real interest
rate reduces the stock of durables by 3.4 percent, while it
reduces the expenditure on nondurables and services by only .5

percent. Since the stock of durables is four times the annual

flow,, this one percentage point higher interest rate reduces

annual expenditure on durables by 13.6 percent.

II.   The Model

      I assume that aggregate consumption behavior can be modeled
as the optimizing decisions of a representative consumer. The

consumer maximizes the following utility function..


(1)     sO (1 +    )_S    Lu   (c+ + V    (K
where      Et = expectation          conditional on infoation available
                   at time     t;

               =   rate   of subjective time preference;
           C = consumption of nondurable goods;
           K = stock of th2rable goods providing services to the
               consumer;
           U = one—period utility from the nondurable  goods;

           V   = one—period         utility from the durable goods.
Various assumptions are implicit in this utility f'unction. First,
the objective function is additively separable through time.
Although it has no theoretical basis, most previous work main-
tains this assumption, primarily since it facilitates the
generation of empirically testable hypotheses. Second, non—
durables and durables are additively separable in the           utility
function. In addition, by ignoring, the utility of leisure, I
implicitly assume that leisure and consumption are additively

separable. The main virtue of these postulates, which are
also maintained in most previous work, is again parsimony. In
my 1982 paper with Rotexnberg and Summers, we allow' non—separability

between consumption and leisure. In that paper, no qualitative conclu-

sions are altered, and no additional insights are gained, by relaxing
                                                                        5.




this separability assumption. Throughout this study, I maintain
the assumption of additive separability both through time and
among nondurable consumption, durable consumption, and leisure.
       I   assume the   consumer has access to some capital market.

That is, he is not liquidity constrained. Let t the nominal
interest rate at which he can, at the margin, borrow and lend.
If T    is   his marginal tax rate, (1 —       is   his after tax nominal
interest rate. The consumer can. trade off present and future

expenditure on nondurables and durabIes at this relative price.
       Solving for the consl..unerts decision rule is an almost

intractible task. The current levels of C and             depend upon
the entire subjective distribution of all futire interest rates,

prices and incomes. Lucas (l976 correctly criticizes the derivation
and use of standard consumption functions. These consumption

functions insufficiently treat the formation of expectations.

The estimated parameters are not invariant with respect to policy
changes, and meaningful interpretation of the econometric
results is difficult. This paper avoids thIs problem by
examining the first—order conditions for an optimum, rather
than the reduced form decision rule.

       I examine two first—order conditions necessary for maximation

of the utility function (1). Their derivation rests upon simple
perturbation arguments. In particular, no feasible perturbation
from an optimum should increase expected utility. The first—order
effect of a small feasible perturbation is      zero, just as an
indifference    curve is tangent to the budget constraint at a maximum.
                                                                                     6.


        First,       consider a reduction in. ci.,.rrent consumption of

dCt. Current           utility      is reduced by Ut(C,dCt. Nominal spending
is reduced by PdCt. The consumer invests this ectra saving and,

in.period t ÷ 1, has axi'extra (1 +(.1 - T)it)PdCt to spend. The.
extra consumption he purchases Is dC+i = (1 +(1 - T)i)Pdc/Pt+i
The extra utility is tJtCCti)dCt÷i.. The total change                        In. utility

from this feasible perturbation discounted at the rate subjec-

tive time preference y               , is    the   following.

This    change must, at an opttml.uttr have an expectation of zero.
Thus, the following first—order condition is necessary.

Previous studies——Grossman and Shiller (1981), Hall (1982),
Hanson and Singleton (1983), Mankiw, Rotèmberg and Summers (1983),
Runkle (1982), Shapiro (1982), Shiller (1982) and Summers (1982)

——extensively    examine condition (3).
        Second, consider a reduction in the current durables stock
of                Current utility is reduced by V'()dI. Nominal                   spending
is     reduced by PdX. In period t +                    1,    the consumer has an extra

(1 +(1 -t)i)PdK      to spend. He spends it in two ways.                           He

first purchases durables in order to restore the stock in period
                                                                                          7.

lower,    where        is the      depreciation       rate. Hence, h.e spends (1 -
on durables. There is therefore no change in                                   The re-
mainder of his extra expenditure is on nondurables.                            He buys
dC1 =     ((.1 +(1 —               - (1   —

utility is U'(Ct+i)dC1. The total change in utility from

time    preference 'i',. is the following.

This change must, at an optinn.un, have an expectation of zero.
The second first—order condition is the following.

                                      = 1

No study has examined condition (6). This equation allows us
to examine the link between interest rates and consumption of
both nondurables and durables.
     The first—order condition (6) is based upon the somewhat
unnatural comparison between the current stock of dura.bles and
next period's consumption of nondurables.                            Indeed, that the

perturbation is so unnatural may explain why previous work on
durables has typically not allowed a stochastic real interest
rate. There are, of course, other more natural perturbations
to consider. Yet these often produce first—order conditions with
                                                                                        8.




more than two terms. For example, suppose the representative
consumer reduces current nondurable consumption C. and increases
expenditure on durables. In this case, with exponential

depreciation, all future stocks of durables KtrKt+ir... are at
least      slightly altered. The resulting first—order condition
therefore has an infinite nuinbe-r of                     terms. The vtrtue of
equation (6 is that it is                        tractible, and that it allows the
econometrician to estimate directly paraneters of the underlying

utility function.
        It is useful to consider the two relative price variables:

R'   and   R2.         Although they may appear somewhat            intricate,   they
are actually quite intuitive. They are approximately' the                         following.

                             ri       are the inflation rates for nondurables and
durables, respectively. R is simply one plus the real interest
rate measured in terms of nondurable goods, which is the relative
price of consumption today versus consumption tomorrow. In the
certainty case, the first—order condition (3) equates this relative
price to the marginal rate of substitution between consumption
                                                     2
today and consumption tomorrow. The relative price R is the
depreciation. rate plus the real interest measured in terms of the

durable good, all multiplied by the relative price of durables.
Intuitively, it is the relative price of holding durables today
versus consuming nondurables tomorrow. Under certainty, the first-
order condition (6) equates this relative price to the relevant
                                                                    9'.




 marginal rate of substitution. ThÜSr   both R'   and R2 are real
 interest rate variables, defined using the appropriate depreciation
 rate and   prIce series.
       Remember that these simple relations, (3 and (16) are
                                                         ,   only
 first—order conditions necessary for an optimum. Equations (3)
 and (6) are not "consumption. functions", as they do not relate
 endogenous decision variables to exogenous forcing variables.
 As the next section shows, these relations do allow' us to estimate
 the utility function parameters from, observed levels oe con-
 sumption, and thus permit inferences regarding consumer behavior.
     These first-order conditions are fully robust to assumptions
regarding other markets. In particular, no assumption is
necessary regarding the income process or the determination
of employment. The labor market can clear continuously, as in
neoclassical macromodels, or it can exhibit persistent dis-equilibrium,
as in Keynesian macromodels. In either case, conditions C3) and
(.6) hold so long as the representative consumer can trade off

expenditure today and expenditure tomorrow.

III. Implementation

       The utility function I use to implement the model is the

standard constant relative risk aversion utility function.
In particular, the follow'ing functional forms are used.

                 UI_a
 (8)   UCC) =    1 —          where         > 0.

                 OK'S
 (9)   vci) =                      whereO>Gand>0.

The parameters a and $ axe the Arrow-Pratt nea,stres oe relative

risk aversion.
       For any time series X, the statement                              = 1   Is

equivalent to the statement X.j = 1 +                             where tCct+i) = 0.
We can thus restate the first—order condition (3 and (6) using
the realized values of the variables. Using our functional
forms (8) and (9), we have the following.
         1          —a
       R1 C1                   =    1   +
                                             1
        i+'      Ce_a
             2           -a
         Rt+l     C1                               z

         O(l+y) K
                                   =    1   +
                                                 c1
where E(+i) =           0 for j         = 1,2.         Thus, the model produces two

very simple relations among the realized values of the two
choice variables——C and K——and the two relative price variables——

R1 and R2.
                                                                                    11.


        I   next linearize the first-order conditions (3') and (6').                 I

take the natural logarithm of both sides of the equations and use

the Taylor approximation that log(l +                                    -   Note
that this approximation is exact if the error terms are log—normal.
  assume the errors are conditionally homoskedastic. That is,

Et[()21 =               for   all t. Some simple manipulation produces the

following equations.

(3") log(C÷1/C) = a0 +log(R1) +                   u1
(6") lo(C÷1) = b0 +           1og(R1)       +
                                                -1og(K)   +
                                                              u1
where        a0 =
                    [½ — log(1 + y) /c;
            b0 =
                    [½ - log(G +            /a;
                    =                   —         Ia,   for j =   1,2;
                        (c÷1)2__
and E(u+i) = 0,               for j =   1,2.
These linearized first—order conditions are somewhat more tractibie

and intuitive that (.3') and (6'), the equivalent nonlinear versions.

     It is useful to examine the linearized first-order conditions
(3") and (6") in the special case that the relative price terms,

R1 and R2, are constant. Ignoring the constant term, (3") implies
that the growth rate of consumption, log(C÷1/C) is white noise,
since Et(u+i) = 0.             The level of consumption, log(C÷1) is thus
a random walk. In addition, no information known at time t, apart

from log(.C) should be useful in forecasting log (.Ct+i). Equivalent-
ly, the optimal forecast of log(C1) is log(C). In an important
paper, Hall (.1978) first shows these results. Equation (.3") is a

generalization of Hall's "random walk" theorem.
                                                                                 12.


     The second first—order condition C6) has a similar inter-
pretation. If R2 does not.          vary,   then 6't) implies that log(C1)
equals a linear function of 1og(K) p1-us            a white noise error.
Again   ignoring the constant term, the optimal forecast of
            is --log(K).Since by (.3") the optimal forecast is also
log(C÷)
log(C      it follows that 1og(I<) is proportional to log(C).

Since log(C) obeys a. random         w'a1k, log(X also -must obey a
random walk. I explore this last implication, in -my' 1982 paper,
where I conclude the theory fails when confronted with. post-war
data. That paper, though, assumes a cons-tan.t real interest rate.

All the tests in this paper allow a variable and uncertain real
rate of return.

     EquatIon (3tF) and     C61*)    cannot be estimated -using ordinary
least   squares. We know'    the     error terms t+I
                                                  u are. iincorrelated
with any variable known at time t. But the realized values of
R' and R2 are not known until time t +. 1. ifence, these
 t+1      t÷1
variables may be correlated with the error terms, which would
lead to inconsistent parameter estimates.
     We can produce consistent estimates using the technique

we use alternative instrument lists to ensure the conclusions

are robust.

       It is possible to test directly the implication of theory
that   Et(u1) = 0.        If we include any variable       knowi   at   t
in equation (3 ')    or         the. variable     should have   a zero
coefficient. If the coefficient is statistically significant,
then u1 is forecastable from known information contrary to
the theory. This test parallels- the test of over—identifying
restrictions in aanson       and Singleton 1S83} and in ny 1982
paper with Rotemberg and S-ummers.'
       The approach, taken   here has-   an important 'advanta.ge over
the test statistic used in these two previous' papers. The
only inference we can -make from a. test statistic is whether a
rejection is statistically significant. et this is- not the
primary issue. Any theory is at best an approximation of reality;
as such, it is literally false. The primary is-sue is whether
the theory is a good approximation. Thus, we need to know whether
a rejection is economically significant. Suppose that u1 is
forecastable, but only slightly so. We shOuld not conclude on.
this basis that the theory is invalid. The inclusion of lagged
variables in (3t1)   and (6")   allows the use of greater judgement.
We can   examine the coefficients and the standard error of the
regression to gauge whether any      statistically significant      rejection is
economically meaningful.

       From the estimates of the utility function. pa,raneters,

we can compute various' relevant elasticities. These elasticities
are the best way to guage the implications' of the stiniates.

I compute two          kinds         of elasticities'. The first is a. ahort—run

elasticity. Note that all temporary changes' in interest rates

and    prices     affect future decisions only' through their effect

upon the state                  variable wealth. For a short—run elasticity

this effect is small enough. to be ignored.                                      Hence we
assume log(C÷1Y is unaffected by a temporary change in period

t   interest      rates         and prices. From                C3'   and.   (6" we know' that
(dc/C) /(dR1/Rl) =              1/         and. that CdK(K)/Cd.R2/R2 = 1/ . Together
with (4 ) and (7 , we                      can infer the following short—run
semi—elasticities and ela.sticittes.

parameters and          the       necessary' variables at their historic mean.

       The long—run elasticities are computed assuming C and K are

IV.   Data

      To estimate the model, I use U. S. data from 1950 to 1981.
Instead of using quarterly data, as in HaJ,l (1978) and Mankiw (1981),

or monthly data, as in Hanson and Singleton (1983), T use data

only from the fourth quarter of each year. This procedure, which
Hall (1982) also follows, has five justifications.
      First, the BEA publishes data on the stock of durables only

for the end of each calendar year. It is possible to construct
a quarterly stock series from the flow data. Bernanke (1982)
follows this procedure. Nonetheless, there are clear advantages

to using a standard published series.
      Second, the use of data at an annual frequency minimizes

the  problem of seasonal adjustment. Undoubtedly, tastes for
consumption are seasonal. The demand for
                                           haatin.g oil, for instance,

is greater in winter than in suituter. Similarly', techo1ogy makes
certain prices seasonal. Ceitain fruits' and yeeta1es    are

obvious examples. Ieal1y, as Niron C19821 discusses', one shou1d
encorporate this sea.sonality into the model. In pra,ctice this
often complicates modelling substantially. The standard procedure
of using X—11 adjusted data bas' no theoritical jtis'tiicatiOn.
This paper avoids the problem of seasonality by the use of only

fourth quarter data.
                                                                       17.




       Third,   the problem of tine averag3.ng   also si.iggeststhg
use   of only fourth quarter data. The      first—order   conditi.ons (3)
and (6) apply    to C   and K   at points in time. Observed consumption
is   measured as an average over an interval. A time average of

a stochastic process can. have properties very different than the

process itself. For example, as Working C1960) shows, the time
average of a random walk has serially correlated increments.
Thus, the use of contiguous time averages is often not the

best way to study the underlying stochastic process. By examining
data only from the fourth quarter of each year, the problem of
time averaging is greatly reduced.

      Fourth, over short intervals, goods labelled nondurable
are in fact durable. For example, a pair of shoes, which is
classified nondurable in the National Income Accounts, typically
lasts longer than three months. Those items called nondurable

simply have relatively higher depreciation rates. It is more
plausible to believe that shoes fully depreciate over a year
than over a month or aquarter. This suggests the use of an annual
rather than a quarterly periodicity.
                                                                18.


     The fifth and final justification for the use of only
fourth quarter data is based upon the possible illiquidity
of consumer durables and upon the costs of adjusting the stock.

Mishkin (1976) emphasizes the importance of the illiquidity
of consumer durables. Undoubtedly, the resale market for
durables is imperfect, largely de to the "Lemonst' problem

Akerloff (1970) describes. Similarly, Bernanke (1982) stresses
the costs of adjusting the stock of durables. Few individuals

buy a new car, for example, without time—consuming search and
deliberation. This process often delays the actual purchase.
These considerations suggest that the stock of durables does not

adjust instantly to the desired stock. Nonetheless, over longer

periods, the adjustment process is less important. Thus, the
model above is likely a better approximation for annual data than
for more frequent data.

     The variable C is per capita expenditure on nondurables and
services in fourth quarter as reported in the National Income and
Product Accounts. The variable K is the per capita net stock of
durables at the end of the year. The Bureau of Economic Analysis
computes this series. Musgrave (1979) discusses the BEA method—
ology. The depreciation rate(5) I use is 0.2, which is consistent
with the BEA net stock and flow series.
     The interest rate is the three month Treasury bill rate.

The rate i is the return from buying a three month T-bill in the
fourth quarter and reinvesting in T-bills each quarter until the
next fourth quarter. I use a const3nt marginal tax rate(t) of 0.3.
                                                                19.




The price series   and pC are the NIPA deflators for durables

and for nondurables and services, respectively, in the fourth
quarter.
                                                                     20.



V.   Results

     To estimate equations (3") and (6tt),.I use two alternative

instrument lists. The SHORT list contains only the lagged

relative price variable log(R). The LONG list contains log(R),
                                   Of course, the included
log(R_1), log(C) and log(C...1).
exogenous variables, such. as log(K) in (6"), are always in-
cluded in the first stage equation.
                                            =   0, I included dis-
      To test the hypothesis that Et(u+i)

posable     income growth log       in the equations. The
alternative hypothesis that some individuals are liquidity
constrained suggests a possible correlation between the error
term and disposable income. In my 1981 paper, I report that
disposable income growth is significant in (3") at the 99 per-
cent level, contrary to the theory.   That paper, though, uses

contiguous quarter data. As discussed in the last section,
the problem of time—averaging can   possibly    lead to misleading

results..  In addition, the reduction in the standard error
 reported in that paper was only four percent. This suggests
 that, although the forecastability of u1 is statistically
 significant, it may not be economically significant.
                                                       That is,
 despite the formal rejection of the overidentifying restric-
 tions, the udel may still provide a useful approximation of
 consumer   behavior.
                                                                   21.




      Table 1 presents estimates of equation (3").   The estimates
 indicate the utility function parameter 1/a is approximately
 .37 with a standard error of .33.    Equivalently, a is roughly
 2.7 with a standard error of 2.4. In my 1981 paper, I report
 an estimate of a of 4. Other studies that examine (3) report

 a broad range of estimates. Hall (1982) reports that a is about

 15, while in my 1982 paper with Rotemberg and Summers, we find
 a well less than one. All the studies report estimates of the

theoretically correct sign, which certainly lends support to the
model.

     The coefficient on disposable income growth is insignificant

in (3"). The coefficient is roughly 20 percent lower than the

one I report in my 1981 paper and the standard error is larger.
It is possible that the inability to reject here is due to the

smaller sample size, as the 1981 paper uses quarterly data. On
the other hand, the earlier results may be attributable to the

use of contiguous time averages. It is difficult to disentangle
the various explanations. Yet it appears reasonable to conclude
that the model, although likely not exact, provides a good
approximation of consumer behavior.

     Table 2 presents estimates of equation (6"), the first—

order condition relating the current stocks of consumer durables,
future consumption of nondurables and services, and the relative

price. The estimate of 1/a is approximately 1/3. This is
almost exactly the same as the estimate from equation (3"), a

fact that provides strong support for the model. The estimate

of     is   roughly 2/3 and has a small standard error. The
data suggest that ci. is about 3, and $ is about 2.

     Disposable income growth is again insignificant in (6"),
conforming to the theory. On the other hand, the Durbin-Watson

statistic is very low, indicating positive serial correlation.
This contradicts the theory, since E[u1l = o implies u1
is serially uncorrelated if u is known at time t. There are
various plausible explanations for this serial correlation.

First, the process of adjustment discussed in the last section

may lead to this serial correlation. Bernanke's (1982) model
suggests it would. Although the use of an annual periodicity

may reduce the problem, undoubtedly the adjustment process is
not complete each fourth quarter. This is certainly the case
when news arrives late in the year. Second, it is possible
that tastes for durables relative to nondurables changes

throughout the period. This explanation. suggests the utility
function parameter 0, which is inthedded in the constant term

in (6"), is a serially correlated random variable. Third, it
is likely that quality changes in durables or nondurables are
perceived imperfectly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.     The

mistakes in measuring Kt or C undoubtedly persist through time,
and thus lead to serially correlated errors in (.6"). Fourth,

it is likely that simple division by the population does not
adequately account for demographic changes.    Individuals at
                                                                 23.




different stages in life have different consumption patterns.

Gradual changes in the age profile     of the population, as well

as other demographic movements, could explain the serially
correlated error. All these explanations suggest that, despite
the serial correlation, the model is a useful framework for

examining the linkage between interest rates, prices and consumer
demand.

     Table 3 presents estimates of ci. and 8 from alternative

forms of   the first-order conditions (3")   and (6"). In each
of the previous estimated equations, the relative price variable
R is placed on the right hand side of the equation. Although
this normalization may be more natural, it is also econometrically

correct to rewrite (3") and (6") with log(R) as the left hand side
variable. Both normalizations produce consistent estimates
under the null hypothesis that the model is correct. In a.
finite sample, the estimates may be different. For the SHORT
instrument list, the normalization is irrelevant, since the

equation is exactly identified. A comparison of column 3.1 with
column 1.1, and column 3.3 with. column 2.1, verifies this fact.

As is shown in columns 3.2 and 3.4, the estimates using the
LONG instrument list do change with this alternative normalization.

Yet. the signs of a and 8 are still correct. In addition,

although the alternative estimates are smaller, they are not greatly
different when compared to the standard errors.

       The l.as column in Table 3 presents estimates from a hybrid

of (3") and (6"). If we solve these two equations to eliminate
                                         2   1
1og(C÷1) we obtain a relation between 1og(R÷1/R1)1 log(C)
and log(K). We can estimate this relation with ordinary least
squares, since log(C) and. 1og(K) are known at time t and
hence uncorrelated with the error term. The estimates of .
and     from this equation again have the correct sign, lending
further support to the model, although they are also smaller
than those presented in Tables 1 and 2.
      Table 4 presents various elasticities for   =   1.5 and
  =   1, which appear reasonable parameter estimates. Also pre-
sented are the elasticities for other plausible parameter values.
The short-run interest semi-elasticities are particularly
striking. A one percentage point rise in the interest rate
reduces consumption of nondurables and services by .5 percent.
It reduces the stock of durables by 3.4 percent. Since the
stock of consumer durables is roughly four times the annual
flow, a one percentage point rise in the real interest rate
reduces annual expenditure on durables by about 13.6 percent.

V. Conclusion
     This paper examines the linkage between interest rates and
consumption both of durables and of nondurables and services.
The model presented here accords well with U.S. postwar data.
The estimated coefficients have the correct sign, and are well

within the range ofestimates from previous studies. In
addition, when the same structural parameter is estimated in
different equations, the two estimates are very close. These
findings suggest that the model is a good first approximation

of consumer behavior.

     The estimates indicate that consumer expenditure on
durables is very responsive to changes in the real interest
rate. This finding is consistent with casual observation. For
example, it is widely believed that high real interest rates
caused the recent recession. Between 1979 and 1982, inflation
fell from 11.7 percent to 4.1 percent. At the same time, the
three month Treasury bill rate rose from 10.0 percent to 10.7

percent. Consumer spending during this recession was strong,
probably because of the large personal tax cuts. Consumption
of nondurables and services rose by 4.9 percent during these

three years. Expenditure on durables, though, fell by 5.8
percent. This pattern is precisely what one would expect from
                                                            26.

the policy mix. Personal tax cuts bolstered consumers'
expectations as to their permanent income. But restrictive
monetary policy lead to high real interest rates, which

increased the relative price of holding durables relative to
consuming nondurables and services. It is not surprising that

the auto industry suffered particularly high.unemployment
during this economic downturn.
     Although the model explains the data well, there are

various generalizations future research should pursue. The
strongest restriction imposed in this paper is the form of the

utility function. The various additive separability
assumptions could be relaxed. In particular, future work
should pay closer attention to the role of adjustment costs. A

model that took account of the adjustment process would be
better suited for examining the effects of shorter term

fluctuations in the real interest rate. The model presented
here provides only a first step for understanding the
connection between interest rates and consumer expenditure.
