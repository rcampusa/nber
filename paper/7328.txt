                                               ABSTRACT

        Expanding on an approach suggested by Ashenfelter (1984), we extend the Phillips curve to an
open economy and exploit panel data to estimate the textbook ‚Äúexpectations augmented‚Äù Phillips curve with
a market-based and observable measure of inflation expectations. We develop this measure using
assumptions common in economic analysis of open economies. Using quarterly data from 9 OECD
countries and the simplest econometric specification, we estimate the Phillips curve with the same functional
form for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Our analysis suggests that although changing expectations played
a role in creating the empirical failure of the Phillips Curve in the 1970s, supply shocks were at least as
important.

I. Introduction
Although the Phillips curve is a staple of textbook macroeconomics (see, for
example, the treatments in Blanchard (1997), Dornbusch, Fischer and Startz
(1998) and Mankiw (1997)), it is dicult to state a consensus view about the
relationship between unemployment and in ation. Ironically, there is gen-
eral agreement on only one point { the empirical failure of the simple Phillips
curve. Figure 1 displays the bivariate relationship between quarterly (annu-
alized) in ation rates and (lagged) quarterly average unemployment rates for
9 OECD countries for the period 1970 to the end of 1982. Indeed, from these
data it is hard to see any systematic relationship between unemployment and
in ation, let alone the negative sloping line suggested by the textbook model
of the Phillips curve.
    The impression one receives from the pictures is con rmed by the slightly
more formal analysis in Table 1, which presents Phillips curve estimates from
the 9 OECD countries in our sample. Letting j denote the country, and t
the quarter, our estimation equation is simply:
                                 = a + U ;1
                                    j
                                    t     j
                                                  j
                                                  t
                                                                            (1)
where  denotes in ation and U the unemployment rate. We pool the data
for our 9 OECD countries and include the country{speci c intercepts a .1           j




    The estimates in column (2) correspond to the same sample period as
Figure 1. The OLS point estimate of the coecient on unemployment is
-0.13 and not particularly well determined. As King and Watson (1994)
have noted for the U.S., however, the period highlighted is exceptional if one

graphs the relationship between in ation and unemployment for the period
1983 to 1995. While the t is clearly imperfect, it is easier in these data to
see the negative relationship predicted by the Phillips curve. Column (3) of
Table 1 presents the OLS estimates of the simple Phillips curve for the more
recent period. The point estimate of -0.42 for the unemployment coecient
is well within the range of more recent estimates (see the symposium in
the Journal of Economic Perspectives (especially Gordon (1997) and Staiger,
Stock and Watson (1997)). Over the entire sample period, the point estimate
is -0.82.
    The intellectual history of the Phillips curve is familiar to most economists.
In the wake of arguments by Friedman (1968) and Phelps (1968) in the late
1960s that the Phillips curve would not survive if policy makers tried to
exploit it, and the \stag ation" of the 1970s, economists' views about the
Phillips curve diverged sharply. No consensus seems to have emerged. Some
economists \continu[e] to view the Phillips curve as essentially an intact
structure" (Gordon 1997) and focus on more sophisticated time{series analy-
sis and di erent functional forms for the relationship, while others dismiss the
Phillips curve relationship as an \econometric failure on a grand scale"(Lucas
and Sargent 1978). Those in the former group cite supply shocks (speci cally
unexpected increases in the price of oil) as one cause of the empirical failure
of the Phillips Curve in the 1970s. However, in common with those who dis-
miss the Phillips curve as (at best) a statistical epiphenomenon, many in this
group suggest that \the main reason was [that] rms and workers changed
the way they formed expectations"(Blanchard 1997).

                                        2
    This consensus about the primary role of expectations for the failure of the
Phillips curve has a serious limitation: expectations are dicult to subject
to empirical examination. We address this problem by developing a simple
and natural extension of the textbook Phillips curve for an open economy,
and applying standard reasoning from international economics to develop a
measure of in ation expectations. In so doing, we also confront the issues of
the appropriate price index to use in computing in ation and the dependence
of the consumer price index on international prices, and extend the concept
of a natural rate of unemployment to an open economy.
    Our primary motivation is empirical. With our open economy extension,
and from an identi cation strategy based on exploiting the power of panel
data, we can estimate a simple Phillips curve with supply shocks and in ation
expectations. Moreover, we can use the same functional Phillips relation to
explain the 1970's, the 1980s, and the 1990s. The open{economy, panel data
approach also allows us to investigate the relative importance of the two
mechanisms { supply shocks and changing in ation expectations { alleged to
have been responsible for the failure of the Phillips curve in the 1970s.
    Our panel data strategy was rst suggested by Ashenfelter (1984), who
observed that when countries had similarly{sloped Phillips curves, supply
shocks were common across countries, and di erences in in ation expec-
tations across countries could be ignored, transforming data by \country{
di erencing" could produce consistent estimates of the simple Phillips curve
relation when the standard (untransformed) data would not. Using data for
the U.S., U.K. and Canada (three countries for which it might be reason-
able to assume similar in ation expectations), Ashenfelter found that, rather

                                       3
then falling apart in the 1970's, the estimated Phillips curve relations were
remarkably robust.
    Building on Ashenfelter (1984) and developing a natural open{economy
extension of the textbook \expectations{augmented" Phillips curve model we
can avoid relying on dicult{to{test assumptions about expectation forma-
tion. Our extension also provides a theoretically sound, market-based, and
observable measure of relative in ation expectations with which we are able
to estimate directly the textbook model. Using data from 9 OECD coun-
tries, and the simplest possible econometric speci cation, we nd that our
estimates of the Phillips curve are remarkably robust. Our results are con-
sistent with an important role for expectations, but they also suggest that
supply shocks had much to do with the poor performance of the Phillips
curve in the 1970s.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. First we provide a brief
sketch of the textbook Phillips curve model and show how standard assump-
tions in open economy macroeconomics can be used to generate an observable
measure of relative in ation expectations. Next we take this framework to the
data and show that it provides remarkably robust estimates of the Phillips
curve. Our nal section discusses the implications of our results.


II. Empirical Framework
For any country i, the standard expectations-augmented Phillips relation is
given by:
                    = E [ ] + (U ;1 ) + a + z
                     j
                     t;gdp
                                 j
                                 t;cpi
                                             j
                                             t
                                                   j
                                                        t               (2)

       gdp

shock. Following standard treatments, we interpret this equation as an aggre-
gate supply curve possibly subject to a set of common shocks z and therefore
                                                              t



expect < 0. Expected in ation a ects wage-setting because workers care
about their real consumption wage. Therefore, consumer price in ation is
appropriate on the right hand side of equation (2). Domestic price setting
depends on domestic nominal wages. Therefore, in ation in domestically
produced goods is appropriate on the left hand side.
    In a closed economy (where GDP in ation equals CPI in ation), the
natural rate hypothesis boils down to = 1 { i.e., in the absence of supply
shocks, the unemployment rate equals a constant (the natural rate) when
expected in ation equals actual in ation. This condition will turn out to be
the same for an open economy. However, we will not impose it at the outset,
but rather estimate .
    Closed economy variants of the Phillips relation arise from substituting
di erent values for expected in ation and (often) imposing = 1. For ex-
ample, in a closed economy, the non-accelerating rate of in ation (NAIRU)
characterization of the natural rate of unemployment arises from substitut-
ing lagged in ation for expected in ation, imposing = 1, and generating a
relation between the di erence in in ation and the unemployment rate.
    To exploit variation in panel data, we will assume that each country
faces the same Phillips curve apart from a (possibly) di erent natural rate.
We further assume that labor is not mobile between countries. Given the

    This expression, which removes the common supply shock z by di erenc-                                    t



ing, is essentially the one derived by Ashenfelter (1984), except that we take
explicit note of the di erent price indices on the left{ and right{hand side of
the equation. We depart from Ashenfelter by deriving an expression for the
expected in ation di erential between country j and the U.S.

    Given equation (6) one might be tempted to regress country{di erenced
GDP in ation on the forward discount and the lagged country{di erenced
unemployment rate. The diculty with this approach, however, is the famil-
iar problem of omitted variable bias: the omitted variable g ;1 { last period'st



demand shock { is correlated with the lagged unemployment rate.
    Recognizing this limitation, we proceed in three steps. First, we use
equation (3) and uncovered interest parity to derive an expression for the
percentage change in the real exchange rate. Next, we derive an expression
for the di erence between relative CPI in ation and relative GDP in ation.
These two steps allow us to take the nal step of rewriting equation (6) in
a form suitable for estimation by recasting it as relationship between CPI
in ation, the forward discount, and the di erence in unemployment rates
between country j and the U.S.
    First, recall the uncovered interest parity condition (UIP):

    The left hand side of equation (9) is the di erence in CPI in ation between country j
     2
and the U.S. minus depreciation of country j 's currency relative to the dollar. Note that
the tradable component of U.S. CPI in ation does not include an exchange-rate term,
since we denominate in ation in tradables in dollars.

    Equation (13), which we call the open economy Phillips curve, is the basis
for the empirical work that follows in the remainder of the paper. We note
two points.
    First, in an open economy, unemployment should be at its natural rate
when the real exchange rate is on its trend growth path{i.e., when g is a
constant{or equivalently, when the real interest rate di erential is constant.
By equation (11), this implies that CPI in ation equals GDP in ation, up to
a constant. Thus, if = 1, the relative unemployment rate will be a constant
when expected in ation equals actual in ation. This constant unemployment
rate{the open economy natural rate{will be a function of the trend rate of

                                                      9
real depreciation, among other things.
    Second, observe that e and e, the coecients on the forward discount and
the di erence in unemployment rates, are not the coecients that describe
the aggregate supply curve. As our concerns are primarily empirical { we are
interested in the relationship between in ation, unemployment, and in ation
expectations { this is not a problem. It is interesting to note, however, that to
the extent that traditional estimates of the Phillips curve use incorrect price
indices or imprecise measures of in ation expectations (e.g., lagged in ation),
this analysis suggests that such estimates do not capture the true aggregate
supply relation. It is true, however, that the coecients are informative
about the aggregate supply curve: e <> 1 implies <> 1 and (as long as
 < 1) e <> 0 implies <> 0 .3
    Finally, we observe that the derivation of equation (13) requires three
assumptions:
   1. the consumption share of nontradables is the same across countries;
   2. , the coecient on unemployment, is the same across countries; and
   3. the risk premium in UIP is constant over time.
   The rst two assumptions exploit the power of the panel. We explore the
implications of partially relaxing the second assumption in our discussion of
the empirical results. The third assumption is arguably a tolerable approxi-
mation for the countries in our sample. This assumption concerns the use of
   3 The above derivation also implies that we can recover and from e and e if we
know : Although our focus will be on the estimates of e and e, we will discuss a technique
for estimating , implement it, and recover and below.

the forward discount as a measure of in ation expectations. We discuss this
issue in the nal section of the paper.


III. Data
To estimate (13), we need data on in ation, unemployment, and the for-
ward discount for a cross section of countries. We use average quarterly
CPIs and nonstandardized average quarterly unemployment rates from the
OECD, Main Economic Indicators. The unemployment data were assembled
by Bianchi and Zoega (1998).4 In ation is de ned as the log di erence in
the CPI. We obtain three-month forward discounts and spot exchange rates
from a widely-used data set assembled by Richard Levich from a continuous
publication of Harris Bank. Throughout, we use the forward discount at the
end of the preceding period as the measure of in ation expectations. Thus,
to estimate (13), an observation for country i for 1980:1 would include the
1980:1 in ation rate and the 1979:4 unemployment rate, both di erenced
with respect to the U.S. values, and the three-month forward discount as of
the end of December, 1979. Note that for ease of interpretation we annualize
the quarterly in ation rates and forward discounts.
    We end up with a sample of 9 OECD countries (including the U.S. as the
base country), with varying sample lengths, which are presented below.5
   4 The use of the standardized OECD unemployment rates makes no di erence to the
empirical results. The non{standardized rates, however, are available for a longer time
period.
   5 The sample for Japan begins in 1972:4 when we use the forward discount. We use this
sample for all country{di erenced regressions, i.e., Tables 2-4.

IV. Empirical Results
Table 2 presents the results of the estimation. The rst half of the table
(columns (1) - (6)) report the results from using the speci cation suggested
by Ashenfelter (1984) with all the countries in the sample. The point esti-
mates and standard errors are generally robust to choice of technique, but for
completeness, we present results using OLS and generalized least squares al-
lowing for heteroskedasticity and country{speci c AR(1) errors. We estimate
the results for the entire sample period, the period before 1983 { the period
when the Phillips curve \failed", and the period after 1982. We choose the
end of 1982 as the dividing line because it represents the end of the Volcker
monetary experiment and because it divides our sample neatly in half. The
speci cation in the rst six columns of Table 2 is strictly appropriate only if
the di erence in in ation expectations between countries is constant or more
generally orthogonal to the country di erences in unemployment rates.6 We
   Note that this speci cation, which does not include the forward discount, would also be
   6
appropriate in a closed economy (since  = 1), and, in this case, the estimated coecient

                                           12
  nd that the estimates are remarkably robust. Far from falling apart in the
1970s, the estimates are consistent with a somewhat more negatively sloped
Phillips curve. The simple R2 s in the rst three columns range from 0.34 to
0.41.
    Columns (7) - (12) show the estimates derived from our open economy
Phillips curve and include the forward discount. The slope of the Phillips
curve becomes somewhat less steep { the point estimates range from -0.47
to -0.79 depending on the choice of estimation technique or time period and
are fairly well{determined. The point estimate on the forward discount is
0.38 in the whole sample using OLS and 0.31 when we use GLS instead.
With the exception of the OLS estimate using only the post{1982 sample
(a period when presumably changes in in ation expectations have been less
important), the estimates on the forward discount coecient are di erent
from zero at conventional levels of signi cance.
    The inclusion of the in ation expectations measure generally makes a rela-
tively small di erence in the estimated coecient on relative unemployment
(compare columns 7-12 with columns 1-6 in Table 2). This suggests that
common supply shocks rather than changing in ation expectations are the
primary reason for the failure of the Phillips Curve in the 1970s. Of course,
country di erencing may also remove common changes in in ation expecta-
tions across countries, so we cannot completely disentangle the e ects. We
also note that we can generally reject the hypothesis that the coecient on
di erences in in ation expectations is equal to 1 { strictly interpreted this is
on the country{di erenced unemployment rates would be the from the aggregate supply
curve if = 0, i.e., if expectations were irrelevant for in ation. See the derivation of
equation (13).


                                          13
a rejection of the natural rate hypothesis. We return to this point below.
    Without abandoning our panel data approach, but at the cost of estimat-
ing many additional parameters, we take a step in relaxing our assumption
that the coecients are the same for all pairs of countries. Table 3 presents
country{by{country estimates of our open-economy Phillips curve. These
estimates use the Prais-Winsten technique to account for serial correlation
in the error terms. Not surprisingly, our estimates are less precise, but they
provide support for our panel data strategy as the OLS estimates are very
similar across countries. The estimated coecients on relative unemployment
all negative for all countries and for all but three of these countries (Belgium,
Germany, and Japan) the estimates are di erent from zero at conventional
levels of signi cance. Apart from the U.K. (with an estimated coecient of
-0.85) and Japan (with an estimated coecient of -.12) the remaining coe-
cients range from -.33 to -.59 { compare this to our the GLS panel estimate
of -0.47.
    Likewise, the point estimates on the forward discount coecient are strik-
ingly similar across the sample countries. All but three (Canada, Germany,
and the Netherlands) are di erent from zero at conventional levels. The co-
ecient for the UK is largest (0.47) and the smallest is for the Netherlands
(0.14). The remaining coecients range from 0.22 to 0.41 { this can be
compared to our pooled GLS estimate of 0.31. As we discuss below, it is
interesting to observe that all the estimates are signi cantly less than one {
in the context of our model, we can reject the natural rate hypothesis.

V. Discussion
If one accepts the stability of the open economy Phillips curve, it is natural to
ask what guidance it provides policymakers. Apart from the Lucas critique,
there are two obvious limitations. First, the country{di erencing approach
removes common supply shocks and produces a relationship between relative
in ation and relative unemployment. The actual in ation rate in a given
country would depend on supply shocks. Second, expectations do matter in
our estimated Phillips curves. To the extent that changes in policy a ect
expectations about in ation, they will also a ect in ation.
    On the latter point, our nding that the estimated coecient on expected
in ation is less than one seems to call into question the typical natural rate
hypothesis, in which the natural rate is de ned as that unemployment rate
which occurs when expected in ation equals actual in ation. According to
our estimates, in order for the unemployment rate to be constant, expected
in ation would have to exceed actual in ation.
    Recall from section III that the point estimates in the table are not iden-
tical to the parameters of the aggregate supply relation, except in the case
where the in ation moves one{for-one with in ation and the share of non{
tradables in consumption is zero. Even when in ation moves one{for-one the
estimated coecients con ate two di erent \structural" parameters { the
slopes of the aggregate supply relation and  { the share of consumption in
non-tradable goods.
    As we also noted, the theoretical model developed above, however, does
provide a rather simple method to recover the aggregate supply relation.
Equations (11) and (12) imply that the coecient on the (country{di erenced)
                                      15
GDP in ation in a regression of relative CPI in ation on relative GDP in a-
tion and the forward discount (and a set of country xed e ects) provides a
simple estimate of .7 Intuitively, if all consumption is domestic consumption
{ the economy is closed { the two measures are identical up to a constant
and random error and the coecient on relative GDP in ation will be one.
    When we perform this exercise, we get an estimate of  = :90.8 Our
motivation for  was the share of nontradables in consumption. In fact, it
should be interpreted a bit more broadly, as the percentage of CPI in a-
tion attributable to domestic wage in ation. Thus,  would incorporate the
nontradable share of consumption and the retail component of tradable con-
sumption. The latter component is cited as a reason for the divergence of
traded goods prices across the world.
    Given our estimate of  and our estimates of e and e, we can \back out"
the underlying estimates of the aggregate supply relation. To give some sense
for what this implies consider the following estimates (using our GLS results
for the full sample in Table 2) for the aggregate supply curve9 :
   7 Our approach also implies the need for instrumental variable estimation. Our estimat-
ing equation (implied by the de nitions of the price indices and uncovered interest parity)

Since  is correlated with the di erence in GDP in ation at time t, we instrument GDP
       t

in ation with its lag.
   8 To carry out this exercise, we obtain GDP de ators from the OECD Main Economic
Indicators, and de ne GDP in ation as the log di erence in the GDP de ator. The OECD
sample for GDP in ation excludes Belgium, and begins in 1977:2 for the Netherlands, and
1992:1 for Germany. We replace the OECD series for Germany with an IMF series, which
spans our original sample period. Our estimate of  { the coecient on (instrumented)
relative GDP in ation { is .90 (.094) and our estimate of (1 ; ) { the coecient of the
forward discount { is .13 (.047). We cannot reject the hypothesis that the sum of these
coecients is one.

    Although we do not wish to stress this aspect of the ndings, we note that
given our estimate for , the relationship between relative CPI in ation and
expected relative CPI in ation (the open economy Phillips curve) is weaker
than the relationship between GDP in ation and expected CPI in ation
(the domestic aggregate supply relation), although in both cases we can
reject the hypothesis that the coecient on expected in ation is one. On the
other hand, the sensitivity of relative CPI in ation to the country{di erenced
unemployment rate is stronger than the sensitivity of relative GDP in ation
to the country{di erenced unemployment rate.
    Another issue which we wish to address is whether our measure of in ation
expectations may be plagued by the same problems that bedevil empirical
work on the foreign exchange market. In particular, the forward discount bias
  nding in the international nance literature seems to imply that uncovered
interest parity, equation (7), does not hold.10 On this point, we make three
observations.
    First, our result is not an anomaly of our data set. Indeed, we have
practically the entire exible rate period in our sample. For our data set, the
\Fama regression" of actual depreciation against the forward discount and a
set of country xed e ects yields a coecient (statistically insigni cant from
zero) of -0.07. Standard theory predicts a coecient of one. The results
bootstrap using = 0:31 (0.035), = ;0:47 (0.061) with 10,000 replications, assuming a
 xed value for  = 0:91.

are similar (the coecient falls to -0.14, but remains insigni cant) when we
include unemployment di erentials in the regression. So we have not solved
the forward discount bias puzzle. Despite this, the forward discount still
seems to predict in ation.
    Second, we note that the coecient on relative unemployment does not
change much when we use relative lagged in ation as the measure of in ation
expectations. Table 4 presents these results using relative lagged in ation.
We also try using both the forward discount and relative lagged in ation.
Again, the estimated coecients on relative unemployment are similar to
our baseline estimate (compare columns 7-12 in Tables 2 and 3). The inclu-
sion of lagged in ation also has only a small e ect on the coecient on the
forward discount, even though the estimated coecients on lagged in ation
are signi cantly di erent from zero. We note that we can easily reject that
the coecients on the forward discount and relative lagged in ation sum to
one. We believe that the forward discount is a better measure of expected
relative in ation because it is a forward-looking and market-based measure,
with some tie to theory. Nevertheless, it is comforting that the coecient on
relative unemployment is robust to the measure of in ation expectations.
    Third, a common strategy for estimating a modern Phillips curve is to
choose lagged in ation as the measure of in ation expectations and impose
a coecient of one. The di erence in in ation is then regressed against un-
employment. This gives rise to the NAIRU characterization of the natural
rate. We experiment with this technique by subtracting the forward discount
from relative in ation, and regressing the result against relative unemploy-

ment and xed e ects.11 Using OLS, we obtain an estimated coecient on
relative unemployment of -0.33 , with a standard error of 0.059. The GLS
estimate is -0.34, with a standard error of 0.081. These estimates compare
to our estimates of -0.48 (OLS) and -0.47 (GLS) when the coecient on the
forward discount is unrestricted.
    In sum, we believe that our results show a remarkably robust relationship
between relative in ation and relative unemployment. Our results also sug-
gest that country{di erencing may be a useful empirical strategy in research
on open economies.




   Note from the derivation of equation (13) that the restriction = 1 implies that the
  11
coecient on the forward discount is one.
