The Vintage Effect in TFP Growth: An Analysis of the Age Structure of Capital

                                              ABSTRACT

The age structure of capital plays an important role in the measurement of productivity. It has been
argued that the slowdown in the 1970’s can be ascribed to the aging of the stock of capital. In this
paper we incorporate the age structure in productivity measurement. A proposition proves that
Nelson’s (1964) formula is wrong. Our final proposition shows that inclusion of the vintage effect
prompts an upward correction of measured productivity growth in times of an aging stock of capital.
Here capital ages if the investment/capital ratio falls short of the inverse of the capital age, as a first
proposition shows. The analysis rests on a rigorous accounting for vintages. We translate the
Bureau of Economic Analysis’ age of capital data into a measure of rates of obsolescence.
Empirically, the correction of productivity growth for the vintage effect requires an estimate of the
obsolescence and depreciation parameters on the basis of age data. The results indicate that the use
of capital stock in efficiency units does cause some smoothing of Total Factor Productivity growth
over time. In the 1950s, when investment accelerated, the vintage-adjusted capital growth rate well
exceeded the BEA growth rate, and vintage-adjusted TFP growth is significantly lower than
unadjusted TFP growth.        The measured productivity slowdown of the 1970s is somewhat
ameliorated.

1. Introduction

An important source of technological advance is through new technology embodied in
investment goods (see, for example, Solow, 1960 and Jorgenson, 1966). It is also
consistent with the "vintage effect," which states that new capital is more productive
than old capital per (constant) dollar of expenditure.1 If the capital stock data do not
correct for vintage effects, then a negative correlation should be observed between the
rate of technological gain and the change in the average age of capital.


Several papers have attempted to measure the contribution of the vintage effect to
U.S. productivity growth, particularly as a factor in explaining the productivity
slowdown of the 1970s. Three different approaches have been used. Kendrick (1980)
relied on a growth accounting approach. Using the average age of capital goods as an
indicator of the rate of diffusion of new technology, he found that between 1948 and
1966, the average age declined by three years, contributing 0.25 percentage points to
the overall productivity growth rate. Between 1966 and 1973 the decline in average
age slowed to one year; and between 1973 and 1978 there was no decline in the
average age of capital stock. Clark (1979), also using growth accounting methods and
assuming that new capital stock is 1 percent more productive than last year's capital
stock, estimated a somewhat smaller vintage effect than Kendrick did. He estimated
that of the 0.66-point decline in the labor productivity growth rate between 1948-1965
and 1965-1973, the vintage effect explained 0.09 points; of the 1.17-point decline
between 1965-1973 and 1973-1978, the vintage effect accounted for 0.10 points.


Hulten (1992) employed a second approach.                       Using data on quality-adjusted
investment flows of capital goods purchased by manufacturing industries, he
estimated that about 20 percent of total quality-adjusted technical change in U.S.
manufacturing over the period 1949 to 1983 could be ascribed to embodied technical
change in machinery and equipment. However, he found very little difference in the
contribution of embodied technical change to total technical change between the
periods 1949-73 and 1974-83, the slowdown period.

  We will estimate rates of obsolescence for physical capital; for knowledge capital see Bosworth
(1978) and Pakes and Schankerman (1984). As Ben Eden pointed out to one of us, this is an
aggregation issue. Indeed, we will estimate the stock of capital in efficiency units. For a recent review
of capital measurement see Diewert and Lawrence (2000).
                                                                                    3



A third approach was used by Wolff (1991, 1996). Using Nelson’s method for
econometrically estimating the vintage effect (see below), Wolff (1991) found a very
significant vintage effect, estimated by the change in the average age of the capital
stock, for Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Italy, the U.K., and the U.S. over the
period 1880-1979. These results suggested that embodied technical change played a
significant role in the productivity fall-off of the 1970s. Using more recent data for
these countries, Wolff (1996) estimated that the vintage effect explained on average
about two-fifths of the post-1973 productivity slowdown among these countries.


The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section (Section 2)
provides some theoretical background on the measurement of the vintage effect,
including Nelson’s (1964) formula. Section 3 introduces our model of the vintage
effect and Section 4 provides a theoretical discussion of the relationship between the
age of capital and investment; Nelson’s formula is not tenable. Sections 5 to 7
provide estimates of the obsolescence rate of capital by type of capital, vintage-
adjusted net capital stock, and the vintage effect on TFP growth for the U.S. Economy
over the 1947-1997 period. Concluding remarks are made in Section 8.




2. Background on the Vintage Effect

The age structure of capital plays an important role in the measurement of
productivity. When investment is low, the stock of capital ages and, therefore, the
units not only perish, but also become obsolete from a technological point of view:
capital is no longer state of the art. This mechanism has a negative contribution to
measured productivity; in the absence of technical change, the Solow residual will be
negative. Such an outcome is paradoxical, because the residual has been claimed to
account for the shift of the production possibilities frontier (Solow, 1957) and
knowledge does not contract, but expands.


At least conceptually, the paradox is resolved when capital is measured not in
physical units, but in efficiency units (Hulten, 1992). Then, continuing the low
investment example, the higher obsolescence of capital will show up in a negative
                                                                                        4


contribution to the growth of capital in terms of efficiency units. Since the Solow
residual measure of productivity is the difference between the output growth rate and
a weighted average of the labor and capital growth rates, the lower measure of capital
growth (as capital is measured in efficiency units) yields more productivity. In other
words, the conventional measure of productivity would understate the role of
technical change in times of an aging stock of capital.


The econometric analysis of the vintage effect in productivity measurement goes back
to Nelson (1964).       Suppose that this year’s capital investment is s-percent more
productive than last year’s, with the obsolescence parameter s constant over time.
Denote the capital stock measured in natural units (constant prices) by K, and the
capital stock in "efficiency units" by Ks. The greater the obsolescence parameter, the
smaller will be the capital stock in efficiency units. In other words, Ks will be
decreasing in s. In fact, Nelson (1964) has postulated


   (1)        Ks = K · exp(-sĀ)


where Ā is the average age of the capital stock. This formula simply states that the
capital stock existing at time t is, on average, less efficient by a factor of sĀ than the
capital goods produced at time t. One of the contributions of this paper is that the
Nelson (1964) specification is wrong. Since Wolff (1996) employed the formula, we
must reinvestigate the ascription of the productivity slowdown to the vintage effect.
This paper sets up a rigorous framework of vintage capital that is amenable to
estimation.


Although the functional form used in formula (1) will be shown to be untenable, the
fact that a higher rate of obsolescence effectively diminishes the volume of capital is
true and has a simple implication for the measurement of productivity.               The
explanation begins with a general definition of the level change in total factor
productivity (TFP) by means of a Solow residual that features an arbitrary
obsolescence parameter, s:


   (2)        TFPs^ = Ŷ – α L^ – β Ks^
                                                                                             5


where Ŷ = (p dy/dt)/py (with p the commodity price vector and y the net output
vector), α = wL/py (with w the wage rate and L labor employment), L^ = (dL/dt)/L, β
= rKs/py (with r the rental rate of capital).


When capital obsolescence is ignored, s = 0, Ks = K, and TFPs^ = TFP^. Otherwise
measured productivity growth is corrected. A result of this paper is that the correction
must be upward (downward) if capital ages (becomes younger). The measurement of
capital in terms of efficiency units and the consequent adjustment of measured
productivity require an estimate of the obsolescence parameter, s.              This will be
obtained by an analysis of age data.2




3. The model

Consider a unit of investment at time t, the vintage of this piece of capital, and the
stream of services that it will yield at later times t’ > t. The initial level of the capital
service is exp(st), where s is the obsolescence parameter; future capital is more
progressive. Thereafter, for t’ > t, depreciation takes its toll at a rate σ and the level
of capital service goes down to exp(st) · exp[-σ(t’ – t)], where σ is the depreciation
parameter.     We assume that the obsolescence and depreciation parameters are
constant over time, but may vary by type of capital.


The exponential decay of capital is the most common specification and the
depreciation parameter admits an easy interpretation in terms of lifetime.                 For
illustration consider a unit of investment at time 0. It yields a stream of capital
services exp(-σt) at times t > 0. What is the expected lifetime? Well, at time t the
amount of capital that depreciates is –d/dt exp(-σt) = σ exp(-σt). This density function
sums to unity over t > 0 indeed. The expected lifetime is


    (3)      ∫ t σ exp(-σt) dt = (1/σ) ∫ t σ exp(-σt) dσt = 1/σ

  For other vintage models, see Böhm-Bawerk (1959), Tatom (1979), Wolff (1991) or Abramovitz
(1994). A related approach is exemplified by Hulten and Wykoff (1981) who use the price of used
capital goods to estimate the obsolescence rate of capital.
                                                                                                     6


Here ∫ is the integral from 0 to ∞. This notation holds throughout this paper.
Expression (3) shows that a rate of depreciation of for example 5% implies a lifetime
of 20 years.


Change the perspective by looking backward from time t. Let I denote investment. In
natural units (constant prices), the stock of capital at time t is


       (4)     K(t) = ∫ I(t – t’) exp(-σt’) dt’


Depreciation (at the rate σ) refers to the physical deterioration of capital goods. For
example, internal combustion engines lose efficiency over time as fissures develop
between the piston and cylinder.3 Obsolescence, on the contrary, refers to economic
deterioration. For example, a matrix printer may still function well, but now it pales
in comparison to a laser printer.4 In current efficiency units, invoking obsolescence
parameter s, the stock of capital at time t is


       (5)     Ks(t) = ∫ I(t – t’) exp(-st’) · exp(-σt’) dt’


Equation (5) shows that in terms of efficiency units only the combined rate of
depreciation and obsolescence matters, that is s + σ. As equation (3) showed that the
physical lifetime of capital is 1/σ, the economic lifetime is only 1/(s + σ).
Differentiating with respect to t and integrating by parts,


       (6)     d Ks/dt = I – (s + σ)Ks


Substituting (6) into (2),


       (7)     TFPs^ = Ŷ – α L^ – β [I/Ks – (s + σ)]


where Ks is given by (5) and also features s in combination with σ only. Formula (8)
shows that TFP-growth equals net output growth minus labor growth, minus
investment, and minus the sum of obsolescence and depreciation. From an economic

3
    Another example is a baseball pitcher, whose throwing speed will generally decline as he ages.
                                                                                                 7


point of view, it does not matter if capital deteriorates because of physical or
technological aging--that is depreciation (σ) or obsolescence (s). Empirically, the
obsolescence parameter is hard to get. For this purpose we will analyze age data.


Suppose we invested one unit of capital last year and one unit this year. The average
age of the stock of capital is less than 0.5, because last year’s unit has depreciated.
For example, if the rate of depreciation is 10%, we have 0.9 unit of last year and 1
unit of this year, so that the average age is 0.45. In terms of efficiency units, the
average age is even less. For example, if the rate of obsolescence is also 10%, the
average goes down to 0.40. Obviously, the average age of the stock depends on the
rate of obsolescence we employ. Formally, it is defined by


       (8)      Ās(t) = ∫ I(t – t’) exp[-(s + σ)t’] t’ dt’ / ∫ I(t – t’) exp[-(s + σ)t’] dt’


The numerator accounts for each unit of capital by its age, t’, and the denominator is
the total number of units, or Ks(t) of (4). When capital obsolescence is ignored, s = 0
and Ās(t) = Ā(t). An important question is whether the average age of capital has risen
or lessened over time. The answer depends on the time derivative of (8), which is
presented in the next section.




4. The relationship between the age of capital and investment


Investment adds young units to the stock of capital. It contributes to the age reduction
of capital. On the other hand, there is the autonomous aging of capital. To beat this,
investment must be strong enough to lower the average age of capital. The change in
the age of capital is given by the following Proposition.


Proposition 1. d Ās/dt = 1 – (I/Ks) Ās.


Proof. The derivative of the numerator of (8) becomes, integrating by parts,
∫ I(t – t’) {exp[-(s + σ)t’] – (s + σ) exp[-(s + σ)t’] t’} dt’ = Ks(t) [1 – (s + σ) Ās(t)].


4
    An obsolescence rate may be negative. First class train service is not what it used to be.
                                                                                               8


The derivative of the denominator of (8) is given by (6). It follows, by the quotient
rule and the fact that the numerator can be written as Ās(t) Ks(t) in view of (8) and (5),
that dĀs(t)/dt = {Ks(t) · Ks(t) [1 – (s + σ) Ās(t)] – Ās(t) Ks(t) [I(t) – (s + σ)Ks(t)]}/ Ks(t)2.
This simplifies into 1 – [I(t)/Ks(t)] Ās(t). Q.E.D.


Proposition 1 is quite intuitive. It states that if the investment ratio is the inverse of
the age of capital, then the age will be preserved. If the investment ratio is higher
(lower) than the inverse of the age of capital, then capital will become younger
(older). Though intuitive, Proposition 1 has an important ramification.


Proposition 2. Formula (1) is wrong.


Proof. Suppose (1) is right. Differentiation with respect to time yields,
dKs/dt = dK/dt · exp(-sĀ) – K · s exp(-sĀ) · dĀ/dt. By (6) and (1), the left hand side is
I – (s + σ)Ks = I – (s + σ)K · exp(-sĀ). Multiplying through by exp(sĀ) we obtain
exp(sĀ) · I – (s + σ)K = dK/dt – K · s · dĀ/dt. On the right hand side, using (5) with
s = 0, the first term is I – σK and, using Proposition 1 with s = 0, the second term is
-K · s · (1 – I/K) Ā. The terms sK and σK cancel, respectively. Dividing by I we
obtain exp(sĀ) = 1 + sĀ. This nonlinear equation has one and only one solution:
sĀ = 0. This curiosum establishes a contradiction. Q.E.D.


The upshot of this negative result is that modifying TFP-growth for obsolescence (s)
by expressing capital in efficiency units cannot be implemented by a simple
replacement of K(t) by Ks(t) on a yearly basis. Instead, we must take into account past
investment and reconstruct Ks(t).         In particular, we can no longer use Nelson’s
formula (1) to estimate obsolescence parameter s.




5. Estimation of obsolescence and of the growth in the capital stock

Instead of using Nelson’s formula (1) in a regression analysis (Wolff, 1996), we will
go back to basics--namely equation (8), the definition of capital age. Since we
                                                                                                   9


assume that the obsolescence and depreciation parameters are constant over time, the
equation cannot exactly meet the data and, therefore, we must attach an error term:5


    (9)      Ās(t) = ∫ I(t – t’) exp[-(s+σ)t’] t’ dt’ / ∫ I(t – t’) exp[-(s+σ)t’] dt’ + εt(s+σ)


On the left hand side we enter the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ age of capital (by
type of capital) and implicitly assume that the weights of vintages are in terms of
efficiency units.6 There are 57 types of capital goods (see Table 1 for a listing) and
the series runs from 1947 to 1997.7


On the right hand side we enter investment data. These are also obtained from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis fixed reproducible capital series. There are also 57
types of investment goods (corresponding to the 57 capital types) and the series runs
from 1901 to 1997. Since the right hand side features the expression s + σ, the error
term will depend on the sum, as indicated in equation (9). Now let εt(s+σ) have
density function f with mean zero and unknown variance. The likelihood of our
observations is the product ... · f [εt(s+σ)] · ... · f [ε0(s+σ)]. Maximization of the log
likelihood, which is a series, yields an estimate of s+σ. If the error term is normally
distributed, estimation via nonlinear least squares estimator (NLLS) is equivalent to
maximum likelihood estimation, so in that case NLLS will provide consistent and
asymptotically efficient estimates (Amemiya, 1985).

Equation (9) was estimated using NLLS, with a separate regression performed for
each capital type to arrive at type-specific rates of obsolescence and depreciation.
The results are shown in Table 1. In light of the rapid rate of technological innovation
in the computer industry, it is no surprise that the rates of obsolescence and
depreciation are highest for computer-related equipment. The estimates suggest that,
on average, more than half (0.521) of the efficiency units of mainframe computers and
computer tape drives was lost each year during the period to obsolescence and
depreciation, with the rates for computer storage devices (0.457) and computer

5
  Robert Inklaar has suggested that the rate of obsolescence has accelerated and could be made period
specific.

  The Bureau of Economic Analysis does not disentangle annual rings of capital and, therefore, we
cannot test this implicit assumption.

printers (0.452) only somewhat slower. The personal computers rate of obsolescence
and depreciation, 0.256, is equivalent to a lifetime of four years, see equation (3).8 To
put these rates in perspective, an annual rate of obsolescence and depreciation of
0.067 is obtained if one restricts this parameter to be the same for all capital types
combined. On the other end of the spectrum are buildings and other structures, which
tend to have longer lives than other types of capital. For example, the combined rate
of depreciation and obsolescence for commercial warehouses is 0.023, that for
amusement and recreational buildings is 0.025, and that for hospitals and other
institutional buildings is only 0.019. In the middle is a variety of industrial,
transportation and miscellaneous equipment, such as aircraft (0.103), agricultural
machinery (0.115), and construction machinery (0.051).


We next compare rates of growth of our newly estimated net stocks of capital with
those of the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) both by type of capital and by
industry. It should be noted that while the BEA does adjust capital stock each year for
depreciation, it does not generally adjust the capital stock figures for technological
obsolescence. The major exception is computer equipment, which is adjusted each
year on the basis of a hedonic regression that captures such features of computers as
speed and memory. The comparisons are shown in Tables 2 and 3.


Table 2 shows the annualized growth rates of net capital stock by capital type. We
have aggregated the types from the original 57 to 28 because many of the series have
zeroes in the early years of the period (for example, computer equipment and nuclear
fuel rods.) If the vintage parameter s is positive, then a rising ratio of investment to
net capital stock over a period will cause the vintage-adjusted capital growth rate to
exceed the BEA capital growth rate. Conversely, if the investment to net capital stock
ratio is declining over a period (and s is positive), then the vintage-adjusted capital
growth rate will be less than the BEA capital growth rate.


Over the full 1947-97 period, there was very little difference between the BEA and
the vintage-adjusted growth rate of the total capital stock--only 0.09 percentage
points. Differences are quite small for most of the capital types. There are a few


8
    According to Elsa Fontainha this agrees with the accounting rules, at least in Portugal.
                                                                                     11


exceptions.   The vintage-adjusted annual growth rate of other office equipment
exceeded the BEA growth rate by 0.36 percentage points, as did the vintage-adjusted
growth rate of petroleum and natural gas exploration equipment. In contrast, the
annual growth rate of the BEA net stock of automobiles exceeded the vintage-
adjusted growth rate by 1.04 percentage points. The last line of the table shows the
correlation coefficient between the two sets of growth rates across the 28 capital
types. Over the full 1947-97 period, the correlation is extremely high (0.99).


Results also vary by ten-year period. The vintage-adjusted annual growth rate for
total capital exceeded the BEA growth rate by 0.39 percentage points in the 1947-57
period and by 0.10 percentage points in the 1957-67 period but fell short of it by 0.10
percentage points in the 1987-97 period. The biggest differences are recorded for
computer equipment. In the 1967-77 period, the difference between the BEA and the
vintage-adjusted growth rate (2.70 percentage points) was a reflection of the rapid
acceleration in computer equipment investment over the period. The difference was -
1.99 percentage points in the 1977-87 period, but virtually zero in the 1987-97 period.
Other large differences in the two growth rates are observed for autos as well as
railroad structures and track. However, by and large, the correlation in the two sets of
capital growth rates is very high by ten-year period--ranging from 0.983 to 0.998.


The BEA capital stock data are also available for 62 individual industries (see
Appendix Table 1 for a listing). In Table 3, we show the results for 11 major sectors.
Differences in the annual growth rates of the two capital stock series over the full
1947-97 period are relatively small for the total capital stock and for most sectors,
with the notable exception of transportation, with a difference of 0.56 percentage
points between the vintage-adjusted and the BEA series. The correlation in capital
growth rates over the 1947-97 period across the 62 individual industries is 0.95,
somewhat lower than the correlation coefficient across capital types.


Differences in capital growth rates between the two series are more marked for the
individual 10-year periods than for the full 50-year period. In the 1947-57 period,
large differences are found for durables manufacturing, transportation, and the
combined sector, fire, insurance, and real estate; in the 1957-67 period, for
transportation; in the 1967-77 period, for both agriculture and transportation; in the
                                                                                                    12


1977-87 period, for agriculture, mining, transportation, and finance, insurance, and
real estate; and in the 1987-97 period, for mining.9




6. Estimation of implied TFP-growth


Substitution of our estimate of the total obsolescence and depreciation rate in formula
(7) yields TFP-growth corrected for vintage effects. Estimates of TFP-growth based
on BEA capital and on efficiency units (that is, vintage-adjusted capital stock) are
shown in Table 4 for the major sectors and the total non-governmental economy. The
output measure is real gross domestic product in chained 1992$; the labor input is
persons engaged in production (PEP); the capital input is nonresidential net stocks,
real-cost valuation (1992$); and the labor share is the ratio of employee compensation
to net national product.10 Due to differences in industry classification between the
two sources, we use 58 industries instead of 62 (see Table 5).


Over the full 1947-97 period, overall TFP grew slightly faster (0.04 percent per year)
on the basis of the BEA capital stock data than on the basis of the vintage-adjusted
capital stock in efficiency units. This is a reflection of the slightly slower growth in
BEA capital stock than capital stock in efficiency units. Differences are also quite
small for the 11 major sectors. The largest difference in annual TFP growth is
recorded for the finance, insurance, and real estate sector--a 0.18 percentage points
difference between the BEA and the vintage-adjusted measures. The correlation in
TFP-growth rates over the 1947-97 period across the 58 individual industries is 0.90.


Differences in TFP-growth rates between the two series are somewhat more marked
for the individual 10-year periods than for the full 50-year period. In the 1947-57
period, large differences in annual TFP-growth are found for finance, insurance, and
real estate (0.39 percentage points), transportation (0.21), construction (0.20), and for
the overall economy (0.16); in the 1957-67 period, for agriculture (-0.21)
transportation (0.17), and finance, insurance, and real estate (0.20 percentage points);

  The correlation coefficients in capital growth rates across the 62 industries by ten-year period range
from a low of 0.89 in the 1957-67 period to a high of 0.99 in the 1987-97 period.

97 period, for agriculture (0.21) and mining (0.31).11




7. Aging capital and the vintage effect on TFP


The effect of the incorporation of the rate of obsolescence on TFP-growth is shown to
depend on the aging of the stock of capital. In fact, there is a straight proportionality
between aging and the vintage effect:


Proposition 3. d TFPs^/ds = β d Ās/dt.


Proof. Differentiate (7) with respect to s, using (5) and (8): d TFPs^/ds
= -β d [I/Ks – (s + σ)]/ds = -β [-I/Ks2 (d/ds) ∫ I(t – t’) exp(-st’) exp(-σt’) dt’ – 1]
= -β [-I/Ks2 ∫ I(t – t’) exp(-st’) (-t’) exp(-σt’) dt’ – 1] = -β [(I/Ks) Ās – 1] = β d Ās/dt
by Proposition 1. Q.E.D.


The message of this proposition is clear.               In times when capital becomes older,
measured TFP-growth increases as obsolescence, s, is taken into account.
Conversely, in times when capital becomes younger, measured TFP-growth decreases
as obsolescence, s, is taken into account. Thus, the incorporation of obsolescence
may well remove some of the cyclicallity of TFP-growth. Let us explain.


In an upswing of the business cycle the investment/capital ratio tends to be high. This
means, by Proposition 1, that capital becomes younger, and, therefore, by Proposition
3, that the incorporation of the vintage effect in TFP measurement amounts to a
downward correction. By the same token, in a downswing of the business cycle
capital grows older and the incorporation of the vintage effect amounts to an upward
correction. In short, the vintage effect is expected to be counter-cyclical.




11
   The correlation coefficients in capital growth rates across the 58 industries by ten-year period range
from a low of 0.96 in the 1957-67 period to a high of 1.00 in the 1987-97 period.
                                                                                                   14


TFP-growth itself, however, is known to be pro-cyclical, which is considered an
awkward finding, as it is supposed to measure the shift of technology rather than the
business cycle (see, for example, Gordon, 1979). As the vintage effect is expected to
be counter-cyclical, it may have a smoothing impact. In short, the vintage effect may
throw light on productivity puzzles such as the pro-cyclical behavior of TFP-growth
and the slowdown of productivity in the 1970’s.


The results displayed in Table 5 are interesting. The left panel displays standard TFP-
growth figures, based on BEA capital stock estimates. The right panel displays our
vintage-adjusted TFP-growth rates. In each panel, the first three columns show the
annual rate of TFP-growth during the high productivity growth period of 1947-1967,
the slow productivity growth period of 1967-1987, and then the recovery period 1987-
1997.12 The differences between the figures in the first two columns indicate the 1967
slowdown and are listed in the fourth columns. Similarly, the differences between the
figures in the second and third columns indicate the 1987 recovery and are listed in
the fifth columns. The sixth and final column in either panel shows the standard
deviations of the TFP-growth rates over the five ten-year periods (1947-57, 1957-67,
1967-77, 1977,87, and 1987-97).


There are three questions of interest. First, does the use of capital measured in
efficiency units reduce the measured slowdown between the 1947-67 and the 1967-87
periods? Second, does the use of capital in efficiency units increase the measured
recovery after 1987 (that is to say, does it cause TFP growth in the 1987-1997 period
to return more closely to its long-term average performance)? Third, does the use of
capital in efficiency units reduce disparities in measured TFP growth across the five
ten-year periods? The answer to the three questions is generally "yes."


First, for the overall economy, the slowdown in annual TFP growth after 1967 is 1.46
percentage points on the basis of BEA capital stock but only 1.37 percentage points
on the basis of vintage-adjusted capital stock.              The measured slowdown is also

12
  We have decided to use 1967 as the demarcation of the beginning of the slowdown period instead of
the more standard 1973 because of peculiarities associated with the year 1973 (such as the beginning of
the oil crisis in the U.S. and the end of Bretton Woods). In Table 5, ‘1967 Slowdown’ and also ‘1987
Recovery’ should be understood as representing differences between the two surrounding ten-year’s
periods in each case rather than single-year events.
                                                                                      15


reduced in 31 of the 58 detailed industries. Second, for the overall economy, the
recovery in annual TFP growth is 0.52 points on the basis of BEA capital stock and
0.58 points on the basis of capital stock in efficiency units. The measured recovery is
also increased in 40 of the 58 detailed industries. Third, the standard deviation of TFP
growth for the overall economy over the five ten-year periods is 0.66 on the basis of
BEA capital stock and 0.62 on the basis of capital measured in efficiency units. The
standard deviation is also lower on the basis of the vintage-adjusted capital stock in 33
of the 58 industries.



8. Conclusion

TFP-growth is known to be pro-cyclical, an awkward finding, as it is supposed to
measure the shift of technology rather than the business cycle. If the age of capital is
counter-cyclical, then the vintage effect is also counter-cyclical by Proposition 3, a
neutralizing effect. In short, the vintage effect throws light on productivity puzzles
such as the slowdown in the 1970’s and the pro-cyclicality of productivity growth.


The results indicate that the use of capital stock in efficiency units does cause some
smoothing of TFP growth over time. It is also noteworthy that the productivity growth
slowdown of the 1970’s--known from studies that do not take into account the age
structure of capital--is reduced on the basis of these new capital stock data. The reason
is that capital became older over this period. The relationship between the aging of
capital and the sign of the vintage effect has a theoretical foundation.


Based on our new method, we find that the vintage effect accounted for 0.06
percentage points of the 1.34 percentage points decline in overall TFP growth
between the 1957-67 and the 1967-77 periods or about 5 percent of the productivity
slowdown. This is about the same order of magnitude as Kendrick (1980) and Clark
(1979), though much lower than Wolff (1996). For the manufacturing sector, the
vintage effect explained 40 percent of the (very modest) 0.15 percentage point
productivity slowdown in non-durable manufacturing and 27 percent of the 0.33
percentage point slowdown in durable manufacturing between the 1957-67 and the
1967-77 periods. This result is larger than that estimated by Hulten (1992). However,
whereas Hulten estimated that the vintage effect accounted for about 20 percent of the
                                                                                            16


total quality-adjusted technical change in manufacturing over the years 1949 to 1983,
we estimate that it accounted for only about 5 percent over the 1947-1997 period.


Perhaps, our most significant results are for the 1950s (the 1947-57 period), when
investment in the economy accelerated and the vintage-adjusted capital growth rate
well exceeded the BEA growth rate (3.51 and 3.13 percent, respectively).13 As a
result vintage-adjusted TFP growth is 8.4 percent lower than unadjusted TFP growth
for the whole economy (with the figures for the construction sector and the finance,
insurance and real estate sector 7 and 34 percent lower).

Notes:
a. Standard error is zero (capital type has only one observation), so t-statistic cannot
   be computed.
b. Estimation did not converge. We do not adjust the BEA stocks.
