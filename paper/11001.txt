                                           ABSTRACT

While neoclassical models assume static cost-minimization by firms, agency models suggest that firms
may not minimize costs in less-competitive or regulated environments. We test this using a transition
from cost-of-service regulation to market-oriented environments for many U.S. electric generating
plants. Our estimates of input demand suggest that publicly-owned plants, whose owners were largely
insulated from these reforms, experienced the smallest efficiency gains, while investor-owned plants
in states that restructured their wholesale electricity markets improved the most. The results suggest
modest medium-term efficiency benefits from replacing regulated monopoly with a market-based
industry structure.

        Economists have long maintained that markets generate important efficiency

benefits for an economy. These arguments usually focus on allocative efficiency; the

implications of competition for technical efficiency are less clear. Neoclassical models of

profit-maximization assume static cost-minimizing behavior by all firms, regardless of

market competitiveness.1 Agency models, however, in recognizing the interplay of

asymmetric information with the separation of management and control, suggest possible

deviations from cost-minimization by effort-averse managers. These distortions may be

amplified when a firm’s prices are set by asymmetrically-informed regulators (e.g., Jean-

Jacques Laffont and Jean Tirole, 1993). Replacing regulated price determination with

markets makes firms residual claimants to cost-savings, potentially increasing incentives

for efficiency-enhancing effort. 2 Theory suggests several possible roles for markets:

constraining managerial behavior by rewarding efficiency gains, confronting less-efficient

firms with the choice of cost reduction to the level of their lower-cost counterparts or exit,

and perhaps reducing agency costs.3 The actual relevance of markets for technical

efficiency ultimately is an empirical question.

        This paper uses data on the U.S. electric generation sector to assess the effect on

technical efficiency of shifting regulated monopolies to more market-based environments.

The past decade has witnessed a dramatic transformation of this industry. Until the mid-

1990s, over ninety percent of the electricity in the US was sold by vertically-integrated

theoretical and empirical literature in economics, dating at least from Joseph Schumpeter’s 1942 classic

competitive pressure and reduced R&D investment, leading to a negative effect on cost-reducing
innovation.

investor-owned utilities (IOUs), most operating as regulated monopolists within their

service areas. Many utilities faced some form of incentive-based regulation, adopted by

states during the 1980s and early 1990s to improve upon the efficiency incentives of

traditional cost-of-service regulation. More radical reform was initiated in the mid-1990s,

as many states began to restructure their electric utility markets. Today, nonutility

generators own roughly a quarter of generation capacity nationwide, and IOUs in many

states own only a small fraction of total generating capacity and operate in a structure that

relies heavily on market-based incentives. While studies of state-level electricity

restructuring suggest that politicians may have been motivated in large part by rent-

seeking (e.g., Matthew W. White, 1996, and Paul L. Joskow, 1997), many proponents of

restructuring argued that exposing utilities to competitive, market-based outcomes would

yield efficiency gains that could ultimately reduce electricity costs and retail prices.

        The considerable body of empirical research on electricity restructuring within the

U.S. and abroad has thus far focused on assessing the performance of competitive

wholesale markets, with particular attention to the exercise of market power (e.g., Severin

Borenstein, James Bushnell and Frank A. Wolak, 2002 and Joskow and Edward Kahn,

2002, and Wolak, forthcoming). While many of the costs of electricity restructuring have

been intensively studied, relatively little effort has been devoted to quantifying any ex

post operating efficiency gains of restructuring. Christopher R. Knittel (2002) reports

evidence of some electric generating plant efficiency increases associated with the

diffusion of incentive regulation.4 The question of whether further reform—moving from

  Stephen J. Nickell (1996) provides a discussion of many of these theoretical arguments. Jen Baggs and
Jean-Etienne de Bettignies (forthcoming) develop a model in which competition may reduce costs through
both direct effects, such as those described in Nickell (1996), and reductions in agency costs.

  Incentive regulations have been more extensively studied in the telecommunications sector; e.g., Chunrong
Ai and David Sappington (2002), or Donald Kridel, Sappington, and Dennis Weisman (1996) for a survey

incentive-based regulation to deregulated markets for generation—yields additional

improvements in plant efficiency remains open.

         Research on other industries suggests productivity gains associated with

deregulation (e.g., G. Steven Olley and Ariel Pakes, 1996, on telecommunications and

Charles K. Ng and Paul Seabright, 2001, on airlines) and with increased competitive

pressure caused by factors other than regulatory change (e.g., José E. Galdón-Sánchez and

James A. Schmitz, Jr., 2002, on iron ore mines).5 This study provides the first substantial

analysis of early generation efficiency gains from electricity restructuring. 6 As such, it is

of direct policy relevance to states contemplating the future of their electricity

restructuring programs, and contributes to the broad economic debate on the role of

competition in the economy.

         The results of our work indicate that the plant operators most affected by

restructuring reduced labor and nonfuel expenses, holding output constant, by three to five

percent relative to other investor-owned utility plants, and by six to twelve percent relative

to government- and cooperatively-owned plants that were largely insulated from

restructuring incentives. These may be interpreted as the medium-run efficiency gains

that Joskow (1997, p. 214) posits “may be associated with improving the operating


5
  Some hint of this possibility in electricity is provided by Walter J. Primeaux (1977), who compared a
sample of municipally owned firms facing competition to a matched sample of municipally owned firms in
monopoly situations and found a significant decrease in costs per kWh for firms facing competition.
6
  Joskow (1997) describes the significant labor force reductions that accompanied restructuring in the UK,
as the industry moved from state-owned monopoly to a privatized, competitive generation market, although
these mix restructuring and privatization effects. The only econometric evidence on restructuring of which
we are aware is from L. Dean Hiebert (2002), who uses stochastic frontier production functions to estimate
generation plant efficiency over 1988-1997, treating all inputs as orthogonal to productivity shocks. Hiebert
models plant inefficiency as a function of several variables, including indicators for state regulatory or
legislative enactment of utility restructuring in 1996 and in 1997. He reports a huge reduction in estimated
mean inefficiency for coal plants in states deemed to have restructured in 1996 but none for gas plants in
those states, and no effect on plants of either fuel type for policies enacted in 1997. Our work uses a longer
time period, richer characterization of the restructuring environment and dating of reforms consistent with
the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and an alternative technology specification that both allows for
more complex productivity shocks and treats possible input endogeneity biases.

                                                                                                            3
performance of the existing stock of generating facilities and increasing the productivity

of labor operating these facilities.” Our work also highlights the importance of treating

the simultaneity of input and output choice. Failing to recognize that shocks to input

productivity may induce firms to adjust targeted output leads to overstatement of

estimated efficiency effects, by nearly a factor of two in some cases. While endogeneity

concerns have been long recognized in the productivity literature, ours is one of the first

studies of electric generation to control for this. Finally, we explore the sensitivity of the

estimated efficiency impact to the choice of control group to which restructured plants are

compared, and discuss the issues involved in determining the appropriate counterfactual.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section I describes existing

evidence on the competitive effects of efficiency and discusses how restructuring might

alter electric generation efficiency. Section II details our empirical methodology for

testing these predictions and describes our strategy for identifying restructuring effects.

The data are described in Section III. Section IV reports the results of the empirical

analysis, and Section V concludes.

I. Why Might Restructuring Affect Generator Efficiency?

       Through the early 1990s, the U.S. electricity industry was dominated by vertically

integrated investor-owned utilities. Most operated as regulated monopolists over

generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity within their localized geographic

market, though there was some wholesale power traded among utilities or purchased from

a small but growing number of nonutility generators. Prices generally were determined by

state regulators based on accounting costs of service at the firm level. It has long been

argued that traditional cost-of-service regulation does relatively well in limiting rents but

less well in providing incentives for cost-minimizing production (e.g., Laffont and Tirole,


                                                                                                 4
1993). Under pure cost-of-service regulation, regulator-approved costs are passed directly

through to customers, and reductions in the cost of service yield at most short-term profits

until rates are revised to reflect the new lower costs at the next rate case.7 Given

asymmetric information between regulators and firms, inefficient behavior by managers

that raises operating costs above minimum cost levels generally would be reflected in

increased rates and passed through to customers. Joskow (1974) and Wallace E.

Hendricks (1975) demonstrate that frictions in cost-of-service regulation, particularly

those arising from regulatory lag (time between price-resetting hearings), may provide

some incentives at the margin for cost-reducing effort. Their impact generally is limited,

however, apart from periods of rapid nominal cost inflation (Joskow, 1974).

         This system led economists to argue that replacing cost-of-service regulation with

higher-powered regulatory incentive schemes or increased competition could enhance

efficiency.8 Over the 1980s and early 1990s, many state utility commissions accordingly

adopted some form of incentive regulation. The little empirical evidence available on

these reforms, which modify price setting within the regulated monopoly structure,

suggests limited effects. Knittel (2002) studies a variety of incentive regulations in use

through 1996, and finds that those targeted at plant performance or fuel cost were

associated with gains in plant-level generation efficiency.9 More general reforms, such as

price caps, rate freezes, and revenue-decoupling programs, typically were associated with

insignificant or negative efficiency estimates, all else equal.

  Rates are constant between rate cases, apart from specific automatic adjustments (such as fuel adjustment
clauses), so changes in cost would not be reflected in rates until the next rate case.

         During the second half of the 1990s, states began to shift their focus from

incentive regulation to restructuring. By 1998, every jurisdiction (50 states and the

District of Columbia) had initiated formal hearings to consider restructuring their

electricity sector, and by 2000, almost half had approved legislation introducing some

form of competition that included competitive retail access, whereby companies competed

to sell power to retail customers.10         Restructuring initiatives, in contrast to incentive

regulations, fundamentally changed the way plant owners earn revenue. At the wholesale

level, plants sell either through newly created spot markets or through long-term contracts

that are presumably based on expected spot prices. In the spot markets, plant owners

submit bids indicating the prices at which they are willing to supply power from their

plants. Dispatch order is set by the bids, and, in most markets, the bid of the marginal

plant is paid to all plants that are dispatched. High-cost plants will be forced down in the

dispatch order, reducing expected revenue.11 Plant operators that reduce costs can move

higher in the dispatch order to increase dispatch probability, and increase the profit margin

between own costs and the expected market price. Most restructuring programs also

changed the way retail rates are determined and the way in which retail customers are

allocated.12 Retail access programs in combination with the creation of the new

wholesale spot markets may increase the intensity of cost-cutting incentives, leading to

even greater effort to improve efficiency.


on the order of 1-2 percent associated with these reforms. Equations that do not allow for plant fixed effects
suggest much larger magnitudes.
10
   In the aftermath of California’s electricity crisis in 2000-2001, restructuring has become less popular and
many states have delayed or suspended restructuring activity, including six that had previously approved
retail access legislation. See US Energy Information Administration (EIA), 2003.
11
   This could induce closure. We address potential selection-induced biases from exit below.
12
   States have used a variety of approaches to link retail rates under restructuring to wholesale prices in the
market. Over the short term, most states decoupled utility revenue from costs by mandating retail rate
freezes, often at levels discounted from pre-restructuring prices. Some states, such as Pennsylvania, are
aggressively trying to encourage entry by competitive energy suppliers, who may contract directly with
retail customers.

                                                                                                              6
         Exit by less-efficient firms is a well-understood efficiency benefit of competition:

as output shifts from (innately) higher-cost firms to lower-cost competitors the total

production cost for a given output level declines. Olley and Pakes (1996) provide

empirical evidence of this phenomenon in their plant-level analysis of the magnitude and

source of productivity gains in the U.S. telecommunications equipment industry over

1974-1987. They find substantial increases in productivity associated with the increased

competition that followed the 1984 divestiture and deregulation in this sector, and identify

the primary source of these gains as the re-allocation of output from less productive to

more productive plants across firms. In a similar vein, Chad Syverson (2004) finds that

more competitive local markets in the concrete industry are associated with higher mean,

less dispersion, and higher lower-bounds in plant productivity, effects he attributes to the

exit of less-efficient plants in more competitive environments.

         The existing evidence on whether competition also leads to cost reductions

through technical efficiency gains by continuing producers and plants is relatively sparse.

Nickell (1996) uses a panel of 670 U.K. manufacturing firms to estimate production

functions that include controls for the competitive environments in which firms operate.

He finds some evidence of reduced productivity levels associated with market power and

strong support for higher productivity growth rates in more competitive environments.

Concerns about the ability of cross-industry analysis to control adequately for

unobservable heterogeneity across sectors may make sector-specific evidence tighter and

more convincing.13 A notable example is the Galdón-Sánchez and Schmitz (2002) study

of labor productivity gains at iron ore mines that faced increased competitive pressure


13
  A number of studies have analyzed efficiency gains following regulatory reform in various industries; see,
for example, Elizabeth E. Bailey (1986) and B.U. Park et al. (1998) on airlines. Unfortunately, in many
cases it is difficult to disentangle direct regulatory effects on efficiency (e.g., operating restrictions imposed
on trucking firms or airlines by regulators in those sectors) from the indirect effects of reduced competition.

                                                                                                                7
following the collapse of world steel production in the early 1980s. They find

unprecedented rates of labor productivity gains associated with this increase in

competitive pressure, “driven by continuing mines, producing the same products and

using the same technology as they had before the 1980s” (at 1233).14

         Several features of the electric generation sector make it an attractive subject for

testing these potential competitive effects on technical efficiency.15 First, generation

technology is reasonably stable and well-understood and data on production inputs and

outputs at the plant-level are readily available to researchers. This has made electric

generation a common application for new production and cost function estimation

techniques, dating at least from Marc Nerlove (1963). Second, policy shifts over a

relatively short period have resulted in a dramatic transformation of the market for electric

power. This provides both time series and geographic variation in competitive

environments. Finally, static and dynamic efficiency claims bolstered much of the policy

reform; measuring these benefits is a vital prerequisite to assessing the wisdom of these

policies.

         While the most significant savings from restructuring are likely to be associated

with efficient long-run investments in new capacity, there may be opportunities for

modest reductions in operating costs of existing plants (Joskow, 1997). This paper

attempts to measure the extent of that possible improvement for the existing stock of

electricity generating plants in the U.S. The implicit null hypothesis is that before

restructuring, operators were minimizing their costs given the capital stock available in the


14
   Ng and Seabright (2001) estimate cost functions for a panel of U.S. and European airlines over 1982-
1995, and conclude that potential gains from further privatization and increased competition among
European carriers are substantial, though they point out that the best-measured component of these gains
relates to ownership rather than market structure differences.
15
   Understanding possible reallocation of output across plants is hampered by the exit of plants from most
publicly available databases when they are sold to nonutility owners.

                                                                                                             8
industry. Under the null, there should be no change in plant-level efficiency measures

associated with restructuring activity. We discuss below our method for estimating plant

efficiency and identifying deviations from this hypothesis. To assess the effects of

restructuring, we need to specify how generating plants would have operated absent the

policy change. Constructing this counterfactual is crucial, but difficult.

II. Empirical Model

       For a single-output production process, productive efficiency can be assessed by

estimating whether a plant is maximizing output given its inputs and whether it is using

the best mix of inputs given their relative prices. Production functions describe the

technological process of transforming inputs to outputs and ignore the costs of the inputs;

a plant is efficient if it is on the production frontier. Cost minimization assumes that,

given the input costs, firms choose the mix of inputs that minimizes the costs of producing

a given level of output. A plant could be producing the most output possible from a given

input combination but not minimizing costs if, for instance, labor were cheap relative to

materials, yet the plant used a lot of materials relative to labor. Even if the plant were

producing the maximum output possible from its workers and materials, it would not be

efficient if it could produce the same level of output less expensively by substituting labor

for materials. We explore the impact of restructuring on efficiency by specifying a

production function and then deriving the relevant input demand equations implied by cost

minimization.

       We adopt the convention of representing electric generating plant output (Q) by

the net energy the generating units produce over some period. This is measured by annual

megawatt-hours, MWh, in our data, as discussed in further detail in the data section

below. While many studies of generating plant productivity model this output as a


                                                                                              9
function of current inputs using a Cobb-Douglas production function, the characteristics of

electricity production argue strongly for an alternative specification. We derive a model

of production and cost minimization that is sensitive to important institutional

characteristics of electricity production that have been ignored in much of the earlier

literature.

         First, observed output in general will be the lesser of the output the plant is

prepared to produce given its available inputs (we call this probable output), and the

output called for by the system dispatcher (we call this actual output). Because the system

dispatcher must balance total production with demand at each moment, the gap between

probable (QP) and actual (QA) output for a given plant i will be a function of demand

realizations, the set of other plants available for dispatch, and plant i’s position in the

dispatch order.16

         Second, while fuel inputs are varied in response to real-time dispatching and

operational changes, other inputs to a plant’s production are determined in advance of

output realizations. Capital typically is chosen at the time of a unit’s construction (or

retirement), and at the plant level large capital changes are relatively infrequent. From the

manager’s perspective, it may be considered a fixed input. Utilities hire labor and set

operating and materials expenditures in advance, based on expected demand. While these

can be adjusted over the medium-run, staffing decisions as well as most maintenance

expenditures are not tied to short-run fluctuations in output.17 We therefore treat these as

set in advance of actual production, and determining a target level of probable output, QP.


16
   Random shocks to a plant’s operations, such as unexpected equipment failures or equipment that lasts
longer than expected, will cause it to produce less or more than its probable output from a set of available
inputs.
17
   In fact, over a short time period, maintenance and repair expenditures will be inversely related to output
since the boiler needs to be cool and the plant offline for most major work. We deal with this potential
simultaneity bias below.

                                                                                                                10
       Finally, while labor, materials, and capital may be to some extent substitutable to

produce probable output, the generation process generally does not allow these inputs to

substitute for fuel in the short-run. Given this description of the technology, we posit a

Leontief production process for plant i in year t of the following form:

(1)            QitA = min[ g(Eit, Γ E, εitE ), QitP(Ki, Lit, Mit, Γ P, εitP)·exp(εitA)]

where QA is actual output and QP is probable output; inputs are denoted by E for energy

(fuel) input, K for capital, L for labor, and M for materials; Γ denotes parameter vectors,

and ε denotes unobserved (to the econometrician) mean zero shocks. See Johannes Van

Biesebroeck (2003) for the derivation of a similar production function he uses to model

automobile assembly plant production.

       As noted above, fuel input decisions are made in real time, after the manager has

observed any shocks associated with the plant’s probable output productivity, εitP, the

actual operation of the plant, εitA, and the plant’s energy-specific productivity in the

current period, εitE . Probable output, QP, is in contrast determined by input decisions

made in advance of actual production. We assume that capital, measured by the

nameplate generating capacity of the plant, is fixed.18 Labor and materials decisions are

made in advance of production, but after the level and productivity of the plant’s capital is

observed. This reflects the quasi-fixity of these inputs over time: staffing decisions and

maintenance plans are designed to ensure that the plant is available when it is dispatched,

based on the targeted output QP. The error term εitP incorporates productivity shocks that

we assume are known to the plant manager in advance of scheduling labor and materials

inputs, but are not observable to the econometrician. We allow actual output to differ

from probable output by a multiplicative shock exp(εitA), assumed to be observed at the




                                                                                              11
time fuel input choices are made but not known at the time probable output is determined.

This shock would be, for example, negative if a generating unit were unexpectedly shut

down due to a mechanical failure, or positive if the plant were run more intensively than

anticipated, as might be the case if a number of plants ahead of it in the usual dispatch

order were unavailable or demand realizations were unexpectedly high.

        We model probable output (QP) as a Cobb-Douglas function of labor and

materials, embedding capital effects in a constant (Q0(K)) term. This yields the

specification:

(2)                QitP ≤ Q0(Ki)·(Lit)γL·(Mit)γM· exp(εitP)

In preliminary analysis, we estimated the parameters of the production function, including

terms that allowed for differential productivity under restructuring. Those results

suggested productivity gains associated with restructuring. The work reported here

imposes an additional constraint, based on cost-minimization, to estimate input demand

functions, and isolate possible restructuring effects on each measured input. A cost-

minimizing plant manager, facing wages Wit and material prices Sit, would solve for the

optimal inputs to produce probable output QitP by:

(3)     min        Wit·Lit + Sit·Mit             s.t. QitP ≤ Q0(Ki)·(Lit)γL·(Mit)γM·exp(εitP)

        Lit, Mit

yielding the following factor demand equations:

(4)                Lit = (λγL QitP)/Wit

(5)                Mit = (λγM QitP)/Sit

where λ is the Lagrangian on the production constraint.



18
  The empirical analysis defines a new plant-epoch, i, whenever there are significant changes in capacity, so
that within each plant-epoch, capacity is approximately constant.

                                                                                                          12
         We observe actual output, QitA = QitP exp(εitA), rather than probable output, QitP.

Making this substitution and taking logs of both sides, equation (2) becomes:

(6)      ln(Lit) = α0 + ln(QitA) – εitA – ln(Wit )

where α0 = ln(λγL).       If there are differences across plants, over time, or across regulatory

regimes in the coefficients of the production function (γL) or in the shadow value of the

probable output constraint (λ), or if there is measurement error in labor used at the plant,

this equation will hold with error. As we are particularly interested in changes in input

demand associated with restructuring, we expand the subscript it to irt to include plant i in

year t, and regulatory restructuring regime r, and re-write equation (6) as: 19

(7)      ln(Lirt) = ln(Qirt A) – ln(Wirt ) + αiL + δtL + φ r L – ε irt A + εirtL

where αiL measures a plant-specific component of labor demand, δtL captures year-specific

differences in labor demand, φ r L captures restructuring-specific shifts in labor demand,

and εirtL measures the remaining error in the labor input equation. α0 is now subsumed in

the plant-specific demand, αiL. Note that φ r L picks up mean residual changes in labor

input for a plant in a restructured regime relative to that plant overall and to all other

plants at the same point in time. It could reflect systematic changes in the marginal

productivity of labor (γL), in the shadow value of the availability constraint (λ) or in

optimization errors. 20

         Similarly, equation (5) becomes:

(8)               ln(Mirt) = ln(QrtA) – ln(Srt ) + αiM + δtM + φ r M – ε irt A + ε irtM

which is directly analogous to equation (7).


19
   Note that many plant-level differences, such as capital stock, and many time-varying shocks, such as
technology-neutral productivity shocks, drop out of this equation when we condition on output choice.
20
   If there are systematic differences in the relation of probable and actual output across restructuring, γ r L
may also reflect the change in mean εirt A. Since εirt A reflects shocks unobservable by the firm when setting
planned output, it seems plausible that these could be mean zero in expectation, but their realizations could
be nonzero in the restructuring sample we observe.

                                                                                                             13
        We model the energy component of the Leontief production function, which will

in general hold with equality, as:

(9)             QirtA = g(Eirt, γE, εE)

Assuming that g(•) is monotonically increasing in E, we can simply invert it to get an

expression for E in terms of Q. Note that the price of fuel does not enter into the demand

for fuel except through the level of output the plant is dispatched to produce. For

consistency with the other input specifications, we specify a log-log relationship:

(10)            ln(Eirt) = γQE ·ln(Qirt) + φ r E + αiE + δtE + εirtE

where as before, the plant-specific error, αiE, the year-specific error, δtE , and the

restructuring-specific term, φ r E , capture systematic changes in the efficiency with which

plants convert energy to electricity—that is, changes in plant heat rates—across plants,

over time, or correlated with restructuring activity, respectively.

        We confront two important endogeneity concerns in estimating the basic input

demand equations, (7), (8) and (10). The first is the possibility that shocks (ε irtL, ε irtM,

εirtE) in the input demand equations may be correlated with output. If output decisions are

made after a plant’s manager observes the plant’s efficiency, managers may increase

planned output in response to positive shocks to an input’s productivity, or reduce planned

output in response to negative shocks. This behavior would induce a correlation between

the error in the input demand equation and observed output. Though one can control

directly for plant-specific efficiency differences and for secular productivity shocks in a

given year, idiosyncratic shocks remain a source of possible bias. Second, the estimates

may be subject to selection bias if exit decisions are driven by unobserved productivity

shocks. In this case, negative shocks could lead to plant shutdown, implying that the

errors for observations we observe will be drawn from a truncated distribution. Neither of


                                                                                                 14
these problems is unique to our setting, and they have been raised in many earlier

papers.21

        Consider first the simultaneity issue. We face a potential simultaneity problem if,

for instance, a malfunctioning piece of equipment reduces the plant’s fuel efficiency,

leading the utility to reduce its operation of that plant and consequently to use less fuel.

There may be deviations from predetermined employment and materials budgets caused

by unanticipated breakdowns that require increased use of labor and repair expenditures

and result in lower output. A variety of methods have been used to address concerns

about simultaneity.22 We choose to use an instrumental variables approach, using a

measure of state-level electricity demand as an instrument for plant output. Geographic

electric generation markets are likely to be at least as broad as the state-level at the annual

frequency of our data. This demand is likely to be highly correlated with the amount of

output a plant will be called to provide, but uncorrelated, for instance, with how efficiently

an individual plant’s feedwater pumps are working. This approach is likely to be

particularly effective for the energy equation, given the responsiveness of energy input

choices to demand fluctuations in real time, and for identifying exogenous output

fluctuations at nonbaseload plants, which are more strongly influenced by marginal

swings in demand. It may be less powerful in identifying variation in ex ante labor and

maintenance choices, depending in part on the extent to which plant managers anticipate

state demand. We have explored the sensitivity of our results to a broad set of alternative

21
  Nerlove (1963) provides an early discussion of simultaneity bias in production functions. Olley and
Pakes (1996) propose a structural approach to addressing simultaneity, which is compared to alternatives in
Zvi Griliches and Jacques Mairesse (1998). Daniel A. Ackerberg et al. (2005) discuss this issue and
compare treatments proposed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and James Levinsohn and Amil Petrin (2003).
While many papers have estimated production or cost functions for electric generating plants, from the
classic analyses in Nerlove (1963) and Laurits R. Christensen and William H. Greene (1976) to very recent
work such as Andrew N. Kleit and Dek Terrell (2001) and Knittel (2002), electricity industry studies
typically have not treated either simultaneity or selection problems.


                                                                                                         15
instruments, including interactions of state demand with relative plant efficiency

(heatrates), fuel type, and load profile that allow for plant-level variation in the instrument

set, weather-related demand drivers (cooling and heating degree days), and lags in plant-

level output (similar to Richard Blundell and Stephen Bond, 1998 and 2000).23 The

results reported below are qualitatively robust to these alternatives.

        The potential selection issue is more difficult to address. The plants in our sample

are more stable than those studied in many other contexts (especially see Olley and Pakes,

1996), suggesting that the selection problem may be somewhat less severe for electric

generation. Exit in our sample is relatively rare, apart from exit induced when

restructuring-related divestitures remove the plant from the reporting database. Adverse

productivity shocks are much more likely to result in reduced run time than in plant

retirements for the large generating plants analyzed in this work. To the extent that the

divestitures were mandated by restructuring policies, these also should not create selection

problems. In all states where plant divestitures were part of the restructuring process

except New York, virtually all of the utility-owned fossil-fuel fired plants were divested,

suggesting that the extent and incidence of divestitures following restructuring are largely

nondiscretionary.24 To further gauge the significance of potential selection effects, we

have compared results for the unbalanced panel we use in the analysis to those for a panel

of plants that continue to operate through the end of our sample period, for which potential

selection effects are likely to be most severe. With one exception, the results from the

balanced panel are similar to the main results reported in this paper, suggesting there is

little to be gained from a more detailed treatment of potential selection biases.25

Identification strategy

         There is substantial spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the economic

environment in which electric utilities have operated. There are thousands of generating

plants operated by hundreds of utilities subject to regulation by dozens of political

jurisdictions each setting their own legal and institutional environment. Restructuring,

however, is not randomly assigned across political jurisdictions—earlier work suggests

that it is strongly correlated with higher than average electricity prices in the cross-

section.26 Fortunately, we have panel data on the costs and operations of most electric

generating plants from well before any restructuring until the present. This allows us to

construct benchmarks that we believe control for most of the potentially confounding

variation.

         The plant-specific effects, {αiN}, measure the mean use of input N at plant i

relative to other plants in the sample. These effects may be associated with differences in

plant technology type and vintage, ownership (government v. private utilities), and time-

invariant state effects. The year-specific shock, {δtN}, measures the efficiency impact of

sector-level shifts over time, such as secular technology trends, macroeconomic

fluctuations or energy price shocks. Restructuring effects on plant productivity


25
   The exception is the coefficient on an indicator for transition to RETAIL ACCESS competition. This
coefficient is smaller and statistically indistinguishable from zero in the balanced panel estimation of the
NONFUEL EXPENSE regression. This could be due to the fact that several of the states that implemented
retail access competition within our sample required generating plant divestitures. Divested plants generally
are exempt from publicly disclosing the data that we rely on in our analysis, eliminating them from the
balanced sample. The negative coefficient on RETAIL ACCESS in the full sample could reflect reduced
spending on NONFUEL EXPENSES by plants that are eventually divested, though there are too few
observations on divested plants to conclude this with any certainty.
26
   The significant role of sunk capital costs in regulatory ratemaking means that high prices do not
necessarily imply high operating costs for generation facilities within a state, however. See Joskow (1997)
for a discussion of the contributors to price variation across states.

                                                                                                          17
correspond to a nonzero {φrN}. Heterogeneity in the timing and outcomes of state-level

restructuring activity allow the data to distinguish between temporal shocks and

restructuring effects. While all states held hearings on possible restructuring, the earliest

was initiated in 1993 and the latest in 1998. There is considerable variation in the

outcome of those hearings, as well, with just under half the jurisdictions (23 states and the

District of Columbia) enacting restructuring legislation between 1996 and 2000.27 The

remainder considered and rejected, or considered and simply did not act on, such

legislation. This variation allows us to use changes in efficiency at plants in states that did

not pass restructuring legislation to identify restructuring separately from secular changes

in efficiency of generation plants over time.

        It is possible that plants in this control group also altered their behavior over the

post-1992 period. This could be due to the introduction or intensification of incentive

regulation within states that did not enact restructuring, to the expectation of potential

restructuring that did not occur, or to spillovers from restructuring movements in other

states (e.g. if regulators updated their information about the costs necessary to run plants

of a certain type, or multi-state utilities operating under differing regimes improved

efficiency of all their plants, not just those in restructuring states). To the extent this

occurs, our comparison will understate the magnitude of any efficiency effect of

restructuring.

        We therefore consider a second control group, consisting of cooperatively-owned

and publicly-owned municipal and federal plants, which for convenience we will refer to

collectively as municipal or “MUNI” plants, although the group is broader than strictly


27
  We collected information on state restructuring legislation from various Energy Information
Administration and National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners publications and state public
utility commission websites. Since 2000, no additional states have enacted restructuring legislation, and
several have delayed or suspended restructuring activity in response to the California crisis.

                                                                                                       18
implied by this label. An extensive literature has debated the relative efficiencies of

private and public ownership in this sector under traditional regulation, with quite mixed

results. We abstract from this by allowing for plant-specific effects that absorb any levels

differences in input use across ownership type. Restructuring generally altered the

competitive environment only for private investor-owned utilities within a state, leaving

those for publicly- and cooperatively-owned utilities unchanged.28 This suggests that

MUNIs may provide a second benchmark against which to measure changes in efficiency

associated with restructuring. To control for the possible divergence of publicly-owned

plant input use in the years preceding the restructuring period, we allow a separate

intercept shift for publicly-owned plants after 1987: MUNI*POST 1987.29 We then adopt

a parameterization that measures {φrN} relative to incremental differences at publicly-

owned plants during the period that investor-owned utilities are at risk of restructuring,

defined as 1993 forward, through inclusion of an indicator for MUNI*POST 1992.

        Using N to denote input (labor, nonfuel expenses, or fuel), and PRICEN to denote

the relevant input price (none for the fuel equation), we have input use equation (11):

(11)    ln(Nirt) = ln(QirtA) - ln(PRICENirt ) + γ87 MUNI*POST1987it +

                  γ92 MUNI*POST1992it + αiN + δtN + φr N – ε irt A + ε irtN

        Base differences in input use across each investor-, publicly-, or cooperatively-

owned plant are embedded in the plant fixed effects, {αiN}. All plants experience

common annual changes in input use measured by the time effects, {δtN}; publicly-owned

plants may experience a differential mean shift from these effects following 1987.

28
   Arizona and Arkansas, which included government-owned utilities in restructuring programs, are the two
exceptions.
29
   In Figures 1 and 2, we report nonparametric time paths for IOU and MUNI plant efficiency that suggest
some divergence between the groups prior to the beginning of state restructuring. While the designation of
1988-1992 as a transition period before restructuring is somewhat arbitrary, it serves as a conservative


                                                                                                        19
Restructuring effects are measured by the difference-in-differences in two implicit

“nontreatment groups” to which investor-owned plants in restructuring regimes may be

compared: investor-owned plants in non-restructuring regimes over 1993-1999 (with the

IOU restructuring effect measured by φ rN), and MUNI plants over 1993-1999 (with the

IOU restructuring effect measured by φ r N – γ92).

III. Data & Summary Statistics

         The analysis in this paper is based on annual plant-level data for large fossil-fueled

generating plants owned by U.S. electric utilities. Plants are comprised of at least one, but

typically several, generating units, which may be added to or retired from service over the

several-decade life of a generating plant. While an ideal dataset would allow us to explore

efficiency at the generating unit level, inputs other than fuel are not available at the

generating unit level. Some inputs, such as employees, are not assignable to a unit as they

are shared across units at the plant.30 We therefore use a plant-year as an observation.

         The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) collects data for investor-

owned utility plants annually in the FERC Form 1, and the EIA and Rural Utilities Service

(RUS) collect similar data for municipally-owned plants and rural electric cooperatives,

respectively. These data include operating statistics such as size of the plant, fuel usage,

percentage ownership held by the operator and other owners, number of employees,

capacity factor, operating expense, year built, and many other plant-level statistics. Our

base dataset includes all large fossil-fuel steam and combined cycle gas turbine generating




control for pre-period relative changes and is broadly reflective of policy transitions during the mid-1980s
and early 1990s (Joskow, 1997).
30
   Some labor may be shared across multiple plants, though assigned to one particular plant in our data.
This will induce measurement error, particularly in our plant employment variable.

                                                                                                           20
plants for which data were reported to FERC, EIA or RUS over the 1981 through 1999

period.31 Further details on data construction are provided in the data appendix.

         We follow the literature in characterizing output by the total energy output of the

plant over the year, measured by annual net megawatt-hours of electricity generation, NET

MWH. This is an imperfect choice. Output is, in reality, multidimensional, although most

dimensions are not recorded in the plant data. For example, generating plants may also

provide reliability services (such as spinning reserves, when the plant stands ready to

increase output at short notice), voltage support and frequency control. While the

production process varies considerably across these different outputs, only net generation

is well-measured in the data.32

         More importantly, electricity output is not a homogenous product. The availability

of the plant may be an important modifier of output quality. Because electricity is not

storable, firms must decide how to balance the costs associated with taking their plant

down to do maintenance against the probability that a poorly maintained plant will fail

during peak demand hours. Changes in incentives associated with restructuring may have

altered firms’ assessments of these tradeoffs, although the expected direction of the effects

is theoretically ambiguous.33 Hourly output prices and output from individual plants

might allow us to better assess this. Lacking such data, we rely on a single output

dimension, while acknowledging its limitations.

31
   One unfortunate consequence of restructuring is that available data on plants sold by utilities to nonutility
generators are extremely limited after the sale, due to changed reporting requirements. This means that
plants will be excluded from our dataset after such sales.
32
   The inputs required to produce a given level of energy (MWh) from a specific plant also will depend on
whether the plant runs continuously or intermittently and on its average capacity utilization. Starting a plant
frequently and running it at low capacity utilization rates typically use more inputs (particularly fuel) per
MWh generated than does running a plant continuously at its rated capacity.
33
   For instance, under traditional regulation, utilities may have faced strong political incentives to avoid
blackouts or brownouts, leading to investment in greater capacity to increase reserve margins and in greater
maintenance resources to increase plant reliability. On the other hand, competitive firms producing in


                                                                                                             21
         We have information on three variable inputs. The first, EMPLOYEES, is a count

of full-time equivalent employees at the plant. The second, NONFUEL EXPENSE,

includes all nonfuel operations and maintenance expenses, such as those for coolants,

repairs, maintenance supervision and engineering. This variable is less than ideal as a

measure of materials, both because it reflects expenditures rather than quantities, and

because it includes the wage bill for the employees counted in EMPLOYEES, although

that expense is not separately delineated in our data. As NONFUEL EXPENSES includes

payroll costs, both this and EMPLOYEES will reflect changes in staffing.34 The third

input is the quantity of fuel consumed by type of fuel (tons of coal, barrels of oil, and mcf

of natural gas). We convert fuel into BTUs using the reported annual plant-specific Btu

content of each fuel to obtain total BTU input at the plant for each year.

         Input prices pose a challenge. We do not observe firm- or plant-level wages.

Our basic specifications use the variable WAGE, reflecting the Bureau of Labor Statistics

state-level average utility wage by ownership type: investor-owned or publicly-owned.

For MUNI plants in states without a publicly-owned utility wage series, we impute wage

to be the product of investor-owned utility wages for that state and the average ratio of

publicly- to investor-owned utility wages overall. This variable is problematic: not only

does it measure firm-specific wages with error, but it is susceptible to the potential

endogeneity of wages to the regulatory environment.35 We have experimented with


restructured wholesale markets may face even stronger incentives to be available when demand peaks
because this is when prices are highest.
34
   The elasticity of NONFUEL EXPENSES with respect to EMPLOYEES is about .5 in our data, broadly
consistent with our back of the envelope calculations suggesting that labor costs are roughly half of the total
nonfuel operating budget.
35
   Hendricks (1975) suggests that utilities may bargain less aggressively over input prices such as wages
during periods in which higher costs can be readily passed on to customers through higher regulated prices,
and more aggressively when the firm is likely to be the residual claimant to cost savings. In other industries,
regulatory reform has sometimes been associated with substantial reductions in wages, suggesting rent-
sharing under regulation (see Nancy L. Rose, 1987, on the trucking industry). Moreover, electricity workers
tend to be highly unionized, and unions may bargain over employment terms as well as wages. These

                                                                                                            22
specifications that instrument for utility wages with the state average wages of workers in

comparable labor markets, including natural gas distribution, petroleum refining and

hazardous waste treatment facilities. While this instrument may in theory better reflect an

exogenous opportunity wage for workers at power plants, the results using this are much

noisier (though the non-WAGE coefficients are not materially affected). We therefore use

WAGE in our basic specifications. We do not have reasonable indices for the materials

prices that comprise NONFUEL EXPENSES, even at the state-industry level. Our

empirical model of NONFUEL EXPENSES therefore corresponds to an input demand

equation with constant real relative prices and a price coefficient of one.

        The final input is the capital stock of the plant, which we measure by plant

capacity and vintage. Our data record the plant capacity in megawatts. We combine this

with information on unit retirements to define plant-epochs. Each plant is assigned a

unique identifier. Any time the capacity of the plant is significantly changed, we create a

new identifier and associated new plant-epoch specific effect. This allows capital changes

to alter the underlying input efficiency of the plant. There may be variation within plant-

epoch when “scrubbers” (flue-gas desulfurization systems, or FGDs), are installed to

reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by some coal plants. SCRUBBERs affect the

environmental output, unmeasured by ln(NET MWH), which may suggest less efficient

operation conditional only on observed output. We therefore include a direct control for

the presence of a SCRUBBER.

        Operational plant data are supplemented with information on state-level

restructuring activity. For each state, we have identified (i) the date at which formal

hearings on restructuring began, (ii) the enactment date for legislation restructuring the


considerations suggest that observed wages may not be exogenous to the firm, and may not reflect the

                                                                                                       23
state’s utility sector, if any, (iii) the implementation date for retail access under that

legislation, and (iv) associated aspects of restructuring such as rate freezes and mandatory

divestiture of generation. Testing for restructuring-specific shocks requires a

determination of how to match this information with firm decisions: when were plant

operators in a given state likely to have begun responding to a policy change?

Consultations with industry participants and readings of these events suggest that utilities

often acted in advance of final legislative or regulatory outcomes. The process leading to

state restructuring typically lasted a number of years, allowing utilities to anticipate the

coming change, and alter their behavior in advance. For example, Boston Edison’s 10-K

filed in March 1994 discussed Massachusetts’ consideration of restructuring, stating “The

Company is responding to the current and anticipated competitive pressure with a

commitment to cost control and increased operating efficiency without sacrificing quality

of service or profitability” (Boston Edison, 1994, p. 6).36 Massachusetts had just begun

holding formal hearings on restructuring the industry in 1994. Utilities may have phased

input changes, especially those involving labor and particularly unionized workers.

Moreover, as policy changes were discussed, rates were frozen in many states, either

explicitly by policy makers or in effect by implicit PUC decisions not to hear new rate

cases, enabling utilities to capture the savings from incremental cost reductions.37


opportunity cost to managers of the marginal unit of labor.
36
   A similar theme was echoed by many other utility executives. For example, in a 1993 news story on
PECO’s early retirement plan, Chairman and CEO Joseph Paquette described “trying to improve the
company's competitive position by emphasizing a more productive work force. Employees are receiving
extensive training for quality, and the company is looking at modifying its salary structures to promote pay
for performance. Paquette said such programs are needed to help the company conduct business in an
evolving, less-regulated power generation environment. ‘We have to be prepared for this more competitive
world,’ he said” (“Philadelphia Electric: Cites Effect of Cost-Cutting Plan,” Dow Jones News Service, May
27, 1993).
37
   As noted earlier, some of these changes may have also affected utilities in non-restructuring states. For
example, the number of utility rate cases dropped dramatically in the 1990s, implying that many utilities
may have been short- or medium-run residual claimants to cost reductions. Knittel (2002) identifies a
number of incentive regulations adopted in various jurisdictions during the 1990s. Many of the fuel-related

                                                                                                          24
         In this work, we allow restructuring effects to begin with the opening of formal

hearings on restructuring. The primary variable of interest, RESTRUCTURED, is an

indicator variable that turns on for investor-owned plants with the start of formal

proceedings in a state that eventually passed restructuring legislation.38 If utilities did not

respond until restructuring legislation or regulation was enacted and the policy uncertainty

resolved, RESTRUCTURED will underestimate the true effect by averaging in

nonresponse years. To evaluate this possibility we introduce a second variable, LAW

PASSED, an indicator equal to one beginning in the year the state passes restructuring

legislation.39 A third variable, RETAIL ACCESS, indicates the start of retail access for

plants in the states that implemented retail competition within our sample.40 If actual

implementation of retail access and the associated wholesale market reforms is important

to efficiency gains, it will be reflected in an incremental effect of RETAIL ACCESS.

         To compare differences in the path of municipally-owned plants over the

restructuring time period, we define the indicator variables MUNI*POST 1987 and

MUNI*POST 1992. The first is equal to one for all non-investor-owned plants after 1987,



regulations (modified pass-through clauses, heat rate and equivalent availability factor incentive programs)
were strongly correlated with ultimate restructuring. Some of the broader regulations (e.g., price caps and
revenue decoupling programs) were almost orthogonal to eventual restructuring.
38
   The RESTRUCTURED variable is based on whether a state had passed legislation as of mid-2001. To
date, there has been no additional restructuring and some states have delayed or suspended planned
restructuring activity in the aftermath of the California electricity crisis. Plants are assigned to the state in
which they are regulated. A plant located in one state may be owned by a company with exclusive service
territory in a different state. In this case, the ownership state is the one for which the regulatory policy is
measured. Some plants are owned by a company with service territory in more than one state and some
plants are owned by several companies that are regulated by different states. In the regression analysis, we
found that separately characterizing “mixed” regulation and “shared” plants had very little impact on our
results.
39
   There is on average about a 2.6-year lag between the initiation of hearings and the passage of the law.
We have experimented with a number of alternative measures of restructuring activity, including variables
that begin with hearings regardless of restructuring outcomes, those that measure years since hearings were
initiated for states that eventually restructured, and the presence of restructuring-associated rate freezes.
None of these materially changes the conclusions we draw below.
40
   While RESTRUCTURED indicates approval of retail access competition, the specified phase-in of retail
access was often slow. Only seven states implemented retail access during our sample period, four in 1998
and three in 1999.

                                                                                                               25
the second for all non- IOU plants after 1992. MUNI*POST 1987 allows for the

possibility that relative input demand growth for IOU and publicly-owned plants diverged

in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when many states began to experiment with incentive

regulation and during which time the earliest discussion of increased competition took

place. MUNI*POST 1992 captures the incremental change in relative input demand

growth across IOUs and publicly-owned plants during the restructuring period. Because

the designation of the pre-reform period is inherently imperfect, we also report the

unrestricted annual time path of input demand growth (see Figures 1 and 2).

       Details on the data sources and summary statistics are provided in the data

appendix. Table 1 reports summary statistics for plant-level data in 1985 across three

categories: investor-owned plants in states that eventually restructured, investor-owned

plants in states that did not restructure, and non-IOU (MUNI) plants. We use 1985 to

ensure that comparisons are made prior to any significant changes across states in the

competitive or regulatory environment, even well before restructuring initiatives.

       This table suggests that the plants in these groups are not random draws from the

same population. The first three variables measure employees and nonfuel operating

expenses, scaled by the plant’s capacity, and fuel use in millions of British thermal units

(mmBtus), scaled by the plant’s output. In 1985, before state-level restructuring

initiatives were considered, IOU plants in states that eventually restructured used more

employees and nonfuel operating expenses per MW of capacity than did IOU plants in

non-restructuring states (see the difference in means test in column 4). Employment by

municipally-owned plants is not statistically distinguishable from employment at

restructuring IOU plants, but MUNI plants appear to have lower levels of nonfuel

expenses. Differences in heat rates and capacity factors are not significant for any cross-


                                                                                              26
sample comparison. The last four rows suggest notable differences in the stock of plants

across these three groups. Although IOU plants are very similar in size across regimes,

MUNI plants tend to be substantially smaller. IOU plants in restructuring states tend to be

older, more likely to use gas, and less likely to use coal, than their counterparts in non-

restructuring states. IOU plants in restructuring states also tend to be older and less likely

to use coal than their MUNI counterparts. The regression analysis will control for these

differences directly or with the use of plant-epoch effects.

         If investor-owned utilities achieved efficiency improvements when facing

impending restructuring of the generation sector, one would expect to see a relative

decrease in the cost of generation for affected companies, and little difference in the

change in transmission and distribution costs between the affected and not affected states

since restructuring programs leave transmission and distribution comparatively untouched.

If restructuring did not affect operating efficiency in the generation sector, we might

expect similar changes in generation expenses across restructuring and non-restructuring

companies, and perhaps similar patterns of cost changes across the transmission,

distribution, and generation sectors.

         Table 2 displays the mean changes in cost per MWh for investor-owned utilities in

restructuring and non-restructuring states between 1990 and 1996. 41 Unlike distribution

and transmission costs, generation costs per MWh decrease considerably over this period,

and by considerably more at companies in restructuring states, significant at the 6 percent

level. Moreover, the difference in cost changes across regimes is not significant for either

the transmission or distribution costs. These aggregate statistics may suggest that the

  For this analysis, we rely on data reported annually by utility companies to the FERC in the Form 1, page
320, 321, and 322 respectively. We use a balanced sample composed of all companies with data reported
for all three sectors in both 1990 and 1996. This amounts to 48 companies in states that did not restructure
and 72 in states that did restructure.

                                                                                                          27
division of the utility company faced with competition (the generating sector) responded

with a decrease in costs, while other sectors and companies not faced with competition did

not share this response.

IV. Estimating the Effects of Restructuring on Input Use

         Following equation (11), we estimate the influence of restructuring on the use of

input N (EMPLOYEES, NONFUEL EXPENSE, and BTUs) with the following basic

regression model:

(12)     ln(Nirt) = β1Nln(NET MWHirt) + β2Nln(PRICENirt ) + β3NSCRUBBERirt +

                   φ r NIOU*RESTRUCTUREDirt + γ87NMUNI*POST 1987irt +

                   γ92NMUNI*POST 1992irt + αiN + δtN + eirt

where we allow for nonunity coefficients on the output term (β1N ) for all equations and on

the input price term (β2N on WAGE) in the EMPLOYEES equation,42 and measure the

impact of having a scrubber on plant input use with the variable SCRUBBER. αiN is a

time-invariant fixed effect for input N at plant-epoch i, which may contain a state-specific

and ownership-specific error that will not be separately identified. These plant-specific

effects control for much of the expected variation in input use across plants arising from

heterogeneous technologies, state or regional fixed factors, and basic efficiency

differences. They also control for differences in the plant mix between restructuring and

non-restructuring states by comparing each plant to itself over time, removing any time-

invariant plant effects. As a Hausman test (Jerry Hausman, 1978) rejects the exogeneity

of the plant-epoch effects, all reported results include plant-epoch fixed-effects. δtN is an




42
  Recall that we do not have a price associated with nonfuel expenses, and that according to equation (10),
fuel prices should not enter into the fuel input function. We experimented with using a variable measuring
the price of a given plant’s fuel relative to the prices of other fuels in the same region as an instrument for
output but the variable had no power in the first stage.

                                                                                                             28
industry-level effect in year t, which controls for systematic changes in input demand

common to all plants in that year.

         The error term, eirt, combines the deviation of actual from probable output, β1Nε irtA,

and the input N-specific productivity shock to plant i in regime r at time t, εirtN. This error

is unlikely to be independent over time for a given plant; the data suggest considerable

persistence in input shocks, particularly for labor, from year to year. The estimated rho

assuming a first-order serial correlation process ranges from roughly 0.33 for nonfuel

expenses to 0.75 for labor. As discussed earlier, the estimation must also account for

endogeneity of output, measured in these specifications as the net generation by the plant

in megawatt-hours (NET MWH). We therefore implement a GLS-IV estimation strategy,

using a Prais-Winsten GLS correction for first-order serial correlation at the plant level,43

and instrumenting for plant output with a nonlinear function of state demand (the log of

total state electricity sales, which is a consumption rather than production measure). 44

         We consider specifications that include interactions of IOU ownership with the

three primary restructuring indicator variables described in section III:

RESTRUCTURED, LAW PASSED, and RETAIL ACCESS. In the input regressions, a

negative coefficient on the restructuring variables would imply increased input efficiency

associated with the regulatory reform. The core results for the input analysis are presented

in table 3 for EMPLOYEES, table 4 for NONFUEL EXPENSES and table 5 for BTU. We

first discuss the results for employment and nonfuel expenses, and then discuss the results

for fuel use.


43
  Reported standard errors also correct for possible correlation across observations at the state-year level.
44
  State demand is an important determinant of plant-level output, but should be unaffected by plant
productivity shocks. The F-statistic on the instrument from the first stage estimates for the NONFUEL
EXPENSE and BTU specifications (i.e. excluding the WAGE variable) is 11.9. We have explored the
sensitivity of our results to alternative instrument choices; these are reported in the FRW (2007) Technical
Appendix.

                                                                                                            29
         Column 1 of tables 3 and 4 reports results from generalized least squares (GLS)

estimation of our basic specification, treating plant output as exogenous. The primary

coefficient of interest, IOU*RESTRUCTURED, captures the mean differential in input use

for investor-owned plants in states that eventually pass restructuring legislation. This is ,

measured over the period following the first restructuring hearings, relative to the

untreated IOU plants in non-restructuring states. The results suggest statistically and

economically significant declines in input use associated with regulatory restructuring.

Employment declines by roughly 3 percent (1 percent standard error) and nonfuel

expenses decline by roughly 9 percent (2 percent standard error),45 relative to IOU plants

in regimes that have not restructured.46

         The second notable result is the dependence of the implied restructuring effect on

the control group. While IOU plants in restructuring states exhibit modest reductions in

employment and nonfuel expenses relative to IOUs in non-restructuring states, the implied

reductions are substantially larger when compared to public and cooperative plants. The

positive MUNI*POST 1987 coefficients suggest that all IOU plants improved their

efficiency relative to MUNI plants during the late 1980s and early 1990s. This gap

widened further after 1992 (see MUNI*POST 1992). This suggests that even IOU plants

in non-restructuring regimes improved their relative input use to a significant extent,

perhaps in response to latent threats of increased competition and restructuring.

Employment use was 6 percent lower for IOU plants in restructuring states relative to


45
   We use [exp(φ r N )-1]*100 to approximate the implied percentage effect of IOU* RESTRUCTURED on
input use.
46
   Note that the Cobb-Douglas functional form assumption for labor and nonfuel expenses suggests that the
coefficient on output should be one, substantially larger than the coefficients estimated in these regressions.
We have estimated production functions in EMPLOYEES and NONFUEL EXPENSES using more flexible
functional forms than Cobb-Douglas, and the results also suggest efficiency gains associated with
restructuring. We have also estimated instrumental variables versions of equations (7) and (8) that include
the other input instead of output and obtained very similar results to those reported here.

                                                                                                             30
MUNI plants after 1992, and nonfuel expenses declined by 11 percent relative to the

MUNI benchmark (computed as the IOU*RESTRUCTURED minus MUNI*POST 1992

coefficients in tables 3 and 4).     We return to this issue in greater detail below.

        The remaining columns in each table report instrumental variables (GLS-IV)

estimates of the input equations that treat potential measurement error and simultaneity

bias with respect to output, as well as serial correlation of shocks. For EMPLOYEES,

estimates of the output coefficient almost double relative to the GLS estimates, although

the imprecision of the GLS-IV estimates make it impossible to reject equivalence, and in

absolute magnitude, both estimates of the labor demand elasticity with respect to output

are quite small, at 4 percent (0.5 percent standard error) for GLS and 7 percent (7 percent

standard error) for GLS-IV.        Consistent with this, the estimated effect of restructuring on

labor demand is essentially unaffected by the treatment of output exogeneity. For

NONFUEL EXPENSES, however, instrumenting for output increases its estimated

elasticity more than fourfold, to over 50 percent (9 percent standard error). This is

consistent with a negative correlation of input shocks and output, as for example, if large

maintenance expenditures are associated with outages at the plant. With the strong link

between output and nonfuel expenses implied by these results, correcting for output

endogeneity also has a substantial effect on the estimated effect of restructuring. The

estimated coefficient on the IOU*RESTRUCTURED coefficient drops by almost half, to

-5 percent (2.6 percent standard error), bringing it into the range of the estimated labor

input effect.

        Columns 3 and 4 of the tables explore robustness to alternative measures of

restructuring, maintaining the use of GLS-IV estimates. Measuring restructuring by LAW

PASSED in column 3 yields smaller (and statistically indistinguishable from zero)


                                                                                               31
coefficients in both the employment and the nonfuel expense regressions, perhaps because

the baseline period now includes efficiency improvements made between the initiation

and passage of legislation. Column 4 adds the RETAIL ACCESS variable. We note that

its coefficient is identified by no more than two years of data in the seven states that

implement retail access as of 1999, and it is not particularly stable across alternative

instrument sets or to changes in the sample. In these basic specifications, the coefficient

on RETAIL ACCESS in labor demand is quite imprecisely estimated, though the point

estimate suggests an additional –3 percent (5 percent standard error) change in

employment when states implement retail access. The estimated impact of retail access on

nonfuel expenses is substantially larger, at -17 percent (6.5 percent), though its sensitivity

to balancing the sample precludes confidence in the estimate (see footnote 25).

        Finally, in column 5 of each table, we report results that use an alternative measure

of competitive pressure. Policy changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s set the stage for

increased nonutility generation, but the impact of that change varied substantially across

states. We construct an indicator, HIGH NONUTILITY GENERATION, which turns on in

1993 if the plant is in a state that has above median penetration of nonutility generation as

of 1993. This measure should capture any utility responses to higher intensity of actual

generation competition from unregulated market participants.47 The estimated impact of

high levels of nonutility generation on employment at IOU plants is slightly smaller and

noisier than RESTRUCTURED estimates (at -2.2 percent, standard error, 1.9 percent). For

nonfuel expenses, high penetration by non utility generation appears to have no detectable

direct effect on IOU plant input use (-1 percent, standard error, 3 percent).



47
  We include this in column 5 as a replacement for restructuring policy variables, but have also estimated
models that include direct effects of RESTRUCTURED and HIGH NONUTILITY GENERATION as well as
their interaction.

                                                                                                        32
           In the instrumental variables results, as in the GLS results, the implied magnitude

of the restructuring effect depends upon the chosen benchmark or control group. The gap

in IOU input demand between restructuring and non-restructuring states, conditional on

output, is generally statistically and economically significant, though relatively modest.

The performance gain of an IOU plant in a restructured regime relative to MUNI plants

over the same period is larger, on the order of 6 percent reductions in employment and 12

percent reductions in nonfuel expenses.48

           To provide further insight into the question of benchmark group, we re-estimate

the basic model of column (4) without the IOU*RESTRUCTURED and MUNI*POST

1992 variables, but allowing for separate year effects for each of three categories of

plants: IOU plants in states that eventually restructure, IOU plants in states that do not

restructure, and MUNI plants. Figures 1 (employees) and 2 (nonfuel expenses) plot the

estimated year effects for each plant group. The figures suggest greater divergence

between MUNI and IOU plants in both input measures as the 1990s progress. As this is a

period of increasing competitive pressures and substantial movement toward restructuring,

these patterns suggest to us that there is considerable information in the MUNI benchmark

comparisons.

           Table 5 reports results from variants of our basic specification for fuel inputs. In

column 1, GLS results suggest an output elasticity well below unity (0.912, standard error

0.004), and an implied reduction in fuel use associated with IOU plants in restructuring

regimes (-1.4 percent, standard error 0.4 percent). Columns 2 through 5 report results for

specifications that instrument for output. The estimated output elasticity is quite close to,

and statistically indistinguishable from, unity. The estimated effects of restructuring or

48
     The results are robust to a variety of more flexible specifications of the MUNI controls over time and to

                                                                                                                 33
NON UTILITY GENERATION competition are all small and statistically indistinguishable

from zero (negative in columns 2 and 4, positive in columns 3 and 5). There is no

measurable effect of restructuring on fuel efficiency relative to IOU plants in non-

restructuring states. Nor is there evidence of significant differences between IOU plants

and MUNI plants. The MUNI *POST 1992 coefficient point estimates appear virtually

identical to the IOU restructuring coefficients, and are similarly indistinguishable from

zero.49

          While the data do not suggest gains in fuel efficiency from restructuring within our

sample, a caveat is in order. Although variations on the order of even 0.5 - 1.0 percent in

fuel productivity are economically significant, it may be difficult to measure these

sufficiently precisely with our aggregated data. Fuel efficiency at a plant is heavily

influenced by factors such as the allocation of output across units at a plant, the number of

times its units are stopped and started, and for how long the units were running below

their capacity. Our inability to measure or control for possible changes in these

operational characteristics may make it particularly difficult to capture any changes in fuel

efficiency. Improving our understanding of fuel efficiency effects seems an important

direction for future research.

Testing robustness of the RESTRUCTURED effect

          We have analyzed the robustness of these results to a variety of alternative

specifications of the input demand equations. We report selected results below;

additional robustness tests are available in our Technical Appendix. Given the null results




allowing differential MUNI output elasticity coefficients.
49
   We obtained similar null results when we estimated specifications using the log of plant heat rate
(BTUs/MWhs) as the dependent variable, controlling for output.

                                                                                                        34
in our basic fuel use regressions, we focus on labor and nonfuel expense input choices in

this analysis.

        Our first tests divide the sample along size and age lines; recall that these are the

dimensions on which MUNI plants appear to differ from IOU plants. In tables 6

(employees) and 7 (nonfuel expenses), we report results for “larger” versus “smaller”

plants (columns 1 and 2), and “old” versus “new” plants (columns 3 and 4). These are

relative cuts that divide the sample at roughly the median of size (575 MW) and the

median of age (oldest unit is built after 1960). For all specifications, IOU plants in

restructured regimes exhibit lower input use than do IOU plants in nonrestructured

regimes (see the coefficients on IOU*RESTRUCTURED), though the magnitude of the

estimated effect varies with the subsample. Estimated IOU restructuring effects suggest

very similar employment reductions at LARGER and SMALLER plants and slightly greater

employment reductions at NEW plants than at OLD plants, though the point estimates are

not significantly different across the subsamples. Nonfuel expense reductions appear to

be greatest for LARGER and NEW plants—about twice the estimated magnitude for those

at SMALLER and OLD plants. More interesting, perhaps, is the comparison to MUNI

plants. They appear indistinguishable from IOUs in input use at OLD plants (see column

3 of both tables) and in employment at LARGER plants. For newer and SMALLER plants

(where the MUNI density is greatest), the post-1992 performance gap is at least as large as

in the previous tables. It is difficult to tell whether the patterns in these subsamples reflect

real differences or a greater ability of the data to pin down performance effects for the

denser part of the sample. Moreover, it does not appear that the overall conclusions of the

earlier tables with respect to the MUNI benchmark are substantially affected by these

sample differences.


                                                                                                35
           In table 8, we consider whether the results are explained by a regression to the

mean phenomenon among IOU plants: is the gain in efficiency among plants in

restructuring regimes because they had on average low productivity draws prior to

restructuring, and simply return to mean efficiency over time? To examine this, we

identify high- and low-input use plants and investigate the extent to which efficiency gains

at the higher input use plants are offset by efficiency losses at low input use plants. To

separate plants into “low input” and “high input” categories, we predict input use from a

regression on data for the pre-restructuring period, 1981 – 1992. We calculate the mean

residual for each plant and classify plants with mean residuals above zero as “HIGH

INPUT” and those below zero as “LOW INPUT.” We then interact these indicators with

the restructuring variables, which are post-1992, and re-run the basic regression

specification allowing input responsiveness to restructuring to differ across plant type.50

           The results in table 8 suggest that most of the restructuring-related input declines

relative to IOU plants in nonrestructured regimes are associated with high input-use IOU

plants, with reductions in the neighborhood of 10 percent to 12 percent (standard errors,

about 3 percent) for both labor and nonfuel expenses for these plants. The coefficients on

the IOU*RESTRUCTURED*LOW INPUT interactions are economically and statistically

indistinguishable from zero, contrary to mean reversion predictions. This may suggest

that the form of efficiency improvement was to bring less efficient plants into line with

more efficient plants. This is consistent with discussions we have had with several utility

managers, who claimed that restructuring led their firms to identify high-cost plants as

those disadvantaged in the dispatch order, and to focus attention on bringing the costs of

those plants closer to an efficient benchmark plant. Interestingly, the MUNI benchmark


50
     The direct effects of LOW INPUT and HIGH INPUT categories are absorbed in the plant fixed effects.

                                                                                                          36
suggests that LOW INPUT MUNI plants became more expensive, with little relative

change at the HIGH INPUT MUNI plants after 1992.

         We have implemented a number of additional robustness checks, including

alternative instruments and instrument strategies and more flexible dynamics in input

choice. A more complete discussion and example results are available in our Technical

Appendix. Of particular note were specifications that allow for the possibility of fixed

costs of input adjustments. We find that the restructuring estimates are robust to allowing

inputs to respond to future as well as current output levels. Lagged values of output

(following Blundell and Bond, 1998, 2000) proved to be weak instruments in our GLS-IV

model.

V. Conclusion

         This research provides some of the first estimates of the impact of electricity

generation sector restructuring in the United States on plant-level efficiency. The results

suggest restructuring may yield substantive medium-run efficiency gains. The estimates

suggests that IOU plants in restructuring regimes reduced their labor and nonfuel

operating expenses by three to five percent in anticipation of increased competition in

electricity generation, relative to IOU plants in states that did not restructure their markets.

The estimated efficiency gains are even larger when compared to a benchmark based on

municipal, federal, and cooperative plants: on the order of six percent reductions in labor

use and twelve percent reductions in nonfuel operating expenses relative to non-IOU

plants over the same time period. There is little evidence of increases in fuel efficiency

relative to plants in non-restructuring regimes, although the power of these tests is limited

given the plausible range of possible fuel use improvements.




                                                                                             37
        These same-plant reductions in input use suggest an important role for market-

based incentives and competition in promoting technical efficiency, buttressing the

findings of Nickell (1996), Ng and Seabright (2001), and Galdón-Sánchez and Schmitz

(2002), among others. This finding is particularly interesting given the industry context.

Generating plant technology is reasonably well understood by engineers, and the pre-

restructuring industry was remarkably open in sharing detailed information on plant

operations and input use across plants and firms.51 Presumably, external benchmarks also

were more accessible in this setting than in most industries. This could suggest that

competition induced greater effort on cost reduction by increasing the sensitivity of

returns to managerial and worker effort, rather than by reducing informational

asymmetries over managerial effort (Nickell, 1996).

        Additional work remains to be done to fill out the picture of the overall effects of

restructuring on electricity industry efficiency.52 We began by looking at operating

efficiency within existing utility plants both because this is one of the few places where

gains are likely to show up before restructured wholesale markets open up and because

rich data are available on utility-owned plants. As our results suggest, even these data are

inadequate for the fine-level analysis required to estimate within and across-plant changes

in fuel efficiency. This analysis will require datasets with both cleaner measures of fuel

efficiency and richer information on independent factors that affect fuel use. Finally,

assessing whether investment decisions are made more efficiently after restructuring

requires more time, and access to better nonutility data. Since power plants are so long-




51
  Our access to detailed, publicly-available, plant-identifiable data corroborates this.

  See Wolfram (2005) for a discussion of the general issues involved in assessing different types of
efficiency changes accompany electricity restructuring.

                                                                                                       38
lived, very few new additions are made each year, and currently we have no more than a

handful of anecdotes about investment after restructuring.

        It is important to recognize that these efficiency estimates are, however, only one

input to judging the ultimate benefit of restructuring policies. The overall assessment

depends as well on the realized magnitude of potential dynamic efficiencies, and

offsetting effects from higher investment expenditures, restructuring costs, the loss of

coordination and network economies within vertically integrated systems, and the exercise

of market power in unregulated generation markets. Dynamic costs could be higher if

restructuring reduces knowledge sharing that affects productivity growth over time. It is

possible, however, that longer run benefits will be greater if firms respond to the new

incentives created by restructuring with investments in both human and physical capital

that further enhance efficiency. If California’s crisis does not induce reversals of the

restructuring movement, and regulators do not shut down data reporting and researcher

access to detailed plant-level data, time may enable us to distinguish among these

possibilities.

Sample Construction:

         This study analyzes productivity for large fossil-fueled steam turbine or combined cycle

plants. The core data source is the Utility Data Institute (UDI) O&M Production Cost Database.

UDI develops this from the annual FERC Form 1 (filed by investor-owned utilities), EIA Form 412

(filed by municipal and other government utilities), and RUS Form 7 & 12 (filed by electric

cooperatives) filings. We construct the sample used in the empirical analysis as follows:

Plant type: We exclude alternative fuel plants (wood, geothermal, waste; 14 plants, 196 plant-

years). We restrict the sample to steam turbine (ST) and combined cycle (CC) plants, based on the

variable OMPTYPE in the UDI database. This excludes 564 combustion (gas) turbine only (GT)

plants, 6487 plant-year observations. 53

Plant-epoch: Plant-epochs consist of plant-years over which plant capacity is relatively constant, i.e.

reported capacity changes are less than 40 MW and 15 percent.

Plant size: We retain plant-year observations as long as they are part of a plant-epoch with mean

capacity (gross megawatts) above 100 MW and at least 3 years of operations at a scale above 100

MW. The mean capacity test excludes 229 plant-epochs (186 plants, 2142 plant-years); the 3-year

operations test excludes an additional 117 plant-epochs (171 plant-years). The latter test also

excludes plant-epochs for which we only have one or two years of data, typically plants that add or

retire capacity near the beginning or end of our sample period. Excluding these seemed appropriate


53
  Most of these are small; the majority report incomplete data. In many cases, these appear (based on plant names and
locations) to report information for auxiliary gas turbines located on the same site as units with large steam turbines:
e.g., Alamitos, a 1900 MW plant with 6 steam units and Alamitos GT, a 140 MW jet engine unit are separate
observations in our dataset. The basic restructuring results are robust to including all large GT plant observations with
nonmissing data as additional plants, and to aggregating GT plant data with their identifiable associated base plants
(using plant name and location). See column (2) in tables T5 and T6 in the FRW (2007) Technical Appendix.

                                                                                        Data Appendix – page A1
given plant-epoch fixed effects and the Prais-Winsten-differenced GLS estimation techniques we

use.

Incomplete plant data: We drop 274 plant-years with missing or nonpositive output data; 80 plant-

years with missing or nonpositive nonfuel expenses; 204 plant-years with missing employment and

289 plant-years with zero reported employees. Observations excluded for missing data do not

seem to be directly related to restructuring, and in some cases are less frequent in restructuring

states, conditional on year.54

Outlier analysis: Stata’s dfbeta regression diagnostics were used to ensure that the results are

robust to outliers. The dfbeta statistic measures how much a coefficient estimate changes (relative

to its standard error) when an observation is omitted. For the basic employment and nonfuel

expense model, we calculated dfbeta statistics for all observations for the variables ln(NET MWH ),

SCRUBBER, ln(WAGE) for the employment input model, IOU*RESTRUCTURED, MUNI*POST

1992, and MUNI*POST 1987. We excluded 148 observations that moved coefficient estimates in

either or both of the employment or the nonfuel regressions by more than 0.1 standard errors. We

found little evidence of a pattern in the observations that are dropped this way. For instance, we

drop at least 4 observations from every year, and the most observations dropped from any year are

21 from 1998. These deletions change the coefficient point estimates relatively little and serve

mainly to clean the data of extreme outliers that inflate the standard errors, as reported in columns

(3) and (4) of our Technical Appendix tables T5 and T6. We note that the coefficient on

IOU*RESTRUCTURED in the labor input equation changes only slightly (from 0.31 in our basic

  For example, regression of the percent of plants in a state-year observation with missing or zero employee data on
time since restructuring indicator (min (0, the number of years since the start of formal hearings in the state), year
dummy variables, and state fixed effects suggests that the percentage of such missing values actually decreases
following restructuring.

specification on the trimmed sample to 0.26 in the untrimmed sample) though it is significantly

distinguishable from zero only at the 11 percent level for the untrimmed sample.

       The resulting basic dataset consists of 10,079 observations on 647 plants, allocated to 779

plant-epochs.

Fuel Input Dataset: The fuel input dataset begins with the basic dataset described above. We

eliminate observations with missing fuel data and apply Stata’s dfbeta regression diagnostics to an

estimate of the fuel input equation, using a process and thresholds similar to that described for

employment and nonfuel expenses. This resulted in deletion of an additional 77 observations.

Since most of the analysis that we report in the paper is based on the employment and nonfuel

specifications and since the fuel data appear considerably noisier, this smaller dataset is used only

for the fuel input analysis. It consists of 10,002 observations on 646 plants, 778 plant-epochs.
