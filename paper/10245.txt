A Scapegoat Model of Exchange Rate Fluctuations

                                           ABSTRACT

While empirical evidence finds only a weak relationship between nominal exchange rates and

macroeconomic fundamentals, forex markets participants often attribute exchange rate movements

to a macroeconomic variable. The variables that matter, however, appear to change over time and

some variable is typically taken as a scapegoat. For example, the current dollar weakness appears

to be caused almost exclusively by the large current account deficit, while its previous strength was

explained mainly by growth differentials. In this paper, we propose an explanation of this

phenomenon in a simple monetary model of the exchange rate with noisy rational expectations,

where investors have heterogeneous information on some structural parameter of the economy. In

this context, there may be rational confusion about the true source of exchange rate fluctuations, so

that if an unobservable variable affects the exchange rate, investors may attribute this movement to

some current macroeconomic fundamental. We show that this effect applies only to variables with

large imbalances. The model thus implies that the impact of macroeconomic variables on the

exchange rate changes over time.

1         Introduction


There is a peculiar mismatch between explanations given by market analysts for ob-

served exchange rate uctuations and the academic consensus about exchange rates.

The academic consensus, based on the seminal work of Richard A. Meese and Ken-

neth Rogo (1983) and subsequent literature, is that macroeconomic variables have

little explanatory power for exchange rates in the short to medium run. On the other

hand, market analysts often point to particular macro developments in accounting for

exchange rates. For example, the large depreciation of the euro relative to the dol-

lar subsequent to its inauguration in January 1999 was blamed on the strong growth

performance of the US economy relative to the European economy. More recently the

appreciation of the euro relative to the dollar has been blamed on the large U.S. cur-

rent account de cit.1 That practitioners regularly change the weight they attach to

di erent macro indicators is widely reported in the nancial press. It has also been

con rmed by Yin-Wong Cheung and Menzie Chinn (2001), who surveyed US foreign

exchange traders.

        The varying weight that traders give to di erent macro indicators may explain

why formal models of exchange rates have found so little explanatory power of macro

variables. In contrast to existing models, the relationship between macro variables and
    1
        For example, in the Financial Times of December 1, 2003, one can read: "The dollar's latest

stumble ... came despite optimistic economic data from the US. But analysts said the movement of

the US currency was no longer driven by growth fundamentals. All the focus is on the de cit now..."

the exchange rate appears to be highly unstable. Cheung et. al. (2002) nd that some

models, with certain macro variables, do well in some periods but not in others.

   One explanation for this parameter instability is a scapegoat story: some variable

is given an 'excessive' weight during some period. The exchange rate may change for

reasons that have nothing to do with observed macro fundamentals, for example due

to unobserved liquidity trades. As the market rationally searches for an explanation

for the observed exchange rate change, it may attribute it to some observed macro in-

dicator. This macro indicator then becomes a natural scapegoat and in uences trading

strategies. Over time di erent observed variables can be taken as scapegoats, so that

the weights attributed to macro variables change.

   In this paper we formalize this scapegoat story in the context of a simple rational

expectations model. The model illustrates how a variable can become a scapegoat and

illuminates the implications for the exchange rate. The basic mechanism behind this

scapegoat story is that there is \confusion" in the market about the true source of

exchange rate uctuations. This happens because investors have di erent views about

the importance of various observed macro variables. We model this heterogeneity

with investors receiving di erent private signals about some structural parameters.

Investors therefore do not know whether an exchange rate uctuation can be explained

by unobserved fundamentals, such as liquidity trades, or by a larger than expected

weight to certain observed macro fundamentals. In such an environment it is natural

to blame the variables you can observe, i.e., the macro fundamentals.



                                          2
    Although models with investor heterogeneity are common in the nance literature,

they have not often been used to analyze the foreign exchange market. In related

work, Philippe Bacchetta and Eric van Wincoop (2003), we develop a fully dynamic

macro model of exchange rate determination where investors have di erent information

about future macro variables. We show that such a framework can lead to a disconnect

between observed macro fundamentals and exchange rates in the short to medium

run, but a closer relationship in the long-run. In that paper it is assumed that all

investors know the model and its parameters. In contrast, here we assume that investors

are incompletely, and heterogeneously, informed about some parameters and therefore

about the importance of various macro indicators.

    In the next section we present a simple monetary model of the exchange rate,

where investors have di erent views about the growth rate of fundamental variables.

In Section 2, we show how the model is solved and how a scapegoat can emerge.

A crucial element is that investors use the exchange rate as a source of information

on imperfectly known parameters. In Section 3, we examine the implications for the

exchange rate and provide concluding comments in Section 4.




2     A Model with Heterogeneous Beliefs

Our starting point is the standard monetary model of exchange rate determination. It

contains three equations. The rst is a purchasing power parity equation: pt = pt + st ,

where st is the log of the nominal exchange rate. The second is a money demand


                                          3
equation: mt    pt = yt        it (and foreign analogue). The third is an interest arbitrage

equation:

                                                                    2
                                E t (st+1 )   s t = it   it + b t   t                      (1)

                                                                         2
Here E t denotes the average expectation of individual investors and     t   is the conditional

variance of next period's exchange rate. bt is the unobserved net supply of foreign

currency based on non-speculative trade (such as liquidity trades) and has a normal

                     2
distribution N (0;   b ).   This interest parity equation can be derived from a standard

portfolio choice model with constant absolute risk-aversion . We refer the reader to

Olivier Jeanne and Andrew K. Rose (2002) and Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2003)

for formal derivations.

   As usual, (1) is solved forward after substituting the purchasing power parity and

money demand equations, leading to an expression equating the current exchange rate

to the present value of expected future fundamentals. In our context, however, we are

dealing with average instead of single expectations. In Bacchetta and van Wincoop

(2003) we show that this implies that the law of iterated expectations may not hold and

that the exchange rate may depend on higher order expectations as in John Maynard

Keynes' beauty contest paradigm (average expectations of average expectations, and

so on). While the presence of higher order expectations has interesting implications

for asset price behavior in general (see Franklin Allen, Stephen Morris, and Hyun Song

Shin (2003), and Bacchetta and van Wincoop (2004)), we abstract from them in this

short paper by assuming that information heterogeneity lasts only one period.



                                                  4
   We assume that starting at date 2 investors have common information about future

output levels and money supplies. To keep things simple we assume that E 2 (mt ) =

E 2 (yt ) = 0 for t > 2 and that the foreign money supply and output level are zero at all

times. Since E 1 (bt ) = 0 for t > 2, we have E 1 (st ) = 0 for t > 2 (ruling out bubbles).

Then,
                          1                                                                 2
                  s1 =      (m1        y1 ) +                E 1 (m2         y2 )           1 b1             (2)
                         1+                       (1 + )2                              1+

The exchange rate depends on current and expected future macro fundamentals minus

a risk-premium term that depends on liquidity trade. Investors need to forecast money

and output at time 2. We assume the following autoregressive structure (applying only

at time 2):


                                m2        m =            m (m1         m) + "m
                                                                             2                               (3)

                                  y2      y =            y (y1        y) + "y2


with 0 <      j   < 0 and "j2   N (0;     2
                                          j ),   j = m; y. The persistence coe cients              m   and     y


are a key element of the model. The larger                       m,   the bigger the impact of the current

money supply on the exchange rate, and similarly for output. However, investors do

not know the persistence coe cients and only receive private signals about them:


                                   i
                                  vm =       m    + "im          "im      N (0;       2
                                                                                      v)


                                  vyi =     y    + "iy       "iy        N (0;    2
                                                                                 v)



We assume that errors in the private signals average to zero across all investors. We

can plug the expectation derived from (3) into (2) to get:

                                                                                      2

                                                                                 1+

                                       (m1       y1 ) + ~ (m         y). Equation (4) shows that the

exchange rate depends in a straightforward manner on the observable variables m1 and

y1 as well as the unobservable b1 . Moreover, it depends on the average expectations

of the persistence coe cients, E 1 (        m)   and E 1 ( y ). With heterogeneous information,

individual investors do not know these average expectations and cannot disentangle

shocks to b1 from shocks to E 1 (      m)   and E 1 ( y ). This di culty in the inference process

can lead to rational confusion, which in turn can lead to attributing the wrong weight

to fundamental variables.




3     Finding a Scapegoat

The equilibrium exchange rate can be solved with a simple signal extraction procedure.

Based on (4), we rst conjecture that the exchange rate takes the form


                        s 1 = q1 + ~   m (m1       m)           ~ y (y1   y)     b1               (5)


for some positive . The exchange rate depends linearly on the unknown persistence

coe cients   m   and    y,   and therefore provides a public signal of these parameters. It

is therefore optimal for individual investors to use both their private signals and the

exchange rate as basis for estimating         m   and     y.    We now describe the inference process

and the solution for the exchange rate in the case where y1 = y, so that investors are

                                                    6
only interested in estimating              m.       The more general case can be found in a Technical

Appendix available upon request.

      From (5), investors can use an adjusted exchange rate signal that is normally dis-
                s1 q1
tributed:    ~ (m1 m)
                      .   Since the private signal is also normal, the optimal inference of                       m


is a linear combination of the two signals. Aggregating the expectations of                                 m   over

individuals, we get:2

                                                                              s 1 q1
                                    E(   m)    =    v m     + (1      v)                                         (6)
                                                                           ~ (m1 m)

where 0 <        v   < 1 depends on the (endogenous) relative precision of private and
                                         1=    2
public signals (     v    =   (1=   2
                                               v
                                               m)2 =    2 2)   ). A crucial element in the analysis is that
                                    v )+((m1              b


the expectation of         m   depends on the value of the exchange rate. Using (5), one can

substitute s1 to obtain:

                                         E(        m)   =   m       k(m1    m)b1                                 (7)

                  (1 v )
where k =       ~ (m1 m)2
                               > 0. It is easily veri ed that the conjectured equation (5) is

                                                                                   2
con rmed if one substitutes (7) into (4), with                         =   1+      1= v.


      Equation (7) illustrates how an observed macro variable can become a scapegoat.

Investors know that the equilibrium exchange rate takes the form (5). While they

know the functional form, they do not know the persistence                                 m   and liquidity trades

b1 . When an investor sees that the exchange rate is higher than expected based on the

private signal of persistence, there can be only two explanations: either unobserved

liquidity sales have reduced b1 or the persistence coe cient di ers from the private

  2                                                       i
      Here we use the fact that summing over the signals vm gives                  m.



                                                                7
signal. In the case where money supply is large, so that m1               m is large, a high

exchange rate can then be explained by a large persistence coe cient. The reason is

that more persistence leads to a bigger expected second period money supply when

the money supply is above its mean in period 1.

   Now assume that the high level of the exchange rate is actually caused by liquidity

trades. It then becomes rational to make money the scapegoat when the money supply

is unusually large. Even if investors do not believe that the high money supply will be

so persistent based on their private information, they will each believe that others have

private signals indicating that money supply is persistent. The scapegoat is captured

by (7), which shows that the expected persistence rises when b1 < 0 and m1             m > 0.

   The rational confusion that leads to making money the scapegoat is market-wide.

Based on private information alone the average expectation of              m   is equal to   m.


However, when b1 < 0 and m1 m > 0 investors systematically, and incorrectly, believe

that   m   is larger than it actually is. They all believe that others must have information

indicating that     m   is very large, even if no investor actually has such information.

   Output can similarly become a scapegoat. The Technical Appendix shows that

if y1 6= y we have E( y ) =                e
                                         + k(y     y)b1 . If the exchange rate is high due to
                                     y         1


liquidity trades and output is below its mean (y1            y < 0), investors revise upward

their expectation of       y   and output becomes a scapegoat. The larger the deviations

from the mean, the more likely it is to blame one of the macro variables.

4         The Scapegoat E ect on Exchange Rates

When a macro variable becomes a scapegoat, it has a much larger impact on the

exchange rate than otherwise due to confusion with liquidity trade. In this regard an

                                                                    2
important role is played by the parameter              =      1+    1= v   that multiplies liquidity trade

in the equilibrium exchange rate. This coe cient is larger than in the risk-premium

term in (2) or (4) because           v   < 1. This implies that the impact of b1 is ampli ed with

heterogeneous information.3 More important in our context, it is easy to check that

depends positively on (m1             m)2 . In other words, @ =@(m1            m)2 > 0. If the deviation

of money from its mean is large, there is more rational confusion that leads to a bigger

ampli cation of the impact of liquidity trade on the exchange rate.

        The impact of current money supply on the exchange rate is found by di erentiating

(5):
                                 @s1    1
                                     =            +~      m        (m1     m)b1                       (8)
                                 @m1   1+

where         = 2@ =@(m1         m)2 > 0. The impact of m1 therefore depends on b1 . For

example, if m1 > m a negative b1 increases the impact of m1 .

        With no liquidity shocks the derivative of the exchange rate with respect to money

                      1
would be only        1+
                          +~    m,   the same as it would be under perfect foresight. A similar

impact obtains if money supply is close to its normal level m. It is the interplay

between the unobserved liquidity trades and the unusual size of the money supply that
    3
        This ampli cation of shocks is similar to the one discussed in detail in Bacchetta and van Wincoop

(2003).

delivers the scapegoat e ect and its increased weight in the equilibrium exchange rate.

    The derivative in (8) is not known to market participants since          m   is unknown.

One can compute the average expectation of (8), by using (5) to (7) (see the Technical

Appendix for details). This gives

                        @s1    1
                    E       =       +~   m        (   v   + ~ k)(m1   m)b1               (9)
                        @m1   1+

Clearly, the same reasoning applies to the perceived impact of m1 on s1 as to the actual

impact. The reason is that   m   is expected to be larger than it actually is when m1 is

large and b1 is negative.

    We conclude this section with two remarks. First, it is worth noting that when the

impact of money on the exchange rate is large as a result of the scapegoat e ect, the

impact of liquidity trade is also magni ed. The rational confusion raises the impact of

both money shocks and liquidity trades. Second, we have focused on the case where

macro variables have increased weight. The opposite can also occur, for example,

when the exchange rate is high due to a negative b1 and the money supply is below

normal. On average, macro variables have the correct weight because on average b1 = 0.

However, this average weight may be small, so that observed macro variables do not

consistently contribute much to observed exchange rate volatility.




5     Conclusion

In this short paper we have developed a simple model to illuminate some implications

of information dispersion for the importance of macro variables in the equilibrium

                                             10
exchange rate. We have shown that when unobserved speculative trades are responsible

for an exchange rate depreciation, an unusually high money supply can easily be made

the scapegoat. We introduced only two macro fundamentals, money supply and output,

but in reality one can have a large number of such macro indicators. When a macro

fundamental becomes a scapegoat, its impact on the exchange rate can be much larger

than otherwise.

   While the model we adopted here is close to static in nature in order to keep

things simple, future work should naturally focus on a more dynamic model with

information heterogeneity of the sort described here. This can account for phenomena

such as parameter instability and changing weight given by investors to di erent macro

indicators.

6.1      Solving the model with inference on two parameters

In this Appendix we solve the case where m1 6= m and y1 6= y so that investors

make inference about both          m   and      y.   The reasoning with two variables can easily be

extended to a model with N variables and N signals. We start from equation (4) and

                                                                                                                     2 2
conjecture equation (5). Then s1                q1 is normally distributed with variance                               b   and

                                                                                           i

We can then use (14) to get equation (7), with its analogue for                                                                              1    e .

Substituting (14) into (4) gives:


                                                                         2

Solving for k and D gives:

       The next step is to compute                     1.    First, we assume that the conditional variance of

the exchange is a constant for t > 1, i.e. vart (st+1 ) =                                                      for t > 1.4 It is easy to see

that:

Thus, using (3) :

Given the de nition of D, it is easy to see that:

       This is justi ed by assuming that we are at a steady state, except for periods 1 and 2. Since

in general leads to two steady-state values. It can be shown, however, that only the smallest value is

6.2      Deriving Equations (8) and (9)

Here we specialize to one parameter,                     m,   so that Z = (m1                 m)2 . Notice also that in

    To get equation (9), using (5) gives:
