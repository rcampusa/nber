                                          ABSTRACT

We study how trade linkages affect the conduct of monetary policy in a two-country model with
heterogeneous firms, endogenous producer entry, and labor market frictions. We show that the
ability of the model to replicate key empirical regularities following trade integration---
synchronization of business cycles across trading partners and reallocation of market shares
toward more productive firms---is central to understanding how trade costs affect monetary
policy trade-offs. First, productivity gains through firm selection reduce the need of positive
inflation to correct long-run distortions. As a result, lower trade costs reduce the optimal average
inflation rate. Second, as stronger trade linkages increase business cycle synchronization,
country-specific shocks have more global consequences. Thus, the optimal stabilization policy
remains inward looking. By contrast, sub-optimal, inward-looking stabilization---for instance too
narrow a focus on price stability---results in larger welfare costs when trade linkages are strong
due to inefficient fluctuations in cross-country aggregate demand.

      "I would like to know how the macroeconomic model that I more or less believe can be
      reconciled with the trade models that I also more or less believe. [...] What we need to
      know is how to evaluate the microeconomics of international monetary systems. Until
      we can do that, we are making policy advice by the seat of our pants"(Krugman, 1995).


1   Introduction

Concern for a new era of protectionism has been making news headlines across the globe. The
consequences of increasing trade barriers returned to the forefront of policy debates after the U.S.
administration of President Donald Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Paci...c Partnership
(TPP), started renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and imposed
punitive tari¤s against a number of trading partners. Other countries expressed analogous appetite
for protectionism.
    In light of these recent events, a budding literature examines the macroeconomic e¤ects of
higher trade costs, both empirically and theoretically (e.g., Auray, Devereux, and Eyquem, 2019;
Barattieri, Cacciatore, and Ghironi, 2018; Barbiero, Farhi, Gopinath, and Itskhoki, 2018; Erceg,
Prestipino, and Ra¤o, 2017; Lindé and Pescatori, 2019). In contrast to this literature, the present
paper studies how the strength of trade linkages a¤ects the conduct of monetary policy both in the
long run and over the business cycle.
    The consequences of increased trade for incentives to cooperate across countries in monetary
matters and for the desirability of alternative exchange rate arrangements are classic topics of
discussion and research. In the policy arena, the implementation of the European Single Market
after 1985 was viewed as a crucial step toward the adoption of the euro. The argument was that
the mere possibility of exchange rate movements may eventually destabilize the Single Market, thus
making monetary union desirable for the viability of a broader integration agenda (Eichengreen and
Ghironi, 1996). The view that increased trade integration makes monetary cooperation-- and, in
this case, the adoption of a shared currency-- more desirable is fully embraced in o¢ cial European
Union documents.1 Inuential articles by Frankel and Rose (1998) and Clark and van Wincoop
(2001) provided highbrow backing for this argument by ...nding evidence that trade integration
results in stronger business cycle comovement, thus potentially resulting in countries endogenously
satisfying one of Mundell'
                         s (1961) optimum currency area criteria. At the other end of the spectrum,

the limited weight of international trade in U.S. GDP was often invoked among the reasons for small
international spillovers to the United States, and therefore small incentives for the Federal Reserve
to engage in international monetary coordination in the post-Bretton Woods era.2 The 2007-2009
...nancial crisis brought global monetary cooperation to the forefront as it had not been since perhaps
the Plaza Accord of 1985.
   In the academic realm, researchers face important challenges when studying how trade linkages
a¤ect monetary policy tradeo¤s. The reason is that benchmark international business cycle models
cannot reproduce key empirical regularities about the e¤ects of trade integration. First, workhorse
models imply lack of comovement associated to stronger trade linkages, the so-called trade and
comovement puzzle ...rst documented by Kose and Yi (2001). Second, by abstracting from micro-
level producer dynamics, benchmark models ignore the reallocative e¤ects of lower trade costs
across producers (Melitz, 2003, and subsequent literature). This paper shows that accounting for
both features of the data is central to understanding how trade costs and trade linkages a¤ect
monetary policy trade-o¤s.
   We develop a two-country model that incorporates the standard ingredients of the current work-
horse frameworks in international trade and macroeconomics: Heterogeneous ...rms and endogenous
producer entry in domestic and export markets (Melitz, 2003); nominal rigidity; and dynamic, sto-
chastic, general equilibrium. Reecting the attention of policymakers to labor market dynamics
and unemployment, we introduce search-and-matching frictions in labor markets, following Dia-
mond (1982a,b) and Mortensen and Pissarides (1994). By combining these ingredients, we answer
Krugman'
       s (1995) "call for research" that opens the paper.
   We ...rst show the model reproduces empirical regularities for the U.S. and international busi-
ness cycle, including increased comovement following trade integration. In the long run, trade
integration-- captured by a reduction in "iceberg" trade costs (including tari¤s)-- results in pro-
ductivity gains through ...rm selection, consistent with the Melitz (2003) model of trade.
   We then address two main questions: (i) How do trade linkages a¤ect the optimal average ina-
tion target? (ii) Does trade integration change monetary policy trade-o¤s in response to aggregate
shocks? In so doing, we evaluate whether trade linkages call for an active response to international
variables and whether gains from cross-border monetary cooperation are tied to trade openness.
   Three main results emerge. First, trade costs and the strength of trade linkages a¤ect the
   2
     Canzoneri and Henderson (1991) survey theoretical contributions and debates in the 1970s and 1980s. See
Eichengreen and Ghironi (1998) for a discussion of the prospects for U.S.-European monetary cooperation at the
outset of the euro.



                                                      2
optimal average ination target. When trade costs are high (and trade linkages correspondingly
weak), the optimal policy uses ination to increase a suboptimally low job-creation, i.e., the average
optimal ination rate is positive. As lower trade costs reallocate market share toward more produc-
tive ...rms, the need of positive ination to correct long-run distortions is reduced. Intuitively, the
increase in average ...rm-level productivity pushes employment toward its e¢ cient level, reducing
the need to use average ination to stimulate job creation.
       Second, as trade linkages increase business cycle synchronization, country-speci...c shocks have
more global consequences. Thus, the constrained e¢ cient allocation generated by the optimal
cooperative policy can be achieved by appropriately designed inward-looking policy rules even
when trade linkages are strong (together with a exible exchange rate). Put di¤erently, as long as
each central bank inuences domestic distortions appropriately, increased synchronization dampens
the e¤ect of international distortions (e.g., lack of risk sharing, incentives to manipulate the terms
of trade, lack of exchange rate pass-through).3 This result echoes Benigno and Benigno'
                                                                                      s (2003)
...nding that only domestic distortions determine policy trade-o¤s when aggregate shocks (and,
therefore, business cycles) are perfectly correlated across countries. Our model provides a structural
microfoundation for their ...nding, by making increased business cycle correlation an endogenous
consequence of trade integration.4
       Third, while trade costs do not change the features of the optimal monetary stabilization policy,
they a¤ect the welfare costs of ine¢ cient domestic stabilization. In particular, sub-optimal inward-
looking policies-- for instance a too narrow focus on price stability-- become substantially more
costly when trade linkages are strong. Intuitively, ine¢ cient international spillovers stemming from
sub-optimal uctuations in cross-country aggregate demand result in larger welfare losses when
trade linkages are stronger.


Related Literature The paper is related to the vast literature on monetary transmission and
optimal monetary policy in New Keynesian macroeconomic models.5 We contribute to the strand
of this literature that incorporates labor market frictions, such as Arseneau and Chugh (2008), Faia
(2009), and Thomas (2008), and to the literature on price stability in open economies (Benigno
and Benigno, 2003 and 2006, Catão and Chang, 2013, Galí and Monacelli, 2005, Dmitriev and
   3
     With weak trade linkages, international distortions have second-order welfare e¤ects; when trade linkages are
strong, they are not more costly (if inward-looking policies are designed optimally) because of increased comovement.
   4
     An implication of this result is that the gains from optimal cooperation remain modest compared to optimal,
non-cooperative policy.

Hoddenbagh, 2012, and many others) by studying hitherto unexplored mechanisms that a¤ect
monetary policy incentives.
   A recent New Keynesian literature has made an e¤ort to incorporate trade integration among the
determinants of policy incentives. The main focus of this literature is the relationship between trade
openness and optimal exchange rate volatility, where openness is de...ned by changes in the degree
of home bias in consumer preferences and/or the weight of imported inputs in production.6 While
there is undisputed merit in this exercise, proxying a policy outcome (the extent of trade integration)
with structural parameters of preferences and technology risks confounding the consequences of
a policy change (the removal-- or lowering-- of trade barriers) with those of features of agents'
behavior that may have little to do with policy. Moreover, these studies abstract from the e¤ects
of business cycle synchronization and trade-induced reallocation of shares reallocation.
   The paper is also related to Bergin and Corsetti (2018), who study the relationship between
monetary policy and the composition of international trade. They show that (e¢ cient) monetary
stabilization policy can lead a country to specialize in relatively more di¤erentiated industries,
where demand and marginal costs are more sensitive to macroeconomic uncertainty. Our study
explores an alternative channel through which monetary policy a¤ects external competitiveness. In
the presence of ...rm heterogeneity, monetary policy a¤ects export entry decisions along the extensive
margin of trade within a given industry. As a result, domestic policy can optimally increase the
number of manufacturing producers that also export, in addition to selling domestically, boosting
the external competitiveness of the country.
   Finally, our paper contributes to the literature that studies how endogenous entry and product
variety a¤ect business cycles and optimal policy in closed and open economies. In this literature,
our work is most closely related to Cacciatore (2014), who studies how labor market frictions
a¤ect the consequences of trade integration in a real model that merges Ghironi and Melitz (2005)
with the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides framework. His analysis shows that search-and-matching
frictions, ...rm heterogeneity, and endogenous producer entry are key ingredients to address the
trade comovement puzzle. We introduce sticky prices and wages in Cacciatore'
                                                                           s model and study
how trade integration a¤ects monetary policy. Our results on optimal monetary policy extend those
in Bilbiie, Fujiwara, and Ghironi (2014-- BFG) and Cacciatore, Fiori, and Ghironi (2016): As in
BFG, an ine¢ ciency wedge in product creation is among the reasons for the Ramsey central bank of

our to use positive long-run ination, but our model features a wider menu of sources of ine¢ ciency,
with the labor margin a¤ected by a larger number of distortions. Di¤erently from BFG, we ...nd
that the interaction of distortions in our model can result in sizable, optimal departures from price
stability over the business cycle. In this respect, our approach and results are closer to the analysis
of market deregulation and optimal monetary policy in a monetary union in Cacciatore, Fiori, and
Ghironi (2016), whose model, however, does not incorporate the ...rm heterogeneity and reallocation
e¤ects that are central to the recent trade literature.7


2       The Model

We model an economy that consists of two countries, Home and Foreign. Foreign variables are
denoted with a superscript star. We focus on the Home economy in presenting our model, with
the understanding that analogous equations hold for Foreign. We resort to a cashless economy
following Woodford (2003).


Household Preferences

Each country is populated by a unit mass of atomistic households, where each household is thought
of as an extended family with a continuum of members along the unit interval. In equilibrium, some
family members are unemployed, while some others are employed. As common in the literature,
we assume that family members perfectly insure each other against variation in labor income due
to changes in employment status, so that there is no ex post heterogeneity across individuals in the
household (see Andolfatto, 1996, and Merz, 1995).
    The representative household in the Home economy maximizes the expected intertemporal
                   P
utility function E0 1t=0
                         t
                           [u(Ct ) lt v (ht )], where 2 (0; 1) is the discount factor, Ct is a con-
sumption basket that aggregates domestic and imported goods as described below, lt is the number
of employed workers, and ht denotes hours worked by each employed worker. Period utility from
consumption, u( ), and disutility of e¤ort, v ( ), satisfy the standard assumptions.
   The consumption basket Ct aggregates Home and Foreign sectoral consumption outputs Ct (i)
                             R                 =( 1)
in Dixit-Stiglitz form: Ct = i2 Ct (i)( 1)= di       , where > 1 is the symmetric elasticity
of substitution across goods. A similar basket describes consumption in the Foreign country. The

(2011), and Lewis (2013), among others. Auray and Eyquem (2011) and Cavallari (2013) study the role of monetary
policy for shocks transmission in two-country versions of Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz's (2012) model, but they do not
analyze optimal monetary policy.

is the price index for sector i, expressed in Home currency.


Production

In each country, there are two vertically integrated production sectors. In the upstream sector, per-
fectly competitive ...rms use labor to produce a non-tradable intermediate input. In the downstream
sector, each consumption-producing sector is populated by a representative monopolistically-competitive
multi-product ...rm that purchases intermediate input and produces di¤erentiated varieties. In equi-
librium, some of these varieties are exported while the others are sold only domestically.8


Intermediate Goods Production

There is a unit mass of symmetric intermediate producers. Each of them employs a continuum of
workers. Labor markets are characterized by search and matching frictions. To hire new workers,
...rms need to post vacancies, incurring a cost of                 units of consumption per vacancy posted. The
probability of ...nding a worker depends on a constant-return-to-scale matching technology, which
converts aggregate unemployed workers, Ut , and aggregate vacancies, Vt , into aggregate matches,
Mt =          Ut1   "
                        Vt" ; where      > 0 and 0 < " < 1. Each ...rm meets unemployed workers at a rate
qt         Mt =Vt . As in Krause and Lubik (2007) and other studies, we assume that newly created
matches become productive only in the next period. For an individual ...rm, the inow of new hires
in t + 1 is therefore qt t , where             t   is the number of vacancies posted by the ...rm in period t. In
equilibrium,            t   = Vt .
         Firms and workers can separate exogenously with probability                         2 (0; 1). Separation happens
only between ...rms and workers who were active in production in the previous period. As a result
the law of motion of employment in a given ...rm, lt , is given by lt = (1                             )lt   1   + qt   1 t 1.

         As in Arsenau and Chugh (2008), ...rms face a quadratic cost of adjusting the hourly nominal
wage rate, wt . For each worker, the real cost of changing the nominal wage between period t                                            1
and t is #          2 =2,      where #     0 is in units of consumption, and                      (wt =wt
                    w;t                                                                    w;t                     1)       1 is the net
wage ination rate. If # = 0, there is no cost of wage adjustment. The representative intermediate
                       I = Z l h , where Z is exogenous aggregate productivity. We assume the

         This production structure greatly simpli...es the introduction of nominal rigidities in the model.

                                                                                                         wt+1                 #        2
                         = Et        t;t+1     (1           )           + 't+1 Zt+1 ht+1                      ht+1                     w;t+1   ;          (1)
                    qt                                          qt+1                                     Pt+1                 2

where       t;t+1        uC;t+1 =uC;t is the one-period-ahead stochastic discount factor. The job creation
condition states that, at the optimum, the vacancy creation cost incurred by the ...rm per current
match is equal to the expected discounted value of the vacancy creation cost per future match,
further discounted by the probability of current match survival 1                                                        , plus the pro...ts from the
time-t match. Pro...ts from the match take into account the future marginal revenue product from
the match and its wage cost, including future nominal wage adjustment costs.


Wage and Hours The nominal wage is the solution of an individual Nash bargaining process,
and the wage payment divides the match surplus between workers and ...rms. We present the details
of wage determination in Appendix A. We show there the equilibrium sharing rule can be written
as   t Ht   = (1          t )Jt ,   where      t    is the bargaining share of ...rms, Ht is worker surplus, and Jt is
...rm surplus (see Appendix A for the analytical expressions). As in Gertler and Trigari (2009), the
bargaining share is time-varying due to the presence of wage adjustment costs. Absent these costs,


                                                                                   7
we would have a time-invariant bargaining share                    t   = , where           is the weight of ...rm surplus in
the Nash bargaining problem.
       The bargained wage satis...es:

                 ht =        t            + b + (1        t)    't Zt ht             w;t

                                                                                                            t
                          +Et         t;t+1 Jt+1   (1     )(1          t)   (1             t )(1   t+1 )         ;       (2)
                                                                                                           t+1


where v (ht )=uC;t + b is the worker'
                                    s outside option (the utility value of leisure in consumption
units plus an unemployment bene...t b), and               t   is the probability of becoming employed at time t,
de...ned by    t   Mt =Ut . With exible wages, the third term in the right-hand side of this equation
reduces to (1       ) t Et       t;t+1 Jt+1   , or, in equilibrium,         (1       ) t =qt . In this case, the real wage is
a linear combination-- determined by the constant bargaining parameter -- of the worker's outside
option and the marginal revenue product generated by the worker plus the expected discounted
continuation value of the match to the ...rm (adjusted for the probability of worker'
                                                                                    s employment).
When wages are sticky, bargaining shares are endogenous, and so is the distribution of surplus
between workers and ...rms. Moreover, the current wage bill reects also expected changes in
bargaining shares.
       As common practice in the literature we assume that hours per worker are determined by ...rms
and workers in a privately e¢ cient way, i.e., so as to maximize the joint surplus of their employment
relation. The joint surplus is the sum of the ...rm'
                                                   s surplus and the worker'
                                                                           s surplus, i.e., Jt + Ht .
Maximization yields a standard intratemporal optimality condition for hours worked that equates
the marginal revenue product of hours per worker to the marginal rate of substitution between
consumption and leisure: vh;t =uC;t = 't Zt , where vh;t is the marginal disutility of e¤ort.


Final Goods Production

In each consumption sector i, a representative multi-product ...rm produces a di¤erentiated bundle
Yt (i) sold to consumers in Home and Foreign. The bundle Yt (i) consists of di¤erentiated product
                                                                   R1                      =( 1)
varieties, indexed by ! and de...ned over a continuum : Yt (i) = !2 yt (!; i)( 1)= d!            ,
where      > 1 is the symmetric elasticity of substitution across product varieties.9
       Each product variety y (!; i) is created and developed by the representative ...nal producer i.
   9
    Sectors (and sector-representative ...rms) are of measure zero relative to the aggregate size of the economy. Notice
that Yt (i) can also be interpreted as a bundle of product features that characterize the ...nal product i.



                                                               8
Since consumption-producing sectors are symmetric, from now on we omit the index i to simplify
                                                               R1 n 1          1=(1 )
notation. The nominal cost of the product bundle Yt is: 'n
                                                         Y;t =  ! 2 't (! ) d!         , where
'n
 t (! ) is the nominal marginal cost of producing variety ! .

       The number of products (or features) created and commercialized by each ...nal producer is
endogenous. At each point in time, only a subset of varieties                       t           is actually available to
consumers. To create a new product, the ...nal producer needs to undertake a sunk investment,
fE;t , in units of intermediate input. Product creation requires the creation of a new plant that
will be producing the new variety.10 Plants produce with di¤erent technologies indexed by relative
productivity z . To save notation, we identify a variety with the corresponding plant productivity
z , omitting ! . Upon product creation, the productivity level of the new plant z is drawn from
a common distribution G(z ) with support on [zmin ; 1). Foreign plants draw productivity levels
from an identical distribution. This relative productivity level remains ...xed thereafter. Each plant
uses the intermediate input to produce its di¤erentiated product variety, with real marginal cost:
'z;t = 't =z .
       At time t, each ...nal Home producer commercializes ND;t varieties and creates NE;t new products
that will be available for sale at time t + 1. New and incumbent plants can be hit by a "death"
shock with probability            2 (0; 1) at the end of each period. The law of motion for the stock of
producing plants is ND;t+1 = (1                )(ND;t + NE;t ).
       When serving the Foreign market, each ...nal producer faces per-unit iceberg trade costs,                         t   > 1,
and ...xed export costs, fX;t . Following Ghironi and Melitz (2005), ...xed export costs are denom-
inated in units of intermediate input and paid for each exported product. Thus, the total ...xed
cost is NX;t fX;t , where NX;t denotes the number of product varieties exported to Foreign. Absent
...xed export costs, each producer would sell all its product varieties in Home and Foreign. Fixed
export costs imply that only varieties produced by plants with su¢ ciently high productivity (above
a cuto¤ level zX;t , determined below) are exported.11
       De...ne two special "average" productivity levels (weighted by the relative output shares): an
average z
        ~D for all producing plants and an average z
                                                   ~X;t for all the plants that export:

  10
     Alternatively, we could decentralize product creation by assuming that monopolistically competitive ...rms produce
product varieties (or features) that are sold to ...nal producers, in this case interpreted as retailers. The two models
are isomorphic. Details are available upon request.

     Notice that zX;t is the lowest level of plant productivity such that the pro...t from exporting is positive.

At the optimum, the marginal revenue from adding a variety with productivity zX;t to the export
bundle has to be equal to the ...xed cost. Thus, varieties produced by plants with productivity
below zX;t are distributed only in the domestic market. The set of exported products uctuates

At the optimum, the cost of producing an additional variety, 't fE;t , must be equal to its expected



                                                                            10
bene...t (which includes expected savings on future sunk investment costs augmented by the marginal
revenue from commercializing the variety, net of ...xed export costs, if it is exported).
       We are now left with the determination of domestic and export prices. Denote with PD;t the
price (in Home currency) of the product bundle YD;t and let PX;t be the price (in Foreign currency)
of the exported bundle YX;t . Each ...nal producer faces the following domestic and foreign demand
for its product bundles: YD;t = (PD;t =Pt )                YtC and YX;t = (PX;t =Pt )                  YtC , where YtC and YtC
are aggregate demands of the consumption basket in Home and Foreign.12
       Prices in the ...nal sector are sticky. We follow Rotemberg (1982) and assume that ...nal producers
must pay quadratic price adjustment costs when changing domestic and export prices. In the
benchmark version of the model, we consider producer currency pricing (PCP). Absent ...xed export
costs, the producer would set a single price PD;t and the law of one price (adjusted for the presence
of trade costs) would determine the export price. However, with ...xed export costs, the composition
of the domestic and export bundles is di¤erent, and the marginal costs of producing these bundles
are not equal. Therefore, ...nal producers choose two di¤erent prices for the Home and Foreign
markets. Under PCP, each producer sets PD;t and the domestic currency price of the export
         h . In turn, the price in the foreign market is P

                                                           X;t = PX;t =St , where St denotes the

nominal exchange rate. The nominal costs of adjusting domestic and export price are, respectively,

adjustment costs,                = (PD;t =PD;t          1), and   h          h =P h
                                                                         = (PX;t                   1).

       As shown in Appendix B, the real price of Home output for domestic sales is given by:                                 D;t

PD;t =Pt =      D;t 'D;t ,   where        D;t   denotes the time-varying domestic markup. The real price of
Home output for export sales,               h        h =P , is
                                                    PX;t           h     =     h                          h

markup. (See Appendix B for the analytical expressions for                                 and     h ).   As expected, the cost
                                                                                     D;t           X;t

    To summarize, the assumption of price rigidity at the bundle level preserves the aggregation
properties of the original Melitz (2003) model in the presence of nominal price rigidities. A con-
sequence of our assumption is that price changes are fully synchronized across products within a
...rm.13 This is consistent with the evidence in Bhattarai and Schoenley (2014), who document
substantial synchronization of price changes within ...rms across goods. The di¤erent composition
of domestic and exported bundles is also consistent with the evidence in Dvir and Strasser (2018).


Household Budget Constraint and Intertemporal Decisions

International assets markets are incomplete as only risk-free bonds are traded across countries.
Home bonds, issued by Home households, are denominated in Home currency. Foreign bonds, issued
by Foreign households, are denominated in Foreign currency. Let At+1 and A                                     ;t+1   (At and A ;t )
denote, respectively, nominal holdings of Home and Foreign bonds at Home (Foreign). To induce
steady-state determinacy and stationary responses to temporary shocks in the model, we assume a
quadratic cost of adjusting bond holdings (e.g., Turnovsky, 1985). The cost of adjusting Home bond
holdings is    (At+1 =Pt )2 =2, while the cost of adjusting Foreign bond holdings is                              (A      ;t+1 =Pt   )2 =2.
These costs are paid to ...nancial intermediaries who rebate the revenue to households in lump-sum
fashion.

where it+1 and it+1 are, respectively, the nominal interest rates on Home and Foreign bond holdings
between t and t + 1, known with certainty as of t                               1. Moreover, Ttg is a lump-sum transfer (or
tax) from the government, TtA is a lump-sum rebate of the cost of adjusting bond holdings from
the intermediaries, and Tti and Ttf are lump-sum pro...ts rebate from intermediate and ...nal goods

Net Foreign Assets and the Trade Balance

We present the details of the model equilibrium in Appendix C. Here we limit ourselves to presenting
the law of motion for net foreign assets below. Bonds are in zero net supply, which implies the
equilibrium conditions at+1 + at+1 = 0 and a                       ;t+1   +a   ;t+1   = 0 in all periods. Net foreign assets are
determined by:

3        Monetary Policy

In our benchmark exercise, we compare the Ramsey-optimal, cooperative monetary policy to the
consequences of historical behavior by the Federal Reserve and its symmetric counterpart under
a exible exchange rate. Following Sims (2007), we consider historical behavior a more realistic
benchmark for comparison than optimal, non-cooperative policies.


Data-Consistent Variables and Historical Monetary Policy

Historical policy is captured by a standard rule for interest rate setting for both central banks.
Before describing the interest-rate setting rule that characterizes historical policy, we must ad-
dress an issue that concerns the data that are actually available to the central bank.                                    Since
gains from variety are mostly unmeasured in CPI data (Broda and Weinstein, 2010), we con-
                                      ~t , that removes the product-variety e¤ect from the welfare-
struct a data-consistent price index, P

    In the presence of endogenous producer entry and preferences that exhibit "love for variety,"the welfare-consistent
aggregate price index Pt can   uctuate even if product prices remain constant.

under the constraints of the competitive economy (see Appendix D for the full set of equilibrium
conditions). As common practice in the literature, we write the original non-stationary Ram-
sey problem in a recursive stationary form by enlarging the planner'
                                                                   s state space with additional
(pseudo) co-state variables. Such co-state variables track the value to the planner of committing
to the pre-announced policy plan along the dynamics.


4        Calibration

We interpret periods as quarters and calibrate the model to match U.S. macroeconomic data. Table
1 summarizes the calibration, which is assumed symmetric across countries. (Variables without time
indexes denote steady-state levels.) We set the discount factor                           to 0:99 and assume the following
                                      1   C                         1+    h
period utility function: ut = Ct              =(1        C)    lt ht          = (1 +   h ).   The risk aversion coe¢ cient    C

is equal to 1, while the Frisch elasticity of labor supply 1=                      h   is set to 0:25, a mid-point between
empirical micro and macro estimates.16 Following Ghironi and Melitz (2005), we set the elasticity of
substitution across product varieties, , and the elasticity of substitution across Home and Foreign
goods, , equal to 3:8. As in Ghironi and Melitz (2005), we also set kp = 3:4, normalize zmin to 1,
and calibrate the ...xed export cost fX so that the share of exporting plants is equal to 21 percent.
    15
    We de...ne GDP as total income: the sum of labor income, dividend income from ...nal producers, and pro...t
income from intermediate producers. Formally: GDPt (wt =Pt ) lt + Ttf 't Ne;t fe;t + Tti .
    16
    Students of the business cycle tend to work with elasticities that are higher than microeconomic estimates,
typically unity and above. Most microeconomic studies, however, estimate this elasticity to be much smaller, between
0:1 and 0:6. Our results are not a¤ected signi...cantly if we hold hours constant at the optimally determined steady-
state level.



                                                               14
We choose iceberg trade costs, , so that total trade (imports plus exports) over GDP is equal
to 10 percent, the average value for the U.S. over the period 1954-1980.17 This requires setting
       1 = 1:47, consistent with the estimates of trade costs reported by Anderson and van Wincoop
(2003).
       We set the bond adjustment cost            to 0:0025 as in Ghironi and Melitz (2005). The scale
parameter for the cost of adjusting prices, , is equal to 80, following Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz
(2008). We choose #, the scale parameter of nominal wage adjustment costs, so that the model
reproduces the volatility of unemployment relative to GDP observed in the data. This implies
setting # = 290. To calibrate the entry costs, we follow Ebell and Haefke (2009) and set fE so that
regulation costs amount to 5:2 months of per capita output.
       We set unemployment bene...ts, b, so that the model reproduces the average replacement rate,
b= (wh), for the U.S. reported by OECD (2004). The steady-state bargaining share of ...rms, , is
equal to 0:6, as estimated by Flinn (2006) for the U.S. The elasticity of the matching function, ",
is also equal to 0:6, within the range of estimates reported by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2006)
and such that the Hosios condition holds in steady state. The quarterly exogenous separation rate
between ...rms and workers, , is 10 percent, as in Shimer (2005). We calibrate the cost of vacancy
posting,     , and the matching e¢ ciency parameter,              , to match the steady-state probability of
...nding a job and the probability of ...lling a vacancy. The former is 75 percent, while the latter
is 70 percent, in line with Shimer (2005). To pin down the exogenous producer exit rate, , we
assume that job destruction due to plant exit is equal to 40 percent (Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, and
Schweiger, 2008).
       For the bivariate productivity process, we set persistence and spillover parameters consistent
with the evidence in Baxter and Farr (2005), implying zero spillovers across countries and per-
sistence equal to 0:999. Moreover, we set the standard deviation of productivity innovations at
0:73 percent and the covariance of innovations at 0:19 percent, as in Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland
(1992). Finally, the parameter values in the historical rule for the Fed'
                                                                        s interest rate setting are
those estimated by Clarida, Galí and Gertler (2000). The ination and GDP gap weights are 1:62
and 0:34, respectively, while the smoothing parameter is 0:71.
  17
    This time period featured relatively weak trade linkages between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world. The
growth in U.S. trade began at the beginning of the 80'   s, experiencing a ...ve-fold growth in nominal terms over the
next twenty ...ve years-- in 1980 US two-way merchandise trade was 467 billion U.S. dollars, reaching 2; 942 billion
U.S. dollars in 2006 (UNComtrade via WITS 2008).

Model Properties         In Appendix E, we present the second-moment properties of the model under
the historical policy, showing the model successfully replicates several features of the U.S. and in-
ternational business cycle. Here we briey discuss the propagation of a positive productivity shock.
Figure 1 (solid lines) shows impulse responses to a one-percent innovation to Home productivity
under the historical rule for the Fed interest rate setting. The higher expected return of a match
induces domestic intermediate input producers to post more vacancies on impact, which results in
higher employment in the following period. Firms and workers (costly) renegotiate nominal wages
because of the higher surplus generated by existing matches, and wage ination increases. Wage
adjustment costs make the e¤ective ...rm'
                                        s bargaining power procyclical, i.e.,       t   rises. Other things
equal, the increase in    t   dampens the response of the renegotiated equilibrium wage, amplifying
the response of job creation to the shock.
    Higher employment and labor income boost aggregate demand for ...nal goods and consump-
tion. The larger present discounted value of future pro...ts generates higher product creation and
investment at Home. The number of domestic plants that produce for the export market also
increases, since higher aggregate productivity reduces the export productivity cuto¤ zX;t . In turn,
the endogenous selection of relatively low-productive ...rms into the export market partially o¤sets
the reduction in marginal costs and export prices generated by higher aggregate productivity, since
'X;t = 't =z
           ~X;t . Thus, the terms of trade (T OTt       St PX;t =PX;t ) fall less relative to a model that
abstracts from plant heterogeneity.
    Foreign households shift resources to Home to ...nance product creation in the more productive
economy. Accordingly, Home runs a current account de...cit in response to the shock. At the
same time, GDP, employment, and investment comove positively across countries. The increase in
aggregate demand at Home (which falls on both domestic and imported goods) and the moderate
size of expenditure switching e¤ects induced by terms-of-trade dynamics explain this result (see
also Cacciatore, 2014).


5   Optimal Monetary Policy with Weak Trade Linkages

We begin by discussing the Ramsey-optimal monetary policy when trade linkages are weak. First,
we study optimal monetary policy in the long run, then we turn to the Ramsey allocation over the
business cycle.




                                                   16
Optimal Monetary Policy in the Long Run

Our interest in this section is in how the two Ramsey central banks determine the optimal ination
rates      C   and        C.   To begin, it is immediate to verify that long-run ination is always symmetric
across countries regardless of symmetry or asymmetry of the calibration. This result follows from
the Euler equations for bond holdings once it is observed that the latter are always zero in steady
state: 1 +         C   = (1 + i) = 1 +         C.   Moreover, it is straightforward to verify that in steady state
       =       =     h    =
 C         D         X         w.

       Table 2 shows that the optimal (annualized) long-run ination rate is positive and equal to 1:45
percent before trade integration. To understand this result, notice that ...rms'monopoly power in
the downstream sector and positive unemployment bene...ts imply suboptimally low job-creation.18
Since      C   =     w,   positive ination raises the steady-state level of ...rm bargaining power        t,   favoring
vacancy posting by ...rms. However, the Ramsey authority must trade the bene...cial welfare e¤ects
of reducing these distortions against the costs of non-zero ination implied by allocating resources
to wage and price changes and by the departure from the Hosios condition (since                       w   > 0 results
in a steady-state value of             t   that is higher than "). Compared to the zero ination outcome, the
Ramsey authority increases job creation.
       The ...nding of an optimal positive long-run ination is in contrast with the prescription of
near zero ination delivered by the vast majority of New Keynesian models in closed and open
economy. While the costs of ination outweigh the bene...ts of reducing other distortions in those
models, this is no longer the case with a richer microfoundation of labor markets. In particular,
the prescription of an optimal positive long-run ination rate stems from the presence of wage
stickiness and labor-market search and matching frictions. Wage stickiness, in fact, allows the
Ramsey authority to optimally manipulate the ...rm'
                                                  s bargaining power to reduce ine¢ ciencies in
job creation. Absent sticky wages, a policy of zero ination would be optimal also in our model, as
shown in Appendix G.19 In addition, when trade linkages are weak, the optimal long-run ination
rate is 2:44 percent absent price-setting frictions (see again Appendix G), con...rming that welfare
costs of price adjustment reduce the bene...cial e¤ects of positive wage ination. Finally, while
the model assumes quadratic wage and price adjustment costs, the results would be similar with
  18
      In Appendix F, we derive the ...rst-best allocation chosen by a benevolent social planner for the world economy.
We then formally de...ne the ine¢ ciency wedges that characterize the market economy by comparing the equilibrium
allocation in the decentralized economy to the one chosen by the social planner.
   19
      In Appendix G, we also show that the optimal long-run in      ation rate remains positive even in the presence of
wage indexation.




                                                              17
staggered wage and price setting.20
       Table 2 also presents the welfare gain from implementing the long-run optimal policy relative to
the Fed'
       s historical behavior. To avoid spurious welfare reversals, we assume identical initial condi-
tions across di¤erent monetary policy regimes and include transition dynamics in the computation.
We set all the state variables at their steady-state level under the historical policy at time t =                  1,
regardless of the monetary regime from t = 0 on.21 We compare welfare under the continuation of
historical policy from t = 0 on (which implies continuation of the historical steady state) to welfare
under the optimal long-run policy from t = 0 on (which implies a transition between the initial
implementation at t = 0 and the Ramsey steady state). We measure the long-run welfare gains of
the Ramsey policy by computing the percentage increase                    in consumption that would leave the
household indi¤erent between policy regimes:

                 1
                 X
                       t      Ramsey Ramsey Ramsey              u   1+   100   C Hist ; hHist ; lHist )
                           u Ct     ; ht   ; lt    =                                                    :
                                                                               1
                 t=0


Table 2 shows that the welfare gains from the Ramsey-optimal policy amount to 0:34 percent of
annualized steady-state consumption.
       An important implication of our results is that monetary policy a¤ects the composition of trade
along the extensive margin. Relative to a policy of strict price stability, the Ramsey-optimal policy
results in a larger number of exported products-- NX is approximately 4 percent higher under
the optimal policy. The reason is that employment gains induced by positive net ination raise
aggregate demand and income in both countries, stimulating producer entry into the domestic and
export market.22
       The dispersion of ...rm-level productivity, indexed by kp , plays an important role for the optimal
long-run ination rate,         R.   In particular,   R   increases with lower productivity dispersion (i.e., an
increase in kp ). For instance, when kp increases by 25%, i.e., from 3:4 to 4:25,              R   increases from 1:45
to 1:98 percent. Intuitively, as the dispersion of ...rm-level productivity decreases, productivity levels
are increasingly concentrated toward their lower bound zmin . Accordingly, the average domestic
productivity, z
              ~D , falls, resulting in a higher optimal long-run ination rate to increase job creation.
  20
     Carlsson and Westermark (2016) show that staggered wage bargaining leads to the same prescription of a positive,
optimal in  ation rate in a search-and-matching model that features ine¢ ciently low job creation. In Appendix G, we
show that our results are robust to considering Calvo price-setting.
  21
     The results are not sensitive to the choice of (identical) initial conditions for the state variables.
  22
     The export productivity cuto¤ zX is independent of steady-state in      ation. The reason why steady-state ination
does not a¤ect the productivity cuto¤ zX is that a given change in induces an equal change in the marginal revenue
product of exporting an additional variety and its marginal cost, 'fX , thus leaving zX una¤ected.



                                                           18
       However, the increase in the optimal long-run ination rate is not monotone. For instance,               R


is 1:67 percent when kp = 4:8, still higher relative to the benchmark calibration (kp = 3:4) but
lower relative to kp = 4:4. Intuitively, when the reduction in average domestic productivity, z
                                                                                              ~D , is
too large, the welfare cost of further raising ination outweighs its bene...t, i.e., the cost of further
increasing ination to raise job creation becomes too large.


Optimal Monetary Policy over the Business Cycle

Stochastic uctuations in aggregate productivity modify the policy tradeo¤s facing the Ramsey
authorities by reintroducing the distortions eliminated by symmetry and absence of time variation
in steady state. First, as in steady state, there is a tension between the bene...cial e¤ects of
manipulating ination and its costs. Second, there is a tradeo¤ between stabilizing consumer price
ination (which contributes to stabilizing domestic markups) and wage ination (which stabilizes
unemployment). Third, there is a tension between stabilizing domestic markups,                 D;t ,   and export
markups,       h .   Finally, the Home and Foreign economies uctuate around a steady state where
               X;t

unemployment is ine¢ ciently high and the number of producers is ine¢ ciently low. As a result,
shocks trigger larger uctuations in product and labor markets relative to the e¢ cient allocation.
       Figure 1 (dashed lines) shows impulse responses to a Home productivity increase under the
Ramsey-optimal policy. Relative to the historical rule (i.e., a policy of near producer price stability,
de...ned as zero deviation of average domestic producer ination from trend), the Ramsey authority
generates a much smaller increase in wage ination and a larger departure from price stability
(disination) in both economies.
       Policy tradeo¤s explain why a policy of price stability is suboptimal. First, as highlighted by
Erceg, Henderson, and Levine (2000) in a baseline New Keynesian model and by Thomas (2008) in
a New Keynesian model with search-and-matching frictions, a policy of price stability is suboptimal
in the presence of both price and wage rigidity. A case against price stability arises because wage
ination is too volatile and markup stabilization correspondingly too strong under this policy. In
addition, positive unemployment bene...ts generate real wage rigidities, i.e., a positive (negative)
productivity shock is not fully absorbed by the rise (fall) of the real wage. Firms post too many
vacancies and nominal wage adjustment costs are too large. As a result, price stability results in
excessive employment volatility.23
  23
   Notice, however, that a policy that completely stabilizes wage ination is also suboptimal. In this case, there
would be too much in ation and markup volatility.




                                                       19
    Finally, domestic price stability is also suboptimal due to the asymmetric dynamics of domestic
and export markups. Endogenous uctuations in the export productivity cuto¤ zX;t open a wedge
between domestic and export ination in each country. Since the law of one price does not hold,
the central bank cannot stabilize export markups by setting domestic producer price ination equal
to zero.24
    As for the long-run optimal policy, we compare policy regimes by computing the welfare gains
for the two countries from optimal policy. Speci...cally, we compute the percentage                            of steady-state
consumption that would make households indi¤erent between living in a world with uncertainty
under monetary policy m, where m = Ramsey or Hist, and living in a deterministic Ramsey world:

                        1
                        X
                              t      m m m           u   1+   100   C Ramsey ; hRamsey lRamsey )
                   E0             u(Ct ; ht lt ) =                                               :
                                                                        1
                        t=0


We compute welfare by resorting to a second-order approximation of the policy functions, since
with a distorted steady state volatility a¤ects both ...rst and second moments of the variables that
determine welfare. As shown in Table 2, by implementing the Ramsey-optimal policy the welfare
cost of business cycle falls by approximately 35 percent: Optimal departures from price stability
lower the cost of business cycles from 0:85 percent of steady-state consumption under the historical
policy to 0:52 percent.
    From a policy perspective, it is important to know whether the Ramsey-optimal policy can be
implemented by mean of simple interest rate rules, and whether such optimal rules can be purely
inward looking. To address this question, we consider a constrained Ramsey problem in which
the Ramsey authority maximizes aggregate welfare in (7) by cooperatively choosing the optimal
response coe¢ cients in a general class of inward-looking interest rate rules.25 We allow the interest
rates in Home and Foreign to respond to four domestic variables: the previous-period interest rate,
producer price ination, wage ination, and the output gap. For the Home economy, the interest
rule has the following functional form (a similar expression holds for the Foreign country):

                                      h                                                             %Y i1 %i
                1 + it+1 = (1 + it )%i (1 + i) (1 + ~ D;t )%        D   (1 + ~ w;t )%   w    ~g;t
                                                                                             Y                 :          (8)


    The welfare maximizing rule implies: %i = 0:81, %Y = 0, %                       D
                                                                                            = 1:15 and %       w
                                                                                                                   = 2:08. As
  24                                                                                                                       h
     This tradeo¤ is quantitatively less important when trade linkages are weak, since the dynamics of D;t and             X;t
are similar under the Ramsey-optimal policy.
  25
     We only consider combinations of policy parameters that deliver a unique rational expectations equilibrium.




                                                          20
shown in Table 2, the welfare loss implied by the (constrained) optimal interest rule relative to
the (unconstrained) Ramsey allocation is very small (approximately 3 percent, corresponding to
0:01 percent of steady state consumption). As a result, when trade linkages are weak, the Ramsey-
optimal policy is well approximated by an inward-looking interest rate rule, i.e., each central bank
can achieve the constraint, e¢ cient allocation by appropriately responding to domestic targets.


6        Optimal Monetary Policy and Trade Integration

How does trade integration a¤ect optimal monetary policy? Stronger trade linkages pose di¤erent
challenges for the central banks of integrating countries. First, a permanent decline in trade costs
may alter the optimal long-run ination target. Second, lower trade costs may a¤ect the way
economies respond to aggregate shocks, with consequences for the optimal stabilization policy.
         In our exercises, we interpret trade integration as a symmetric reduction of iceberg trade costs,
    and       , capturing a decrease in several impediments to international trade such as tari¤s and
transportation costs.26 We consider two scenarios. First, we re-calibrate               t   and   t   so that in the
new steady state the trade-to-GDP ratio is 25 percent, the average value observed in the U.S.
during the period 1980         2011. Second, we consider a further reduction in trade costs that implies
a trade-to-GDP ratio equal to 35 percent.


Optimal Long-Run Monetary Policy

The starting point of our analysis is a robust conclusion reached by empirical work using microlevel
data: When the exposure to trade changes, the probability of exporting among non-exporters
increase. Given the productivity advantage of exporters, this induces reallocations in favor of the
more productive exporting plants, increasing average industry productivity (see Bernard, Jensen
and Schott, 2006).
         Our model, as Melitz (2003), is consistent with these stylized facts. De...ne a weighted productiv-
ity average z
            ~ that reects the combined market shares of all Home ...rms and the output shrinkage
                          h                           i1=( 1)

the relative more productive non-exporting plants begin to export and the market shares of the
domestic plants shrink due to increased foreign competition. Even if the average productivity of
the exporters (z
               ~X ) falls, the gain in market shares of existing and new exporting plants is strong
    26
    Trade integration can also be interpreted as a permanent decrease in ...xed export costs. Qualitatively, none of
our results is a¤ected by the speci...c nature of the "integration shock".

enough to guarantee that the average productivity z
                                                  ~ increases.
       This result has implications for the conduct of monetary policy. Table 2 shows that stronger
trade linkages lower the steady-state optimal ination rate, which becomes 1:1 percent when trade
integration reaches its maximum. Intuitively, trade-induced productivity gains reduce the need
to resort to positive ination to correct market distortions. In particular, the increase in average
productivity dampens the negative consequences of ...rms'monopoly power and distortionary unem-
ployment bene...ts. To see this, let {       q= be the labor-market tightness. Since U = = ( + { " ),
the e¤ect of trade integration on job creation is summarized by the response of { . As shown in
Appendix G, the labor market tightness is an increasing function of the marginal revenue from
                                                                        1=(   1)
a match, ', i.e. d{ =d' > 0. Moreover, since ' = (1=               D ) ND          z
                                                                                   ~, the marginal revenue of
a match increases with the number of domestic goods available to consumers, ND , and the av-
erage ...rm productivity, z
                          ~. Trade openness leads to a decrease in ND and to an increase in z
                                                                                            ~.
For any realistic parametrization of the model, the productivity e¤ects dominate, implying that
@ { =@' > 0. Thus, our model features a negative link between trade and unemployment, given that
@U=@ { =       @ { =@' < 0. As in Cacciatore (2014) and Felbermayr, Prat, and Schmerer (2011), the
increase in z
            ~ makes workers on average more productive, increasing the average marginal revenue
of a match and employment toward their e¢ cient levels.27 In turn, this explains why the optimal
long-run ination rate falls when trade costs are reduced.
       Table 2 also shows the welfare gains from implementing the optimal policy response to trade
integration (including transition dynamics) are positive but smaller that in the pre-integration
scenario (welfare gains reduce from 0:45 percent of steady state consumption to 0:18 percent).


Optimal Monetary Policy over the Business Cycle

A second robust conclusion of empirical work is that, among industrialized economies, business
cycles become more synchronized when trade linkages are stronger. In particular, by running cross-
country regressions, the slope coe¢ cient estimates in Frankel and Rose (1998) and Clark and van
Wincoop (2001) imply that countries with 3:5 times larger trade intensity have a correlation that
is, on average, 0:089 higher and 0:125 higher, respectively.28 Table 3 shows the model correctly
predicts business cycle synchronization in response to trade integration. In particular, under the
  27
     Dutt, Mitra and Ranjan (2009) and Felbermayra, Prat and Schmerer (2011) document empirically the negative
long-run relationship between trade openness unemployment. See Pissarides and Vallanti (2007) for evidence that
higher productivity lowers unemployment in the long run.

historical monetary policy making, the model predicts that cross-country GDP correlation increase
from 0:27 to 0:43 when trade volumes are 3:5 larger.29
       The ability of the model to account for the business cycle synchronization observed in the data
has often eluded standard international business cycle models, the so-called trade and comovement
puzzle identi...ed by Kose and Yi (2001).30 The success of our model on the trade and comovement
front relates to the ...ndings in Cacciatore (2014). He shows that endogenous product dynamics
and labor market frictions introduce a strong internal propagation mechanism in the model, which
translates in long-lasting e¤ects of domestic shocks abroad with strong trade linkages. Second, as
previously discussed, ...rm heterogeneity mitigates the terms-of-trade e¤ects of aggregate shocks,
reducing the incentives to shift resources across countries over the cycle.
       We now discuss the consequences of trade integration for the conduct of monetary policy over the
business cycle. Figure 2 shows the optimal monetary policy does not change after trade integration.
The Ramsey authority continues to strike a balance between stabilizing price and wage ination in
both countries. Moreover, the optimized inward-looking interest rate rules derived in the previous
section can still replicate closely the constrained e¢ cient allocation. Even when the trade-to-GDP
ratio is 35 percent, there are virtually no di¤erences between the welfare costs of business cycle
under the Ramsey-optimal policy and the optimized rules (see Table 2).
       Our results echo the ...nding in Benigno and Benigno (2003), who show that when aggregate
shocks are perfectly correlated across countries, only domestic distortions determine policy trade-
o¤s.31 In our model, increased trade integration results (endogenously) in stronger business cycle
comovement. Thus, inward-looking interest rate rules can still replicate the constrained e¢ cient
allocation. Put di¤erently, when stronger trade linkages result into plausible business cycle synchro-
nization, there is no shift in the focus of monetary stabilization to redressing domestic as well as
external distortions, i.e., trade integration does not require targeting rules involving misalignments
in the terms of trade or cross-country demand imbalances.
       A question remains open: what are the consequences of trade integration when monetary policy
  29
      This ...gure is not directly comparable with the empirical estimates, since the latter refer to an increase in the
average bilateral trade intensity. For this reason, we have also considered an alternative calibration of trade costs,
setting the initial value of and        to generate a 0:5 percent bilateral trade intensity, the average value for the U.S.
in the period 1954 1980. Then, we reduced trade costs to increase the bilateral trade intensity by a factor of 3:5.
The predicted increase in GDP comovement is 0:085, in line with empirical estimates.
   30
      The Backus, Kehoe and Kydland (1992) model augmented with trade costs yields the counterfactual prediction
of a smaller cross-country GDP correlation following reductions in trade costs. Production reallocation towards more
productive locations more than o¤sets demand complementarities induced by lower trade costs.
   31
      When productivity shocks are perfectly correlated across countries, the optimal cooperative policy in Benigno and
Benigno (2003) dictates a      exible exchange rate and domestic price stability. Notice their model features frictionless
labor markets and       exible wages.

is not optimally designed? Table 2 shows that historical (Fed) policy behavior results in more
sizable welfare costs relative to the pre-integration scenario: The welfare gains from implementing
the Ramsey-optimal policy relative to historical policy making increase from 36 percent (with high
trade costs) up to approximately 50 percent. To understand this result, recall that historical policy
results in suboptimal unemployment dynamics in each country, inducing ine¢ cient uctuations in
terms of trade and cross-country demand. For example, Figure 2 shows that following an increase
in Home productivity, terms of trade depreciation is too weak relative to the constrained e¢ cient
allocation since the Home economy expands production beyond its e¢ cient level. When trade
linkages are strong, sub-optimal terms-of-trade uctuations combine with incomplete risk sharing
across countries, resulting in ine¢ cient international spillovers and larger welfare costs of historical
policy.
    To summarize, our analysis has two main implications for the conduct of monetary policy
following trade integration. First, provided that central banks appropriately use ination to smooth
domestic unemployment uctuations, inward-looking interest rate rules (and a exible exchange
rate) remain optimal. However, sub-optimal inward-looking policies (such as a policy of price
stability), become more costly when trade linkages are stronger due to the negative consequences
of (ine¢ cient) international spillovers.


7   Extensions

Thus far, we assumed complete exchange rate pass-through and abstracted from strategic consid-
erations in monetary policy setting. In the data, however, exchange rate pass-through is far from
complete and monetary policy can involve strategic currency devaluations. As a result, the bench-
mark model could underestimate the importance of external distortions for the optimal conduct of
monetary policy. We turn to these issues next, investigating the robustness of our ...ndings to the
presence of local currency pricing (LCP) and non-cooperative monetary policy setting.


Local Currency Pricing Under local currency pricing (LCP), ...rms set prices in domestic cur-
rency for the domestic market and in foreign currency for the market of destination. As a result,
nominal exchange rate movements do not have expenditure switching e¤ects: Nominal deprecia-
tion does not make goods produced in the country cheaper worldwide, thus re-allocating demand




                                                   24
in favor of them. We derive the optimal export prices under LCP in Appendix B.32
    How does LCP a¤ect the policy tradeo¤s faced by the Ramsey authority? A well-known theoret-
ical result in the literature is that incomplete pass-through makes it is impossible to simultaneously
stabilize domestic and export markups since the law of one price does not hold. The optimal-policy
prescription is that policymakers should pay attention to international relative price misalignments,
as the exchange rate cannot be expected to correct them. In our model, however, the law of one
price does not hold regardless of the currency denomination of exports. As a result, LCP does not
introduce new policy tradeo¤s for the Ramsey authority, but it modi...es their nature with respect
to PCP.
    As shown by Figure 3, when trade linkages are weak, the optimal policy continues to stabilize
unemployment uctuations, generating higher domestic markups volatility in the relatively more
productive economy. Table 2 shows the welfare costs of historical policy under PCP and LCP
remain close, and the optimized inward-looking interest rate rule obtained under PCP continue
to approximate well the Ramsey allocation. These results are not surprising since di¤erences
in the international transmission of aggregate shocks are expected to have second-order welfare
implications when trade linkages are weak.
    The key ...nding is that the cooperative, optimized interest rate rules that we derived under
PCP and weak trade linkages continue to be optimal after trade integration even with LCP. In-
tuitively, provided that each central bank responds appropriately to movements in price and wage
ination, business cycle synchronization o¤sets international distortions: When shocks are more
global, asymmetries in the dynamics of domestic and export markups are reduced and the need
to correct for real exchange rate misalignment and cross-country misallocation in consumption
correspondingly mitigated.
    Table 2 also shows that sub-optimal domestic stabilization continues to be costly in terms of
welfare. Moreover, the welfare loss relative to the Ramsey optimal policy are larger under LCP
compared to what observed in the presence of PCP. As shown by Figure 4, historical policy implies
that Home terms of trade do not depreciate enough in response to an increase in Home produc-
tivity due the lack of unemployment stabilization. Since the optimal terms-of-trade depreciation
engineered by the Ramsey authority is larger under LCP relative to PCP, historical policy becomes
more costly.
  32
     For simplicity we assume that all the producers set export prices in Foreign currency. The model could be easily
extended to allow for an exogenous partition of ...rms operating under PCP and LCP.

Optimal Non-Cooperative Monetary Policy We now investigate whether strategic consid-
erations a¤ect the conduct of monetary policy in the presence of trade integration. As common
practice in the literature, we consider two self-oriented central banks that set monetary policy to
maximize the welfare of domestic consumers.
         The strategic game follows Benigno and Benigno (2006). We specify each policymaker'
                                                                                           s strategy

                        s consumer price ination rate,                C;t ,   taking as given the sequence of the
other country'
             s consumer price in ation rates (a two-country, open-loop Nash equilibrium). Thus,
                                   X1                                          n     o1
                                        t
the Home central bank maximizes E0        [u(Ct ) lt v (ht )], taking as given   C;t    . The central
                                                                                                  t=0
                                            t=0
                                                                                                       1
in Bank in Foreign solves an analogous maximization problem, taking as given f                    C;t gt=0 .

         In a Nash equilibrium, domestic policymakers have an incentive to manipulate their country'
                                                                                                   s
terms of trade, resulting in ine¢ cient exchange rate volatility relative to the constrained e¢ cient
benchmark of policy cooperation. Table 2 shows that when trade linkages are weak, the welfare
loss associated to the non-cooperative outcome is very modest (almost 0 percent, regardless of the
assumptions about the currency denomination of export). Intuitively, weak trade linkages imply
that each policymaker has no incentives to manipulate terms of trade.
         Stronger trade linkages do not signi...cantly change this conclusion. Table 2 shows that the
welfare costs of non-cooperative monetary policy relative to the Ramsey-optimal allocation reach
at most 0:2 percent.33 Once again, this result is explained by the increase in comovement induced by
trade integration (see Table 3): business cycle synchronization reduces the incentives to manipulate
terms of trade since shocks become more global.34


8        Conclusions

We re-examined classic questions on trade integration and international monetary policy using a
dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium model with micro-level trade dynamics and labor market
frictions. We have shown that trade-induced productivity gains reduce the need of positive ination
to correct long-run distortions. Over the business cycle, optimized inward-looking policy rules can
still approximate the optimal cooperative outcome, as stronger trade linkages result in increased
    33
     We have also considered the case in which the optimal non-cooperative problem is described in terms of particular
interest rate rules. In this case, each central bank maximizes the domestic welfare by choosing the coe¢ cients of
the interest rate rule in equation (8). The best response coe¢ cients for each policymaker do not di¤er from the
cooperative equilibrium regardless of the level of trade integration (results are available upon request).
  34
     Absent search and matching frictions and endogenous producer entry, with strong trade linkages the welfare cost
of business cycles under the Nash-optimal policy can be 20 percent higher relative to the optimal-cooperative policy
(see Appendix I and the results in Coenen, Lombardo, Smets, and Straub, 2007).

business cycle synchronization. By contrast, sub-optimal, inward-looking stabilization-- for instance
too narrow a focus on price stability-- results in larger welfare costs.
   Much remains to be done in this area of research. We modeled trade integration as an exogenous
reduction in tari¤s (iceberg trade costs), but trade integration may also take the form of lower
...xed costs of trade. Moreover, we did not analyze optimal trade policy nor its potentially strategic
interdependence with monetary policymaking. Finally, our analysis abstracts from zero-lower-
bound considerations and the role of ...nancial frictions, additional dimensions that may a¤ect how
trade linkages shape monetary policy tradeo¤s. We view these as important, promising areas where
to take this research next.

A    Wage Determination

The nominal wage is the solution of an individual Nash bargaining process, and the wage payment
divides the match surplus between workers and ...rms. Let Jt be the real value of an existing
productive match:

                                             n
                                            wt         #   2
                           Jt = 't Zt ht       ht          w;t   + Et   t;t+1 (1   )Jt+1 :                    (1)
                                            Pt         2

Intuitively, Jt is the per-period marginal value product of the match, 't Zt ht , net of the wage bill
and costs incurred to adjust wages, plus the expected discounted continuation value of the match
in the future.
    Next, denote with Wt the worker's asset value of being matched, and with Uu;t the value of
being unemployed. The value of being employed at time t is given by the real wage bill the worker
receives plus the expected future value of being matched to the ...rm. With probability 1                     the
match will survive, while with probability           the worker will be unemployed. As a result:


                                   wt
                            Wt =      ht + Et       t;t+1 [(1     )Wt+1 + Uu;t+1 ] :                          (2)

The value of unemployment is given by:

                               v (ht )
                      Uu;t =           + b + Et           t;t+1 [ t Wt+1          + (1         t )Uu;t+1 ]    :                         (3)
                                uC;t

In this expression, v (ht )=uC;t is the utility gain from leisure in terms of consumption, b is an un-
employment bene...t from the government (...nanced with lump sum taxes), and                                          t   is the probability
of becoming employed at time t, equal to the ratio between the total number of matches and the
total number of workers searching for jobs at time t:                      t      Mt =Ut .
   Equations (2) and (3) imply that the worker's surplus Ht                                   Wt    Uu;t is determined by:

                            wt           v (ht )
                     Ht =      ht                + b + (1                           t )Et      t;t+1 Ht+1         :                     (4)
                            Pt            uC;t

   Nash bargaining maximizes the joint surplus Jt Ht1                            with respect to wt , where                  2 (0; 1) is the
...rm'
     s bargaining power. The ...rst-order condition implies:

                                                 @Jt                       @Ht
                                         Ht          + (1            )Jt       = 0;                                                     (5)
                                                 @wt                       @wt

where:
                  @Jt       ht           w;t                                                             w;t+1
                      =             #            + (1        )#Et              t;t+1 (1   +    w;t+1 )                ;                 (6)
                  @wt       Pt          wt   1                                                           wt

and:
                                                        @Ht  ht
                                                            = :                                                                         (7)
                                                        @wt  Pt

The sharing rule can then be rewritten as:


                                                   t Ht   = (1         t )Jt ;                                                          (8)


where:

                                         t   =                                            :                                             (9)
                                                                      @Ht @Jt
                                                        (1       )    @wt = @wt

Equation (8) shows that bargaining shares are time-varying due to the presence of wage adjustment
costs. Absent wage adjustment costs, we would have @Jt =@wt =                                      @Ht =@wt and a time-invariant




                                                             A-2
bargaining share            t   = . The bargained wage satis...es:

                 wt                     v (ht )                                              #       2
                    ht =           t            + b + (1              t)       't Zt ht              w;t
                 Pt                      uC;t                                                2
                                                                                                                                     t
                                 +Et          t;t+1 Jt+1   (1         )(1           t)     (1                 t )(1        t+1 )              ;            (10)
                                                                                                                                   t+1


        Finally, notice that equation (10) implies that the value of a match to a producer can be
rewritten as:

It follows that home'

income on the assets position entering period t plus the di¤erence between home'

A similar equation holds in Foreign:

   Now, multiply equation (23) by Qt , subtract the resulting equation from (22) and use the bond
market clearing conditions at+1 + at+1 = 0 = a                 ;t+1   +a     ;t+1   in all periods. It follows that:

This is the familiar result that net foreign assets depend positively on the cross-country di¤erential
in production of ...nal consumption output and negatively on relative absorption.
   Notice next that home absorption of consumption must equal absorption of consumption output
from home ...rms and output from foreign ...rms:


                                        YtC = ND;t ~D;t y
                                                        ~D;t + NX;t ~X;t y
                                                                         ~X;t ;


where we used the fact that           X;t   = Qt   D;t .   Similarly,


                                        YtC = ND;t ~D;t y
                                                        ~D;t + NX;t ~X;t y

Substituting these results into equation (24) yields net foreign assets as a function of interest income

intuition for the tradeo¤s facing the Ramsey policymaker. The table contains 25 equations that de-
termine 25 endogenous variables of interest: Ct ; ~D;t ; lt ; ht ; Vt ; ND;t ; wt =Pt ; z

E        Model Properties

Table A.2 presents model-implied, HP-...ltered second moments (normal fonts). Bold fonts denote
data moments, where cross-country correlations are averages of bilateral GDP and consumption
correlations between the U.S. and its four largest trading partners during the period considered for
the model calibration (Canada, Japan, Germany and UK).
        The model correctly reproduces the volatility of U.S. consumption, investment, and real wages
    1
     We assume that the other variables that appear in the table have been substituted out by using the appropriate
equations and de...nitions above.
   2
     In the primal approach to Ramsey policy problems described by Lucas and Stokey (1983), the competitive
equilibrium is expressed in terms of a minimal set of relations involving only real allocations. In the presence of sticky
prices and wages, it is impossible to reduce the Ramsey planner'    s problem to a maximization problem with a single
implementability constraint.



                                                                            A-8
relative to GDP. Moreover, it generates a negative Beveridge curve, and all the ...rst-order auto-
correlations are in line with the data.3 Investment volatility is lowered relative to the excessive
volatility generated by a standard IRBC framework because product creation requires hiring new
workers. This process is time consuming due to search and matching frictions in the labor market,
dampening investment dynamics. In contrast, consumption is more volatile than in traditional
models as shocks induce larger and longer-lasting income e¤ects.
        The model is quite successful in matching the cyclical properties of trade data: imports and
exports are more volatile than GDP, net exports are countercyclical and the volatility of the trade
balance relative to GDP is in line with the data. The model can also reproduce a ranking of cross-
country correlations that is a challenge for standard IRBC models: GDP correlation is larger than
consumption correlation. As shown in Figure 1 in the main text, an increase in Home productivity
generates Foreign expansion through trade linkages, as demand-side complementarities more than
o¤set the e¤ect of resource shifting to the more productive economy. Moreover, absent technology
spillovers, Foreign consumers have weaker incentives to increase consumption on impact, which
reduces cross-country consumption correlation.


F        Social Planner Allocation and Ine¢ ciency Wedges

The Ramsey planner uses its policy instruments (the Home and Foreign interest rates) to address
the consequences of a set of distortions that exist in the market economy. To understand these
distortions and the tradeo¤s they create for optimal policy, it is instructive to compare the equi-
librium conditions of the market economy to those implied by the solution to a ...rst-best, optimal
planning problem. This allows us to de...ne ine¢ ciency wedges for the market economy (relative to
the planner's optimum) and describe Ramsey policy in terms of its implications for these wedges.


F.1       Planner Economy

Here we derive the ...rst-best allocation chosen by a benevolent social planner for the world economy,
summarized in Table A.3. The social planner chooses:


               fCt ; Ct ; lt ; lt ; ht ; ht ; Vt ; Vt ; YD;t ; YD;t ; YX;t ; YX;t ; z      ~X;t ; ND;t+1 ; ND;t+1 g1

    The close match between data- and model-implied real wage moments provides indirect support for our calibration
of the nominal wage adjustment cost.

features of technology-- the technology for product and job creation-- that characterizes also the

   The ...rst constraint in the social planner'

as discussed in the main text. We denote the Lagrange multiplier associated to the constraint (27)
with $t , which corresponds to the social marginal cost of producing an extra unit of intermediate
output.
   The second constraint is that total output can be used for consumption and vacancy creation:

                                                            1                   1        1

The Lagrange multiplier associated to this constraint,                     t,   represents the social marginal utility of

   Finally, the third constraint is that the stock of labor in the current period is equal to the
number of workers that were not exogenously separated plus previous period matches that become
productive in the current period:

                                                                              1 " "

The Lagrange multiplier associated to this constraint,                t,   denotes the real marginal value of a match
to society.
   The ...rst-order condition for consumption implies that                           t   = uC;t . De...ning the real exchange

   The demand schedules for Home output are obtained by combining the ...rst-order conditions

The expected cost of ...lling a vacancy                        =qt must be equal to its (social) expected bene...t. The
latter is given by the average value of output produced by one worker net of the disutility of labor,
augmented by the continuation value of the match. Finally, the ...rst-order condition for hours
implies vh;t = $t Zt . Table A.3 summarizes the equilibrium conditions for the planned economy.


F.2      Ine¢ ciency Wedges

Here we derive the ine¢ ciency wedges that characterize the market economy by comparing the
equilibrium allocation in the decentralized economy (Table A.1) to the one chosen by the social
planner (Table A.3).
   The presence of price and wage stickiness, ...rm monopoly power, positive unemployment ben-
e...ts, and incomplete markets induces ten sources of distortion (summarized in Table A.4) in the
market economy. These distortions a¤ect three margins of adjustment and the resource constraint
for consumption output in the decentralized economy:

   The wedge             P C;t   is induced by the presence of sticky prices which result in ine¢ cient time-
variation and lack of synchronization of domestic and export markups:                                     D;t          D;t 1 = D;t     1

                                                                                            = 0), the product creation wedge

 P C;t   is zero.


                                                                    A-12
Job creation margin: Comparing the term in square brackets in equation (11) in Table A.1 to

along the market economy's job creation margin. As for the product creation wedge, subtracting
the term for the planned outcome from that for the market economy and scrolling time indexes
backward by one period yields:

                       qt    1                      wt      #    2                                 v (ht )            qt 1

   The wedge                 JC;t     is a combination of various distortions. Monopoly power in the ...nal sector
distorts the job creation decision by inducing a suboptimally low return from vacancy posting,
captured by             ';t           1=    D;t .   Failure of the Hosios condition (for which equality of the ...rm's
bargaining share and the vacancy elasticity of the matching function is necessary for e¢ ciency) is
an additional distortion in this margin, measured by                                    ;t         t     ". This is a¤ected both by the
exible-wage value of the bargaining share ( , which can be di¤erent from ") and the presence
of wage stickiness, which induces time variation of                               t.    Sticky wages are su¢ cient to generate a
wedge between private and social returns to vacancy posting. Moreover, they distort job creation
also by a¤ecting the outside option of ...rms through an additional term                                                      #   2 =2.    Finally,
                                                                                                                       w ;t       w;t

 ';t   =      ;t   =        b;t   =     w ;t   = 0, the real wage is determined by

                                              ht = "         + (1      ")   D;t Zt ht   + (1             ") t =qt ;

and    JC;t   = 0.


Labor supply margin:                           With endogenous labor supply, monopoly power in product markets,

 ';t         1=    D;t            1, induces a misalignment of relative prices between consumption goods and
leisure. This is the distortion that characterizes standard New Keynesian models without labor
market frictions. The associated wedge                          h;t     ';t ,   which is time-varying for the presence of sticky
prices.


Cross-country risk sharing margin: Incomplete markets imply ine¢ cient risk sharing between
Home and Foreign households, resulting in the distortion                                     Q;t       (uC ;t =uC;t ) =Qt . The departure of
relative consumption from the perfect risk sharing outcome is also a¤ected by the costs of adjusting


                                                                       A-13
bond holdings (the distortion              a;t     at+1 + a   ;t+1   and its Foreign mirror image in the Euler
equations for Home and Foreign holdings of bonds). We summarize the combined e¤ect of these
distortions with the ...nancial ine¢ ciency wedge             RS;t    (uC ;t =uC;t ) =Qt =      Q;t .   E¢ ciency along
this margin requires         RS;t   = 1.


Consumption resource constraint:                    Sticky prices and wages imply diversion of resources from
consumption and creation of new product lines and vacancies, with the distortions                                 #   2 =2,
                                                                                                         w ;t         w;t
                2 =2   and                 2 =2.   The associated wedge (de...ned by                              +         +
    D ;t        D;t            X ;t        X;t                                               Y C ;t        w ;t        D;


    X ;t   ) is zero under exible wages and prices.
     The market allocation is e¢ cient only if all the distortions and associated ine¢ ciency wedges
are zero at all points in time. Since we abstract from optimal ...scal policy and focus on asymmetric
shocks, it follows that we work in a second-best environment in which the e¢ cient allocation cannot
be achieved. In this second-best environment, the Ramsey central bank optimally uses its leverage
on the economies via the sticky-price and sticky-wage distortions, trading o¤ its costs (including
the resource costs) against the possibility of addressing the distortions that characterize the market
economy under exible wages and prices.


G      Additional Sensitivity Analysis

G.1         Optimal-Trend Ination: Robustness Analysis

Table A.5 reports the optimal (annualized) ination rate for alternative models and for di¤erent
levels of trade integration (i.e., for di¤erent values of the iceberg trade costs). The "Baseline"
scenario refers to the model presented in Section 2 in the main text. The "No Wage Rigidity"
scenario assumes exible wages, i.e., the wage-adjustment cost is equal to zero (# = 0). The "No
Price Stickiness" model assumes exible prices, i.e., the price-adjustment cost is equal to zero
(   = 0). The "Calvo Price Stickiness" scenario refers to a version of the model that assumes
staggered price adjustment in the ...nal-goods sector (rather than a quadratic adjustment cost).
We present the equilibrium conditions of this alternative model in Section G.3 below. We set the
probability of not readjusting prices to a conventional value of 0:75. Finally, the "New-Keynesian
Model"corresponds to a benchmark New Keynesian model that features staggered price and wage
adjustment. We present the equilibrium conditions of this model in Section I below. In this case,
we set the probability of not readjusting prices and wages to 0:75.



                                                         A-14
   Table A.5 shows that what motivates a positive optimal long-run ination rate is wage stickiness
and not price rigidities. In fact, absent wage stickiness, the central bank loses its ability to a¤ect
job creation and the optimal ination rate is                    = 0 under both Rotemberg and Calvo price-setting
frictions. The reason behind this result is that the Ramsey-optimal policy engineers positive net
ination to stimulate job creation through its leverage on the e¤ective ...rm bargaining power. Once
this channel of transmission is muted, the standard prescription of zero optimal long-run ination
that emerges in benchmark New Keynesian models is restored.
   Both Rotemberg and Calvo price stickiness lower the optimal ination rate in the presence of
nominal wage rigidity. To see this, notice that with exible prices (and sticky wages),                                = 2:44%
when trade linkages are weak, a higher ...gure relative to both Calvo and Rotemberg price stickiness.
To summarize, the welfare costs of price-setting frictions-- either due to a waste of productive
resources (Rotemberg) or due to price dispersion (Calvo)-- lower the central bank's incentive to

wage rigidity and search-and-matching frictions that motivates a positive optimal long-run ination

G.2     Nominal Wage Indexation

We introduce nominal wage indexation by assuming that the real cost of changing nominal wages
between period t and t        1 is given by

                                                                                    2
                                                 #    wt                  w
                                                          (1 +      t)          1       ;
                                                 2   wt 1

where   w   2 [0; 1] measures the degree to which nominal wage adjustment is indexed to contempo-
raneous price ination,                                                                                C)
                             t.   We assume            t   is equal to CPI ination (        w;t   =   t    or, alternatively, to
its data-consistent counterpart (            t   = ~C
                                                    t ).

   The value of a match is now given by:


                                                     wt        #   2
                           Jt = 't Zt ht                ht         w;t   + Et   t;t+1 (1    )Jt+1 ;
                                                     Pt        2
                                                 w
where    w;t     (wt =wt   1 ) (1   +   t)            1. The worker asset value of a match and the value of




                                                               A-15
unemployment are unchanged. The Nash bargaining ...rst-order condition implies:

                                                       @Jt                   @Ht
                                                  Ht       + (1        )Jt       = 0;
                                                       @wt                   @wt

where:

         @Jt                      w;t        w                                             w;t+1                      w
             Pt =   ht       #    R      t       (1 +   C;t )   + (1       )#Et    t;t+1     R
                                                                                                   (1 +   w;t+1 )   t+1   :
         @wt                     wt 1                                                      wt

   When     w   = 0, there is no wage indexation, which corresponds to the benchmark version of
the model. When          w   = 1 (full indexation), the real cost of changing nominal wages is zero in
steady state, since      w   =     C    = ~ C . In the latter case, steady-state ination no longer a¤ects job
creation, since the ...rm bargaining power is equal to the exogenous weight of ...rm surplus in the
Nash bargaining problem. As discussed above, the implication of this result is that with                                      w   =1
the Ramsey-optimal ination is zero for any value of trade costs.
   The empirical evidence concerning the degree of wage indexation has not converged to a punctual
indication yet. For the U.S. economy, the estimation of medium-scale DSGE model typically yields
...gures that lie between 0.1 and 0.5. The estimates in Ascari, Branzoli, and Castelnuovo (2011),
obtained using microdata, suggest an average ...gure around 0.5. Thus, we quantitatively explore
the importance of wage indexation by setting iw = 0:5. When trade linkages are weak, the Ramsey-
optimal ination target,           R,    remains well above 1 percent, since                  R   = 1:32 percent. With weak
trade linkages, the optimal long-run ination target drops to                          R    = 1:08 percent. Finally, none of
the results about monetary policy stabilization and trade linkages are signi...cantly a¤ected by the
introduction of nominal wage indexation.


G.3      Calvo-Price Setting

Here we present the equilibrium conditions for a version of the model that features staggered price
setting. The only modi...cation to the baseline model concerns the optimal pricing problem for
...nal-goods producers.
   In each period, there is a ...xed probability 1                     p   that a multi-product ...rm can adjust its price.
As in the baseline model, we assume producer currency pricing (PCP). Each ...nal producer sets

In addition, recall that YD =               D    Y C and YX =                        X    Y C . In a symmetric steady state, the latter
expression implies Y C = (PX =P ) YX . Moreover, PX;t = PX;t

Job Creation

First notice that in a steady state with zero wage ination the real wage is given by:


                                             wr = (hp + b) + (1                             ) ('t Zt + { ) :


By substituting the wage equation into the job creation equation, and using q = #"                                                                    1
                                                                                                                                                          ,we obtain:

                                         1
                            #1    "
                                                       (1      ) +             (hp + b) + (1                           ) { = 'Z:                                 (39)


Taking the total di¤erential of equation (39) we obtain:

                                          @{
                                             =                             1

Since our calibration implies that         < 1, then              1   >   (1        ) and @ { =@' > 0.

I     A Benchmark New Keynesian Model

We consider a two-country New Keynesian model that abstracts from search-and-matching frictions
and endogenous producer entry. As in the baseline model, there are two vertically integrated
production sectors in each country. In the upstream sector, perfectly competitive ...rms use labor
to produce an intermediate input. In the downstream sector, representative monopolistically-
competitive ...rms purchase intermediate input and produce di¤erentiated varieties. The model
features both price and wage rigidities as in Erceg, Henderson, and Levine (2000).
      Here we limit ourselves to presenting the equilibrium conditions that are new relative to the
baseline model.

      We now discuss the determination of the optimal price. In each period, there is a ...xed proba-
bility 1            p   that a ...rm can adjust its price. We consider both producer currency pricing (PCP)
and local currency pricing (LCP).


Producer Currency Pricing (PCP)

Under PCP, producer j sets the domestic price PDj ;t and let the export price be determined by
PXj ;t =         t PDj ;t =St .
                                                                               ~D ;t to maximize the expected
                                  When resetting the price, producer j chooses P j

present discounted value of pro...ts:

The CPI index implies: 1 = (1                           X ) D;t           +        X X;t       , where      D;t       PD;t =Pt and             X;t     PX;t =Pt .
In turn, the domestic price index is given by

                                    1      p                      1        p              1 p                         p    1
                                    D;t        = (1          p ) ~D;t           +       p D;t 1 (1   +      C;t+1 )            :


Concerning the export price index,                          X;t   = ( t =Qt )            D;t   under PCP, while:

                                     1     p                         1      p             1 p                          p   1

I.6   Calibration

Consistent with the benchmark model of Section 2, we set      =       p   = 3:8. We set the elasticity of
substitution for the di¤erentiated labor inputs at the conventional value           = 6. We set the Calvo
probabilities of not readjusting prices and wages such that   w   =       p   = 0:75.
