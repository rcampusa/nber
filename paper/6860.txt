                           Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts

                                Martin Feldstein and Daniel Altman*

         Unemployment insurance exists to provide protection against the hardship that would

otherwise be caused by unemployment. Unfortunately, it also distorts incentives in ways that cause

inefficient increases in total unemployment. In this paper we analyze empirically a modification of

the traditional unemployment insurance system. We show that this alternative, based on individual

savings accounts, can substantially reduce the adverse incentive effects of the existing unemployment

insurance system without any decrease in the protection of those who become unemployed.

         Our analysis is therefore fundamentally different from previous studies investigating how the

adverse incentive effects of the current tax-financed unemployment insurance system could be

reduced by changes in basic program parameters such as the level and duration of benefits, the

experience rating rules, and the provision of bonuses for hiring the unemployed (Baily, 1978; Meyer,

1995; Mortenson, 1994). Many others have no doubt considered the possibility of substituting

individual saving accounts for the current tax-financed UI system (see, for example, Coloma, 1996;

Orszag and Snower, 1997) but we know of no empirical research on its feasibility.

         The basic system that we examine requires each individual to save a fraction of his or her

wage income in a special Unemployment Insurance Saving Account (UISA). If the individual loses

his job and would be eligible for unemployment benefits under the current UI rules, he withdraws an

amount equal to the regular UI benefits from his personal UISA. If the funds in the account are not

sufficient to pay the benefit, the government lends the necessary amount to the account. Accounts

earn a market rate of return on existing balances and pay the government the same return on

borrowed amounts. At retirement age the funds in the UISA are merged into the individual’s IRA or

other investment-based retirement saving plans. An individual who dies with a positive account

balance bequeaths that amount to his spouse or other heirs. The government cancels the debt of those

who reach retirement age (or die before then) with negative account balances. More details of the

plan are described in section 2 below.

         All unemployed individuals would therefore receive the same cash amounts during spells of

unemployment from their UISAs as they would under the existing unemployment insurance rules.

Their full current protection is thus maintained. Any individual whose UISA always has a positive

balance (and who expects that it would remain positive) would completely internalize the cost of

unemployment benefits and therefore would not have any incentive to increase in an inefficient way

the frequency or duration of his unemployment spells because of the availability of those benefits.

The adverse incentive problem would arise only for individuals who expect that they will retire or die

with negative balances in their UISAs. For such individuals, the benefits received because of

additional unemployment have no personal cost.          They face the same incentives to excess

unemployment that they would under the existing unemployment system, but without the discipline

that comes from employer experience rating.1

    1
    Experience rating can affect firms’ decisions to lay off employees and the duration of
unemployment among those on temporary layoff. Although the U.S. unemployment insurance
rules provide for experience rating, many firms do not face effective experience rating. We return

                                                  2
         The feasibility of this savings account approach to unemployment insurance depends on the

extent to which insured unemployment is concentrated in a subgroup of the population. Some

individuals experience a disproportionate share of the total unemployment days and this concentration

applies to insured unemployment as well as to unemployment in general (see, e.g., Meyer and

Rosenbaum, 1996). If the insured unemployment is sufficiently concentrated, individuals may not be

able to finance their own unemployment benefits by saving moderate shares of their earnings in the

UISAs.2 The use of individual savings accounts to finance unemployment benefits would be irrelevant

if those who collect benefits would typically have negative balance accounts and therefore be drawing

on the government guarantee.

         Before carrying out the current research, we regarded this as a potentially serious problem

that could make the savings account approach unworkable. It is important therefore to assess the

proportion of individuals who develop negative account balances and the extent to which UI benefits

are now paid to individuals who would have negative accounts. To do so we examine the extensive

experience represented by individuals in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Our analysis

of these data implies that approximately five percent of employees would retire or die with negative

account balances and that only about half of all benefits from the UISAs would be paid to such

individuals. The cost to the government of the unrecovered loans in the negative accounts is



to these issues below, including an option that provides some of the incentive effects of
experience rating.
    2
    To the extent that the identities of those who will experience large amounts of lifetime
unemployment are unknown at the start of their working lives, the social provision and subsidy of
unemployment benefits would therefore be a kind of optimal catastrophic insurance.

substantially less than the cost of the current unemployment insurance system, permitting a reduction

in the current distortionary payroll tax as well as in the distortionary effects of the existing benefit

system. These findings tell us that the savings account approach to unemployment insurance,

combined with a government guarantee, can be an economically viable policy option.

         The first section of this paper summarizes the existing unemployment insurance system and

discusses the various ways in which it causes a rise in the frequency and duration of unemployment.

In section 2 we describe the operation of the Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts and the

several alternative funding options that we will analyze in the remainder of the paper. Section 3 then

uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to show how a large group of individuals would have been

affected by these alternatives to the existing unemployment insurance system over periods of up to

25 years. Section 4 analyzes the distributional effects of the UISA system and of the associated

reduction in the UI payroll tax. Section 5 briefly discusses the potential mutually reinforcing effect

of a behavioral response of unemployment to the improved incentives implied by the UISA system.

There is a brief concluding section.

1.       The Current Unemployment Insurance System and Its Problems

         To discuss the distorting effects of the current UI system on the frequency and duration of

unemployment, it is useful to begin by reviewing the current system’s basic rules. Although

unemployment insurance rules differ among the individual states, the basic structure is quite similar

throughout the country. An individual who has worked a sufficient amount or earned a sufficient




Uisa.120598



                                                   4
amount of wage income during the past year is eligible to receive benefits if he or she is laid off.3

Benefits are approximately 50 percent of the unemployed individual’s previous gross wage, subject

to a minimum weekly benefit floor that raises the percentage for low wage workers and a maximum

weekly benefit ceiling that lowers the percentage for high wage works. Some states also provide

supplementary benefits if the unemployed individual has a dependent spouse or children. The average

weekly benefit in 1997 was $193. Benefits are generally payable for a maximum of 26 weeks.

         Benefits are subject to federal personal income tax but not to the Social Security payroll tax

(or the equivalent tax for self-employed individuals). Some states include unemployment benefits in

taxable income for assessing the state income tax.

         Unemployment benefits are financed by taxes levied on firms by the state governments. Each

firm pays a percentage of the earnings of each employee up to a relatively low maximum level that

varies among the states; the maximum taxable wage for the UI tax was only $7,000 in most states in

1997. The percentage that each firm pays depends on the past experience of that firm as a UI taxpayer

and of its employees as UI benefit recipients. This “experience rating” system is intended to cause the

firms to internalize the cost of the unemployment benefits of its employees. However, because there

are both lower and upper limits on these state UI tax rates, many firms are not effectively experience

rated, i.e., an additional layoff or an additional week of unemployment by a former employee would




    3
    Individuals who quit a job may be eligible for benefits if their quitting is found to be “for just
cause.” In some states quitters are eligible after an extensive waiting period. Unemployed
individuals who are new entrants to the labor force or reentrants without recent work experience
are not eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.

have no effect on the firm’s UI tax bill.4

           The most obvious and most thoroughly researched effect of the existing UI system on

unemployment is the increase in the duration of the unemployment spells. By reducing the cost of

remaining unemployed, UI benefits induce individuals to have longer spells in order to search for a

better job or simply to enjoy some leisure or the opportunity to work at home. There is substantial

evidence that the level and maximum duration of UI benefits affects the level of reservation wages

and the duration of unemployment spells (Feldstein and Poterba, 1984; Katz and Meyer, 1990;

Moffitt, 1985).

           This evidence and the underlying search theory (e.g., Baily, 1977) would seem to provide a

clear case that UI induces excessive search. Calculations for a typical employee imply that the

combination of UI benefits and personal taxes reduces the net cost of search to about one-fourth of

the unemployed individual’s potential marginal product5. However, against this presumption that UI

benefits cause excessive search it is sometimes argued that in the absence of unemployment benefits

individuals would not search long enough because they lack access to the capital market and therefore

could not finance the optimal amount of search. The Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts

    5
    Consider an individual who can earn $100 a day and faces a federal marginal income tax rate
of 28 percent, a state marginal income tax rate of 5 percent and a payroll tax rate of 7.65 percent.
Taxes reduce the net take-home pay of that individual from the $100 gross pay to $59.35. If the
individual is unemployed, he or she receives gross unemployment benefits of $50, subject to a 28
percent federal income tax; the resulting net benefit is therefore $36. The net cost to the
individual of remaining unemployed for the day is the difference between these two net amounts
or $23.35. By contrast the individual’s marginal product of labor is the sum of the $100 gross
pay and the additional $7.65 employer payroll tax. The net cost of remaining unemployed is thus
only 22 percent of the marginal product of labor.
Uisa.120598

provide the access to funds to finance the optimal search with a reinsurance mechanism provided by

the government in case the individual’s fund is exhausted. Individuals with positive UISA balances

are motivated to take the costs and benefits of search into account correctly6 while those with

permanently negative account balances are in the same situation as today’s UI recipients. T h e

current system of UI benefits not only increases the duration of unemployment of those who are

unemployed but also increases the frequency of temporary layoffs. Because of the subsidy inherent

in the current system of benefits, individuals will prefer to be unemployed rather than to work at a

time when the marginal revenue product of their labor is depressed (Feldstein, 1976). Empirical

research (Card and Levine, 1994; Feldstein, 1978) shows that this is true for seasonal unemployment

and other forms of temporary layoffs. If individuals were instead to finance such spells of

unemployment by drawing from their own UISAs they would have no incentive to choose excessive

spells of temporary unemployment.

         The current payment of benefits to workers who become unemployed reduces the wage

premium required to compensate employees for the risk of being laid off. The unemployment

insurance system thus lowers the cost of production in firms that have above-average layoff rates,

whether for cyclical, seasonal or other reasons.        The reduced cost of production in such

unemployment-intensive firms lowers the price of the associated product and therefore raises its share

in GDP relative to what it would be without the UI subsidy. This shift in the mix of products raises


    6
    The opportunity cost of search is still substantially less than the marginal product of labor but
the gain from search is also reduced by the same set of marginal tax rates. With the capital
market problem solved, the amount of search done by a rational and risk-neutral individual will be
optimal.

                                                  7
the overall unemployment rate. Once again, the UISAs would eliminate the subsidy for those with

positive balances, leading to an adjustment in wages that raises the cost of those products and of

those firms that contribute most to overall unemployment.

2.       Unemployment Insurance Savings Accounts: Five Alternative Options

         In a UISA plan each individual (or that individual’s employer7) would be required to

contribute a fraction of wage income to a UISA. The magnitude of this mandatory saving is limited

in different ways in the alterative options described in this section. The options specify different limits

on the maximum annual income to which the saving fraction applies. Some options permit deposits

to stop when the accumulated balance reaches a specified fraction of the individual’s annual earnings.

         The funds deposited to the UISA would come from pretax income, just as current UI tax

payments do. They would accumulate tax-free. If the funds are withdrawn in lieu of UI benefits, they

would be considered taxable income just as UI benefits are today. It would be natural to apply the

tax to the funds withdrawn in retirement or by heirs, just as 401k and traditional IRA funds are taxed.

Alternatively, the funds deposited in UISAs could come from after-tax income and subsequent

withdrawals would be untaxed (as they are in Roth IRAs).

         The funds in the UISAs might be invested by the individuals in a variety of ways similar to

IRA or 401k investments. Since the government augments the funds in those accounts that have

insufficient funds to meet benefits during spells of unemployment, the nature of the investments might


     7
     The current UI taxes are paid by employers but the incidence of the tax would presumably be
the same if the tax were paid by employees. Similarly, gross wages would adjust down if UISA
deposits were made by employers rather than employees, since these deposits are the property of
the individual workers and are similar to a form of tax-preferred cash compensation.
Uisa.120598



                                                    8
be more tightly regulated than the funds in IRAs or 401k accounts. We shall not explore this issue

here but will discuss calculations based on two alternative investment strategies.



          In the more conservative strategy, the UISAs are invested in money market mutual funds that

earn the six-month commercial paper rate of interest. In an alternative investment strategy, the

accounts are invested in a continuously rebalanced mixture consisting of 60 percent corporate stock

(represented by the Standard and Poors 500 index) and 40 percent corporate bonds (based on the

Salomon Brothers bond index). This portfolio produced a real rate of return of 5.9 percent for the

period from 1946 to 1992 (Feldstein and Ranguelova, 1998). We reduce this yield by 0.4 percentage

points (to 5.5 percent) to allow for administrative costs of the portfolio management.

          We assume that individuals must choose permanently between the commercial paper strategy

and the 5.5 percent strategy and may not change their rates of return at any time in the analysis. The

individuals whose account balances are insufficient to pay the benefits to which they are entitled can

borrow from the government at the same rate as they earn in their account. The results that we

present below show that our conclusions are not sensitive to the choice between these two rates of

return.

          The amounts that individuals would withdraw from their UISAs when they are eligible for

benefits under current UI rules are the same as the benefits that they would receive under the current

UI system. Each of the five options that we study requires individuals to contribute 4 percent of their

wages up to the maximum amount specified by that particular option. We assume a five year start-up

period during which individuals contribute to their UISAs but during which the unemployed continue

Uisa.120598



                                                   9
to receive government UI benefits under the current system.

         After describing these five alternatives, we use the Panel Study of Income Dynamics data to

assess how the choice among these options affects the performance of the system.

Option 1         High Saving Base

         Individuals contribute 4 percent of earnings up to a maximum of about three times the average

weekly wage. For the first year of the PSID data (1967) , the annual wage ceiling for our UISA

contributions is $15,000. This ceiling then grows in proportion to the growth of the average weekly

wage, reaching about $52,000 in 1991.

Option 2         Low Saving Base

         The saving base in option 1 permits a rapid accumulation of UISA balances by high wage

earners but is arguably unnecessarily high for two reasons. First, the dollar limit on the level of

weekly benefits is equivalent to providing a 50 percent replacement rate only up to a level that is

approximately equal to the average weekly wage. Second, the frequency of unemployment declines

as wages rise and is substantially less among individuals with above average wages.

         Option 2 requires individuals to contribute 4 percent of all earnings up to a level only slightly

above the median wage, a level that is also roughly equal to the level of wages on which UI benefits

are currently based. For the first year of the PSID data (1967), the wage ceiling is taken to be

$6,000. This ceiling then grows in proportion to the growth of the average weekly wage, reaching

$21,000 in 1991.

Option 3         Target Account Fund

         In the first two options, individuals are required to continue contributing to their UISAs

Uisa.120598



                                                    10
regardless of their unemployment experience and of the amounts accumulated in their accounts. Since

benefits are 50 percent of wages (up to the ceiling) and last for no more than six months in a spell,

the maximum benefit that can be drawn in a single spell is only one-fourth of a year’s earnings. Most

spells of unemployment are substantially shorter than six months, the median spell being less than ten

weeks in almost all years. Spells would be even shorter with the change in incentives provided by the

savings account approach.

         Option 3 therefore provides that the individual stops contributing to the UISA when the

accumulated balance reaches 50 percent of the individual’s wage income in the previous year or 50

percent of the ceiling amount in option 2 if that is smaller.

Option 4        Experience-Based Target Account Fund

         Individuals with substantial risk of unemployment should have larger account balances than

those who are less likely to be unemployed. Option 3 can be modified to reduce the target level of

the account fund for those with low unemployment experience and to increase it for those with

substantial unemployment experience. Option 4 provides one such modification. Individuals save

until the fund reaches the sum of (1) 30 percent of the individual’s annual wage (or of the wage

ceiling specified in options 2 and 3 if that is lower) plus (2) twice the individual’s total UI withdrawals

during the past two years.

         Consider, for example, an individual with $30,000 of base period annual wage income who

has had two eight-week spells of compensated unemployment during the past two years. The UISA




Uisa.120598



                                                    11
withdrawals during those 16 weeks would be $3,200.8 Option 3 would require that individual to save

4 percent of wages until the fund balance reached $10,500. In contrast, option four would change this

to the sum of $6,300 (30 percent of the specified earnings “ceiling”) plus $6,400 (twice the benefits

withdrawn in the past two years), a total of $12,700. The accumulation would still be at a rate of 4

percent of the first $20,000 of wages.

           Accumulating more in this way should not be seen as a penalty since individuals own the funds

in their UISAs and can eventually consume or bequeath them. The funds are there as a buffer to

reduce the government’s risk in guaranteeing that benefits will be paid even if the UISAs have

insufficient funds.

Option 5           An Experience Rating Component

           Although a system of UISAs can substantially reduce many individuals’ incentives for longer

or more frequent spells of unemployment, it does eliminate the effect of experience rating.9 While

experience rating is not needed to correct incentives when individuals have positive UISA balances,

it would improve incentives when individuals have negative balances and are therefore motivated to

act as if the government provides their unemployment benefits. Option 5 combines the basic

contribution requirement of Option 2 with a requirement that employers pay the first five weeks of

benefits in each spell.10 This has two potentially favorable effects on incentives. First, by reducing

maximum benefit of $200 per week.

     On the nature and limits of experience rating, see above, page 5.

         This idea was previously suggested in Feldstein (1975).

the amount that individuals withdraw from their accounts during any given spell, they are more likely

to have a positive balance and therefore to be sensitive to the cost of providing benefits. Second,

even for those individuals with negative accounts, the employer has an incentive not to create excess

unemployment, the traditional role of experience rating.11

3.          Analyzing the Options with the PSID Data

            The Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) provides longitudinal data on individuals that

are well-suited to analyzing the feasibility of substituting UISAs for the existing unemployment

insurance system.12 The PSID contains linked interview data on a national probability sample of

households and subsequent split-offs for the period from 1967 through 1991. The data for each year

and each head of household include the total UI benefits received as well as demographic and labor

market information.

            We focus our analysis on the individuals who were heads of households in 1967. The head

of household can be either a single individual or the individual in a household who is designated as

the head of the unit. We include only those individuals who were still in the sample and under age

65 in 1972, i.e., in the first year after the five-year period in which individuals make deposits to the

savings accounts but draw benefits only from the regular state UI program. We then follow these

2,773 individuals until the end of the data sample in 1991 or until the year in which they die, retire

or otherwise leave the sample. Separate tabulations are presented in the appendix for the subsample

     11
     The experience rating could be strengthened under any of the options by using employers’
experience with unemployment as the basis for the tax used to finance the cost of benefits paid to
individuals with negative UISA balances.
     12
          See Katz (1986) for an earlier use of the PSID data to study unemployment insurance.

                                                   13
of 1,990 individuals who by 1991 are no longer employed or in the PSID sample. We impute

retirements at age 65 for all workers.

         Our procedure is very straightforward. For each of the options, we accumulate funds

according to the rules of that option. The accounts earn the commercial paper rate in one simulation

and a 5.5 percent real return in the alternative simulation. Those are also the rates charged on

negative balances. In each year, starting with the sixth year of the simulation, we subtract from each

account the UI benefits that the individual received in that year.

         The key results for the full sample based on the commercial paper rate of return are shown

in Table 1 and for the 5.5 percent rate of return in Appendix Table A1. The corresponding results

for the subsample of individuals who had died, retired or otherwise left the sample are presented in

Appendix Tables A2 and A3.

         All of the results in these tables assume no behavioral response to the change in

unemployment incentives. We return to this issue in section 5 and present some results that suggest

the sensitivity of our calculations to possible behavioral responses.

         Consider first the results in Table 1 for Option 1. Row one shows that only 5.2 percent of

all the individuals in the PSID sample of household heads had negative balances at the end of their

time in the PSID. If employees correctly anticipated their final condition, almost 95 percent of

employees would be fully sensitive to the cost of unemployment benefits. The figure is essentially

the same (5.3 percent, from Table A1) if we look only at “finishers,” i.e., those who had died, retired

or left the sample by 1991.

         A stricter measure of sensitivity is the fraction of individuals whose accounts were ever

Uisa.120598



                                                  14
negative. Row 2 shows that only 6.8 percent of individuals ever had negative accounts. For the

remaining 93 percent, receiving unemployment benefits would mean drawing from their own funds.

Although many of these did not have any spells of unemployment, their positive UISA balance gave

them a stronger inventive to avoid unemployment than they had in the existing UI system.

         Most individuals who become unemployed have positive accounts at the beginning and at the

end of their spell. Row 3 shows that in only one-quarter of the unemployment spells in which

benefits are received is the account negative at the end of the spell. This reflects the fact that most

spells are short and come when the individuals have accumulated enough in their UISAs to finance

the spell.

         The result is similar when we look at the terminal UISA balances at the end of the PSID

experience, taking into account future deposits to the UISA and future spells of unemployment; 20

percent of accounts in which individuals receive UI benefits are negative at the end of the spell and

at the end of the PSID sample (shown in row 4 of the table).

         Even individuals whose accounts are negative at some point in time (those shown in row 2)

need not assume that they will remain negative. About one-quarter of those individuals (23.4 percent,

shown in row 5) have positive terminal balances when they retire or leave the sample, or in 1991

when the sample ends.

         When we turn from the numbers of individuals to the amount of UISA payments, we find that

only 31.1 percent of UISA benefits are paid in spells that end with negative balances for individuals

that also have negative terminal balances (row 6). This is the group most likely to assume that the

costs of the UISA benefits will be borne by the government. A somewhat higher percentage of UISA

payments go to individuals in spells that are not necessarily negative but that lead to a negative

terminal balance (44.1 percent, shown in row 7). Members of this group may be sensitive to the cost

of UISA payments during those spells (and years) when their balances are positive and they have not

yet concluded that the terminal balance will be negative.

         Row 8 shows the dollars paid by the government and not subsequently repaid by the

individuals as a percentage of the total UISA payments received by all individuals. Because the

Uisa.120598



                                                  17
benefits in the UISA system are the same as the UI benefits in the current UI system, this ratio is also

the ratio of the tax-financed UISA benefits to the total tax-financed benefits under the existing UI

system. The estimate of 27.4 percent shown in row 8 means that the cost of the UISA to taxpayers

with option 1 and no behavioral response would be only 27.4 percent of the cost to taxpayers of the

existing UI system.13 The distorting effects of the existing UI payroll tax are separate from the

distorting effects of the benefits conditioned on unemployment.

         In thinking about the incentive effects implied by these results it is important to consider the

effects on both the duration and the frequency of unemployment. Individuals who have positive

balances or who believe that they will end their careers with positive balances will not want to become

unemployed and, if they do became unemployed, will have no incentive to remain unemployed. The

evidence that most individuals have positive balance accounts and that they end their careers with

positive balance accounts shows that (assuming they understand this likelihood) they generally face

the cost of unemployment and, in contrast to the situation with the existing UI rules, would have little

incentive for behavior that would increase either the frequency or duration of unemployment.


    13
     This ratio is calculated as follows. The denominator is the total UISA payments to all
participants over the period from 1972 to 1991. To calculate the numerator, we focus on those
individuals who had negative terminal balances (at death, retirement, departure from the sample,
or upon reaching 1991). We then identify the last year in which the balance of each of these
“negative terminal balance” individuals was positive and ignore government payments in all prior
years. We then calculate the sum of (1) the negative balance in that year (the difference between
benefits in that year and the sum of the prior positive balance and the savings deposited that year
in the account) and (2) any UISA benefits taken in subsequent years by the individual. We
subtract from this cumulative total (3) the amounts that the individual paid to the account
(actually directly to the government as repayment for past credit) in all subsequent years. The
combination of these three terms is the net amount that the government pays to negative accounts
in excess of the amounts repaid.

                                                   18
         The percentage of funds withdrawn by individuals who end their working life (or are working

when the PSID ends) with accounts that have negative balances appears to suggest that in about 44

percent of the unemployed weeks the individuals that currently receive unemployment insurance

benefits would face the same adverse incentives under the UISA system as they do under the current

UI system. While eliminating the distortion for the other 56 percent of the weeks would be a

substantial achievement of the UISA approach, this 56 percent figure understates for several reasons

the extent of the improvement in incentives that would occur. First, some of the spells of

unemployment that now end with permanently negative balances would never occur if the individuals’

incentives were different. Second, since the duration of the spells would be shortened by the change

in incentives, fewer of the spells would actually lead to negative balance accounts. While we do not

have an estimate of the effect of these behavioral responses, we believe that the evidence here

indicates that the incentives would be improved for substantially more than half of the spells and

weeks of current insured unemployment. We return below (in section 5) to consider the implications

of a behavioral response to the improved incentives.

         The results with the other options are generally similar to the results with option 1,

although options 2, 3 and 4 involve a smaller saving base and therefore more frequent negative

balances. More specifically, shifting to a lower wage base for the saving requirement (option 2

requires a 4 percent saving rate on wage income up to about the median wage) raises the percentages

that become negative or end negative by about two percentage points. With the lower amount of

saving, the percentage of spells that end with negative account balances becomes 30.5 percent instead

of the 24.3 percent with option 1 (row 3). The number of spells that end with negative balances and

Uisa.120598



                                                  19
that also go on to negative terminal balances rises from 20 percent with option 1 to 25 percent (row

4). Capping the saving requirement for workers with above average incomes thus reduces the

sensitivity but still leaves most individuals who experience unemployment with a positive account

balance.

         Option 3 allows workers to stop contributing to their accounts when the balance reaches 50

percent of their savings wage base under option 2. This has essentially no effect on any of the

performance measures. For those who experience no unemployment, it reduces substantially the

amount of lifetime saving that is required in the UISAs without changing the likely sensitivity of this

group or others.

         Option 4 makes the target level of accumulation for the UISA depend on the recent

unemployment experience, lowering the basic target to only 30 percent of the savings wage base

under option 2 but then adding the benefits drawn in the past two years to this amount. The positive

and negative effects are reasonably balanced, causing little affect on the various performance

measures shown in Table 1. For those with little or no unemployment, this option permits a

substantially lower rate of saving.

         Option 5 requires the employer to pay the first five weeks of unemployment benefits in every

spell and is otherwise similar to option 2. Only after the five weeks does the individual draw benefits

from the UISA. This makes the employer directly sensitive to the cost of unemployment for all

employees, including those with negative balances. It also reduces substantially the probability that

employees who experience unemployment will develop a negative balance or end their career with

a negative balance. Thus row 4 shows that among unemployment spells resulting in negative

Uisa.120598



                                                  20
balances, the percentage of spells from individuals who end their careers (or the time in the PSID

sample) with a negative balance falls from 25 percent with option 2 to 22 percent with option 5.

4.       Distributional Effects of Switching to UISA System

         The effect on each individual’s disposable income of shifting from the current UI rules to a

UISA system depends on the individual’s unemployment experience and the level of the individual’s

income. There are three components of the effect: (1) the required saving contribution to the

individual’s UISA account; (2) the net balance in the UISA account at retirement age; and (3) the

change in the payroll tax payment. The benefits paid during unemployment can be ignored because

they are always the same in the two systems.

         Any analysis of the distributional effect of shifting from one system to another involves the

usual incidence issues about the effect of induced behavioral changes on wages and other pretax

factor incomes. These incidence issues are particularly difficult in the current case because the

program change involves not only taxes but also transfers conditioned on unemployment experience.

We limit our analysis therefore to the nominal analysis, i.e., to the estimated distribution of individual

payments with no changes in gross wages or other factor incomes. We assume moreover that all

payments are born by the individuals, regardless of whether they are made by the individual or the

firm.

         A second caveat is necessary about interpreting the distributional effects by income class

tabulated in this section. This analysis refers only to heads of households and makes no attempt to

incorporate the distributional effects of a shift to a UISA system on others in the same household. The

sample is further restricted to those individuals who were less than 45 years old in 1967 in order to

Uisa.120598



                                                   21
study a relatively long working period.

         Before looking at the calculations, it is useful to note the way that the shift from the existing

UI rules to a UISA system affects individuals at two extremes: those with no unemployment during

their working life and those whose unemployment is so substantial that they end their working life

with a negative UISA balance. For individuals who experience no unemployment, the net present

value of UISA saving deposits and the balances withdrawn at retirement is zero (discounting at

whatever rate is used to accumulate those balances). Such individuals are net gainers from the switch

to the UISA system since the taxes required to fund the benefits of those who have negative final

balances are less than the taxes required by the current system to fund all UI benefits. Because the

tax is levied on earnings up to a relatively low level ($7,000 in many states in 1997), the favorable

tax reduction effect is the same for all individuals above that low level and declines with income

below that level.

         For individuals who experience substantial unemployment and retire with negative accounts,

the net discounted present value of the required UISA savings represents a net tax. Against this must

be balanced the reduction in the regular UI payroll tax (which is the same reduction as that enjoyed

by those with no unemployment). Since the current payroll tax is less than the UISA saving

requirement, the reduction in the payroll tax is clearly less than the UISA saving requirement,

implying that individuals who have negative balances incur a net reduction in the present value of their

disposable income.

         These are of course the two extreme cases. To assess the overall distributional effect of the

switch, we divide our sample into lifetime income quintiles based on real mean annual income during

Uisa.120598



                                                    22
the individual’s working years between 1967 and 1991. For each quintile, we calculate the discounted

present values as of 1967 of (1) the required savings deposited to UI saving accounts; (2) the funds

available at retirement age; and (3) the reduced payroll tax in each year. We estimate the payroll tax

reduction of individual I in year t as TAXCUTI t = ( 1 - reltax) θ t TI I t where: reltax is the ratio

of the payroll tax with the UISA system to the payroll tax with the existing UI system, as shown in

row 8 of Table 1 for each UISA option; TI I t is the taxable wage income for individual I in year t (up

to the payroll tax ceiling in that year); and θ t is the national average UI payroll tax rate in year t

under the current UI rules.

          To estimate these values, we assume that the maximum taxable earnings for the UI payroll

tax (Tmax t ) is $7,000 in 1997 and scale it down in earlier years in proportion to the average weekly

earnings in the total private U.S. economy. For each individual, the value of TI I t is the lesser of

(Tmax t ) and that individual’s wage in year t. The national average UI payroll tax rate in year t is

estimated as θ t = BENt / [ 0.9 Tmax t N t ] where BENt is the aggregate national UI benefits paid in

year t, 0.9 Tmax t is the estimated average taxable earnings for the UI tax (we scale by 0.9 since not

all workers will earn $7,000 in 1997 dollars), and N t is the number of individuals in covered

employment.14

         The present values, calculated using the six-month commercial paper interest rate, are shown

in Table 2; a separate calculation based on the 5.5 percent real rate of return is presented in Appendix

Table A4. We present estimates for options 1, 2, and 3.

         The lowest quintile of households corresponds to those in which the head earned an average

lifetime income of only $12,293 a year in 1991 dollars during the years that the individual worked

between 1967 and 1991. The second and third quintiles had average lifetime earnings in 1991 dollars

of $23,976 and $31,948 while the top group had average earnings of $71,561.

         The first three rows of Table 2 show the present discounted value in 1967 of the positive

terminal UISA balances (the refunded amounts) minus the UISA saving deposits, discounting at the

commercial paper discount rate in each year. Thus individuals in the lowest lifetime income quintile

paid on average $591 more in UISA saving deposits (discounted to 1967) than the amount that they

had in their UISA accounts (treating negative accounts as zero, since such debts are forgiven) at the

time of retirement or death (also discounted to 1967). The $591 amount excludes the value of the

benefits received since that does not change as we go from current UI rules to the UISA system. In

the aggregate, this bottom quintile receives a disproportionately large share of the benefits relative

to the amount that it provides in UISA deposits, causing it to receive a substantial transfer from the

UISA system just as it does from the current UI system.         But because we are interested in the

distributional effects of shifting from the current UI rules to a UISA system, rather than the

distributional effects of the UISA system itself, and since the benefits are exactly the same in the two

systems, we ignore the benefits and focus on the difference between the amount that the individuals

get in refunds at the time of retirement or death (i.e., the positive UISA balances at those times) and

the amounts contributed as saving deposits, all discounted to the beginning of the sample.

         This negative effect is balanced by the positive effect of lower payroll taxes. With option 1,

the tax saving associated with replacing the current UI system with a UISA system (as noted in row

Uisa.120598



                                                  25
8 of Table 1) is 73 percent of the UI payroll taxes that would otherwise be paid under the current

rules. For individuals in quintile 1, the present value of these payroll tax reductions (shown in the first

row of the second part of Table 2) is $496. These tax savings offset most of the PDV excess of UISA

savings over balance refunds for this group, leaving a net negative present value cost of $95 for the

shift from current UI rules to UISA rules.

         Since this is the present value of the net effects over the 25 year period, it is essentially too

small to be of significant concern. This “loss” is of course before considering any of the potential

gains – both financially and in terms of economic efficiency – that would result from the behavioral

effects of the shift to the UISA system.

         The second quintile has a net positive gain of $22, again essentially close to zero when

compared to the 25 year present value of the earnings of individuals with average annual earnings of

nearly $24,000. The largest effect is the positive gain of the top quintile, a lifetime present value gain

of $468, which is also quite small relative to the average annual earnings of more than $70,000 in this

group.

         The results for the other two options are similar, with relatively small lifetime present value

losses in the bottom half of the distribution of lifetime income and relatively small lifetime gains in the

top half of the distribution.

5.       Effects of Unemployment Responses to the Unemployment Compensation System

         Section 1 of this paper discussed the various ways in which the existing unemployment

insurance system increases the frequency and duration of unemployment. We have also considered

how shifting to the UISA system would change these incentives in ways that reduce unemployment.

An explicit model of the effect of shifting to a UISA system on the frequency and duration of

unemployment would have to deal with individuals’ expectations about the probability that they will

shift from an existing positive account balance to a negative account balance at the time of retirement

(and therefore should not currently be sensitive to the effect of unemployment on their UI account)

or from an exiting negative UISA account balance to a positive terminal balance (implying that they

should be concerned about the cost of their current unemployment benefits.)

         Although such an analysis lies beyond the scope of this paper, it is clear that the shift to the

UISA system would initiate a mutually reinforcing process in which reduced subsidies to

unemployment would reduce the frequency and duration of unemployment which would in turn imply

that the a larger fraction of UISA payments were from individual account balances rather than from

the government. This virtuous spiral would converge to lower probabilities of unemployment and

lower durations of unemployment spells than are observed in the historic data.

         To indicate how such a virtuous spiral might improve the performance and reduce the

taxpayer cost of the UISA system, we present simulations of the UISA option 1 on the assumption

that all UI spells are reduced by either 10 percent or 30 percent in duration. These simulations are

shown in Table 3. Although a reduction in the frequency of unemployment is not specifically

included, the analysis can be regarded as a way of observing the effect of 10 percent or 30 percent

fewer unemployed days, regardless of whether this is from changes in frequency or duration. As a

rough generalization, the results show that a 30 percent reduction in the amount of eligible

unemployment reduces the proportion of individuals who have negative balances or who end with

a negative account balance by at least one-quarter. The percentage of spells that end with negative

Uisa.120598



                                                   28
balances and the percentage of spells by individuals who eventually have negative balances at the end

of their careers also fall, this time by about one-third. The same is also true of the aggregate dollar

value of benefits. This does not show that a 30 percent reduction in aggregate unemployment days

is likely but only that, if does occur, it will cause a large reinforcing decline in the number who face

or can expect to face negative balances.

         The 30 percent reduction in the amount of insured unemployment also has the effect of cutting

the tax-financed benefits in half, from 27.5 percent of the current UI benefits with no behavioral

response to 13.7 percent with a 30 percent reduction in days with compensated unemployment.

6.       Summary and Conclusion

         In this paper we have examined a system of Unemployment Insurance Saving Accounts as an

alternative to the traditional unemployment insurance system. The system requires individuals to save

a modest share of wages in special accounts and to draw unemployment compensation from these

accounts instead of taking state unemployment insurance benefits. If the accounts are exhausted, the

government lends money to the account. Negative account balances are forgiven at retirement age.

         Positive UISA balances are converted into retirement income or bequeathed if the individual

dies before retirement age. Any dollar taken from a UISA with a positive balance reduces the

individual’s personal wealth by a dollar. As such, the UISAs cause individuals to internalize the cost

of unemployment compensation. The UISAs can therefore in principle provide the same level of

protection to the unemployed with less of the adverse incentives that now increase the frequency and

duration of unemployment.

         The key operational question about the feasibility of UISAs is whether accounts based on a

Uisa.120598



                                                  29
moderate saving rate can finance a significant share of unemployment payments or whether the

concentration of unemployment among a relatively small number of individuals implies that the UISA

balances would typically be exhausted, forcing individuals to rely on government benefits with the

same adverse effects that characterize the current UI system..

         To resolve this issue we use the Panel Study on Income Dynamics to simulate the UISA

system over a 25-year historic period. Our analysis indicates that almost all individuals have positive

UISA balances and therefore remain sensitive to the cost of unemployment compensation. Even

among individuals who experience unemployment, most would still have positive account balances

at the end of their unemployment spell. Although about half of the benefit dollars would go to

individuals whose accounts are negative at the end of their working life, less than one-third of the

benefits go to individuals who currently have negative account balances or who will have negative

account balances at the end of their current unemployment spell. All of this suggests a substantial

improvement in the incentives of the unemployed.

         The reduction in the cost to taxpayers of more than 60 percent of the current taxpayer burden

represents a substantial further potential improvement in the efficiency of the labor market. Our

analysis of the distribution of lifetime UISA payments and taxes shows that the household heads in

the top quintile gain a small cumulative amount while those in the bottom quintile lose a very small

amount. Other quintiles are small net gainers.
