                                         ABSTRACT

International currencies fulfill different roles in the world economy with important synergies
across those roles. We explore the implications of currency hegemony for the external balance
sheet of the United States, the process of international adjustment, and the predictability of the
US dollar exchange rate. We emphasize the importance of international monetary spillovers, of
the exorbitant privilege, and analyze the emergence of a new ‘Triffin dilemma’.

1       Introduction
The intimate links between the rise and fall of great powers and the international monetary
and financial system is what makes studying the latter so fascinating. As analyzed by
Kindleberger (1976):

        In the 19th century, Britain was the leader of the world economic system. Sterling
        was international money. The public goods consisted of a market for distress
        goods, provided by British free trade; a countercyclical flow of capital, produced
        by the City of London; coordination of macro-economic policies and exchange
        rates provided by the rules of the gold standard, legitimized and institutionalized
        by usage; a lender of last resort in the Bank of England, after the Bank Act of
        1844 was suspended in the crisis. The United States took over leadership after
        World War II.

    For Kindleberger, it was essential that the country at the center of the system, the
hegemon, stabilize the workings of the international monetary system. In this view, periods
of transitions between great powers such as the 1930s, when the economic influence of the
UK diminished while that of the US was still not fully established, are considered to be
especially dangerous for economic stability. Furthermore, the economic leadership of the
hegemon rarely goes uncontested. As the US became the center country of the international
order in the post world war II Bretton Woods system, France became increasingly aware of,
and frustrated by, the asymmetries inherent in that new international monetary arrangement.
In a press conference on February 4th, 1965, General De Gaulle stated1 :

        The fact that many states accept, on principle, dollars just as much as gold to
        compensate if need be the deficits of the US balance of payments, means that the
        United States can issue external debt freely. Indeed, when the US owe something,
        they can pay for it, at least in part, with dollars which they can issue, instead of
        using gold, whose value is real, has to be earned and that one cannot transfer to
        others without risk and sacrifice. This unilateral facility that the United States
        has means that the dollar is not an impartial means of international exchange,
        since it is a means of issuing credit for one state.

    On February 16th, 1965, Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, De Gaulle’s finance minister, echoed
the words of the General and famously summarized them by saying that the country issuing
the reserve currency enjoyed an “exorbitant privilege”: in case of a deficit, the United
States do not have to take restrictive measures.2 De Gaulle and Giscard d’Estaing seized
on what may be one of the most consequential implications of being the hegemon of the
international monetary and financial system: the ability to issue securities that are always

     As pointed out in Gourinchas & Rey (2007b), the expression “exorbitant privilege” has been traditionally
attributed to De Gaulle but is nowhere to be found in de Gaulle’s speeches. It appears however in a press
conference of Giscard d’Estaing as reported by Raymond Aron for Le Figaro, February 16, 1965 p.1475 of
Les articles du Figaro, vol. II (Editions de Fallois). We also thank Georges-Henri Soutou for showing us this

in high demand by the rest of the world. This has profound implications for the process of
external adjustment, for international monetary spillovers and, ultimately, for the stability
of the international monetary and financial system. This paper explores these questions.
    The roles of a dominant international currency, i.e. a currency used outside the borders of
its country of issuance, are multifaceted and involve the three classical functions of money:
medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account. As Krugman (1984) clearly
described, there are many interactions and synergies between the international use of a
currency in its different roles.3 These complementarities reinforce the dominance of the
hegemon’s currency and make it long lasting. Incumbent international currencies are hard
to displace.4
    One of the key fact underpinning the architecture of the international monetary and
financial system is that the hegemon provides safe assets to the rest of the world. As shown
in Gourinchas & Rey (2007b), the US is a world banker, long in risky foreign assets and
short in risk-free liquid dollar liabilities, which are in high demand by foreign official and
private sectors.5 This advantage of issuing the reserve currency spills over into other realms,
such as the large amounts of private debt issued in US dollars in international markets
(Maggiori, Neiman & Schreger (2018)) and the large share of trade invoiced in US dollar,
which stabilizes the terms of trade of the hegemon (Gopinath et al. (2018)). It also goes
hand in hand with the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve having an important effect
on the global financial cycle, in particular by affecting the balance sheet of large global
financial institution and their risk appetite (Miranda-Agrippino & Rey (2018)). The dollar
exchange rate is a key relative price in the world economy whether on goods markets or
in international financial markets. Furthermore, issuing the international currency confers
to the hegemon excess returns on its net foreign asset position, thus easing the process of
international adjustment (Gourinchas & Rey (2007a)). These excess returns in normal times
are however associated with net wealth transfers to the rest of world in global crisis times
when the value of US safe assets appreciate while risky asset prices plummet. These wealth
transfers reflect the provision of insurance by the hegemon to the rest of the world in times of
global turmoil, a process we called “exorbitant duty” in Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017).
    Finally, the asymmetry inherent in a hegemonic system may also create financial fragili-
ties that can ultimately lead to its demise. In the early 1960s, Yale economist Robert Triffin
(1961) noted that the United States would not be able to simultaneously provide the interna-
tional liquidity needed by the global economy, and maintain the value of the dollar in terms
of a fixed supply of gold –as required under the Bretton Woods system. Ultimately, either
the world would face a growing shortage of international liquidity, or confidence in the value
of the dollar would plummet with an unavoidable run on the currency. This is Triffin’s well-
known dilemma. His analysis proved prescient. US policymakers, confronted with growing
dollar liabilities in excess of their gold backing, experienced a run on the dollar and were
eventually forced to abandon the link between dollar and gold. Triffin’s analysis, however,
was incomplete for, despite the abandonment of the dollar-gold parity, the dominance of the
dollar has increased since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system. Paradoxically, once free

     In this article we use the name “international currency” or “dominant currency” to characterize the
currency of the main economic power (the hegemon), bearing in mind that some other regional currencies
may also circulate internationally at the same time.

from the shackle of a fixed gold parity, the use of the US dollar as an international currency
soared to unprecedented levels. Yet, as we will argue, the financial fragilities inherent in
a hegemonic system have not disappeared: the Triffin dilemma is still with us, albeit in a
subtly different form (Gourinchas & Rey (2007b), Obstfeld (2011), Gourinchas, Rey &
Govillot (2017), and Farhi & Maggiori (2018)).

    This paper begins with a brief description of the International Monetary System, em-
phasizing the characteristics and functions of international currencies and their synergies. It
discusses the interactions between the monetary policy of the hegemon, international trade
and the global financial cycle. Section 3 zooms in on the current hegemon, the United States.
It analyzes closely the properties of its external balance sheet, and how its characteristics
influence the process of external adjustment. Section 4 focuses on the implications for the
US dollar, a key relative price in the world economy. Section 5 explores several possible
interpretations of the “exorbitant privilege”. Section 6 discusses the possible risks for finan-
cial stability of the organization of the international economic and financial system around
a hegemon. Section 7 concludes.


2       The different roles of international currencies
It has long been recognized that the more people use a certain medium of exchange, the
more useful is that medium of exchange. In that sense, money and languages have similar
characteristics, and the US dollar is the lingua franca for today’s international monetary
system. Barter economies face the well-known problem of the “double coincidence of wants”
(Jevons , 1875), a problem that money solves naturally. Monetary theorists have used random
matching models to analyze the emergence of money as a way to overcome the trading
frictions inherent to barter economies (Kiyotaki & Wright , 1989; Matsuyama, Kiyotaki &
Matsui , 1993; Zhou , 1997; Lagos & Wright , 2005). In these models, the belief that many
people will accept a certain currency unit sustains equilibria in which those monetary units
circulate. As a result, welfare is improved: money puts oil in the mechanism of exchange
and decreases bilateral trading frictions.
    The history of money shows that over time and space, very special objects, in particular
those difficult to counterfeit, have played the role of money: shells, rare stones, precious
metals, are but a few examples. Trust in the medium of exchange is paramount, so it has to
be recognizable and stable in value. In modern days, this implies that it has to be backed by
a credible fiscal authority. In turn, stability also makes it a good unit of account.6 Hence,
there are clear strategic complementarities across the different functions of money. The logic
extends to the various roles of an international currency with similar force. Figure 1, taken
from ECB (2018), shows the strength of these complementarities. It exemplifies the current
dominance of the US dollar in all domains: international debt issuance, international loans,
foreign exchange turnover, global payment, and foreign exchange reserves. The euro, a more
regional dominant currency, comes a distant second.7
    6
    As an aside, note that so far, cryptocurrencies are clearly not meeting these standards.

roles of an international currency in the private and official sectors.8 The next subsections

2.1      Vehicle currencies, currency of issuance, intervention, and peg
Let us first consider the role of an international currency as a medium of exchange. As a con-
sequence of strong network externalities, market forces endogenously select a small number
of currencies to become vehicle currencies, i.e. favored means of exchange, through which
most of the bilateral exchanges in international markets with many different countries take
  8
      See also Cohen (1971), Kindleberger (1981) and Krugman (1984).

place. For example, on foreign exchange markets, the Malaysian ringgit is rarely exchanged
directly against the Mexican peso. Instead, two transactions take place with the dollar in the
middle: ringgit are exchanged into dollar, and dollar are exchanged into peso. The bilateral
exchange rates verify triangular arbitrage, yet only the more liquid bilateral markets involv-
ing the dollar are used to perform transactions. The dollar is the dominant vehicle currency.
According to the last triennal survey of the Bank for international Settlement (BIS , 2016),
the US dollar was on 87.6% of all transactions in the foreign exchange market in 2016 (out
of a total of 200% due to a currency being on both side of a trade). The second most used
currency was the euro at 31.3%.
    This vehicle currency role, closely linked to the liquidity and safety properties of markets
in different currencies, has been studied in Krugman (1980), Hartmann (1998), and Rey
(2001). Private actors around the globe use dollars to transact and invest their short term
funds as they are viewed as the safest and most liquid instrument. Liquidity, i.e. the ability
to transact large quantities without an adverse price movement, is central to the quality of a
medium of exchange. Safety is essential as well, as it preserves the purchasing power of the
currency. It is associated with trust in the issuer, difficulty to cheat or counterfeit currencies,
and overall macroeconomic stability in the value of the currency. It is no mystery that in
countries lacking basic macroeconomic stability, the national legal tender often gives way to
an international currency –usually the dollar. Dollarization followed many episodes of severe
domestic monetary instability in Latin America in the 1970s and 1980s, or more recently in
Zimbabwe or Venezuela.9

    The currency of issuance of internationally traded assets is therefore a key determinant
of the private sector’s demand for stores of value. Using a finely disaggregated dataset of
$27 trillion in security-level investment positions, Maggiori, Neiman & Schreger (2018) show
that investor holdings are biased toward securities denominated in their own currencies, even
when issued by foreign borrowers. This currency bias is very strong. Canadian investors, for
instance, mostly hold securities issued in Canadian dollars. Conversely, most Canadian firms
issue only in Canadian dollars and their liabilities are held locally. The pattern is different,
however, for international currencies like the dollar. Since most investors are willing to hold
dollars, this means that even relatively small US firms have little difficulty borrowing from
abroad. This reflects the liquidity and depth of US dollar asset markets, amplified by the
vehicle currency role described above. It also reflects one aspect of the exorbitant privilege
described by Giscard d’Estaing, an aspect to which we come back in Section 5.

    Moving to the official sector, Central Bank intervention in foreign exchange markets will
use the dominant currency, i.e. the currency in which most market players transact and
may need to obtain emergency financing. Therefore, the vehicle currency will also be the
intervention currency. Naturally, this intervention currency is also the currency in which
most reserves, i.e. the stores of value for the official sector, are held. Figure 2 illustrates
this point by showing how the distribution of Central Bank reserves by currency evolved
over time: the US dollar constitutes the lion’s share of Central Bank reserves, with the euro
   9
    Rogoff (1998) documents the important use of dollar notes outside US borders, whether for tax evasion
or currency substitution purposes. Rogoff (2017) makes a strong case for the elimination of cash to help
eradicate corruption, terrorism, the drug trade, human trafficking, and the rest of a large global underground
economy.

a distant second. These strategic complementarities are further amplified in cases where a
country is pegging, de jure or de facto, its own currency to a dominant currency. In order
to stabilize its own currency, a Central Bank will need to actively buy and sell the dominant
currency. Ilzetzki, Reinhart & Rogoff (2017) show that the US dollar is by far the world’s
dominant anchor currency. Surprisingly, its use is even wider nowadays than it was during
the Bretton Woods system where most countries formally pegged their currency to the US
dollar.
    Starting with the importance of liquidity and safety for international currencies, we have
discussed important synergies between the roles of money as medium of exchange and store
of value in the private sphere (vehicle currency role and nominal securities issuance), its role
as intervention currency and exchange rate anchor in the official sector. We now turn to
another set of powerful interactions linking trade and securities invoicing (unit of account
role) with banking and the lender of last resort role of Central Banks.

2.2     Trade invoicing, banking, reserves, and lender of last resort
An important facet of an international currency is its extensive use for trade invoicing.10
As Goldberg & Tille (2009) and Gopinath (2016) discuss, a disproportionate amount of
international trade transactions are invoiced in US dollars. To emphasize this point, we use
the data from Gopinath (2016) for all available countries, and show in Figure 3 the sum of
the share of imports and exports invoiced in dollars, and in euros, respectively. A sum equal
to 2 means that 100% of imports and exports are invoiced in dollars (euros). We observe
  10
     Trade invoicing is linked to the unit of account role of money. Most of the time, the currency of invoicing
is also the currency of transaction, though there are some historical episodes in which they differed. Note
that conceptually, they are distinct.

the countries for which data on exports and imports are both available. The only exception

    A number of countries (besides the US) have a large share of their trade invoiced in
dollars. They tend to be emerging markets in Latin America and Asia, but also neighboring
countries such as Canada. India has a combined share of about 1.75 in dollar exports and


                                                      8
imports. On the other hand, European countries invoice largely in euros, which for a number
of them is the domestic currency. Overall, there is a clear pattern of dominance of the dollar
in the global economy, while the euro is an important regional invoicing currency around
Europe. Invoicing currencies would be largely irrelevant if prices were flexible. It is, however,
well documented that prices are nominally rigid in the currency in which they are invoiced.
As a result, the choice of invoicing currency also affects the pass-through of exchange rate
movements into exports and import prices, as analyzed in Gopinath et al. (2018).

    There are important complementarities between the use of a currency as a unit of ac-
count and as a store of value. For instance, the more trade invoicing is done in a dominant
currency, the more likely it is that firms will prefer to hold liquid funds and issue liabilities
in that currency. Gopinath & Stein (2018a) explore the complementarities between trade
invoicing and the currency denomination of liabilities in a model where banks are the issuers
of safe deposits. A financial claim is only meaningfully safe if it can be used to buy a certain
consumption basket at a future date, which depends on the currency in which goods are
priced. If imports are invoiced in dollars and these dollar prices are nominally rigid, firms
and households will tend to prefer to hold liquid funds (deposits, cash, liquid securities)
denominated in dollars to finance future consumption or purchases of intermediate goods.
This demand for dollars deposits depresses the dollar interest rate, which in turn induces
local financial institutions to intermediate dollar liabilities. As a result, the expected return
on dollar deposits is on average lower, in violation of uncovered interest parity. This is one
interpretation of the exorbitant privilege associated with the dollar.11 Gopinath & Stein
(2018b) also note there are some natural synergies between the dollarization of intermedi-
aries, as described above, and Central Banks’ holdings of dollar reserves to perform their
lender of last resort function. For many emerging markets, maintaining financial stability
requires owning enough reserves in dollars to cover the liquid dollar liabilities of the domestic
financial system (Obstfeld, Shambaugh & Taylor , 2010; Gourinchas , 2012).

    Overall, this suggests that the role of the dollar in invoicing (unit of account) associated
with price stickiness may lead to the dollarization of bank deposits, and steer the Central
Bank to hold dollar reserves to backstop the financial system. These interactions, just as the
ones described previously between the vehicle currency role (medium of exchange), issuance,
and exchange rate pegs, illustrate some of the possible synergies between the various roles
of an international currency. Recent research has only started to explore these interrelated
dimensions and the complementarities that sustain the dollar as a dominant currency, even
in a world without formal nominal anchors, and there is no doubt that there are more
complementarities between the roles illustrated in Table 1. We now however turn to another
aspect and examine how the existence of a hegemonic currency affect the functioning of
international goods markets, and of international financial markets, through the monetary
policy of the hegemon.

    Chahrour & Valchev (2018) build a model of international trade as a search process, and show the
existence of a similar price effect for the currency emerging as the international medium of exchange.

2.3    Hegemon monetary policy, global trade, and global financial
       cycle
We conclude this section with a discussion of the interactions between the monetary policy
of the hegemon, global trade, and the global financial cycle. There are many reasons why
currency dominance matters beyond those described above. Some are geopolitical –and we
do not discuss them here– others are economic. Our focus in the remainder of this part will
be on the potential spillovers associated with the macroeconomic policies of the hegemon.
    To begin with, a large literature has shown the importance of different trade invoicing
practices for the transmission of monetary policy and more generally of relative prices move-
ments across borders. The first generation of New Keynesian (NK) models assumed that
prices were sticky in the currency of the producing country (Producer Currency Pricing,
PCP) as in Obstfeld & Rogoff (1995). A second generation assumed instead that prices
were sticky in the currency of the destination market (local currency pricing, LCP) as in e.g.
Betts & Devereux (2000) (see Corsetti, Dedola & Leduc (2010) for a survey). However, a
third pricing assumption seems more realistic: Dominant Currency Pricing (DCP), in which
countries price their products in the dominant currency in the international system. The im-
plications of DCP have been explored recently in Gopinath et al. (2018) in a small economy
set-up with strategic complementarities in pricing and imported intermediate inputs. The
authors show how the dollar (dominant) exchange rate pass-through into export and import
prices is high, regardless of the destination or origin of the goods. It follows that movements
in the dollar exchange rate transmit into local consumer prices (via imported prices) and im-
ported quantities, while leaving the US largely insulated. Another interesting implication of
DCP is that a strengthening of the value of the dominant currency relative to non-dominant
ones can negatively impact global trade. In support of this prediction, Gopinath et al.
(2018) document that a 1% U.S. dollar appreciation against all other currencies in the world
predicts a 0.6 to 0.8% decline within a year in the volume of total trade between countries
in the rest of the world, controlling for the global business cycle.
    Relatedly, Bruno, Kim & Shin (2018) underline the importance of the US dollar in
Global Value Chains (GVC). Because on the balance sheet of firms, inventories enter as
assets that must be financed, the authors show that supply chains entail financing needs,
mostly provided in dollars, the latter increasing in a non-linear way with the length of the
supply chain. The interaction of the prevalence of dollar invoicing and of the extensive
use of the dollar as a financing currency for working capital in GVC therefore also tightly
links dollar movements with fluctuations in international trade. This latter channel works
through a tightening of the financing constraints as opposed to an aggregate demand channel.

    Another strand of the literature emphasizes the spillovers of the hegemon’s monetary
policy via asset markets. The importance of international monetary spillovers and of factors
such as the world interest rate in driving capital flows has been pointed out in the classic
work of Calvo et al. (1996). Dollar dominance in banking and the dollarisation of cross
border claims (see for example Avdjiev et al. (2015, 2016)) imply that US monetary policy
impulses get transmitted beyond US borders in international financial markets. Rey (2013)
documents the existence of a global financial cycle and that US monetary policy is one of its
drivers. Miranda-Agrippino & Rey (2018) present evidence that US monetary policy gets
transmitted across borders via its effect on asset prices, risk premia, credit creation, credit


                                              10
flows, and leverage. They find that one global factor, influenced by the Federal Reserve
monetary policy, explains about a quarter of the variance of risky asset prices around the
world. Jorda et al. (2018) study the synchronization of financial cycles across 17 advanced
economies over the past 150 years. They find that the comovement in credit, house prices,
and equity prices has reached historical highs in the past three decades, and again estimate
an important role of US monetary policy in driving risk premia. Cecchetti et al. (2017)
find that a US monetary policy easing has effects of roughly similar magnitude on the risk-
taking behavior of foreign financial firms than on US firms. Rey (2016) and Gerko & Rey
 (2017) show that US monetary policy affects financing conditions even in countries with
flexible exchange rate regimes such as Canada or the United Kingdom. This accumulation
of evidence puts into question the well-known monetary policy trilemma, according to which
a flexible exchange rate regime should enable monetary policy independence. In addition,
Bruno & Shin (2015) show that a strong dollar is associated with tighter credit conditions
worldwide. This link between currency appreciation and leverage implies that global liquidity
conditions are sensitive to the dollar exchange rate (see also Borio & Zhu (2008), and Cohen
et al. (2017)). Verdelhan (2018) also emphasizes the importance of a dollar factor in pricing
bilateral exchange rates. Finally, Bernanke (2017) provides a thorough discussion of the
international spillovers of the policy of the US Federal Reserve.
    An interesting recent empirical literature uses detailed bank-level data to further inves-
tigate the international transmission of monetary policy. A few important examples include
Cetorelli & Goldberg (2012), who use balance-sheet data to study the role of global banks
in transmitting liquidity conditions across borders; Morais, Peydró & Roldán-Peña (2018),
who exploit credit registry data of the Mexican Central Bank and study the effect of foreign
monetary policy on loan outcomes in Mexico; and Baskaya et al. (2017), who use finely dis-
aggregated Turkish data on bank loans and highlight the importance of bank heterogeneity
in the transmission of capital flow shocks to Turkish credit.
    On the theoretical front, work on international monetary transmission and the global
financial cycle has built on Neo-Keynesian models (see e.g. Mukhin (2017) for a model
with endogenous currency choice and an analysis of monetary policy spillovers, Gourinchas
 (2018) for an analysis of monetary policy spillovers from the U.S. to Chile, and Gertler et
al. (2007) for a small open economy model with a financial accelerator). A fruitful research
agenda could be to take into account the risk-taking channel of monetary policy. This could
in turn provide a theoretical basis for the analysis of macroprudential policy for countries
faced with large capital flows.

    In summary, a growing body of evidence documents the dominance of the dollar in all
the classical functions of an international currency. Surprisingly, the dominance of the dollar
has increased, not decreased over time. This dollar dominance has critical implications for
the transmission of monetary policy from the center to the periphery, whether by shaping
export and import price and quantity responses, or by affecting the balance sheet of large
global financial institution, their risk appetite, and the global synchronization of credit and
financial cycles.

3      External balance sheets and external adjustment
The previous section described the importance of the US dollar in the international monetary
and price system and how it shapes the spillovers from monetary policy at the center. This
section zooms in on the United States and analyzes how dollar dominance affects the external
adjustment process of the hegemon itself.
    The process of external adjustment, i.e. the economic mechanisms through which deficit
or surplus countries satisfy their intertemporal budget constraints, has always been deeply
intertwined with the organization and workings of the international monetary and financial
system. By studying the empirical properties of the former, we can hope to learn about the
latter.
    According to Hume’s classical price-specie flow theory, the settlement of trade imbalances
under a gold standard proceeds more or less automatically via shipments of gold reserves. In
the postwar era, the International Monetary Fund, created in 1944 as one of Bretton Woods
multilateral organizations, was designed specifically to facilitate the external adjustment
process of deficit countries, in a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates. It provided
member countries with medium-term borrowing facilities, assorted with various forms of
macroeconomic conditionality. That system suffered from two important asymmetries. First,
as Keynes noted with some concern at the time of the Bretton Woods negotiations, surplus
countries faced little or no pressure to reduce their external balances: countries could choose
to transform their trade surpluses into persistent reserve accumulation. Second, the U.S.,
as the country at the center of the international monetary system, faced little external
constraint given its ability to issue the world’s reserve currency.
    From this perspective, the external accounts and adjustment process of the U.S. are of
particularly interest. While the Bretton Woods system crashed de facto in 1971 when the
link between the US dollar and gold was severed, the dollar has remained the undisputed
world’s anchor and reserve currency since then, as discussed previously.12 A critical question
is whether and how the U.S. external adjustment process has changed over time.
    As issuer of the main reserve currency and global provider of liquidity, the United States’
external balance sheet exhibits very specific characteristics, described in detail in Gourinchas
& Rey (2007b) and Gourinchas & Rey (2014). First, gross cross-border positions are large,
reflecting the important role of the US dollar in international portfolios and in underpinning
international transactions.13 Second, the United States has a long position in risky securities,
investing abroad in the form of foreign direct investment and equity.14 It has a short position
in ‘safe’ securities, issuing a large quantity of bonds, in particular US Treasuries, which are
held by the rest of the world as ‘safe assets’15 . Hence, being ‘long risky and short safe’, the
United States has historically played the role of a world banker. Furthermore, almost all
of its external liabilities are denominated in dollars, whereas a sizable portion (about two
thirds) of its external assets are in foreign currencies.
    To illustrate these balance sheet asymmetries, Figure 4 shows the net positions in risky

Figure 4: Data are from Lane & Milesi-Ferretti (2018) and cover 1970-2015 at an annual

bilities + FDI liabilities). Net safe position = reserve assets + debt assets - debt liabilities.

assets and safe liabilities for the U.S. and the rest of the world. Data are from Lane & Milesi-
Ferretti (2018) and cover 1970 to 2015 at the annual frequency. We obtain the net risky
position by adding portfolio equity and direct investment assets, and subtracting portfolio
equity and direct investment liabilities, and we obtain the net safe position by adding debt
(portfolio debt and other investment) and reserve assets, and subtracting debt liabilities.
Those measures are then normalized by the total gross domestic product of each country or
group. The contrast shown in the Figure is striking: the rest of the world, which includes
emerging markets, but also Europe and Japan, have been long safe and short risky since
the Asian financial crisis of 1997, while the U.S. is increasingly long risky and, especially,
short safe. Within the rest of the world, emerging markets in particular, have been rapidly
accumulating safe assets (with a special appetite for US Treasuries) to insure against crises,
while financial liberalization has enabled the U.S. –and other advanced economies– to invest
in direct investment and portfolio equities abroad.
    This asymmetric balance sheet provides both an intermediation margin to the U.S. and
a differential valuation response to different types of shocks with important implications for
the process of external adjustment. The U.S. earns an intermediation margin in the form
of an excess return on its assets (risky) compared to its liabilities (safe). In Gourinchas &
Rey (2007b), getting some inspiration from the famous Giscard d’Estaing quote, we called
this excess return the exorbitant privilege. We estimate this excess return at about 2% a
year in real terms for the period 1952-2016 (cf. Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017)). This
enables the United States to run higher external deficits on average. Second, the asymmetry


                                                                     13
in currency composition between assets and liabilities means that exchange rate fluctuations
tend to be stabilizing. Everything else equal, a depreciation of the dollar, increases the value
of US external assets, while the dollar value of its liabilities remains constant. The net effect
is an improvement in the US net external asset position.
    This last observation suggests an additional channel of external adjustment, in addition
to the standard trade channel emphasized in the literature: because of the composition and
size of its external balance sheet, the US external adjustment can operate via future valuation
gains or losses. The latter represents what Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) call the valuation
channel of adjustment.
    The nature of the US external adjustment process and how it changed over time were
initially explored by Gourinchas & Rey (2007a). The rest of this section revisits and updates
their results using more recent data. Crucially, we are now in a position to explore the impact
of the Great Recession. We establish three main empirical results. First, the valuation
channel has been quite stable or even increasing in importance over time. Second, the trade
channel has become markedly less important. These two findings highlight the increasing
importance of gross financial flows and positions for the process of external adjustment.
Third, the overall forecasting power of –properly measured– external imbalances for external
returns or the trade balance remains strong especially at longer horizons, even through the
recent crisis. Taken together, these results indicate that an increasingly large share of the US
adjustment process occurs through systematic convenience (safety or liquidity) yields earned
on its external liabilities, relative to its external assets. This confirms that the U.S. and its
currency occupy an increasingly central place in the international financial system, despite
the relative decline of the US economy relative to world GDP.

3.1     External adjustment
We build on the approach of Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) who found that valuation effects
represent roughly one-third of the cyclical external adjustment of the United States over the
1952Q1-2004Q1 period.
   The intuition for their approach is easy to grasp using a simplified framework. Consider
the following log-linearized accumulation equation for the US net foreign asset position:

                        ∆nat+1 ≡ nat+1 − nat ≈ rt+1 + (R − 1)(nat + nxt ).                               (1)

    Here, nat represents the cyclical component of the net foreign asset position, constructed
from estimates of gross external assets and liabilities, nxt represents the cyclical component
of the trade balance, constructed from exports and imports, rt+1 is the (log) return on the
net foreign asset position, i.e. a weighted return on gross external assets and gross external
liabilities, and R > 1 is the steady state gross return on the net foreign asset position.16
Eq. (1) states that the US net foreign asset position improves (∆nat+1 > 0) either when the
US runs a larger trade surplus (nxt > 0) or when the US earns higher returns on its assets
than its liabilities (rt+1 > 0).
  16
    For details on how to obtain this log-linearized accumulation equation, we refer the reader to Gourinchas
& Rey (2007a). The cyclical components of the net foreign asset position and the trade balance are extracted
using a very smooth Hodrick-Prescott filter with the smoothing parameter set so that the frequency gain of
the filter is equal to 70% at the frequency corresponding to a 50-year cycle.


                                                     14
   One can define a measure of cyclical external imbalances, nxat = nat + nxt , manipulate
and iterate Eq. (1) forward, impose a no-Ponzi condition, and take expectations to obtain:
                              +∞

    Eq. (2) is the key empirical equation for our analysis. It shows that movements in the
cyclical trade balance and net foreign asset position encoded in nxat must forecast either
future external portfolio returns or future net export growth, or both.
    An important advantage of this approach is that it imposes only minimal theoretical
restrictions: a dynamic accumulation equation, a no-Ponzi condition, and a log-linearization.
The first ingredient is an accounting relation that must be satisfied. The second condition
could be violated if, for instance, markets incorrectly expect some external bailout or fail to
anticipate a default on external debt. As for the log-linearization, its accuracy depends on
the size of the underlying shocks. Consequently, Eq. (2) provides a natural way to let the data
speak about which channel of adjustment is most important in practice. A finding that the
U.S. external balance condition needs to be satisfied entirely via future trade surpluses (the
trade channel), as encoded in nxa∆nxt     would indicate that the U.S. position at the center of
the international monetary system does not grant the country much additional flexibility. By
contrast, a finding that the U.S. external balance position can be satisfied via future expected
valuation gains (the valuation channel), as encoded in nxart , would indicate that the U.S.
extracts a substantial benefit from its position at the center of the international monetary
system, relaxing the need to generate future trade surpluses. Importantly, adjustments
through returns can occur via changes in the dollar exchange rate as described above.
    To estimate Eq. (2), we construct nxat from quarterly estimates of the US gross external
asset and liability positions at market value, as well as exports and imports, between 1952Q1
and 2015Q4. In the spirit of Campbell & Shiller (1988), we use a simple reduced form Vector
Auto-Regression (VAR) to decompose nxat in its different subcomponents, namely nxart the
part related to valuation adjustments, and nxa∆nx  t    the part related to net exports.17 Fur-
ther, nxat is decomposed into asset and liability return components nxara
          r                                                                         rl
                                                                             t , nxat , and both
are in turn decomposed into equity, FDI, debt, and “other” (bank loans and trade credit)
components. We denote them nxaria            ril
                                      t , nxat for i ∈ {e, f, d, o}. The data and methodology
follow Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) closely, to which we refer the reader for details.

3.2     Trade and valuation channels of adjustment: quantification
The first panel of Figure 5 reports the decomposition of the cyclical imbalance measure
nxat into future valuation adjustment nxart and future net export adjustment nxa∆nx
                                                                                  t  . The
second panel breaks down the return component into an asset part and a liability part18 .
   To get a sense of the long-run properties of nxat , we also report in Table 2 a variance
decomposition into each subcomponents following Cochrane (1992). Table 2 presents the
decomposition for different values of the discount rate R−1 , and for both our extended
  17
     The VAR includes rt , ∆nxt and nxat . We choose the order of the VAR, p = 1, according to standard
lag-selection criteria.
  18
     The subcomponents by investment type are reported in Figure A1 of the Appendix.

sample (1952Q1 to 2015Q4) and the original sample of Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) (1952Q1
to 2004Q1).19
    Several features are noteworthy. First, the overall fit of the decomposition is good, as
evidenced by the fact that predicted nxat , equal to nxart + nxa∆nx
                                                                t   , is closely tracking actual
nxat . More precisely, Table 2 shows that together, nxat and nxa∆nx
                                                           r
                                                                      t    explain around 75%
                                                    −1
of all nxat variations for our benchmark value of R = 0.95. Although this does not match
the 91% explained in the original sample, we find those results to be surprisingly good given
  19
       Specifically, we decompose the variance as follows:

                              cov(nxa, nxa)   cov(nxar , nxa) cov(nxa∆nx , nxa)
                         1=                 =                +                  ≡ βr + β∆nx           (3)
                                var(nxa)         var(nxa)         var(nxa)

  In practice, βs are equivalent to the coefficients from regressing each part independently on nxat . We
proceed similarly to obtain each detailed subcomponent.


                                                               16
that the sample is now longer and includes periods of extreme variations with the Great Re-
cession and euro area crisis. Second, as in Gourinchas & Rey (2007a), nxart and nxa∆nx t   are
positively correlated, i.e. the valuation and trade effects are mutually reinforcing. This un-
derlines the stabilizing role of capital gains in the external adjustment of the United States.
In particular, dollar depreciations can be associated both with an improvement in net exports
and with a capital gain on the net foreign asset position. Third, valuation effects continue
to be particularly important as they explain about 34% of the cyclical external adjustment
of the United States, which is higher than the 30% found in Gourinchas & Rey (2007a).
In relative terms, the results are even more striking with valuation effects explaining almost
as much as trade adjustments (34% vs. 41%) while they were less than half as important
for 1952Q1-2004Q1 (30% vs. 63%). This reflects to some extent the deterioration of the
overall fit but also suggests that valuation changes have been particularly substantial during
the recent crisis period. In order to gain further insights on those changes, we estimate the
same unconditional variance decomposition on a rolling basis with 15-year windows.20 This
exercise is reported in Figure 6, with βp = βr + β∆nx representing the overall quality of
the fit. While net exports account for a large share of the variance until the collapse of
the dot-com bubble, their influence declines substantially subsequently while the influence
of valuation effects gradually rises. As a result, while the overall fit of the decomposition
declines, the deterioration remains limited.

    We attribute the decrease in the overall fit to the large fluctuations in asset prices oc-
curring during the global financial crisis of 2008 and the subsequent Eurozone debt crisis
of 2010. We observe in particular a dramatic but temporary drop in the overall fit (βp )
after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, when the dislocation in financial markets was
most severe. This episode is associated with extreme movements in asset prices and with a
negative co-movement of the net export growth component with nxat (see Gourinchas, Rey
& Govillot (2017) for further discussion). It is likely that the quality of the log-linearization
behind Eq. (1) deteriorates significantly when asset markets experience a severe adjustment.
Nevertheless, our methodology indicates an increased importance of the valuation compo-
nent, in an environment of increasingly large cross-border holdings.

    Note that for both samples, the asset side is driving the vast majority of valuation
changes. For instance, as shown in Table 2, nxara  t explains around 27% of the overall vari-
ations in nxat in the extended sample, versus 7% for nxarl    t . This is also clear from Panel
(b) in Figure 5. Lastly, in terms of investment types, FDI and equity explain the bulk
of valuation changes on the asset-side (14% and 9% respectively), while the “other” cate-
gory, which includes in particular bank loans and trade credits, accounts for the remaining
3%, and debt is small. For liabilities, equity and FDI contribute in equal amount (2.5%),
debt contributes slightly less (1.5%), and other liabilities are negligible. Those findings are
consistent with the composition of the United States external balance sheet being highly
asymmetric both in terms of risk taking as it is long in risky assets (equity and FDI) and
short in safe assets (debt and other), and also in currency composition, assets being mainly
denominated in foreign currency and liabilities in dollars.
  20
    For this exercise, we reconstruct our estimate of nxat for each rolling window. This ensures that there
is no look-ahead bias: the decomposition at time t does not incorporate information from time s > t.

Notes: β∆nx (βr ) represents the share of the unconditional variance of nxa explained by future
net export growth (future excess returns). βra (βrl ) represents the share of the unconditional
variance of nxar explained by future returns on gross external assets (liabilities). βria , βril
are the share of the unconditional variance explained by each subcategory of external assets
(liabilities): i ∈ {debt, equity, FDI, other}. Results for the original sample differ slightly
from Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) because we re-estimate coefficients at the more detailed
level using each subcomponent of nxara and nxarl .

Figure 6: Rolling regressions equivalent of Table 2. In Panels (a) and (b), β∆nx and βr
represent the share of the unconditional variance of nxa explained by future net export
growth and future excess returns, respectively. They are estimated by regressing nxa∆nx
and nxar on nxa over 15-year rolling windows. In Panel (c), βp captures the overall quality
of the fit. Bands are 95% confidence intervals based on Newey-West standard-errors. The
full sample is 1952Q1-2015Q4. The date is the end of each rolling window.

   In conclusion, our empirical analysis of Eq. (2) reveals that the valuation channel of
adjustment has increased over time, even while the global economy and financial markets
experienced substantial dislocation. If anything, this points to an increased dominance of
the US dollar as the international reserve currency and store of value.

3.3         Predictability of the trade and adjustment channels
According to our results, a substantial share of the adjustment process operates via future
valuation gains. A direct implication is that the US external imbalances, as measured by
nxat , must forecast future external portfolio returns rt+j , future net export growth ∆nxt+j ,
or both, at least at some horizons. Evidence of return predictability would confirm that the
US external adjustment process has profound implications for global asset markets as well
as currency markets (we explore the latter specifically in the next section).
    To test this empirical prediction, we run short-term predictive regressions for returns on




                                                                             19
the US net external position. These regressions take the following form:

                                   yt+1 = α + βnxat + δzt + t+1                                      (4)

   where yt+1 is a quarterly return between t and t + 1, zt represents additional controls
used in the literature, and t+1 is a residual. Table 3 presents the results for both samples.

price ratio (available from 1970Q1 to 2004Q2), and xmt is the stationary component from
the trade balance. Robust standard errors in parentheses. R̄2 is the adjusted-R2 . Boldface
entries are significant at the 5 percent level. All coefficients and standard errors are multiplied
by 100.

  The most striking result is that, despite the fact that our extended sample includes the
very turbulent recent economic period, the predictive power of nxat for the returns on the
US external portfolio remains very strong. This is true if we look both at rt+j , the fu-
ture returns on the net foreign asset portfolio defined in Gourinchas & Rey (2007a), and
   e       ae    le
∆rt+j  = rt+j − rt+j , the equity returns differential. The adjusted-R2 of the regression is
7-8%, and the negative and significant coefficients indicate that a positive deviation from
trend (nxat > 0) predicts a decline in net portfolio return that is qualitatively consistent
with Equation 2. Adding controls –lagged values, relative dividend-price ratios and the
stationary component of the trade balance– makes virtually no difference, and nxat remains

                                                   20
a very strong predictor.

    Most importantly, the predictive power of the variable is not only significant, but also
economically large: a one-standard-deviation increase in nxat (13.97%) predicts a decline
in the net external portfolio return of 368 basis points (0.1397 × 26.31/100) over the next
quarter, or about 15.53% in annualized terms, and a decline in the real equity returns dif-
ferential of 157 basis points (0.1397 × 11.22/100), or 6.42% in annualized terms. Hence,
nxat turns out to have a remarkably robust predictive power for the excess returns on the
external balance sheet of the hegemonic country throughout the post World War II period,
and across multiple exchange rate regimes.

    Another way to observe the resilience of the predictability relationship through time is
to run our predictive regressions on a rolling basis. The result of this exercise is presented
in Figure 7. Each panel shows the coefficient βt of a regression similar to Equation 4
run on a 15-year rolling window21 . We take as yt+1 the future returns on the net foreign
                                                                                e
asset portfolio rt+1 (panel (e)), the future differential returns for equity (∆rt+1 ) (panel(a))
                                                                          f
as in Table 2, but also add the future differential returns for FDI (∆rt+1 ) (panel (b)), debt
    d                                            o
(∆rt+1 ) (panel (c)), and other investment (∆rt+1   ) (panel (d)).

    The graphs confirm the results of Table 2. Except for brief periods around the collapse
of the Bretton Woods system and the burst of the dot-com bubble, the coefficients for net
returns and equity returns differential stay of roughly the same magnitude. Panels (a) to
(d) are also consistent with Table 2 and the variance decomposition results: most of the
predictability seems concentrated on equity and FDI returns, with weaker predictability for
debt and other investment returns. Two additional facts are notable. First, nxat did seem
to negatively predict returns differential on debt and other investments from around 1985 to
1995. This period is characterized by large debt and bank flows in international capital flows
as many emerging markets liberalized their risky asset markets around 1990s or later. Sec-
ond, we emphasize that when there is predictability, we predict relative returns. In contrast,
we find very limited evidence of predictability for the level of returns on gross assets (gross
equity and gross FDI assets), and no evidence of predictability for returns on gross liabilities.

    Finally, from Equation 2, the predictability has no reason to be limited to the next
quarter. We conclude this part by turning Pk to long-horizon regressions in which we regress
                                       −1
k-horizon average returns, yt,k ≡ k         i=1 yt+i , on nxat . Table 4 presents the results
for horizons ranging from 1 to 24 quarters, for net total portfolio returns (rt,k ) as well as
net export growth (∆nxt,k ). We postponed the discussion of the latter up to now because
adjustment through the trade channel is likely to be taking place at horizons longer than one
quarter. Note that the tables report results for two regressions, one regressing each yt,k on
nxat directly, and one regressing yt,k on the components of nxat , i.e. the cyclical components
of exports, imports, gross assets and gross liabilities denoted xt , m    a l
                                                                       t , t , t respectively. The
regression results vary little between the two versions of the regression.
  21
    For simplicity, we use the regression without controls for this exercise. Adding controls makes virtually
no difference, as already suggested by the results in Table 2.

    Table 4 shows that in-sample predictability for rt,k increases up to an adjusted-R2 of 24%
at four and eight-quarter horizons (34 and 36% with separate regressors) before decreasing
back to 6% (14%) at 24-quarter horizon. This confirms the findings of Gourinchas & Rey
(2007a), as seen in Panel B, that external adjustment through the financial channel operates
at short to medium-term horizons (one quarter to two years).
    The picture for net export growth is very different. A positive cyclical external imbal-
ance predicts low future net export growth to restore equilibrium, which is consistent with
Equation 2, but this channel is active at longer horizons. In the short to medium term,
in-sample predictability is low, while it increases substantially as the horizon lengthens, cul-
minating in an adjusted-R2 of 46% at 24 quarters (68% with separate regressors). Therefore,
the standard trade channel of external adjustment is also present, but it operates at longer
horizons.
    In summary, our analysis illuminates the type of mechanisms through which the cen-
ter country of the international monetary system adjusts to external imbalances. Unlike
Hume’s specie-flow there is no mechanical adjustment in gold reserves. Unlike the predic-
tions of standard macroeconomic models, there is little evidence of adjustment via domestic
macroeconomic policies that would shape future net exports, at least in the short to medium
run. Instead, an increasing share of the adjustment takes place via predictable changes in
the return on the US net foreign asset position. Adverse movements in the US net for-
eign asset positions predict positive future excess returns. These excess returns include
(but are not limited to) convenience (liquidity or safety) yields on US external liabilities,
relative to US external assets.22 The stabilizing role of these excess returns highlights the
unique position that the U.S. continues to occupy at the center of the international financial
system, and transcends any exchange rate regime arrangement in place since the early 1950s.



4      The dollar exchange rate
A natural question to investigate is the role of the dollar exchange rate in the adjustment
mechanism, especially in the post Bretton Woods era of floating exchange rates. As discussed
previously, the asymmetry in the currency composition of external assets and liabilities of
the U.S. implies that movements in the dollar exchange rate mechanically affect the external
balance. Are these dollar exchange rate fluctuations systematically tied to our measure of
cyclical imbalances? We turn to this question in this section. Predicting nominal exchange
rates is notoriously difficult, as has been shown for instance by Froot & Rogoff (1995)23 . Our
updated results re-affirm the findings of Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) that cyclical external im-
balances are good predictors of the dollar exchange rate: nxat forecasts future exchange rate
changes from one quarter ahead to long horizons (up to 24 quarters). We also compare our
  22
     Because of the rapidly growing cross-border positions, in relation to the size of the economy over that
period, even a small convenience yield can translate into substantial wealth transfers that alter the external
adjustment dynamics.
  23
     We focus mostly on in-sample predictability. In their classic paper, Meese & Rogoff (1983) show that
predicting exchange rate out-of-sample is particularly difficult. Indeed, very few models are able to beat the
prediction of exchange rates following a simple random walk at short horizons. Gourinchas & Rey (2007a)
discuss the ability of nxat to predict exchange rate changes out-of-sample, and show that it beats the random
walk benchmark.

results with the recent literature exploring the explanatory power of the convenience yield
on US Treasuries for dollar exchange rates (see Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b)).

    We begin by considering predictability at the one-quarter horizon. In Table 5, we run
regressions of the form yt+1 = α + βnxat + δzt + t+1 with yt+1 now being exchange rate
changes. We use both a FDI-weighted measure (∆et+1 ) and the Federal Reserve trade-
weighted multilateral exchange rate for major currencies (∆eTt+1 ). The sample covers the
post-Bretton Woods period, from 1973Q1 to 2015Q4.
    The results show that nxat has a strong predictive power for both measures. The coeffi-
cient is negative and significant, which is consistent with positive cyclical external imbalances
predicting a depreciation of the dollar one quarter ahead. The effect is economically sub-
stantial, with a one-standard-deviation decrease in nxat (13.97%) predicting a 95 basis-point
(0.1397 × 6.83/100) increase (3.87 percentage points in annualized terms) in the expected
rate of depreciation.

Notes: Regressions of the form: yt+1 = α + βnxat + δzt + t+1 where yt+1 is the FDI-
weighted depreciation rate (∆et+1 ), or the trade-weighted depreciation rate (∆eTt+1 ). xmt
is the stationary component from the trade balance, and it − i∗t is the short-term interest
rate differential (in %). Robust standard errors in parentheses. R̄2 is the adjusted-R2 .
Boldface entries are significant at the 5 percent level. All coefficients and standard errors
are multiplied by 100.

   Several aspects are noteworthy. First, nxat does particularly well even at relatively short
horizons. This is noteworthy, given the typical difficulty in predicting exchange rates in stan-
dard empirical models. In that respect, the adjusted-R2 are quite high (around 7 to 10%).

                                               25
Second, adding control variables such as the interest rate differential or lags, makes little
difference. Third, when comparing results with those of the original sample of Gourinchas
& Rey (2007a), the stability of the relationship is quite remarkable given that the Great
Financial Crisis of 2008 and the euro area sovereign debt crisis are now included in the sample.

    Let us turn to longer horizons. Table 6 presents the same predictability results but
for horizons ranging between 1 and 24 quarters. In-sample predictability increases with the
horizon, with adjusted-R2 reaching an impressive 52% 12 quarters ahead (60% 16 quarters
ahead if we use separate z s as regressors). In other words, nxat is able to predict in-sample
exchange-rate changes in the short, medium, and long term. This suggests that two dy-
namics are at play. In the short to medium term, valuation effects are the main adjustment
channels and exchange rate changes participate by impacting the return on the net external
portfolio. In the medium to long term, the valuation channel is mostly inactive and returns
are not predictable. However, the trade channel of adjustment becomes more relevant. We
hypothesize that exchange rate changes remain predictable precisely because of their role for
trade flows at longer horizons.

exchange rate changes is to look at Figure 8, which plots the FDI-weighted nominal effec-
tive depreciation rate from one to 12 quarter ahead against its fitted values using nxat , and
independently with z as regressors. The increase in predictive power as the horizon grows
is particularly striking. The plot also emphasizes that the nxat variable is able to pick up

both the general tendencies in exchange rate changes and their turning points.

    We now turn to a comparison with the results of Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b),
who also emphasize the specific features of dollar assets in the international financial system.
In that paper, the authors propose a theory of dollar exchange rate determination based on
the convenience yields offered by US safe securities. Specifically, US Treasuries and US de-
posits offering the LIBOR rate provide a convenience yield to investors both in the United
States and abroad. This convenience yield measures the non-pecuniary value that investors
impute to the safety and liquidity properties of US safe assets (cf. also Krishnamurthy &
Vissing-Jorgensen , 2012). When an episode of global financial instability occurs, the flight
to the safety and liquidity of US securities drives up their convenience yield. A transitory
flight to safety results in a surge in demand for US assets, and is reflected in a contempora-
neous appreciation of the US dollar, followed by an expected depreciation over subsequent
periods. That theory suggests that movements in convenience yields can predict movements
in the dollar exchange rate. In a recent paper, Engel & Wu (2019) also explore the link


                                                                     27
between liquidity yield and exchange rate movements and conclude that liquidity yields are
an important determinant of exchange rates for all the G-10 countries.

    In what follows, we compare the information contained in convenience yields constructed
by Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b) and in our measure of cyclical imbalances nxat
for the dollar exchange rate predictability. Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b) proxy
the convenience yield with the Treasury basis, i.e. the yield difference between on-shore
and off-shore Treasuries of identical maturity, denoted xTreas
                                                          t    . The predictability of nxat for
excess returns (the valuation channel of adjustment) is consistent with, but is not limited to,
the existence of a convenience yield on US external liabilities relative to US external assets,
both broadly defined. Our approach does not take a specific stance on which asset-pair, if
any, will exhibit an excess return in equilibrium. More broadly, it captures the equilibrium
global banker and insurer functions of the hegemon. For instance, our approach is valid
whether on-shore Treasuries are cheaper than off-shore ones (the convenience yield of Jiang,
Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b)) or whether the excess return manifests itself in the asym-
metric composition of the external balance sheet, with more risky assets on the asset side
and more safe liabilities on the liability side.24

    We adopt an empirical specification similar to Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b)
and regress the rate of depreciation of the dollar on the Treasury and LIBOR bases, xTreas    t
and xLIBOR
      t     , respectively, alongside nxat . 25
                                                In their paper, and our results below, the basis is
defined such that a decrease corresponds to an increase in convenience yields and should be
associated with an immediate appreciation of the dollar exchange rate, followed by a subse-
quent depreciation.26 We run both univariate predictability regressions, in which exchange
rate changes are regressed on each measure separately, and multivariate ones, in which we
include all variables as regressors.27 Results are presented in Table 7.28

      See Gourinchas & Rey (2007b) for an early discussion of within and between excess returns on the US
external balance sheet.

      As in that paper, we also add the innovations to change in the bases, obtained as the residual εTreas t
                                                            $      ∗

                                   t    − xTreas                             Treas
                                           t−1 = α + β1 (it−1 − it−1 ) + β2 xt−1 + εt
                                                                                      Treas
                                                                                            . Innovations to the
LIBOR basis are obtained in a similar fashion.
   26
      The only additional difference with previous regressions is that the sample is now limited to 1988Q1 to
2015Q4 due to the availability of the basis measures.
   27
      Note that for “univariate” regressions, the innovations to ∆xt and ∆xt−1 are always included as controls
alongside the basis in level. As suggested in Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b), we also run the
univariate regressions using the interest rate differential dit both as independent regressor and as control.
Results are mostly unaffected and these are omitted in the interest of space. We keep the interest rate
differential as a control in the multivariate regressions.
   28
      We use the FDI-based exchange rate measure extended from Gourinchas & Rey (2007a). Results are
similar if we use the measure from Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b), although the basis measure has
a stronger predictive power at the 3-year horizon (roughly on par with nxat ). Those results are reported in
Table A1 of the Appendix. In addition, the weights for the nxat measure are based on the full extended
sample (1952Q1-2015Q4), but results are unchanged if we re-estimate them on the limited sample (1988Q1-
2015Q4).

Notes for Table 7: The dependent variable is the FDI-weighted depreciation rate, ∆et,k =
et+k − et , extended from Gourinchas & Rey (2007a). Sample: 1988Q1-2015Q4. nxat
weights are computed on the full sample (1952Q1-2015Q4). Panel A presents the results
for univariate regressions of the form ∆et,k = α + βv + t with v ∈ {nxat , xTreas
                                                                             t     , xLIBOR

For Panel A regressions on each xt , the corresponding ∆xt and ∆xt−1 are also included as
controls. Panel B presents the results for multivariate regressions of ∆et,k on all variables
together, also controlling for interest rate differential. Standard-errors are computed using
Newey-West with Bartlett windows of k − 1 quarters, and p-values reported in parentheses.
Boldface entries are significant at the 5 percent level. All coefficients are multiplied by
100, and basis measures are expressed in percentage points to make the magnitude of the
coefficients broadly comparable (in terms of the effect of a 1-standard deviation change).

    We focus first on the univariate regressions. For short horizons, one to two quarters
ahead, nxat and the US Treasury basis xTreas
                                           t   are significant at the 5% and 10% level respec-
tively, and the coefficient are of similar magnitude. Note that the coefficient on the basis
measure is positive, i.e. a higher convenience yield (associated with a lower basis) is associ-
ated with a subsequent appreciation of the dollar exchange rate, not a depreciation. These
results are consistent with the authors’ own findings, which they attribute to momentum
in currency markets. Similarly, an increase in nxat corresponds to a future appreciation
of the dollar exchange rate, delivering negative excess returns, also as suggested by the-
ory. Both effects are economically large: a one-standard-deviation lower basis (0.2482%)
predicts an annualized 7.56 percentage-point decrease in the depreciation rate one quarter
ahead (5.55 percentage points two quarters ahead), while a one-standard-deviation decrease
in nxat (13.97%) predicts an annualized 2.95 percentage-point increase one quarter ahead
(3.19 percentage-point two quarters ahead). At one quarter, both variables do roughly as
well in terms of adjusted-R2 (4% for xTt reas vs. 2% for nxat ), but from two quarter ahead
onwards, the adjusted-R2 for nxat becomes significantly larger. The LIBOR basis does not
do as well, with the coefficient being smaller and insignificant. This is also documented in
Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018a), who show that the LIBOR basis helps mostly on
the most recent part of the sample, after the Great Recession. Finally, note that, the effect
of the innovations to the Treasury basis measure ∆xT reas have roughly the same magnitudes,
albeit with a flipped sign and varying significance levels. Innovations to the LIBOR basis
are mostly insignificant.
    As the horizon extends, the picture changes. First, the coefficient on the Treasury basis
changes sign, as in Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b), so that it now becomes consis-
tent with the authors’ prediction: an increase in convenience yield is associated with a dollar
depreciation in the future. However, in the univariate regressions, the predictive power of
the basis measures decreases sharply, with very small adjusted-R2 . Using the exchange rate
measure from Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b) as in Table A1 does not alter the re-
sults, except at the 3-year horizon for which the coefficient on xTreas
                                                                   t    becomes larger (roughly
on par with nxat ) and significant (p-value = 2%). By contrast, the predictive power of nxat
grows strongly with the horizon, with coefficients staying broadly stable. This is the case
for both measures of exchange rate changes.
    The results from the multivariate regressions also prove informative. Interestingly, using
both nxat and the basis in the regression appears to help xTt reas achieve stronger significance,
and slightly larger coefficients. At the 12-quarter horizon, a one standard-deviation lower

                                                30
basis (0.2482%) does predict an annualized 2.18-percentage-point increase in the depreciation
rate, with a p-value of 2%, vs. an annualized 2.98-percentage-point increase for a one-
standard-deviation decrease in nxat (p-value ≈ 0%). At long-term horizons (16 and 24
quarters), xTt reas remains significant (p-value of 9% and 5% respectively), but with coefficients
becoming significantly smaller. The coefficient for nxat remains broadly stable from one to
24 quarter ahead, and always strongly significant (p-value ≈ 0% for all horizons).
    Taken together, those results suggest that xTreast   and nxat capture complementary chan-
nels: a flight-to-safety channel for convenience yields, and a broader valuation channel in-
cluding a convenience yield for nxat . Combining the two measures leads to striking predictive
power at all horizons, with adjusted-R2 ranging from 7% to 59%. Documenting this com-
plementarity further is an interesting avenue that we leave for future research. Second,
controlling for additional variables, such as the interest rate differential, makes little differ-
ence. Third, the fact that nxat stays important at most horizons, even when controlling for
basis measures and other variables, suggests that it captures more than just the short-term
demand for safe assets. Indeed, this emphasizes that nxat also includes cyclical adjustments
through trade, as well as valuation effects on other assets such as equity and FDI, and that
those are also important in predicting exchange rates. This is consistent for instance with the
last leg of the portfolio rebalancing model developed and tested in Hau & Rey (2004, 2006)
and Camanho, Hau & Rey (2018). In this model, return changes on assets held in other
countries, in particular equities, lead to a change in currency exposure that investors want
to counterbalance. This leads to portfolio rebalancing, which in turn affects the exchange
rate.



5       Exorbitant privilege
The country at the centre of the international monetary system, the hegemon, issues the
dominant currency. There are important inter-related functions of international currencies
in good and asset markets. The implications of the process of international adjustment for
the hegemon depends on the rules of the games of the international monetary system. Under
Bretton Woods, dollar balances were held abroad to perform international payments. In our
fiat currency system, being the hegemon confers a specific ability to issue large amount of
nominally safe liabilities (dollar securities) which are happily absorbed by the rest of the
world. Hence the view that in case of a deficit, the United States do not have to take restric-
tive measures, so that the dollar is not an impartial means of international exchange. This
is the essence of the “exorbitant privilege”. Different aspects of this “exorbitant privilege”
have been characterised in different ways by a series of papers in the literature. Gourinchas
& Rey (2007b) constructs estimates of external assets and liabilities of the United States
at market value at the quarterly frequency for the entire post-war period. They emphasize
that the characteristics of its balance sheet make the US akin to a “world banker” or even
a “world venture capitalist” due to the asymmetry between risky assets and safe liquid lia-
bilities. They compute the first estimates of the excess returns on the US net foreign asset
position29 : these are sizable, around 2% per year in real terms. Those excess returns and
the associated valuation channel of adjustment (see Gourinchas & Rey (2007a) and section
 29
      See also Lane & Milesi-Ferretti (2009) and Curcuru, Dvorak & Warnock (2008).

3) ease the process of external adjustment for the US. This is precisely what Gourinchas
& Rey (2007b) calls “the exorbitant privilege”. Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017) go
a lot further. They derive the external balance sheet of the US as an optimizing problem
in general equilibrium when the US has a comparative advantage in risk taking. The key
assumption is that the US is less risk averse as a country than the rest of the world. Maggiori
 (2017) shows that this asymmetry in risk aversion can be microfounded from differences in
degrees of frictions in capital markets in the US versus the world. In his model, a tighter
constraint in the banking system of the rest of the world looks like a higher aggregate de-
gree of risk aversion of the rest of the world30 . Maggiori (2017) derives the implications of
these financial imperfections on external asset positions while Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot
 (2017) draw the implications of their risk-sharing model. In global crisis times, the U.S.,
less risk-averse, insures the rest of the world, which receives a substantial wealth transfer.
The value of the risky external assets of the U.S. collapses while the value of its liabilities
(mostly reserve assets) goes up and an insurance transfer is made from the US to the rest of
the world31 . Therefore, in Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017), the U.S. is the world insurer
and the “exorbitant privilege” is an insurance fee being paid in normal times in exchange
for an insurance transfer –“the exorbitant duty”– being implemented in global crisis times
via the structure of the external portfolio of the United States.
    In contrast, Farhi & Maggiori (2018) interprets the “exorbitant privilege” as a monopoly
rent that the US can extract as the sole issuer of the international currency32 . In their model,
the centre country is the sole issuer of reserve assets demanded by the rest of the world and
it faces a commitment problem. Ex-post, in bad states of the world, the hegemon faces a
trade-off between inflating away the debt to limit real repayments or incurring the cost of
default. Ex-ante, the centre country chooses how much debt to issue before interest rates are
determined. This allows for the possibility of self-fulfilling confidence crises à la Calvo (1988)
where the hegemon depreciates its currency when expectations of investors are adverse. In
their setting, the hegemon obtains monopoly rents in the form of a positive endogenous safety
premium on reserve assets. He, Krishnamurthy & Milbradt (2019) investigate why US debt
appears to have high valuations relative to the debt of other countries with similar funda-
mentals (see also Krishnamurthy & Vissing-Jorgensen (2011, 2012) and Hassan (2013)). He,
Krishnamurthy & Milbradt (2019) interpret the safety property of a reserve currency as the
result of a coordination game of investors buying that currency and propping up its value. In
their model, for a country’s bond to be safe, the number of investors who invest in the bond
must exceed a threshold, which is decreasing in the country’s fundamentals and increasing in
the size of the debt. Hence, the safety of an asset and the “exorbitant privilege” are linked
to the complementarities in the strategy of investors. In a model with complementarities
between invoicing and banking, Gopinath & Stein (2018a) interpret the deviation of interest
rate parity due to the large demand for dollars as an“exorbitant privilege”. Finally, several
authors, e.g. Maggiori, Neiman & Schreger (2018), have emphasized the specific liquidity
  30
     Another possible microfoundation can be found in Mendoza, Quadrini & Rı́os-Rull (2009), where it is
a better ability to share idiosyncratic risk within the US, which enables the US to be long in risky assets
internationally.

     Farhi & Maggiori (2018) also considers the oligopolistic case of several suppliers of the reserve assets

properties of US dollar bond markets, which enable easier access to funds for corporations
–even including small companies– issuing in dollars. All those represent some facets of the
“exorbitant privilege” enjoyed by the hegemon.


6        The new Triffin dilemma
Observers of the Gold Standard and Bretton Woods systems have for a long time noted
the tension between the international liquidity provision function of the hegemon and the
net asset position backing the gold-like liquidity being issued. Triffin (1961) pointed out
that for the US to issue enough reserve assets to lubricate payment adjustment, it must run
balance of payments deficits under official settlements as it accumulates liabilities to foreign
officials without increasing official assets like gold. In a context where the dollar value was
fixed against gold, this could decrease foreign confidence in the dollar and there would be
an unavoidable run on the dollar. If on the contrary the U.S. were to limit its provision of
liquid reserve assets to the world, as the world economy grew, so would liquidity demand and
there would be a shortage of reserve assets, which would impede international transactions.
This is the “Triffin dilemma”.33 Addressing this issue, Kenen (1960) wrote a formal model
of the dynamics of the balance of payments of the reserve currency country in the context of
the gold standard when new gold production is not enough to satisfy the increase in world
liquidity demand. He shows that the system can become unstable especially in a context
where there are swift increases of private dollar holdings abroad. Despres, Kindleberger &
Salant (1966), labeling themselves as “the minority view” given the influence of the position
of Triffin at the time, questioned the unavoidability of a run on the dollar and emphasized
the role of the U.S. as a financial intermediary in a world where US markets had more
breadth and liquidity than European ones. They argued that there is nothing ominous in
the balance of payments deficits of the US as these reflects the activity of a “world banker”
lending long term and borrowing short term just like New York banks lent to the rest of the
United States. They dismissed the possibility of a run on the dollar as reflecting purely the
nervousness of some Central Bankers and academic economists. As should be clear from the
above description and has been noted e.g. in Portes (2012) and Bordo & McCauley (2018),
the Triffin dilemma has nothing to do with the current account deficits of the US (those are
net flows). Fundamentally, the Triffin dilemma is about the magnitude of the gross stock of
liquid dollar liabilities held abroad (necessary to lubricate the international payment system)
and the possible loss of confidence in the value of the dollar by foreign investors, whether
due to policies, sentiment, or fundamentals (e.g. relative size of the hegemon in the world
economy). This is the reason why the Triffin dilemma has not lost its relevance, even in an
international monetary system that lacks a formal anchor.

       Gourinchas & Rey (2007b) write:

         “Triffin saw that in a world where the fluctuations in gold supply were dictated
  33
     Triffin thought that this situation would lead to the collapse of Bretton Woods and to a deflation. The
first of these two implications turned out to be correct. According to Eichengreen (1992), Feliks Mlynarski
made a parallel observation in 1929 arguing that once outstanding liabilities to the rest of the world would
exceed the US monetary gold stock there would be a run on the dollar, a tightening of monetary policy and
depression (see Mlynarski (1929)).

                                                    33
       by the vagaries of discoveries in South Africa or the destabilizing schemes of
       Soviet Russia, but in any case unable to grow with world demand for liquidity,
       the demand for the dollar was bound to eventually exceed the gold reserves of the
       Federal Reserve. This left the door open for a run on the dollar. Interestingly,
       the current situation can be seen in a similar light: in a world where the US can
       supply the international currency at will, and invests it in illiquid assets, it still
       faces a confidence risk. There could be a run on the dollar not because investors
       would fear an abandonment of the gold parity, as in the seventies, but because
       they would fear a plunge in the dollar exchange rate. In other words, Triffin’s
       analysis does not have to rely on the gold-dollar parity to be relevant.”

   Hence, Gourinchas & Rey (2007b) argue that even under our post-1973 flexible exchange
rate regime, the international monetary and financial system faces a “New Triffin dilemma”.
This point is also emphasized by Farhi, Gourinchas & Rey (2011), Obstfeld (2011), and
Farhi & Maggiori (2018).

    The ability of the United States to be a global insurer and act as a global liquidity
provider hinges on the capacity of the country to credibly issue safe assets, chiefly govern-
ment bonds, private sector safe assets having shown their non-robustness during the 2008
crisis34 . During times of global crisis, US government bonds are at present the only assets
able to provide insurance on a large scale (see Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017)). Those
are backed by the fiscal capacity of the US government. Although the gold value of the
dollar is no longer fixed like in the Bretton Woods system, there is a growing asymmetry
between the fiscal capacity of the United States (the “backing” of US Treasury bills and
bonds) and the stock of liquid dollar debt held abroad (for further discussions on the fiscal
side of the Triffin dilemma see Obstfeld (2013)). In other words, the sheer size of the gross
liquid external debt of the U.S. may be threatening at some point the ability of the U.S.
to act as a world banker or insurer. In Gourinchas, Rey & Govillot (2017), an increase
in the demand of safe assets by the rest of the world relative to the decreasing size of the
US economy translates into a decrease in the real rate of interest. One can think of many
crisis models where fundamentals in extreme regions support only one equilibrium (crisis
with probability one, when fundamentals are bad, or no crisis with probability one at the
other extreme), while when fundamentals are in an intermediate region self-fulfilling crises
are possible. In our specific case, the decline in the relative size of the U.S. over time (or
destabilizing US macroeconomic policies) may shift the economy from the no crisis zone to
the self-fulfilling crisis zone. Farhi & Maggiori (2018) share some of these features. They
model the hegemon as a “world banker” issuing safe assets with limited commitment and
a propensity to inflate in crisis times. The preference of the rest of the world for US safe
assets is exogenous so that the role of the dollar in international payments is left unmodeled.
They emphasize that banking is a fragile activity that is subject to self-fulfilling runs in an
intermediate region of the parameters. Runs in their model are all the more likely that there
is no Lender of Last Resort with a sufficient fiscal capacity to back the hegemon.

  34
    For an analysis of governments as liquidity provider, see the seminal work of Holmström & Tirole (1998).
Gorton (2017) provides an excellent account of the history and economics of safe assets both public and
private.


                                                     34
    To sum up, there is a “New Triffin dilemma”. Just like the Bretton Woods system
collapsed with a run on the dollar, the international monetary and financial system could
witness a loss of confidence in the value of US debt. As the demand for dollar liquidity keeps
growing but the relative size of the US shrinks in the world economy, a new run on the dollar
into one or several alternative reserve currencies could be possible. On the one hand, large
stocks of dollar liquidity held abroad relative to the size of the U.S. may lead to a loss of
confidence in the dollar; on the other hand, too little international dollar liquidity would fail
to lubricate the functioning of international financial markets. “Gold or not, the specter of
the Triffin dilemma may still be haunting us!”35


7       Conclusions
There are multiple complementarities in the functions of the currency of the hegemon in the
international monetary system, from private sector use (invoicing, banking, vehicle currency,
bond issuance) to official sector use (peg, reserves, intervention), and vice versa. An essential
role of the hegemon is to provide liquidity to lubricate the wheels of international transac-
tions in good and asset markets. Another related key role is to provide insurance in crisis
times to the world economy. The hegemon issues large amount of nominally safe securities
denominated in its currency in order to perform these two vital tasks. Those liabilities are
happily absorbed by the rest of the world most of the time. This implies that the external
constraint of the hegemon is relaxed and that its process of external adjustment is greatly
facilitated by this large demand for its external liabilities. This is the essence of the exorbi-
tant privilege. A close look at the current hegemon, the United States, in the context of the
Bretton Woods system and the post-Bretton Woods system of flexible exchange rates shows
that its external balance sheet reflects its role as a world banker or insurer. It benefits from
an important valuation channel of adjustment to ensure external solvency, a channel which
has increased in power in the last decade. Interestingly, because of the key role the dollar
exchange rate plays in the valuation and trade channels of adjustment, it is possible to use
measures of external imbalances of the United States to predict future returns on the net
foreign asset positions, future export growth and importantly future exchange rate changes
at horizons ranging from a quarter to several years for the post Bretton Woods sample.
    A growing literature has provided different interpretations and measures of the exorbitant
privilege in the context of the United States, from sizable excess returns on the net foreign
positions, to deviations from interest rate parity, to liquidity premium and convenience yields
or ease of access to capital markets. A number of recent papers highlight that US monetary
policy is an important factor driving international trade and the Global Financial Cycle, i.e.
comovements in credit creation, capital flows and risky asset prices around the globe. These
monetary policy spillovers matter for the conduct of domestic monetary and macropruden-
tial policies. But, as dollar liquidity is omnipresent in international markets, it becomes
increasingly obvious, with the decline of the relative size of the US in the world economy,
that a “New Triffin dilemma” may emerge. One solution, proposed by several authors, such
as e.g. Farhi, Gourinchas & Rey (2011) and Eichengreen (2011), is the emergence of a
more multi-polar international monetary and financial system where multiple governments
would issue reserve currencies. While this system would help in overcoming the “New Triffin
 35
      Gourinchas & Rey (2007b).


                                               35
Dilemma”, its stability properties are hard to assess ex-ante. As pointed out in Farhi, Gour-
inchas & Rey (2011), increased substitutability across key currencies may stabilize relative
prices, but it may also lead to massive portfolio shifts whenever confidence in one of the
key currency is eroded. This aspect was also pointed out earlier on in Nurkse (1944), who
underlines the instability of the international monetary system when two countries (in that
case the United States and the United Kingdom) were in competition for the top spot in
the inter-war period (see also He, Krishnamurthy & Milbradt (2019) and Farhi & Mag-
giori (2018)). More research on these issues –and the many others raised in this article–
would be desirable.36 The reader will have noticed the many interfaces between the subject
of this article and some of the most intriguing and important themes in macroeconomic
research: external imbalances, macroeconomic adjustment via fiscal and monetary policy,
exchange rate dynamics, currency use, capital flows, international spillovers, financial crises
and safe assets, are just a few examples. The beauty of studying the international monetary
and financial systems lies also in realizing their all encompassing relevance for our economic
lives.
  36
    Insights from the political science, legal and the international relation literatures are crucial to understand
more fully the geopolitical implications and power associated with the issuance of a hegemonic currency. We
unfortunately could not cover those in this article.

Notes for Table A1: The dependent variable is the depreciation rate (minus appreciation
rate), ∆et,k = et+k − et . dit from Jiang, Krishnamurthy & Lustig (2018b). Sample:
1988Q1-2015Q4. nxat weights are computed on the full sample (1952Q1-2015Q4). Panel
A presents the results for univariate regressions of the form ∆et,k = α + βv + t with
v ∈ {nxat , xTt reas , xLIBOR
                        t     , dit }. For Panel A regressions on each xt , the corresponding ∆xt
and ∆xt−1 are also included as controls. Panel B presents the results for multivariate re-
gressions of ∆et,k on all variables together, also controlling for interest rate differential.
Standard-errors are computed using Newey-West with Bartlett windows of k − 1 quarters,
and p-values reported in parentheses. Boldface entries are significant at the 5 percent level.
All coefficients are multiplied by 100, and basis measures are expressed in percentage points
to make the magnitude of the coefficients broadly comparable (in terms of the effect of a
1-standard deviation change).
