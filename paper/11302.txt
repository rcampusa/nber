Parental Educational Investment and Children’s Academic Risk: Estimates of the Impact of
Sibship Size and Birth Order from Exogenous Variation in Fertility

                                             ABSTRACT

The stylized fact that individuals who come from families with more children are disadvantaged in
the schooling process has been one of the most robust effects in human capital and stratification
research over the last few decades. For example, Featherman and Hauser (1978: 242-243) estimate
that each additional brother or sister costs respondents on the order of a fifth of a year of schooling.
However, more recent analyses suggest that the detrimental effects of sibship size on children's
educational achievement might be spurious. We extend these recent analyses of spuriousness versus
causality using a different method and a different set of outcome measures. We suggest an
instrumental variable approach to estimate the effect of sibship size on children's private school
attendance and on their likelihood of being held back in school. Specifically, we deploy the sex-mix
instrument used by Angrist and Evans (1998). Analyses of educational data from the 1990 PUMS
five percent sample reveal that children from larger families are less likely to attend private school
and are more likely to be held back in school. Our estimates are smaller than traditional OLS
estimates, but are nevertheless greater than zero. Most interesting is the fact that the effect of sibship
size is uniformly strongest for latter-born children and zero for first born children.

             Parental Educational Investment and Children's Academic Risk:
         Estimates of the Impact of Sibship Size and Birth Order from Exogenous
                                   Variation in Fertility

        One of the most robust effects in social science research has been that of family

size (better known as sibship size). From Blau and Duncan (1967) onward, researchers

have found that individuals who come from larger families—that is, have more brothers

and/or sisters—do worse in school. For example, Featherman and Hauser (1978: 242-

243) find that each additional sibling costs someone about one-fifth of a year of

schooling, holding other background variables constant (also see, Blake 1981, 1989; Heer

1985; Powell and Steelman 1993).1

        Scholars have generated a number of competing hypotheses to explain why

sibling constellation matters in determining educational success. These explanations

have alternatively relied on economic, genetic, and social-psychological arguments to

address the mechanisms by which sibship size has its effects on children. Some scholars

hypothesize that the observed associations are due to the fact that additional children put

a strain on the monetary and non-monetary resources of the family. This “resource

dilution” hypothesis and its counter part in economics: the trade-off between quality and

quantity of children [see Becker 1964]) has been leant support by studies of the allocation

of educational and financial resources within the family and by the fact that sibship size

seems to matter more for poorer families where monetary resources are already scarce

(Steelman and Mercy 1980). The major alternative theory to the resource dilution model

has been the “confluence model.” This competing paradigm attributes the negative effect

of sibship size primarily to the psychological climate of the family (Zanjonc 1976). This

 Recent work has expanded the range of sibship measures to include sibling spacing and sibling sex
composition (see Powell and Steelman 1989; Powell and Steelman 1990; Powell and Steelman 1993).
theory suggests that a family with a lot of children or one with many spaced close

together in age results in a relatively inferior intellectual climate since children dominate

the environment as opposed to adults who have a greater influence on the intellectual

milieu of a small family. In essence, this theory suggests that it is not the number of

siblings that matter per se, but rather the age distribution in the household environment.

Finally, some researchers in the “no effect” paradigm suggest that the effect is entirely

artifactual, a result of the fact that parents with lower cognitive abilities may tend to have

large families (Grotevant, Scarr and Weinberg 1977). This skeptical “no effect”

hypothesis had long received lip service as researchers moved ahead in specifying which

types of parental resources mattered, when and how—assuming a true causal relationship

along the way (Downey 1995). But it has only been until very recently that the issue of

causality has worked its way into research design.

       In this paper, we extend these recent questions surrounding the true causal effects

of sibship size on children’s educational attainment through an instrumental variable

approach where we exploit random variation in sibling sex composition that affects a

family’s propensity to have a third child as opposed to stopping at two. We find that an

increase in family size reduces the likelihood of children’s private school attendance and

increases the likelihood of children being held back in school, and that this causal

relationship is moderated by birth order. We report on probability changes due to family

size that are relatively small in magnitude, but are nevertheless significantly different

from zero. Our findings are somewhat different from the zero estimates that Guo and

VanWey (1999) report, and we attribute this to differences in our methodologies and

differences in our outcome measures. Whereas Guo and VanWey measure educational




                                                                                                2
achievement through children’s test scores, we measure educational investment through

children’s private school attendance and educational achievement through children’s

likelihood of being held back in school. Thus, we view our findings as, at least in part,

an extension of the important substantive questions that they have raised, and as perhaps

indicative of different educational outcome measures hinging differentially on family

size.



Previous Work on Family Size and Educational Attainment

        It would seem likely that part of the observed effect of sibship size on children’s

educational achievement is spurious and biased upwards due to the fact that small

families and large families vary in important ways that would affect children’s success –

independent of the fact of whether there are actually more children or not. Earlier

strategies to account for this possibility relied on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)

estimations with controls for potentially biasing factors such as parental IQ. The problem

with adding additional controls is that there always remains the possibility of an

association between family size, educational achievement and something

immeasurable—ranging from household environment, neighborhood conditions,

ambition, ability, genetic make up, health status and so on. Additionally, while sibship

size is probably not measured with much error, other variables, such as socioeconomic

status, attitudes towards the future, educational orientation, and IQ, are probably

measured with lots of random and non-random error. The result is that sibship size—

being measured well—likely picks up a lot of the error of other controlled variables,

biasing its effect upward.




                                                                                              3
        In one of the first studies to deal with these OLS-based measurement issues, Guo

and VanWey (1999) use fixed effects models to address possible biases. That is, they

exploit the longitudinal design of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to

assess the impact of changes in family size on changes in test scores between siblings and

within individuals over time. Fixed effects models, however, adequately difference out

unobserved factors that might be associated with both the predictor of interest (sibship

size) and the dependent variable (educational or cognitive attainment) only under certain

conditions. The first condition is that the unobserved (or lurking) variables must be

stable across the unit within which we are differencing. So, taking the case of sibship

size, if it is the underlying, immeasurable genetic profile of parents (i.e. innate ability)

that determines both how many children the parents tend to have and the educational

performance of those children, then we can be fairly sure that the genetic makeup of the

parents is constant over time and across births as long as the composition of the family

remains the same. However, if the lurking variable that is biasing traditional estimates

happens to be something like “family intellectual climate” then it is not at all clear that

such an unobserved factor is constant over time within families. Family intellectual

climate is merely one of a number of lurking variables that may vary over time and not be

differenced out by fixed effects methods.

        What if it is the case that parents adjust their fertility patterns in response to the

“quality” of earlier children? In other words, it could be the case that parents who have

developmentally challenged children do not go on to have many additional offspring –

biasing the effect of family size down to zero. Or, it could be the case that intellectually

thriving children lead parents to have more (again, biasing the effect to zero). Or, it




                                                                                                 4
could be the case that parents compensate for additional children by augmenting the

intellectual climate in other ways. Second, there is the issue of parents adjusting their

behavior in advance to reflect their intended or ultimate family size. Take the case of

schooling. If a family knows that they intend to have more children, they might be much

less likely to send their first child to private school, given the anticipated cost of raising

three children as opposed to one. To the extent that parents know their ultimate family

size and plan accordingly, they undermine the logic of fixed effects, which relies on the

assumption that each change represents an independent source of variation. We assume

that parental decisions regarding fertility and investment in children are based on a

tradeoff between quantity, quality, and sibship sex composition, and work within the

added constraint of imperfect fertility control. Fixed effects methods cannot adequately

deal with such a model that presupposes endogenous effects.

        A third, and perhaps most important issue is multicolinearity. The sample sizes

that Guo and VanWey use range from 431 to 534 for the sibling analysis—depending on

which cognitive test is the dependent measure—and decline for models which isolate

races (it is not clear whether this is individuals or pairs; if it is individuals then the actual

degrees of freedom for difference scores are about half those figures). For the individual

fixed-effects (repeated measure) models, the sample sizes ranged from 694 to 1048

(again, this might be double the number of “difference scores” that are being analyzed).

This does not leave a lot of degrees of freedom when they are controlling for gender,

birth order, and age (it is not clear if they controlled for other time-varying covariants

such as family structure, income, and maternal education, which are controlled in the




                                                                                                 5
conventional regression models they estimate).2 Particularly troubling is the probable

colinearity between sibship size, age and birth order in their models. The seriousness of

the problem lies in the fact that all of these vary in the same direction. So, for example,

in all cases in the sibling difference models, the earlier born is the sibling with the smaller

sibship. This leads to a catch-22. If, in a fixed effects framework, we include birth order,

then we run into problems of multicolinearity. If we leave it out, then the model is

underspecified. Likewise, the age at test varies almost perfectly with sibship size

(particularly since they limited their sample to those siblings who were at least six years

apart in age).3 The same problem comes to the fore with respect to the individual-change

models as well. Other commentators have leveled different critiques at these models,

revolving around the generalizability of their select sample, the anomalous finding that

sibship size is positively related to math scores, and the possibility that there may be

spacing-size sibship interactions (see Phillips 1999; Downey et al. 1999; and Guo and

VanWey 1999a for their response).

           Finally, it is possible that Guo’s and VanWey’s estimates could stand up to these

methodological challenges, while still allowing for the possibility that sibship size may

be detrimental to educational attainment, without affecting scores on their test measures.

Private school attendance, one of our two outcome variables of interest, may hinge more

directly on parental financial constraints which would be in turn affected by sibship size.




2
  Income presents its own problems in a change model since the birth of additional siblings changes the
family size and therefore changes the income-to-needs ratio, even holding constant income changes. It
does not appear that Guo and VanWey (1999) controlled for income-to-needs ratio.
3
    Gender should be orthogonal to these variables and thus should not be an issue here.



                                                                                                          6
It is quite possible that the effects of sibship size are specific to certain educational

outcome measures and not to others.

         Given these lingering issues and the intuitive theoretical appeal of the arguments

of why sibship size should matter, questions regarding spuriousness versus causality

seem far from answered. In the current study, we deploy an IV approach as an alternative

to fixed effects—namely the sex composition of the first two children, which can be seen

as a random assignment to either of two groups: “same sex” and “mixed sex.”4 This sex

mix instrument has been used by other researchers to estimate the labor elasticity of

parents’ fertility (Angrist and Evans 1998). Their resulting estimates are much smaller

than traditional OLS estimates.

         One recent study has taken up the issue of causal versus spurious sibship size

effects using an instrumental variable approach. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2004)

use exogenous variation in family size induced by twin births to examine the causal effect

of family size on Norwegian children’s educational attainment. They find a causal effect,

but one that becomes insignificant once birth order is controlled for. Additionally, they

run the same analyses using sex mix as an instrument for family size and report the

anomalous finding of significant positive effects of family size on educational attainment.

4
  The reason we say, “at least for the first few children” is that when a family has had four or more children
of the same sex, the likelihood of the next child being that same sex rises – much to the chagrin of those
searching for the missing girl or boy to complete the set. For example, in his book, Sex Selection of
Children, Neil Bennett (1983) writes in the introduction: “Ben-Porath and Welch (1976), using the public
use sample of the 1970 United States Census, have shown that there is a slight trend effect in actual births.
If the first three children are boys, then the probability of a boy on the fourth birth rises from .513 (the
probability of a boy on the first birth) to .534. However, even this small change in the probability does not
occur unless all the previous children are of the same sex. For example, if the family consists of three boys
and one girl the likelihood of a boy on the fifth birth is only .515, which is essentially the same as the
probability of a boy on the first birth. Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that couples should assume that
without sex selection the probability of a boy is always approximately equal to the probability of a girl.”

                                                                                                             7
Meaning, in Norway, children from larger families seem to do better in school. Black et

al. attribute this finding to the potential benefits to children of same-sex sibling

compositions. However, their findings seem limited to the Norwegian family, or at the

least not generalizable to the US, as the educational systems and family support policies

of Norway differ markedly from those of the U.S. Norway’s public financial support of

children’s education results in a system whereby familial financial resources hold less

sway over children’s educational attainment. The same cannot be said of the US.

Further, Black et al.’s family size instrument of twin births is problematic in that the

presence of twins may have other effects on the family since it is an unusual occurrence.

In other words, it is difficult to know whether any observed effects on attainment are the

result of the unexpected “extra” child present in the family or the presence of twins.

Another way of putting this is that families with twins may not be generalizable to the

population as a whole. This is not an issue with different sex mixes of children. Black et

al. attempt to address this by examining only children born prior to their twin siblings,

but the arrival of twins is not the same as the arrival of consecutive singletons. At the

very least, the zero spacing between births may put extra strains on parental monetary

and non-monetary resources. Of course, there is also the issue that Black et al. examine

educational attainment, a different outcome measure from what we focus on in this paper.



Same Sex Instrument Validity

       Of course, our parameter estimate applies to those families who do go on to have

an additional child after having same sex children in their first two. In this strict (LATE)

interpretation, it does not apply to families that have one child, or stick at two, or even for




                                                                                             8
those who have three children but have mixed sex children for their first two. Nor does it

tell us anything, necessarily, about the effect of having ten children as opposed to nine.

Even to interpret this estimate as unbiased locally (that is for the treated compliers), we

must make a couple of assumptions. First, we must assume that assignment to the

treatment group (same sex) or the control group (mixed sex) is really random. Given that

there is no reason to expect systematic differences in the likelihood of having two boys,

two girls, or a mixed-sex pair across the population, this seems reasonable (Bennett

1980). Further, there appears to be no association between sex mix and any measurable

variables in the present study. We must also assume monotonicity; that is, we must

assume that for no subgroup does having same-sex children make them less likely—on

average—to have additional children.

       Table 1 presents findings on the proportion of families that go on to have a third

child when the first two children are both boys or both girls. Under the IV framework,

we would expect that parents of two girls and parents of two boys are equally likely to go

on to have a third child (and thus, that larger families are not related to children’s sex).

However, results presented in Table 1 indicate that a slightly smaller percentage of

parents with two boys (35.1 percent) go on to have a third child than parents with two

girls (36.2 percent). Yet results from Table 2 indicate that a slightly smaller percentage

of parents with three girls (24.0 percent) go on to have a fourth child than parents with

three boys (25.6 percent). Taken together, these findings are somewhat inconclusive as to

if child’s sex has an independent effect on compliance. Angrist and Evans (1998) use

sex-mix as exogenous variation in family size to explore the relationship between labor

supply and fertility and find no significant differences by first child’s sex among families




                                                                                               9
that go on to have a second child, except for one of their four sub-samples—all women in

the 1990 PUMS, which is what we use here—but even among these women, the

difference is very small in magnitude.

                                    [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]

                                    [TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]

       We must also assume that the sex mix of children does not affect their educational

outcomes in any other way than by virtue of affecting their parents’ likelihood of going

on to have more children. This is akin to saying that sibship sex composition has no

effects on educational success. If, for example, there were significant returns to scale for

same sex children—i.e. parents saved money by being able to use hand-me-down clothes

or were more able to have same sex children share a bedroom, freeing up money for

education—then our estimates might be biased (Rosenzweig and Wolpin 2000). The

evidence on this question is mixed (Powell and Steelman 1989, 1990; Butcher and Case

1994; Kaestner 1998; Kuo and Hauser 1998; Conley 2000).

       While a recent line of research by Dahl and Moretti (2004) shows that parents of

girls are more likely to divorce, it also shows that this divorce effect has been declining

over the past decades and is effectively zero by the year 2000. The authors also find that

fathers are more likely to marry their partners if they find out, pre-delivery, that their

child is a boy, and that parents are more likely to have another child if their first two

children are girls. To deal with these potentially biasing processes—differential rates of

divorce and marriage by children’s sex—we first limit our analyses to nuclear family

forms (we also need this limitation for other data imputation reasons as well, which we

specify below). However, we recognize that limiting our sample to nuclear families does




                                                                                              10
not fully control for the possible biasing effects of children’s sex on their educational

outcomes. For example, if fathers are more likely to divorce the mothers of their girls, as

previous research suggests, other fathers may be likely to stay within their marriage, but

to retreat from the family. Thus, there may be a detrimental impact of being a daughter,

as opposed to being a son, even for children from nuclear families. While the assumption

of a pure sex-mix effect on educational outcomes is by definition not testable within the

IV framework, we provide some evidence to support our contention that child’s sex does

not have an independent and biasing effect on our educational outcome measures.

       Table 3 reports the proportion of children attending private school by birth order

and third child’s sex among treatment families. We see that .130, or 13 percent, of first

born boys from families where the first two children are boys and the third child is a girl

attend private school. This proportion can be compared to .136, or 13.6 percent, of first

born boys from families where the first two children are boys and the third child is a boy

(instead of a girl, as in the first proportion reported above) attend private school. The

difference between the two proportions, -.007, is not significant and thus indicates that

the treatment effect does not vary by the sex of the third child. Likewise, we see that 15

percent of second born boys in treatment families where the third child is a girl attend

private school. The difference between this proportion and the proportion of second born

boys in treatment families where the third child is a girl is not statistically different from

zero. The latter rows of Table 3 show that for girls, the differences in proportions based

on third child’s sex, while holding the first two children’s sex constant, are not

statistically different from zero. Of first born girls in treatment families where the third

child is a boy, 13.7 percent attend private school, whereas 14.3 percent of first born girls




                                                                                             11
in treatment families where the third child is a girl attend private school. This is sixth-

tenths of a percent difference, which is again not statistically different from zero. Table 4

reports similar insignificant results for the proportion of children held back a grade.

While boys are in general more likely to be held back than girls, the effects of third

child’s sex on treatment outcomes do not vary once we control for the first two children’s

sex.

                                           [TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]

                                           [TABLE 4 ABOUT HERE]

         Our test results reported above lead us to be reasonably confident that the effects

of sex composition in the second stage of our 2SLS models are due to their association

with additional fertility, and not to returns to scale or any other sex-composition related

effect (we could not test for sex composition effects in two sibling families since such a

measure would be collinear with the predicted value).5

         Another common problem with instrumental variables is the use of a weak

instrument—that is, one that is weakly correlated with the endogenous variable being

instrumented (Bound, Jaeger, and Baker 1995). The “partial” F-statistic for the

instrument in the current study’s first stage is 3046 – with a partial R2 of .005, which well

exceeds that of the weak instruments that Bound et al. report.




5
  It could be that the returns to scale matter non-monotonically; however, this is a far-fetched possibility.
Even if there are declining returns to scale, our safeguard should be effective as long as the returns to scale
for same sex siblings do not dip below zero (i.e. become negative). Our control for total sibship sex
composition could also be flawed if there exist significant interactions between birth order and sex
composition, but these appear equally unlikely, given previous evidence and lack of a strong theoretical
reason to expect them.



                                                                                                             12
Data and Variables

       Since the IV method is data demanding, this approach requires very large sample

sizes that most social surveys do not provide. The Census, by contrast, does have the

kind of power necessary for the analysis. For this paper, we use the 1990 five percent

Public Use Microdata Samples (PUMS). The frame is the following: we include mothers

with at least two children at home, the eldest of whom is less than 20 years of age.

Ideally, we would have adult respondents who have completed their education tell us

about their family composition growing up (with a minimum degree of measurement

error). However, using the Census, we have education data only on those individuals still

co-residing. Some adult children still reside with their parents, but this is a selective

subsample of the population. The solution to this problem is to focus on children who are

still living at home under the age of 20.

       Another constraint of using the Census is the fact that we must make assumptions

that the children in the household are all the children of the householders (and that the

householder does not have other children living elsewhere). To make this assumption

more reasonable, we limit the sample not only to those who have at least two children in

the household, but also to units where there are no children residing who are not the

biological child of the head of household, where there are the same number of children

currently residing in the home as the primary female adult has ever had (the primary

female adult is the wife of the householder, unmarried partner, or the female head), where

there are no subfamilies residing in the unit, and where there are no twins in the family.

While these decisions limit the generalizability of our findings to non-nuclear family




                                                                                             13
forms, they are necessary to make sure we are dealing with a clean measure of family

size.

        First, since we only have information about children still residing in the

household, we exclude cases in which the total number of children born to the adult

female (the householder or wife) differs from the number living there. For example, if

the female has grown children who have moved out of the house, we would not know the

sexes of these children and would not be able to properly compute our instrument.

Likewise, if the total number she has is fewer than those currently residing in the home,

then we would not know how to treat the extra children that may be the offspring of a

male householder—but not the “wife”—and who live in the unit now (since we would

not know when they moved in and what there relationship to sibship size is).

        Still, it could be the case that a woman has had four children from a previous

marriage, they have grown up and moved out and now she is residing with four children

of her new husband. We would have no way to distinguish this (albeit rare) possibility

from the case where they were her own children. The problem is not that they are her

stepchildren; it is that the male householder (whose children they are) may have had six

children and the two oldest are also grown up. We cannot know if these are all the

children he has ever had, since men are not asked about total fertility. We are fairly

certain that the number of cases where the number of step children a woman happens to

be living with matches exactly the number of her own previous children who do not live

with her. If any of her own children from a previous mate live with them, the household

is excluded since we keep only those households where all the children are the biological




                                                                                         14
children of the householder (her children would be step-children of the householder and

thus eliminated).

       Additionally, the presence of other relatives, non-relatives or subfamilies

complicates the issues around family size since family size and household size become

non-coterminous and the exact relationships of the various children residing in the unit

become unclear. We eliminate these units as well. Finally, we eliminate units where

there are twin children residing since the presence of twins complicates both the

assumptions about childbearing decisions and assumptions about the impact of additional

children on educational outcomes.



Dependent Variables:

       Private School Attendance: We want a measure of parental investment in the

education of offspring. So for children ages 6 through 18, who are currently enrolled in

school, we predict the likelihood of that child’s school being private as opposed to being

a public elementary or secondary school. In our analysis, private refers to both secular

and religious institutions. This measure represents an attempt to isolate the particular

financial impact of additional siblings on educational choices. This measure is also used

in other analyses as an indicator of differential parental financial investment in siblings.

Of course, paying private school tuition is just one way among many that parents can

invest in their children, but it is nonetheless an important financial measure. Also, while

it certainly may be the case that a particular private school may represent a worse

educational alternative than a particular public school, statistics suggest that children in

private schools typically receive more resources. For example, in 1990 (the year which




                                                                                               15
we study), the average pupil-to-teacher ratio in US elementary and secondary public

schools was 17.2 while it was 14.7 in private schools.6 Through Project Star, a random

assignment experiment in Tennessee, Krueger and Whitmore (2001) show that lower

class size has a positive effect on students’ test performances—particularly for black and

low income students.7 That said, however, the best evidence that exists about the effect

of private schooling on test scores (which is immune to selection bias problems) comes

from voucher experiments where some children who would not have otherwise been able

to afford to attend a private school were able to do so as a result of a voucher lottery.

When Alan Krueger and Pei Zhu compare the test scores of those who won the voucher

lottery with those who entered the lottery but did not receive a voucher, they find no

remarkable differences between the test scores of the two groups three years out from

baseline, challenging earlier claims (Krueger and Zhu 2003). Of course, test scores in

elementary school are not everything and attending private school may be more about

gaining social and cultural capital – i.e. useful connections and class confidence – that

translates into occupational and earnings success in later life. That said, as the

importance of human capital (i.e. formal education) has increased over the years, the

proportion of children attending private (high) school has also remained relatively stable,

fluctuating in the seven to ten percent range for most of the twentieth century (NCES

2001). The real change has been in the total proportion of students attending any high

school, which has increased steadily over time (NCES 2001).

  This difference represents a flip from the 1950s when public schools had lower student-to-teacher ratios
than private schools (26.9 to 31.7 for 1955); the cross over year was 1972. See, National Center for
Education Statistics. Digest of Education Statistics. 2001. Table 56: Enrollment in grades 9 to 12 in public
and private schools compared with population 14 to 17 years of age: 1889-90 to fall 2000.

 Although notably, there has been some debate over Project Star and class size effects, with Hanushek
(1999) finding no effects.


                                                                                                          16
       Held Back in School: This is ascertained by comparing a child’s age to the highest

grade that he or she has completed—for children currently enrolled in school. Since

birthday cut-offs may result in children starting late, we use a conservative estimate,

which underestimates the total number of children held back in school. For example, a

seven-year-old child must not have completed kindergarten in order to be classified as

“age inappropriate.” While a child could have completed kindergarten by age seven and

still have been held back, it is not possible for a child to be seven years old and not have

completed kindergarten unless they have been held back or taken out of school for some

reason. However, it is possible—though unlikely— for a six year old to have not

completed kindergarten, yet be “on track” with his or her schooling. This could occur if a

child was born early in the year, such that he or she enrolled in kindergarten when they

were 5.75 years old (in September of their fifth year of life), and his or her parent filled

out the Census long form after their sixth birthday, but before the end of the school year.

A further complication to this measure stems from the fact that the Census collapses

grades seven through ten into one category; so seventh, eighth and ninth graders may be

held back unbeknownst to researchers. This, too, results in an underestimation of the

proportion we deem “age inappropriate” for their level of schooling. Therefore, it comes

as no surprise to find that the percentage of Census children that receive this

classification is much smaller (0.7 percent) than the figure from the National Center for

Educational Statistics: 11.1 percent of the adult U.S. population in 1992 (NCES 1997).

Though this is more than an order of magnitude greater than the figure we find in the

Census, keep in mind several mitigating factors (besides the overly strict definition of

dropping out that we use). First, the larger figure includes dropouts as well as those who




                                                                                               17
completed school; meanwhile 25 percent of those held back drop out (compared to about

10 percent for those who have never been held back). By contrast, the measure used here

includes only those who are still enrolled in school (which is necessary to identify those

who are behind in their level of schooling as distinct from those who have simply

dropped out). Second, the NCES figure includes all cohorts of adults, not children, and

furthermore, is retrospective. That said, our measure vastly undercounts those who have

been held back. Even so, results are similar when a weaker standard for age

appropriateness is used.

       One final note with respect to the educational measures: The 1995 wave of the

PSID contains information regarding respondents’ attendance of private school during

their elementary and secondary schooling experience. This same wave also includes

information regarding whether a respondent has even been held back a grade. We linked

these responses to the sibling responses on other variables—hoping to see how the

Census-based measures of educational investment and performance related to other

outcomes, such as ultimate educational attainment or earnings. However, the number of

sibling sets who had valid responses on these variables and, further, who displayed

discordance on them (in order to contrast the difference with differences in outcome) was

too few to conclude anything about the effects of private schooling and being held back

on later outcomes. Even if these measures turn out not to be critical downstream, so to

speak, they still should be of importance to parents who are concerned with investing in

their children’s education and getting maximal academic performance out of their

children.




                                                                                          18
Independent Measures:

       Race and Hispanic Origin: We control for the race of the householder using two

dummy variables for “African American” race and for “other non-white race.” We also

construct a dummy variable for Hispanic origin, which is included as a separate question

in the Census.

       Parental Age, Nativity Status and Education: Family demographic measures

include the average age of the two parents, the nativity status of the parents (coded one if

either was foreign born) and the schooling of the father. Results using the mother’s

schooling, with or without the father’s, were the same.

       Household Income: This variable is logged to the base e in all analyses.

       Age and Sex of Child: Since the propensity to drop out of school or to be held

back increases with age, it is important to control for this variable. Also, the likelihood

of private or public school attendance may vary with age. Parental investment in private

schooling may vary by the sex of the child and the propensity of being held back a grade

does (with girls being less likely), so we control for the sex of the child as well.

       More than Two Children: In the traditional logistic regression analysis that we

present as a baseline, the key independent measure is an indicator variable, coded one if

the family has more than two children and zero if it has only two children.

       Same Sex, Eldest Two Children: This is our key instrumental variable for the first

stage regression. It is a dummy indicator, receiving a value of one if the eldest two

children in the household are of the same gender and zero if they are of different genders.

       Descriptive statistics for the various sub-samples used in this analysis, by

outcome and by birth order are presented in Tables 5 and 6, below; most variables display




                                                                                              19
mean values similar to other nationally representative reports. The exception to this is

due to our sampling constraint of nuclear families only; on their first marriage and living

with no extended kin, the proportion black is lower than national estimates by about half.

However, when models are limited to white, non-Hispanic families, results are consistent

with those including everyone.

                             [TABLES 5 & 6 ABOUT HERE]

Research Approach

       The strategy—as in most IV papers—is to first present estimates of the effect of

family size (specifically an indicator of the difference between two and three or more

siblings) using traditional OLS-like estimation techniques and then to contrast these with

the results from the instrumental variable approach. The first stage is calculated at the

family level, with each household providing a case. This approach is used since the

family is the proper unit of analysis for the prediction of having more than two children.

Predicted values from the first stage regression—which include the family level variables

(race, income, parental education, parental nativity status, and the instrument – the sex

composition of the first two children)—are then included in the second stage along with

the household and individual level predictors. These results are then compared to the

traditional estimates. A linear probability model is used at both stages, since Heckman

and Macurdy (1985) persuasively argue that this is the ideal specification when faced

with a set of simultaneous equations where the instrument, the variable being

instrumented for, and the ultimate dependent measure are dichotomous. Alternate

specifications, such as a two-stage probit model or using a log-linear approach in the

second stage, yield similar results.




                                                                                            20
Findings

       Table 7 presents the first results for the likelihood of attending private school; the

results in the first column come from a traditional logistic regression model (with

standard errors robust to clustering within families), where the key independent measure

is an indicator variable of whether or not a family has more than two children. The

effects of control variables are consistent with other findings; for example, higher

income, parental education, and parental age all result in a greater likelihood of

attendance to a private school. Immigrants are more likely to attend private school than

are native-born children; girls are more likely than boys; meanwhile older children are

less likely. Non-whites are less likely than their white counterparts to attend private

schooling; this holds for blacks and for “other” races.

       Surprisingly, children from families that have more than two children are more

likely to attend to private school. Children from families with mean values on the control

variable and which have only two children are 15.8 percent likely to attend private

school; those from families with three or more children are 16.2 percent likely to attend

private school. We attribute this positive effect to the association between Catholicism,

larger family size and a greater tendency to attend parochial school. However, since the

Census does not break out the non-public school category by religious or secular

orientation of the school, we are not able to test this suspicion.

       By contrast, when we instrument for having more than two children using the sex

mix approach, we find that the likelihood of attending private school is decreased in

families with three or more children as compared to families with only two children.




                                                                                            21
Column two of Table 7 reports coefficients from a linear probability model. Children

from families where there are three or more children have an estimated probability of

attending private school that is 3.2 percent less than children from families where there

are only two children. Given that attendance of private school is relatively rare to begin

with—only 12 percent of children in our sample attend private school—this 3.2 percent

decrease can be interpreted as a substantial deleterious effect of family size on children’s

educational achievement. Parameter estimates for other variables generally do not

change when we switch to a two-stage approach; however, a notable exception is the

coefficient for Hispanic families. The insignificant effect of Spanish origin in the

traditional model becomes significant—with an increased point estimate—in the IV

model. Given the overwhelmingly Catholic orientation of the Hispanic population in the

United States, this lends support—albeit circumstantial—that Catholic schooling,

religious orientation and its association with larger family size may have been driving the

positive effect of having more than two children in the traditional estimate of column

one.

                                [TABLE 7 ABOUT HERE]

       The next table, Table 8, performs the two-stage estimation for private school

attendance for children separated out by birth order. As in Table 7, coefficients reported

are from a linear probability model with standard errors adjusted for clustering within

families. Here, we find in column one that the effect of the transition from two to three

or more children is insignificant for first borns. By contrast, for later borns (of any parity

greater than one), it is significantly negative. For later borns, the estimated probability of

attending private school for children from families with three or more is 4.1 percent less




                                                                                            22
than the estimated probability of attending private school for children from families with

only two.

                                 [TABLE 8 ABOUT HERE]

        Turning to Table 9, we perform a similar exercise for the likelihood of being held

back a grade. Here we find in the traditional model that going from two to three or more

children is associated with a change from a 0.65 percent chance of being held back to a

0.75 percent chance. The 2SLS approach yields a larger coefficient; however, it is

insignificant. That changes when, in Table 10, we break out the held back analysis by

birth order as we did for the private school analysis. Here, the two-stage approach yields

similar results as the private school analysis did with respect to birth order. The

transition from two to three or more children does not appear significant for first borns.

However, it is significant for later borns and for second borns, specifically. For all later

borns, we find that reduction in the predicted probability of being held back for having

more than two children in the family is 2 percent. For second borns, the reduction in

predicted probability is greater – at almost 3 percent. Since being held back is a

relatively rare event as defined in this analysis, it is difficult to interpret the magnitude of

the difference; however, what bears noting is that the same pattern we saw for private

schooling with respect to family size and birth order bears out here as well: first borns are

spared the negative consequences while later children suffer from them.

Discussion




                                                                                              23
       Traditional OLS estimates of the effect of increased sibship size on the

educational outcomes of offspring clearly reflect at least two components: (1) the

unobserved differences between small and large families on characteristics that are

relevant to educational success (such as innate intelligence) and (2) the detrimental

effects of increased intra-family competition for resources (and perhaps a less cognitively

stimulating household environment). There may even be a third component if fertility

decisions are partially endogenous to child “quality”. Early OLS estimates neglected the

unobserved differences between small and large families (as well as any endogenous

component of fertility) and instead assumed that the association between sibship size and

outcomes was causal. More recently, fixed effects models may have gone too far the

other way: attributing all of the difference to underlying differences.

       The current paper has used a third method—instrumental variable, two-stage

estimation—to help adjudicate between these two bounds. Since the IV estimation

technique requires large sample sizes, we were unable to examine either the same

outcomes or use the same data that economists and sociologists have traditionally

deployed with respect to sibship size and education. Rather, we took advantage of the

large sample size provided by the US Census by measuring educational investments and

outcomes of offspring still living in the parental household. Based on a two-stage

estimation—using the sex mix of the eldest two children as an instrument to identify the

model—we conclude that going from a two child family to a family of three or more

children is indeed detrimental to the educational prospects of offspring, as measured by

the likelihood of attending private school and the likelihood of being held back a grade.

Though the differences in educational outcome probabilities between larger and smaller




                                                                                            24
families are relatively small in magnitude, when we consider these differences in relation

to events that have a low probability of occurring in the general population, their

magnitudes seem much more substantial. However, the deleterious consequences of

larger sibship size appear to affect the later born children and not the first-born children.

In terms of educational financing (i.e. attending private school), as additional children are

added, each seems to get less; but in terms of educational outcomes—i.e. likelihood of

being held back—it appears that being stuck in the middle is most detrimental.
