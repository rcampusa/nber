                                           ABSTRACT

Recent large-scale randomized experiments find that helping people form implementation
intentions by asking when and where they plan to act increases one-time actions, such as
vaccinations, preventative screenings and voting. We investigate the effect of a simple scalable
planning intervention on a repeated behavior using a randomized design involving 877 subjects at
a private gym. Subjects were randomized into i) a treatment group who selected the days and
times they intended to attend the gym over the next two weeks or ii) a control group who instead
recorded their days of exercise in the prior two weeks. In contrast to recent studies, we find that
the planning intervention did not have a positive effect on behavior and observe a tightly
estimated null effect. This lack of effect is despite the fact that the majority of subjects believe
that planning is helpful and despite clear evidence that they engaged with the planning process.

         Anyone who has made a routine visit to a dentist, pediatrician, or personal trainer is

accustomed to the “nudge” to set up the next appointment before leaving. “Nudges” are low-

cost interventions or manipulations of a choice environment aimed at influencing behavior in a

non-coercive way (Thaler and Sunstein, 2008). Since behavioral obstacles like inattention,

forgetfulness, and present bias often hamper engagement in optimal health behaviors, there is

great interest in the use of nudges to promote public health and help people achieve their desired

actions. For example, reminders sent by postcard, email, or SMS have been shown to increase

dental check-ups (Altmann and Traxler, 2014), gym attendance (Calzolari and Nardotto, 2016),

adherence to antiretroviral medication (Lester et al., 2010; Pop-Eleches et al., 2011), and child

vaccinations (Busso, Cristia and Humpage, 2015). Employees are significantly more likely to get

flu vaccinations if the clinic is located along their typical walking path (Beshears et al., 2016).

Different types of nudges have targeted healthy eating through menu placement (Downs et al.,

2009) and small incentives for healthy options (List and Samek 2015; Loewenstein, Volpp and

Price 2016). 1

         A prompt to create a concrete plan for action (i.e., a planning prompt or implementation

intention) is one particular pervasive nudge that is well-grounded in the psychology literature as

a way to reduce the gap between intentions and actions. (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006). 2 A

  Of course, not all nudge interventions are effective and it is important to conduct rigorous tests of their effects.
Two recent examples of field experiments testing nudge-tactics in health that found little effect of the nudges are
Bronchetti, Huffman, and Magenheim on flu vaccination on college campus and Goldzahl et al., (forthcoming) on
breast cancer screening rates in France. Bronchetti, Huffman, and Magenheim (2015) find no effect for two low-
cost nudges to increase flu vaccination on college campuses, and Goldzahl et al. (2017) find no effect of four
behavioral interventions to increase breast cancer screening rates in France.

planning prompt creates a mental association between engaging in a desired behavior and a

specific future moment that, in turn, can help people attain their goals (Gollwitzer, 1996 & 1999).

Simple, low-cost planning prompts have shown promise in large-scale field experiments targeting

flu vaccination (Milkman, Beshears, Laibson & Madrian, 2011) and preventive screenings

(Milkman, Beshears, Choi, Laibson & Madrian, 2013). Thus, the recent Behavioral Interventions

to Advance Self-Sufficiency (BIAS) project conducted by the Office of Planning, Research and

Evaluation included prompting people for implementation intentions as one of seven highlighted

and tested behavioral techniques for nudging change in human services (Richburg-Hayes,

Anzelone, Dechausay & Landers, 2017).

       While there is now strong evidence of planning interventions improving behavior for one-

time actions, there is little comparable evidence that simple and scalable planning interventions

are effective for important repeated actions. It may be more challenging to use implementation

intentions to change repeated behaviors than to change one-time behaviors for a variety of

reasons. First, people may have pre-established routines for repeated activities, and any concrete

plans they make for the future may be mere reflections of those routines, rather than

instruments for behavior change. Second, even if a concrete plan to act at a specific time does

increase the likelihood of acting at that time, it might do so by reducing the likelihood of acting

at an unplanned time. Third, the implementation intention cue may simply be less evocative for

repeatable activities because there are many opportunities to perform the behavior in question.

Consistent with this last concern, in Milkman et al.’s (2011) study, the effects of a planning

prompt for influenza vaccination were present in locations with only one vaccination day but not

in locations with multiple opportunities for vaccination.



                                                                                                 3
         We address the question of whether simple planning interventions are effective in

repeated-action settings for the case of physical activity. Exercise is a natural setting where

behavioral interventions may be attractive because the gap between intentions and behavior is

often quite large. For example, Royer, Stehr, and Sydnor (2015) document that workers’ targeted

levels of exercise are 43 percent higher than their actual levels of exercise. 3 We measure the

effect of a simple planning intervention on gym visits using a large-scale randomized experiment

with 877 members of a fitness facility. The treatment group was asked to make plans for which

specific days and times over the following two weeks they would attend the gym. The control

group was instead asked to recall the days and times in the prior two weeks when they had used

the gym.

         Our experimental design overcomes some key limitations found in prior research on

planning interventions for repeated behaviors like exercise (Hagger & Luszcynska, 2014). First,

our randomized and large-scale design overcomes the design issues inherent in much of the prior

literature. Nearly all of the existing research utilizes small-scale studies that are either not

randomized or involve tightly controlled but artificial environments. Second, our outcome

measure comes from administrative gym check-in records. Administrative data avoid the

potential biases associated with self-reports and also prevent problems of attrition that arise in

some studies where people are asked to self-report at multiple times. We also are able to

evaluate participant engagement with the planning intervention and assess how their plans

deviate from their actual behavior - a limitation of the prior literature (Carro & Gaudreau, 2013;

 Exercise targets may differ from exercise intentions, but finding physical activity studies measuring intentions and
actual behavior are difficult to find.


                                                                                                                   4
Hagger & Luszcynska, 2014). Third, this study tests the effect of a simple and potentially scalable

planning intervention – asking people to simply plan times for using the gym – in a relevant

environment.


       In contrast to the positive effects for health behaviors like flu shots and preventative

screenings, we find that being prompted to make plans did not cause people to attend the gym

more often. The planning-treatment group and the control group attended the gym equally often

on average over the two-week study period. The treatment group made an average of 2.3 visits

over the two-week period, compared to an average of 2.6 for the control group. This is a precise

null effect as the 95% confidence interval on our estimated treatment effect excludes an increase

in the average number of visits for the treatment group of more than 2%.


       Our results lend more clarity to the literature on the effect of planning interventions on

physical activity, which has previously found mixed results (Milne, Orbell & Sheeran, 2002;

Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006; Skar, Sniehotta, Gerard, Prestwich & Araujo-Soares, 2011; Handel &

Kolstad, 2017). Milne, Orbell & Sheeran (2002) present some of the strongest evidence of

positive effects of planning on physical activity, but notably in their experiment the planning

intervention focused subjects on planning to act once. More recent large-scale studies that

focused on planning for the possibility of repeated physical activity found no effect of the

intervention (Skar, Sniehotta, Gerard, Prestwich & Araujo-Soares, 2011; Handel & Kolstad, 2017).

The null effects in those studies, though, could be explained by relatively few people engaging

with the intervention or, in the case of Handel & Kolstad (2017), by the bundling of the planning

prompts with other interventions that could negate their effects. We build on this prior work by

providing clear and robust evidence that subjects in our experiment engaged in the planning


                                                                                                 5
intervention. For example, we document that subjects actively made plans for significantly more

visits than they had made in past weeks and more than they actually attended. Further, we show

that the plans made by the subjects in the planning treatment are in fact highly predictive of the

days when they actually attended the gym. This rules out the possibility that people haphazardly

selected plans with little attention to when they might actually use the gym. Instead, it suggests

that they planned to go on days where they were more likely to go, but that the act of planning

did not actually increase the number of days they visited. As such, the results here significantly

strengthen the evidence that a simple planning intervention for potentially repeated physical

activity may have little effect.




Method

            The primary research question for this experiment was pre-registered through the AEA

RCT registry (ID AEARCTR-0001214). 4 We attest here that we report results for all treatment

arms in and measures collected in the experiment. This study was approved by the institutional

review boards of Case Western Reserve University and of the University of California-Santa

Barbara.

            We recruited subjects who were members of a private gym in a large Midwestern city and

had participated in a prior survey on exercise behavior. The gym is affiliated with a nearby private

university but is open to the public and is separate from the university’s main student fitness

facility.

                                                                                                  6
       The recruitment pool of 1210 gym members was pre-randomized to receive a “planning”

(treatment) or “non-planning” (control) version of an online survey directly embedded within an

email. Subjects were informed in the email that they would receive a check for $20 for completing

the survey.


       Participants in the planning group were asked to “check off the time of your workout [..]

or select “no workout” if you don’t plan to work out that day” for each day in the 13 day period

starting the following Tuesday (the Monday was the Memorial Day holiday and the gym was

closed), May 31st through June 12th, 2016. The form showed a matrix of bubbles in which each

day corresponded to a separate row, and columns represented every hour in which the gym

would be open each day (6am to 11pm on weekdays and 8am to 9pm on weekends) as well as a

choice for “No Workout” (See Appendix Figure 1). Subjects were told that the information would

be used to create calendar invitations for each day/time that they planned to visit the gym, which

they could click on in the follow-up email to add to their online calendar (iCalendar, Outlook and

Google calendar were supported). They could also select a box to opt out of receiving this follow-

up email with calendar invites. We observe whether individuals opted out of receiving the follow-

up email, but do not observe whether the emailed calendar appointment invites were accepted

by participants.


       Participants in the non-planning (i.e., control) group saw a similar matrix of bubbles, but

for dates in the preceding two weeks. They were asked to “check off the time, as best you can

remember, that you worked out […] Select “no workout” if you didn’t work out that day.” This

ensured that the control group engaged in a similar activity focused on personal use of the gym,

but without an explicit prompt to plan future visits. For both online form surveys, subjects were


                                                                                                7
required to fill in a bubble for each day (indicating either a specific workout time or no workout)

in order to successfully submit the form. Both versions of the survey also contained the same

questions about personal experience with scheduling gym visits, use of calendars, and the

number of days the participant expected to be out of town in the next two weeks.

        The survey remained open for one week. Two weeks after the survey closing date, we

obtained visit data from the fitness center’s computerized log-in system, from five weeks prior

to the survey week to the weeks in which the treatment group members recorded their planned

visit days. We also obtained demographic data from the gym’s member database.

Descriptive Statistics


        A total of 877 members completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 72%. The

response rates were nearly identical in the treatment group (438/605) and the control group

(439/605). Table 1 displays summary statistics for the treatment (i.e., planning) group and the

control group for several pre-treatment characteristics. Consistent with random assignment, the

means are similar across the treatment and control groups. In both groups, approximately 60%

of participants are female and 56-60% are students. The average number of visits in the two-




                                                                                                 8
week pre-intervention period is close to 3, i.e., an average of 1.5 visits per week, and the average

participant expects to be out of town approximately 4 days during the treatment period.


        A priori, there is potential for a planning intervention to be effective, as over 60 percent

of the subject pool reported some agreement with the statement “I don't go to the gym as much

as I would like because I don’t set aside time for it in my schedule; then my schedule fills up and I

no longer have time to go to the gym.” and a similar fraction reported believing that planning

might help them attend the gym more often.5


        In order for planning to be effective, subjects must take it seriously. We can gauge this by

measuring the extent to which plans were associated with behavior. If subjects were filling out

our form as quickly as possible to earn the $20 incentive (i.e., at random), and little actual

planning were taking place, then their plans should not predict behavior. If, in contrast, subjects

were taking time to think about when they might like to go to the gym, then plans should predict

behavior.


        To this end, in Table 2a, we simply regress the number of visits on the number of planned

visits, with and without controlling for visit frequency in the pre-intervention period. Specifically,

the regression model in Column 1 relates the number of planned visits over the 2-week

intervention period to the number of actual visits during that same period. Overall, there is a

significant association between actual attendance and planned attendance. An extra planned

visit during the intervention period translates into an increase of 0.28 of a visit. While this

 Of the 60% of subjects who “Somewhat” or “Very much” agreed with the first statement, 75% answered “Yes” or
“Maybe” to the question “Do you think you would go to the gym more often if you planned one or two weeks ahead
about what days/times you would go to the gym?”


                                                                                                            9
estimate is positive and statistically significant, it is well below 1, meaning that not all plans are

fulfilled. Column 2 shows that recent pre-intervention gym attendance is in fact more predictive

than planned visits for behavior during the 2-week intervention period as both the estimated

coefficient and the R-squared increase considerably. This result raises the possibility that planned

visits may be predictive of intervention period visits only because they are associated with past

visits. Column 3 shows that this is not the case. When both variables are included, pre-

intervention attendance is more predictive of intervention visits than planned visits, but the

coefficient on an extra planned visit is still statistically significant and large. 6


         In Columns 1 and 2 of Table 2b, we examine the timing of visits more closely by studying

whether plans to go at a particular day or time are predictive of whether subjects go on that

specific day or time. The estimate in Column 1 implies that a plan to visit on a day is correlated

with a 21 percentage point increase in the probability of attending the gym on that day. Given a

mean attendance frequency of 0.18, this means that subjects are more than twice as likely to

attend the gym on planned days than on unplanned days. In Column 2 we add controls for the

fraction of days that the subject visited the gym on the same day during the two weeks prior to

the intervention. The inclusion of this past attendance variable controls for the possibility that

planning and attendance are correlated only because those who plan for more visits are more

frequent attendees of the gym. As in Table 2a, while past attendance patterns are associated

with gym visits over the 2 week intervention period, having a planned visit on a particular day is



6
 For these regressions and subsequent regressions, the results are robust to controlling for past attendance beyond
2 weeks prior to the intervention. Also, for the regressions in Table 2a, we can replace the number of visits in the 2
weeks before intervention variable with indicator variables for each possible number of visits (e.g., an indicator for
0 visits, an indicator for 1 visit, etc.) and the results are very similar.


                                                                                                                   10
still predictive of actual attendance in Column 2. Columns 3 and 4 provide an even more granular

analysis by studying the correlation between plans and behavior for a particular one-hour time

slot. The association is again statistically significant and large, even when accounting for past

attendance patterns.




Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Implementation Intentions

Regression Model

       We estimate “intent to treat” treatment effects, comparing those who were randomly

assigned to receive the planning treatment with those who were not, irrespective of whether

they made plans to go to the gym. For our main results (Table 3), we estimate the following OLS

regression:


                       𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 + 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖′ 𝜃𝜃 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖 ,


where 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖 is the total number of days a participant visited the gym during the 2-week (13

day) intervention period, PlanningTreatment is a binary indicator for the planning group, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖

includes the control variables age, gender, university affiliation, student, membership type, and

the number of days the individual visited the gym in the two-week pre-intervention period.




Regression Estimates


       The prior results show that the treatment group’s plans were predictive of the actual visit

patterns, strongly suggesting that the treatment group took the planning exercise seriously. In




                                                                                                          11
Table 3, we turn to our main results comparing the planning-treatment group to the control

group to assess whether the planning intervention had a causal effect on the total number of

gym visits during the 2-week intervention period. Column 1 reports a regression of the number

of visits on an indicator variable designating whether or not the subject was assigned to the

planning treatment. The regression coefficient implies that each member of the planning group

attended the gym 0.3 of a visit less than the non-planning group. This estimate is small and

precisely estimated. The 95 percent confidence interval ranges from -0.71 of a visit to 0.11 of a

visit. The upper bound of this confidence interval rules out positive impacts of planning exceeding

4.2 percent. The addition of control variables in Column 2 improves the statistical precision

slightly, such that the upper bound on the 95-percent confidence interval excludes a positive

effect of planning greater than 2 percent.


        The effects on the mean number of visits reported in Table 3 could conceivably mask

other important distributional impacts, such as a reduction in the fraction making zero visits. To

assess this possibility and to complement Table 3, we also display the distribution of visits for the

planning (treatment) group and the non-planning (control) group in Figure 1. 7 We find that the

histograms of visits are nearly identical for the treatment and control groups. The Wilcoxon rank

sum (Whitney Mann) test p-value is 0.8903, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis

of equivalent distributions.


        In Appendix Table 1 we report the results of several sensitivity analyses. We test whether

the effect of the planning intervention differed based on past frequency of gym visits, survey

 Note the total number of possible visits during the intervention period is 13 days because one day during the two-

                                                                                                                12
responses indicating failure to plan gym visits, the belief that planning would help, the number

of days during the planning period an individual expects to be out of town, and personal use of

an online calendar system that would allow for automated reminders of planned visits. We find

no evidence of positive planning effects for these subgroups.


       Figure 2 contrasts the visit patterns of the planning and no planning groups throughout

the course of the 2-week intervention. Each of the bars denotes the fraction going to the gym on

a particular date along with its 95% confidence interval. Consistent with the reported null result,

the attendance rates for the treatment and control group are similar for most days, with the

largest differences occurring during the weekends during which the attendance rates were

somewhat higher for the control group. A Kruskal-Wallis test of the equality of the histograms

gives a chi-squared (1) value of 1.22, and a p-value of 0.27, and thus we fail to reject equality.

Overall, our analysis lends limited support for the usefulness of planning prompts to influence

exercise behavior.




Discussion


       Recent large-scale field experiments have documented a significant effect of simple

implementation intention prompts on one-time behaviors such as obtaining influenza vaccines,

getting a colonoscopy, or voting. In this paper, we use a similar approach to test for the effect of

a simple planning prompt on a key repeated health behavior: exercise. By asking members of a

fitness center to plan the date and time of their visits to that center over the next two weeks, our

intervention met two key criteria—short time horizons and well-specified intentions—that are



                                                                                                 13
thought to increase the impact of implementation intentions (Sheeran & Orbell, 1999). Yet, in

contrast to the significant effects reported for one-time actions, we document a tightly estimated

null effect, ruling out positive effect sizes greater than 2%.

        Our results suggest that encouraging individuals to plan their gym visits over a 2-week

period had little, if any, influence on their actual rates of gym attendance. As we demonstrated

in Tables 2a and 2b, this is unlikely due to the plans not being meaningful, as plans are indeed

predictive of the days, times, and total quantity of gym visits made by participants. Moreover,

failure to make plans is not a possible explanation either, as 90% of treatment group subjects

made a plan to go on at least one day. Forgetfulness about plans is also unlikely to be an

explanation, since results were also not positive among the subset of participants using online

calendar systems, which allowed them to receive email reminders of scheduled visits (see

Appendix Table 1).

        One possible factor explaining these findings is our lack of a “pure” control group.

Specifically, the control group had to report their prior gym usage (done to keep the control and

treatment surveys comparable lengths). It is possible that the act of reporting past attendance

affected gym attendance and reduced the difference between the treatment and control groups’

behaviors. However, we see no evidence of this type of effect when we compare visit patterns

between the control group and other members who were in our recruitment pool but did not

respond to the survey. Specifically, we analyzed the number of gym visits made between the two

weeks preceding and following our survey for both of these groups and see very small and

statistically insignificant differences in the trajectory (i.e., difference in differences) of visit rates

across the control group and non-respondents. We conclude, therefore that neither participating



                                                                                                       14
in the study nor assignment to the planning group had any impact on changes in gym attendance

during the study period.

        One possible explanation for our results is that, as noted by Milkman et al.,

“implementation intentions prompts may be most effective at encouraging behaviors when the

opportunity for action is fleeting” (Milkman et al., 2011). Repeated behaviors like exercise,

however, are very unlikely to produce a feeling of urgency, since many individuals likely have the

mindset that they can always exercise “later.” Thus, even if the planning prompts succeed at

making certain times more salient as opportunities for gym attendance, individuals may

nevertheless choose not to act on those opportunities, perhaps because of psychological barriers

such as procrastination.8

        Another possibility is that many people may already have pre-established routines for

attending (or not attending) the gym. This would limit the efficacy of implementation intentions

prompts if they have a smaller effect on activities guided by strong habits (Webb et al, 2009).

And even if individuals do not have regular routines for attending the gym, they may still have

difficulty breaking routines for activities that they engage in instead of attending the gym.

Although previous work suggests that implementation intentions can “break the link” between

past and future behavior (Orbell et al., 1997), our findings do not support this hypothesis. For

participants in the planning group, past behavior remained a stronger predictor of future

behavior than their implementation intentions. Moreover, the intervention had no effect even

within the subsets of participants for whom we would expect to see the strongest effects: (i)




8
  Even if individuals were to visit the gym at the times made more salient by the planning prompts, overall gym
attendance may not increase if attendance at those times comes at the expense of attendance at other times.


                                                                                                            15
those who reported that they did not currently plan out their gym attendance and (ii) those who

thought that planning could help them visit more often (Appendix Table 1).

       There is also an important distinction between implementation-intention prompts for

one-time actions versus repeated actions. For one-time actions, implementation prompts simply

ask individuals to form an intention about when and where they will take an action that they

desire to complete. For some repeated behaviors, such as exercising at a gym, the added question

of how often is implicitly raised. Consistent with other studies showing that people are

overoptimistic about their future exercise patterns (Royer et al., 2015), we observe individuals

making considerably overambitious plans to visit the gym, with their total planned visits being

three times as large as their actual visits (7.04 vs. 2.33). If people are knowingly making ambitious

plans (i.e., planning to visit more often than they think is likely), then the mental association

created by each individual visit plan might be weaker than that of a one-time action plan.

Alternatively, if people are unaware that their plans are overambitious, then the gradual

realization that they are falling far short of their visit goals might be de-motivating (Heath et al.,

1999). Note that the question of how often is less relevant for some repeated behaviors that are

supposed to be carried out daily, such as daily vitamin intake, which has been studied in previous

work (Sheeran & Orbell, 1999).

       Although our study documents that a very simple planning exercise focused on planning

when to go to the gym was not effective, this evidence does not rule out that more elaborate

implementation-intention interventions could be effective.          In particular, it may be that

approaches that supplement simple when plans with plans involving how the action will be

accomplished and how barriers will be overcome could be a way forward for effectively



                                                                                                   16
promoting repeated physical activity in practical settings (Hagger & Luszczynska, 2014). Our

results imply that the promise of the simplest approach to implementation intentions suggested

by the recent field experiments on one-time actions does not extend easily to all domains, but

should not discourage future research on the use of implementation intentions for exercise and

other health behaviors that require sustained engagement over time.

       We hope that by documenting a stark contrast between the effects of simple planning

prompts on repeated versus one-time actions, this paper will motivate future research examining

the possible key differences between repeated and one-time behaviors that generate this

contrast in practical settings. Such research can shed new light on the pathways by which

implementation intentions influence human behavior, as well as the factors that mediate the gap

between people’s intentions and actions. We further hope that these results will support

continued research into the use of behaviorally informed interventions to improve health

behaviors.   Our findings highlight that simple behavioral interventions, while often quite

effective, do not work the same in all situations and need to be tested and refined for specific

applications in health.

Table notes: “Secondary on account” designates people who were added as partners of existing members at a discounted
rate. The p-value is for a test of equality of means between treatment and control group. For the non-dichotomous variables,
the numbers in brackets represent the standard deviations. ‡Age is missing for one member of the treatment group and one
member of the control group. I Don't Plan Out Gym Attendance was generated by asking subjects, "To what extent does the
following statement apply to you? I don't go to the gym as much as I would like because I don't set aside time for it in my
schedule; then my schedule fills up and I no longer have time to go to the gym." Planning Would Help Me was generated by
asking subjects, "Do you think you would go to the gym more often if you planned one or two weeks ahead about what
days/times you would go to the gym?".
