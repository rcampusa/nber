                                                 ABSTRACT




       This   paper analyzes the behas br of stock return volatility using daily data from 1885 through
1987. The October 1987 stock market crash was unusual in many ways          relative   to prior history. In

particular, stock volatility jumped dramaticallyduring and after the crash, but it returned to lower.
more normal levels quickly.    I   use data on implied volatilitiesfrom call option prices and estimates

of volatility from futures contracts on stock indexes to confirm this result.

I,   Introduction

         On October 19, 1987, the Standard      &   Poor's composite portfolio fell from 282.70 to 224.84,

or 20.4 percent.     This is the largest one day drop in the history of major stock market indexes from

February 1885 through the end of 1988. Followingthis drop, daily stockprices rose and fell by large
amounts during the next several weeks. Thus, the fall in stock prices was followedby a large increase
in stock volatility.

         This paper documentsthe behaviorof daily stock returns before, during and after the October

1987 crash.     It compares and contrasts the 1987 crash with previous crashes.       It also analyzes   the

behavior of prices for options on stock market portfolios and for futures contracts on the S&P 500,
These contingent claims contracts reinforce the conclusion that stock market volatility returned to
lower, more normal levels quickly following the 1987 crash. This is unusual relative to the evidence

from previous crashes.
         Section 2 summarizes some of the literature on time-varying stock volatility. Section             3

contains estimates     of the conditional standard deviations of daily stock returns from   1885-1987. It

shows that stock volatility was unusually high during the 1929-1934 and 1937-1938depressions, and

during the 1973-1974 OPEC recession. Section 4 comparesthe estimates of daily stock volatility from
the stock, options and futures markets during 1987- 1988. Section 5 summarizesthe empirical results

and relates these findings to the October 1987 stock market crash.

2. Review     of Previous Research
         Officer    {1973J shows   that aggregate stock volatility increased during the Great Depression,
as   did the volatility of money growth and industrial production. He also shows that stock volatilits
was at similar levels before the Depression as after. So it is difficult to credit the creation of the

Securitiesand Exchange Commission (S.E.C.) with the reduction in stockvolatility that occurred after
1939. Benston [1973] shows that the volatility of individual stocks, and particularly, the part                    of
volatility that is unrelated to general market movementt.did not decrease until well after the S.E.C.
began itt operations in October 1934. Like Officer, Benston concludesthat the activities of the S.E.C.
cannot be credited with lowering stock volatility. Schwert [1987] analyzes the relation of stock
volatility with real and nominal macroeconomic volatility, financial leverage,stock trading activity.
default risk, and firm profitability using monthly data from 1857-1986. Schwert [1989) shows that

monthly stock volatility was higher during recessions and following the major banking crises from
1834-1986 (also    tee Wilson. Svlla    and Jones [1988]). Moreover, he shows that the Federal Reserve

Board has raised margin requirementsfollowing decreases in stock volatility during the period from
1934-1987. There is not evidence that increases in margin requirements has e been followed by

reductions in volatility. French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] show that stock volatility is highly
persistent, and that on average unexpectedincreases in volatility are associated with negative stock
returns. They also show there is weak evidence that expected risk premiums are positively related
to expected stock volatility.

3.1 Extreme Changes in Stock Prices

        Table I lists the 50 largest increases and decreases in daily stock returns from February 16,
1885 through 1987. This sample includes 28.884 daily stock returns. From 1885 through 1927, luse

a compositeof the Dow Jones Industrial and Railroad Averages, weighted by the number of stocks
in each index (Dow Jones [1972]). From January 1928 to the present, I use the Standard & Poors

composite portfolio (90 stocks until March 1957, and 500 since that time -- see Standard & Poor's

[1986]). The Dow Jones portfolios are price-weighted, while the S&P portfolio is va1ue-weighted
neither includes dividends in the returns.1

         As mentioned at the beginningof the paper, October 19, 1987, is the largest one day percent

change in stock prices (-20.4 percent) Out of the sample of 28,884 observations. The next largest
change in stock prices occurred on March 15, 1933, when stock prices rose 16.6 percent following
the Federal Banking holiday. In perusing this list several patterns emerge. First, there are many
reversals, when large drops in stock prices have been followed by large increases in stock prices. For
example, the 1929 stock market crash represents the next two largest drops in stock prices, -12.3 and
-10.2 percent on October28 and 29. But the market reboundedon October30 with the second largest
one day gain in the sample, 12.5 percent. This is characteristic of an increase in stock market

volatility; that is, an increased chance of large stock returns of indeterminate sign. In fact, 29 of the
50 most negative returns and 36 of the 50 most positive returns occur in the October 1929—July 1934

period. The September 1937-September 1939 period accounts for 7 of the most negative and 5 of the
most positive returns. The week from October 19 through 26, 1987, accounts for 2                               of the   most

negative and 2 of the most positive returns. March 1907 accounts for I large and 1 small return. July
and August, 1893 contain I of the smallest and 2 of the largest returns, and May—November, 1940
contain 2 of the smallest and I of the largest returns. These brief episodes in stock market history
represent 89 percent of the extreme daily returns to aggregate stock portfolios. They are each
characterized by high levels of stock market volatility!
         Table 2 lists the 50 largest increases and decreases in monthlystock returns from January 1834

through the end of 1987. This represents 1,848 monthly stock returns. Schwert [19891 describes the
construction of this stock return series. Briefly, from 1834-1856 I use Smith and Cole's                              [19351

portfolio of industrial and railroad stocks. From 1857-1870                     1   use Macaulay's [1938] portfolio           of
railroad stocks. From 1871-1925             1   use the Cowles [1939] value—weighted portfolio               of New     York

Stock Exchange (NYSE) listed stocks. From 1926-1987                      I   use the Center for Research in Security

    2Cutter, Poterba and Summer. [1989] analyse large daily returns from 1928-87 to see whether they are related to specific
news events. They find that some, but not all of the large positive or negative returns occur at the some time as major news
stories. One reason that return volatility could increase is that the volatility of the 'informationenvironment' increase,.

Prices(CRSP) value-weighted portfolio of NYSE stocks. The latter two portfolios include dividends.
I use the dividend yields from the Cowles portfolio from 1871-1879 to estimate the yields from 1834-
1870.

           The results in Table 2 reinforce the conclusions drawn from Table 1. First, it is worth noting
that October 1987 is only the fourth lowest return in the 1834-1987 sample. The return for the
month is similar to the return on October            19,   implying that the large positive and negative returns
for the    rest   of the month net to zero.     Second, 17 out      of the 50 most negative and         12 Out    of the   50

most positive monthly returns are from 1929-1934. The 1937—1939 period includes 5                              of the most
negative and 5 of the most positive returns. One of the largest and one of the smallest returns come
from 1987. Again, a large proportion of both the largest and the smallest returns come from brief

subperiods in the overall 1834-1987 sample, This shows an increase in stock volatility during these
periods.
           The models in the next section provide a more structured analysis of the time series properties
of stock market volatility.

3.2 Autoregressive Models         for Dat/c Stock      Volatility, 1885-1987

           There are several stylized facts concerning stock return volatility. First, it                is   persistent, so
an increase in current volatility lasts for many             periods (see Poterba and Summers [1986], Schwert

[19871 and French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] for alternative estimates                        of   the persistence of

stock volatility). Second, stock volatility increases after stock prices fall (e.g., Black [19761, Christie

[1982], French, Schwert and Starnbaugh [19871 and Nelson [1988]). Third, stock volatility is related
to macroeconomic volatility, recessions and to banking crises (Officer [1973], Schwert [1987, 19891).

On the other hand, there are many competing parametric models to represent conditional

heteroskedasticityof stock returns! For this paper, I adopt a variation of the strategy followed by
French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987] and by Schwert [1989]. First, stock returns are regressed on
22 lagged returns (about one month) to estimate short-term movements in conditional expected

in mean returns (e.g., French          [19801     and Keim and Stambaugh [19841). The residuals from this

estimate the unexpected return on day                    t.       Following Schwert [19891, the absolute residual        Un

multiplied by the factor (lr/2)r estimates the standard deviation of the stock return in period t. This
estimator is unbiased if the conditional distribution of returns                    is   normal (hereafter, the absolute
residuals IuJ are multiplied by        (ir/2)). To estimate the conditional standard deviation of returns, I
estimate the regression,

where the dummy variable coefficients C measure the intercepts for different days of the week, and
the autoregressive coefficients              measure the persistenceof volatility.

        Table 3 contains estimates of equations (I) and (2) using the daily data from February 1885
through December 1987. Following Davidian and Carroll [19871, literate twice between equations
(1) and (2) to calculate weighted least squares estimates. The estimate of the equation for stock
returns (1) is consistent with prior research. The intercept for Monday                        is    reliably negative (-.13
percent per day), while the intercepts for the other days of the week are reliably positive.4 The
autoregressive coefficients are positive out to about two weeks (10 to 12 trading days), with the
largest estimate at lag I. The autocorrelation at lag I is often attributed to nonsynchronoustrading
of individual securities (Fisher [1966) and                    Scholes and Williams [1977)).           The sum of the 22

autoregressive coefficients is .18, with a t-statistic of 9.0. Thus, there                      is    a weak tendency for
movements in aggregate stock returns to persist. Despite the large t and F-statistics, the coefficient

of determination R2 is only .013, showing that most of the movements in daily stock returns are not

                                                                    7
explained by these factors.
         The estimate of the equatIon for stock volatility (2)               is also   consistent with prior research.
The intercept for Monday is higher than               for the other days of the          week, and the intercept         for

Saturday is lower. This shows that volatility is expected to be lower than average from the close of
trading on Friday to the close on Saturday. The negative intercept does not imply negative volatility
predictions. since there       is   much persistence in volatility. Saturday trading occurred from 1885

through May 1952, but it lasted for only a half day. Similarly,volatility is expected to be higher than
average from the close of trading on Friday (or Saturday, when there was Saturday trading) to the
close on Monday. This represents more calendar time. Both of these effects are seen by Keim and

Stambawgh [1984] using the daily S&P composite returns from 1928-1984.                              The autoregressive

coefficients are positive for all 22 lags, and many are more than                3   standard errors above zero. The

largest coefficientsoccur in the first 6 lags. The sum of the 22 autoregressivecoefficients is .69, with
a t-statistic of 52.2. The prediction model implied by (2) is                 a 22 period weighted average of the
absolutedeviations, adjusted for day-of-the-week seasonal effects.5 Thus, there isa strong tendency
for movements       in aggregate stock returns to persist. The coefficient of determination R2 is .237,

showing that movements in daily stock volatility are much more predictablethan movements in stock
returns,
         I have also estimated the model in equations (1) and (2) using 44 lagged returns and volatility
measures. The estimate of the return equation (1) is unaffected, in that the sum                     of the incremental
22 lag coefficients is .0063 with a t—statistic of .37. On the other hand, the sum                   of the    incremental

22 lag coefficients in equation (2) is .183 with a t—statistic of 6.45 (the sum for lags I through 44 is

.888). Thus, the persistence in conditional volatility is stronger than the results in Table 3 show.

note that stock volatility is negatively related to stock returns. In particular, an unexpected negative
return is associated with an unexpected increase in volatility. To represent the possible asymmetry
in the relation between stock returns aod stock volatility, I add lagged unexpected returns to the

volatility equation,

Negative correlation between lu) and            uNk is     evidence   of negative conditional skewness.           The prior

evidence suggests that these coefficients should be negative.
           There are two hypothesesthat predict such a negative relation. First, since she firms in the
market portfolio have financial leverage,a drop in the relative value of stocks versus bonds increases
the volatility of the stock (tee Christie 11912]). Second, if increases in predictable volatility increase
discount rates of future cash flows to stockholders,but not the expected cath flows, then unexpected
increases in volatility will cause a drop in stock prices (see,                     for example. Poterba and       Summers

[1986]).

t-statistic of 4.6), but the remaining 21 coefficients have random signs and most are less than 2
standard errors from 0. The sum of the 22 S's is .8045, with a t-statistic of                    .90.   Thus, there is weak
evidence that an increase in volatility increases the expected future return to stocks.

          Table 4b contains estimates of (3), the model relating stock volatility to lagged stock returns
and volatility. The day-of-the—week intercepts are similar to the estimates in Table 3.                                    The

coefficients 'y. measure the effect of lagged unexpected stock returns on stock volatility. The
coefficients from lags 1 to         11   are all negative, and most are more than 3 standard errors from 0. The
sum    of the 22        lag coefficients is -.46, with a t-statistic       of —6.49. The      sum  of the autoregressive
coefficients p is .8281, about 20 percent larger than the sum in Table 3,                      One interpretation of this

regression model is that volatility is related to lagged stockreturns. The coefficient of lagged positive
returns       is    p, while the coefficient for       lagged negative returns is ('i-p1).          Thus, there is strong
evidence that a large negative stock return increases predictions of future volatility more than an
equivalent positive return. This extends the earlier evidence on the asymmetricreaction of volatility
to return shocks.

3.4 Models           for Daily Stock [olwilitv Using High-Low Spreads
          Parkinsonjl980] and Garman and Klass (1980] create efficient estimators of the variance of
returns using extreme values of prices. Garman and Klass show that a variance estimator based on
the percentage (high-low) spread is                 oer 5 times   as efficient as the estimator based on daily stock

returns. They note, however, that infrequent trading biases downward the extreme values estimator
and would reduce its efficiency.
          I        got high, low and closing values of the S&P composite portfolio since 1980 from
COMPUSERVE.                I estimate the following model for daily stock returns,

      'Beckers 1983( finds that the high-low spread variance estimator doeshelp predict future close-to-close variance estimates
for individual stocks, although the improvementsare not as large as Garmari'Xlass analysis suggests.

                                                              13
where fn(H,/L,) is the percent spread for day t. The model for daily volatility uses lags of the spread,
of the   absolute errors JuI, and      of the errors u, from (5),

wherethe coefficients            measure the relation between past spreadsand current conditional volatility.

Table 5a contains estimates of the return equation (5). Table Sb contains estimates of the volatility
model (6). Both equations also include a dummy variable equal to 1 from January 1980 - December
i983, and 0 after 1984. Standard & Poor's changed the way they calculate the high-low values in
January 1984. A plot of the high-low spread for the S&P portfolio compared with the spread for the
Dow Jones industrial Average over the 1980-1988 period shows that S&P spreads drop noticeably at

that time.8 The dummy variable. SPDUM, adjusts for the change in the level of measured spreads
in 1984.
         The spread data do not help predict stock returns in Table                       Sa.   Only one of the spread
coefficient estimates. 2n' is more than two standard errors from 0, and the sum                             is   negative. If

spreads proxy for volatility, these coefficientsshould be positive. The estimates in Table Sa for the
1980—1987 sample are different from the estimatesfor the 1885-1987 sample in Tables 3 and 4a. For

example, while the intercept for Monday returns is negative, it is only + standard error from 0. The
autoregressivecoefficient at lag i, p = .09, is close to the value in Table 3 (.10). but the pattern of
negative coefficients after lag         10 results in    the sum of the 22 lags close to 0. The coefficients on

lagged volatility     S are larger than the estimates in Table 4a, and the sum for 22 lags is 9.6.
Nevertheless,the estimates are imprecise, so there                  is only weak   evidence that expected returns are
related to past volatility.
          Table Sb shows evidence that lagged spreads add significant information in predicting

volatility. The coefficient of the spread at lag I,              U,, is   almost 3 standard errors above 0. The sum



     °One possibility is that 5&P used the highest and lowest prices for each stock in the portfolio during the day to create
the high/low values for the portfolio prinr In 1954. Since 1984, it seemsthat they evaluate the value of the portfolio frequently
throughout the day. The latter prncedure matches the theory behind the Parkinson estimator, and is bound to produce a
smaller measured spread.

for 22 lags is .42, over 4 standard errors above 0. The coefficient on SPDUM                      is   reliably negative,
adjusting for the higher level of spreads in 1980-1983. Compared with Table 4b, the coefficients
on lagged values of u and       Iuj   are smaller and they have smaller t-statistics. The sum for 22 lags is
.098 for lu and -.105 for u. Again, volatility increases more following a large negative return than

following a large positive return, but the size           of the effect seems   to be smaller. Because the spread

containsless estimation error than lagged absolute residuals, it is not surprising that including lagged
spreads reduces the predictive ability of lagged absolute residuals.

3.5 Models    for Monthly Stock Volatility. 1885-1987
        One   disadvantageof the results in Tables 3, 4a and 4b is that it is difficult to graph so many
estimates of daily volatility.9 It      is   also difficult to determine the persistenceof volatility using high
order autoregressions,° Following French, Schwert and Stambaugh [1987),                       1   calculate the sample

standard deviation within each month from 1885- 1987. Next, I estimate an autoregressive model
for the standard deviation estimate for month m

When daily volatility changes slowly, this procedure is a useful approximation. The errors-tn-

variables problem stressed by Pagan and Ullah [1988) is reduced, since the monthly regressors Om,
contain less estimationerror than the daily regressors u). Table 6 contains estimates of the 12c order
autoregressive model for         Om.    including different monthly intercepts           a.       The coefficient of
determination R2 from the monthly model in Table 6 (.556) is much larger than from the daily model
in Table 3 (.237). The sum of the autoregressive coefficients from the monthly model                      (.898) is larger

  Figure 1   -- Estimates of Monlhl             Stock Return Volatility from Table 6, 1886-1987

        The number of stocks in the Dow Jones portfolio increases from 12 in 1885 to 50 by 1926.
Nevertheless, there are no obvious changes in the portfolio standard deviation in the months near
the changes. Moreover, the Dow Jones portfolio volatility is similar to the S&P portfolio volatility
in 1928. Thus, there       is   little reason to believe that the size or composition of the portfolio has
important effects on the time series behasior of volatility.10




    °There is also no signifinool change in volatility when the S&P portfolio expanded from 90 to 500 stocks n March 1957


                                                               19
        •:The most    notable episodes of high volatility are from 1929-1934, 1937-1938, 1946. 1973-
1974 and 1987. Officer [1973) and Schwert[1987) have documented that many macroeconomic time

series, such as the money growth rate and industrial production, were also more volatile during the
Great Depression (1929-l938). Nevertheless, as stressed by Schwert [l987J, the increase in
macroeconomic volatility is not large enough to explain all of the increase in stock market volatility

duringthis period. Schwert also shows shat changes in aggregate financial leverage following the
stock market crash of 1929 are too small to explain the sharp rise in stock volatility during the

Depression.

        Thus, the plot in Figure 1 confirms the analysis of Tables 1 and 2. Episodes of high stock
volatility in the past have occurred in a few briefspans of time. The plot also confirms the analysis
of Tables   3, 4b and Sb, that volatility is persistent. Once it rises, it usually remains high for many

months. As noted by Schwert [1989), many periods        of high volatility correspond to business cycle
recessions or crises in the banking system.

4. How Unusual Was the '87 Crash?


4.1 Daily S&P returns

         There are manyways to measure the extent to whichthe October 1987 crash and its aftermath
was unusual. One somewhat mechanical method is to add dummy variables to equations (3) and (4).

Two dummy variables:

         087   = 1,   from October 20-30, 1987, and 0 otherwise, and
         N87     1, from November2-30, 1987, and 0 otherwise,

are used to estimate the effects of the crash on returns and volatility. Table 7 contains estimates and
t—statistics for the dummy variable coefficients. The, autoregressive model    for returns predicts that
the large drop in stock prices on October 19 would persist for the next month. On the other hand,
the positive effect of lagged volatility on returns predicts higher than average returns after October
19.   The estimates in Table 7 say that stock returns were higher than predicted from October 20-30
relative to the model in equations (3) and (4). They are lower than predicted from November 2-30,

1987, Both   of these coefficient estimates         have t-statistics near 4 in absolute value. Since the October

dummy variable equals        I   for 9 days and the Novemberdummy variable equals I for 20 days, the net
effect of these   tto months on the S&P           index is close to zero,
        From Table 4b. the large drop in stock prices on October 19 predicts future volatility to be
much higher. The estimates of the October and Novembercoefficients for stock volatility are both

negative and several standard errors below 0. Thus, while volatility was high relative to its historical
average in the weeks after the October 1987 crash, it was below the prediction of the model for stock
returns and volatility in Tables 4a and 4b. In essence, the stock market returned to relatively normal
levels of volatility quickly at the end of 1987.
        Another way to tell whether the 1987 crash was unusual is to compare                        it to previous crashes,
Figure 2 plots the average absolute error from the estimate of equation (4j in Table 4b, uj, for the
10 most negative daily otock returno in Table I (excluding October 19, 1987) for 66 days (about 3

                     standard deviations)

This graph shows that volatility typicallydeclines after crashes, and that the October 1987 crash looks
like the average crash, except that it has a much larger value on day 0. It also seems that volatility
was lower before the October 1987 crash than for the average of the other crashes.

        Figure 3 is similar to Figure 2, except that it plots the predictionsfrom equation (3) in Table
4b. There are two notable differences between the October 1987 crash and the average crash. First,
the level of predicted volatility was lower in 1987 than for the average. Second, for the five days

after October 19, predicted volatility remained above the average for the other crashes. After that.
the conditional volatility of stock returns behaved like the average for previous crashes. Relative to
                                                                       19 than the evidence from the
pre—crash levels, stock volatility rose and fell faster around October

of stock return volatility that       is   consistent with the option prices.13       I   use the option whose exerctse

price is closest to the current stock price to calculate the implied volatility. Many studies have shown
that close-to-the-money option prices convey the most information about the expectations of the

options market concerning future volatility.14




         use an interest rate of 6 percent in these calculations. Since short—term interest rates were relatively stable during
this time period, using a   more accurate measure of the interest rate for each day would have little effect en the implied
volatility calculations. I use the yield on the S&tP portfolio 3.7 percent.

     '4Day and Lewis [tOSS]. t also calculated several average measures of implied votatility, averaging across options with
different exercise prices for a given maturity date, and none of these alternatives yielded substantially different results.
        Several things are clear from this graph. First, option traders' perceptions of stock volatility
did not rise until October 19, and they remained high for the next couple of months. The implied

standard deviation rose from less than .04 per month to over .09 per month on the 19. It decayed
back down to its pre-crash level by March 1988 and remained at that level throughout 1988.

4.3 Evidence front she Futures Market

       Arbitrage forces the price of the S&P futures contract to mimic the index. Therefore, it is
reasonable to expect the volatility of futures prices to be similar to the volatility of stock prices.
                                                                                          to 50
Nevertheless, Edwards [1988] shows that the variance of daily futures returns has been 40

percent larger than the variance of S&P stock returns since 1982 when these futures began trading.15
There are several reasons why this might occur. First, variation in the expected real return, or in the
dividend yield, to the S&P portfolio could explain some of this difference (although preliminary
calculations suggest these factors are unlikely to explain the extra variation in futures returns).

Second, becsuse not all stocks in the S&P portfolio trade at the end              of the day, the    measured stock

index smooths volatility of the 'true' value of the underlying stocks (e.g., Scholes and Williams

 1977]). Third, because transactionscosts are lower in futures markets, investors with macroeconomic
information are likely to trade in futures markets rather than the stock market. The extra volatility
in futures prices may reflect information that would not be worth trading on in the stock market.
                                                                                                     to
Arbitrage between futures and stock markets would prevent large disparities between prices
persist, but it would not prevent small short-run variations. Finally, 'speculation' or 'noise tradint'
in futures markets may induce extra volatility into futures prices (e.g., Shiller [1984], Black [1986]
and Summers [1986]).
          Futures prices reflect the value of the portfolio at a point in time. Thus, the intraday (high-

low) futures spread is probably a better measure           of volatility than the (high—low) spread for stocks.
If nothing else, there    is no problem of nonsynchronnus         trading. Thus, even though futures volatilits
is   larger than stock volatility, past volatility or spreads from futures may help predict stock return
volatility.
       Figure 6 plots three estimates of the volatility of the S&P portfolio:(i) the standard deviation
estimated from the most recent 21 daily (high-low) spreads for the S&P portfolio; (ii) the standard



      Iuturee returns, (n]F/F,1), measure the percent change in the futures price. Since there 15 nu net invessrncns in

volatility estimates from the futures market are similar to the estimates from the stock market,

5. Conclusions
         The stock market crash of October 19, 1987 has already been studied under a variety              of

microscopes. This paperfocuses on the effect of the 20 percent drop in stock prices on the volatility

of stock market returns.     In particular, it analyzes whether the behavior of daily returns before and

after the 1987 crash was unusual relative to the experience of over 100 years of daily data. While the
 1987 crash was the largest one day percentagechange in prices in over 28,000 observations, it was

also unusual in that stock market volatility returned to low pre-crash levels quickly.                  Two

comparisons support this conclusion. First, the prediction model             for stock volatility includes

significantnegative differential intercepts for the days from October20 through November30, 1987.
Second, compared with the next 10 most negative daily stock returns, volatility rose faster at the
time of the October 19 crash, and it fell faster afterwards.
       Evidence from the Options and futures markets also supports this conclusion. Estimates from
these markets from 1987—1988 show that stock volatility dropped to pre—crash levels by early 1988

and remained low. These data are only available for the last 6 years, so they cannot be used to study

prior crashes. Nevertheless,they provide more accurateestimates of volatility than the methods using
daily stock returns. When they are available,they corroborate the conclusionsfrom the much larger
         of stock returns. Moreover,data from option prices on British stocks          have the same pattern
sample
of stock volatility.
           This paper also estimates new models for the behavior of stock volatility. I parameterize the

 asymmetric reaction of volatility to negative returns using lagged return shocks along with lagged
 measures    of volatility. 1 also use lagged (high-low)spreads to help predict volatility when these data
 are available.
           Schwert [1987,   19891 shows that   stock volatility was higher during recessions and around the

 major banking panics in the 19h and early           20     centuries. In part, this   is an   example of the



                                                       28
asymmetryin the return-volatility relation. Negative returns lead to larger increases in volatility than
positive returns. Nevertheless, this historical evidence points Out another difference between the
1987 crash and earlier periods   of high   volatility. There has been no major crisis in the US. financial

system, and there has been no recession accompanying the 1987 crash.
        Instead of a microscope, the volatility plots in this paper can be thought of like an
electrocardiogram(ECG). They reflect the pulse of financial markets by measuring the rate of price
changes.   They show the risk borne by investors in the stock market, and where stock volatility
reflects uncertainty about more fundamentaleconomic aggregates (e.g., Schwert [19871), they provide
information about the health of the economy.
