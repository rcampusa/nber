                                               ABSTRACT

        Several recent studies have found that earnings inequality in Canada has grown considerably since
the late 1970's. Using an extraordinary data base drawn from longitudinal income tax records, we
decompose this growth in earnings inequality into its persistent and transitory components. We find that the
growth in earnings inequality reflects both an increase in long-run inequality and an increase in earnings
instability. The large size of our earnings panel allows us to estimate and test richer models of earnings
dynamics than could be supported by the relatively small panel surveys used in U.S. research. The
Canadian data strongly reject several restrictions commonly imposed in the U.S. literature, and they also
suggest that imposing these evidently false restrictions may lead to distorted inferences about earnings
dynamics and inequality trends.

            Earnings Dynamics and Inequality among Canadian Men, 1976-1992:

                         Evidence from Longitudinal Income Tax Records



                                              I. Introduction

        Scores of studies have documented the growth of earnings inequality in developed

Western economies since the late 1970's. Although a large proportion of this literature has

focused on the United States,' numerous studies have examined changes in Canada's earnings

distribution.2 The Canadian studies do not agree in every detail, but by and large they indicate

that earnings inequality has increased substantially, though perhaps not quite as dramatically as in

the United States. They also fmd that the return to education in Canada, unlike the return in the

United States, has increased little if at all. That is, the increase in Canadian earnings inequality has

occurred mainly within education groups, rather than between them. Another contrast with the

United States is that a larger share of Canada's growth in annual earnings inequality has arisen

from increased dispersion in annual work hours rather than in hourly wage rates.

        A few recent U.S. studies (Gottschalk and Moffitt, 1994; Moffitt and Gottschalk, 1995;

Buchinsky and Hunt, 1996; Gittleman and Joyce, 1996; Haider, 1998) have stressed the

importance of decomposing the growth in earnings inequality into persistent and transitory

components. On one hand, if the increase in earnings inequality has been driven mainly by a rise

in returns to education and other persistent worker attributes, then the observed increase in cross-

sectional inequality signifies increased inequality in long-run earnings. In this scenario, the

chronically rich have gotten richer and the chronically poor poorer. On the other hand, if the

increase in cross-sectional inequality has been driven mainly by a rise in the transitory component

of earnings variation, then long-run inequality may have increased very little. In this scenario, the

chronically rich have not gotten richer in the long run, and the chronically poor have not gotten

poorer, but there has been an increase in year-to-year "churning" through the ranks of the annual

earnings distribution.3 As it turns out, the message of the U.S. studies is that both components of

earnings inequality have increased. In Haider's words, "annual inequality increased because of

fairly equal increases of a persistent component and an instability component."4

        In this paper we make two contributions to the literature on earnings dynamics and

inequality trends. First, using almost two decades of longitudinal earnings information drawn

from income tax records, we decompose Canada's growth in earnings inequality into persistent

and transitory components. To what extent does Canada's increasing inequality reflect greater

year-to-year earnings fluctuation, and to what extent does it arise from an increased dispersion in

permanent earnings? Given the integration of the U.S. and Canadian economies, one might

expect to fmd the same answer as in the U.S. literature. The rise in long-run inequality in the

United States, however, has been tied to a large increase in the return to education, which has not

taken place in Canada. The Canadian experience need not be the same as the U.S. experience,

and any similarities and differences can be instructive about labor market developments in both

countries (as well as in other parts of the world).



  As noted by Haider, however, even purely transitory increases in earnings dispersion can have welfare costs. For
example, transitory earnings declines can force consumption reductions for liquidity-constrained individuals even
if their permanent earnings are unaffected.
 Another indication that persistent inequality has grown is the increased dispersion in consumption expenditures.
See Cutler and Katz (1992) and Attanasio and Davis (1996). Blundell and Preston (1998) present related evidence
for the United Kingdom.



                                                        2
        Second, we exploit our extraordinary data set to achieve some methodological advances.

The relatively small scale of the available U.S. panel surveys has forced U.S. researchers to rely

on simple models that impose economically implausible restrictions. Thanks to the much larger

sample size of our data set, we are able to estimate much richer models that nest the various

specifications used in the U.S. literature. We therefore are able to test the restrictions commonly

used in U.S. research, and we also can explore the sensitivity of substantive results to the

imposition of those restrictions. Our data strongly reject some of those restrictions, and they also

indicate that the imposition of those evidently false restrictions can distort substantive inferences

about the nature of earnings dynamics and the sources of changes in earnings inequality.

        In the next section, we provide a detailed description of our data base. In Section III, we

develop econometric models of earnings dynamics and discuss our estimation methods. Section

IV contains our empirical results, and Section V summarizes and discusses the main fmdings.



                                                   II .Data

A. Data Base

        The data base we use was developed by Statistics Canada from the T-4 Supplementary

Tax File maintained by Revenue Canada.5 This file is a one-percent random sample of all

individuals who received a T-4 supplementary tax form, and filed a tax return (a T- I form), in at

least one year between 1975 and 1993. T-4's are issued by employers for any earnings that

(1) exceed a certain annual threshold and/or (2) trigger income tax, contributions to Canada's

public pension plans, or unemployment insurance premiums.6 T-4's are analogous to the W-2



 The construction of the data base is described in Morissette and Berube (1996). Our description draws heavily on
this source.



                                                       3
forms issued by employers in the United States, and the T- 1 forms are the counterparts of the

ever-popular 1040 forms. The annual threshold (condition 1) was equal to $250 for the years

1975-1988 and $500 for 1989-1993. This provision likely superseded the requirements of

condition 2 in the vast majority of cases in which T-4's were issued over the sample period.7 To

obtain a sample which is consistent over time, we exclude all forms with annual earnings less than

$250 in 1975 dollars. The resulting threshold equals, for example, $645 in 1989 and $738 in

1993. Therefore, annual earnings is the sum of earnings from all jobs held by an individual in a

given year that paid at least $250 in 1975 constant dollars.

        This measure of earnings has several advantages over its counterparts in survey data and

other administrative files. Most importantly, it is based on employers' reports under the

provisions of the income tax laws. Therefore, the earnings variable should be free of the

measurement error often observed in survey data due to, for example, recall error, rounding error,

and top-coding. Also, missing values should be of limited concern to the extent that tax

compliance is widespread, or that evasion is more typically an individual (rather than employer)

infraction and/or involves other types of income. Note that, unlike other tax-file-based data, the

earnings measure is not obtained from tax returns (the T- 1 form). This is important as the

decision to file a return is not exogenous, and the incentives for doing so may change over time,

6
  The data include incorporated self-employed individuals who pay themselves a salary, but not other self-employed
workers. The self-employed presumably have more volatile earnings than most workers, and their share of the
Canadian work force has trended slightly upwards over our sample period. Our finding below that earnings
instability has increased in Canada is all the more striking in light of our failure to encompass all of the self-
employed.
 Income tax is deducted whenever an employee's annual income (earnings plus interest income, dividends, etc.)
exceeds his or her personal exemption. In most cases, the underlying annual earnings should be higher than the
current year's threshold. Public pension plan contributions are owed on earnings which exceed the year's basic
exemption, which ranged from $700 in 1975 up to $3500 in 1993. Finally, unemployment insurance contributions
are made whenever employment exceeds certain time (15 hours per week in 1993) or earnings ($149 per week in
1993) thresholds. It is possible that an individual could be issued a T-4 form for weekly work that triggered




                                                        4
which could introduce selection effects to the data.8 In the T-4 file, the only information taken

from T- 1 forms is the birth date and sex of the individual. To obtain this information, it is

necessary that he or she filed a tax return at least once in the sample period. While it would be

preferable to have data that are completely independent of an individual's decision to file a return,

this is a much weaker requirement than consecutive filing over the sample period.

        One limitation of the T-4 file is that, like most administrative data, it contains little

demographic information on individuals. For example, we do not know the educational

attainment of our sample members and therefore are unable to decompose earnings inequality into

the portions occurring within and between education categories. Instead, like most U.S. studies

that decompose the rise in earnings inequality into persistent and transitory components, we

consider changing returns to education as merely one aspect of change in persistent inequality.

Given the evidence that returns to education have not changed much in Canada, our inability to

isolate earnings differences between education categories is less important than it would be in the

U.S. context.

        The target group in our sample selection is males between the ages of 25 and 58. These

individuals will likely have already completed most of their schooling, and are too young to be

strongly affected by the trend to earlier retirement.9 In constructing our analysis sample, we

refine Haider's (1998) revolving balanced panel design to take advantage of the very large size of


unemployment insurance contributions even though annual earnings do not exceed the annual threshold ($250 or
$500). We expect that these cases are of limited importance.
8
 Of particular concern in the present context is the introduction during the late 1980's of the Goods and Services
Tax, which included a new refundable tax credit for low-income Canadians. In a study based on tax returns, such
as Beach and Finnie (1997), the resulting change in the population of return-filers could be confounded with
changes in the earnings distribution.
 There has been a strong increase in school enrollment among individuals 17-24 over this period (Morissette,
1997), which might affect our inference if we included younger males. Application for a public pension in
Canada can be. made as early as age 60.



                                                         5
the T-4 file. We begin by identifying the nineteen two-year birth cohorts who are between the

ages 24 and 59 for at least nine years in the period 1975 through 1993, and select all males who

had positive earnings in each year that the age requirement is met.'° We then discard the first and

last years of earnings for each individual. This is done to ensure that a consistent selection

criterion is applied to each year of positive earnings; that is, we only include years of positive

earnings which are bordered by years of positive earnings. The concern is that, without this

requirement, the earnings variances in the first and last years will be inflated by labor market

entry, retirement, or migration in or out of Canada. The end result is a balanced earnings panel

for each cohort, with the panel length varying across cohorts. Our overall analysis sample

contains 32,105 individuals, and the sample size for each cohort rivals the pooled sample sizes

available in common longitudinal data sets. Table 1 contains a summary of the cohorts/panels that

are included through this process.

        A fully balanced panel design is not appropriate for the current purpose because average

age and time will be perfectly collinear, and it will be difficult to separate the effects of age and

time on earnings inequality. Our inference is based on an aggregate panel in which the (balanced)

cohort panels are stacked. As is evident in the second column of Table 2, the age range in this

larger sample remains approximately constant over much of the sample period, thus breaking the

direct link between time and age, though the sample does age somewhat between 1976 and 1981

and again between 1987 and 1992.




  By requiring consecutive years of positive earnings, we lose individuals who have particularly long spells of
joblessness. Note, however, that individuals in our sample can have jobless spells up to 22 months long, depending
on how they fall across the calendar year. Also, because individuals are identified in the T-4 file by their Social
Insurance Number (SIN), we will lose track of a person if he changes his SIN in the sample period. This might
lead us to mistakenly infer that an individual leaves when this change takes place.



                                                        6
        An alternative approach would be to use an unbalanced sample design in which any years

of positive earnings for individuals satisfying the age requirements in the sample period would be

included. The obvious advantage here is that the resulting panel is more representative of

individuals with positive earnings at a point in time. In practice, however, unbalanced panels can

pose difficult estimation problems for the types of models used here." In addition, the various

sample moments for a given cohort are based on somewhat different samples, so that measured

changes over time may confound sample composition effects with true time and life-cycle

effects.'2 Our approach avoids those problems and still allows the separation of time and age

effects. Its most obvious shortcomings are the possible selection effects of focusing on

individuals with at least nine consecutive years of positive earnings, and that earnings covariances

of different orders are observable for different numbers of cohorts who, in turn, face different

selection criteria. For example, sixteenth-order covariances are observed only for the nine cohorts

born in 1934/35 through 1950/5 1. The individuals in these cohorts have nineteen consecutive

years of positive earnings. In contrast, first-order covariances are observed for all cohorts, which

include individuals who have as few as nine consecutive years of positive earnings. Some direct

evidence of how the aggregate balanced panel represents the target population of males aged 25

to 58 is provided in the next subsection.




  Moffitt and (3ottschalk (1995) provide evidence of the sorts of problems encountered with unbalanced panels in
this context.
12
  An obvious example is that the variances for years t and s would be based on different samples. A more subtle
example is that the variance in year t would be estimated on the basis of all individuals with positive earnings in
that year, but the estimated autocovariance between years t and s would be based on only those positive earners in
year t who also had positive earnings in year s.



                                                         7
B. Overview of Trends in Inequality

       In the third and fourth columns of Table 2, we present the sample size and variance of log

earnings for all the individuals in our pooled analysis sample. For example, in 1976 this includes

the selected individuals in cohorts born in 1924/25 through 1950/51. The variance shows a clear

upward trend over our sample period, and it displays substantial cyclical movements as well. To

recognize the latter, it helps to know that the Canadian labor market was fairly stable from 1976

through 1981, with annual unemployment rates ranging between 7.2 percent and 8.4 percent.

Unlike the United States, Canada did not experience a recession in 1980. It was hard hit by the

1982 recession, however, with unemployment rising to 11.0 percent in 1982 and 11.9 percent in

1983. Unemployment gradually receded afterwards, but leaped again to 10.4 percent in 1991 and

11.3 percent in 1992.

       The variance series in the fourth column is plotted as the solid line in Figure 1. The

variance rises by more than a third in the 1982 recession and then falls gradually in the expansion

of the late 1980's, although it never reaches its pre-recession levels. In the recession of the early

1990's, the variance rises again, this time to a new high. This time-series behavior of earnings

dispersion in our data set is altogether consistent with the patterns reported by the Canadian

studies cited in footnote 2. Most of those studies are based on Canada's Survey of Consumer

Finances (SCF), and it is reassuring that the SCF data and our data based on tax reports tell the

same story. The advantage of our data set is that, because of its longitudinal aspect, we will be

able to sort the trend toward greater earnings inequality into its persistent and transitory

components.

        In the remaining columns of Table 2, we provide some evidence of how the trends in our

revolving balanced panel represent the experience of our target population. In the fifth and sixth


                                                   8
columns, we present the sample sizes and variances of log earnings when we maintain the same

age ranges as in our analysis sample but include all individuals with positive earnings in a given

year. In many years, the sample size almost doubles, as do the variances. Next, in the seventh

and eighth columns, we examine the sample of individuals aged 25 to 58 who had positive

earnings in a given year. In this step we focus on a constant age interval, so the sample does not

age over time. While there are some minor discrepancies from the previous two columns, it is

clear that the requirement of positive earnings in consecutive years, rather than marginal aging

over time, accounts for the differences in the variances between our analysis sample and the

sample of all males aged 25 to 58.

        Our revolving balanced sample approach leads to smaller estimates of the variance of log

earnings, but they appear to be smaller than the variances in the other samples by a roughly fixed

factor of one-half. This suggests that the variances in the alternative samples may follow similar

patterns over time. This is important since our primary focus is on changes in earnings inequality

over time, rather than its absolute level. In Figure 1, we also graph the time pattern of variances

in our two comparison samples. As expected, they appear to shadow the variances in our analysis

sample. In fact, the correlation coefficient between the variances in our analysis sample and the

sample with the same age restrictions but all individuals with positive earnings is 0.957. Likewise,

the correlation coefficient between the variances in the analysis sample and the sample of

individuals 25-58 with positive earnings is O.943.' The primary discrepancy appears on a cyclical

basis, with the variance in the analysis sample growing relative to the variance in the larger

 samples during recessions. This pattern is unsurprising because lower earners


 13
    Furthermore, there is similar coherence in other moments. The correlation coefficients between mean log
 earnings in the analysis sample and the other two samples are 0.999 and 0.997 respectively.


                                                        9
presumably are especially prone to drop out of the unbalanced larger samples during recessions.'4

This sample composition effect dampens the countercydicality of earnings dispersion in the

unbalanced samples. In the analysis sample, which reduces the sample composition effect by

following the same workers over time, the true countercydicality of earnings dispersion is more

apparent.15

        Overall, although the level of earnings dispersion is much lower in the analysis sample, all

three samples show similar behavior over time. Where they differ the most, in their cyclical

amplitudes, the analysis sample probably provides a more accurate picture. At the least, it should

provide a useful depiction of earnings inequality among those men with relatively stable

employment careers.

        In Figures 2 and 3, we present some detail on how different age groups within our analysis

sample fared over the period. In Figure 2, we plot mean log earnings for five-year age categories,

normalizing each series to equal 1 in 1979 to provide a common basis of comparison across the

series of different lengths. For example, as documented in the second column of Table 2, the

complete age group 26-30 is visible in the analysis sample only between 1976 and 1987, while the

age group 5 1-55 is visible only from 1979 to 1992. Mean log earnings for the different groups

moves in tandem up until 1982, but then we observe divergence. For example, by 1987 (the last

year for the 26-to-30-year-olds) the difference in average log earnings between 46-to-50-year-

olds and 26-to-30-year-olds has increased roughly 2.1 percent over its level in 1979. Further

Parker (1994).
15
  The U.S. evidence discussed in Solon, Barsky, and Parker (1994) suggests that the countercyclicality of
dispersion in annual earnings arises mainly from countercyclicality in the dispersion of annual hours, rather than
in the dispersion of hourly wage rates. We are not aware of Canadian evidence on this point.



                                                        10
changes are observed in the late 1980's and early 1990's. The difference in log earnings between

3l-to-35-year- olds and 46-to-50-year-olds is up 1.2 percent in 1987 and 2.6 percent by 1992.

        In Figure 3, we provide complementary information about the variance of log earnings.

Again we normalize each series to equal 1 in 1979. Corresponding to the effects of the recession

on the means, there is a sharp increase in the variances in 1982 which is particularly severe for

younger workers. In 1983, the variance for 26-to-30-year- olds is up 80 percent over its level in

1979, while the increase for older workers is on the order of 25 to 30 percent. The recession of

the early 1990's also has the greatest effect on the young. Between 1989 and 1992, the increases

in the variances for 31-to-35-year-olds and 36-to-40-year-olds are 68 percent and 42 percent

respectively. In contrast, the increase over the same period is 29 percent for 41-to-45-year-olds,

37 percent for 46-to-50-year-olds, and 4 percent for 50-to-55-year-olds.

        One previous study, by Morissette and Berube (1996), has used the same tax data we use

to generate preliminary evidence on the extent to which the growth in annual earnings inequality

reflects an increase in persistent inequality. To get a measure of persistent inequality, Morissette

and Berube take a sample of workers within each of a variety of age ranges as of 1975, they sum

the workers' earnings over the 1975-1984 period, and then they calculate several dispersion

measures for the ten-year earnings total.16 Then they perform the same exercise for the 1984-

1993 earnings total and compare the dispersion measures between the two ten-year periods. For

example, for men ages 35-44 as of 1975, the coefficient of variation in the 1975-1984 total of

earnings is 0.5 12. For men 35-44 as of 1984, the coefficient of variation in the 1984-1993




16
  Surprisingly, Morissette and Berube base their tabulated results on total nominal earnings with no discounting.
They report in a footnote, however, that they obtain qualitatively similar results for real earnings discounted
annually by 3 or 7 percent.


                                                        11
earnings total is 12 percent higher at 0.573. Regardless of age range or dispersion measure,

Morissette and Berube find greater dispersion in the later period.

       Morissette and Berube's evidence strongly suggests that the persistent component of

earnings variation did increase between 1975-1984 and 1984-1993, but this fmding leaves some

important questions unanswered. First, a comparison of two ten-year periods does not pinpoint

the timing of the increase in persistent earnings inequality, and this creates some ambiguity in how

to interpret the comparison. For example, to what extent does the difference between periods

reflect a secular trend or a difference in business cycle conditions? As Morissette and Berube

acknowledge, "Since the unemployment rates observed since the mid-eighties were higher than

those of the mid-seventies, one possibility is that the increase in long-term inequality that we

found simply reflects a cyclical effect. Because we have been comparing two periods and thus

have been using only two observations, we have been unable to control for such an effect."

Second, their evidence does not provide a direct indication of whether (or when) the transitory

component of earnings variation also increased. The remainder of our paper develops and

estimates models designed to answer these questions.



                        III. Econometric Models and Estimation Methods

A. Models

        Earnings dynamics and their implications for the connection between current and lifetime

income have long been of central concern in numerous areas of economic research. Research on

the distinction between the inequality observed in annual cross-sections of earnings and inequality

in long-run earnings is just one such area. Another classic example is the research, going back at

least to Friedman (1957), on the difference in the response of consumption to changes in


                                                  12
transitory versus permanent income. Still another example is the recent research showing that the

intergenerational correlation in earnings appears far greater for long-run measures of earnings

than it does for single-year measures (Solon, forthcoming).

        Because of its recurring importance in many research areas, earnings mobility has been the

subject of a voluminous empirical literature.'7 To explain the connection between the models in

the literature and the models estimated in this paper, we will begin with a rudimentary version of

the canonical variance-components models of earnings dynamics and then embellish it in order to

allow for changes over time in both the persistent and transitory components of earnings

variation.

        Let bt    denote the log earnings in year t of the th sample member born in year b. Then


(1)      1bt—PbtYbt

expresses 1bt as   the cohort-specific mean           in year t plus an individual-specific deviation

from that mean. Most previous studies of earnings dynamics have attempted to partial out p

with preliminary regression adjustments for year and age (or experience) effects and then have

estimated models for the dynamics of y,,,. By doing so, they have characterized both the cross-

sectional variance and the year-to-year mobility in relative earnings within a cohort.

        A stripped-down version of the commonly used models for y is

(2)          = a + v,

   See Atkinson, Bourguignon, and Morrisson (1992) for an elegant survey of the literature up through most of the
1980's. See Baker (1997) and Haider (1998) for more recent analyses and for references to other studies since the
late 1980's. Aside from the study by Beach and Finnie (1997) cited in footnote 8, the only other study of Canadian
earnings dynamics of which we are aware is Kennedy (1989), which uses a small sample of earnings histories
drawn from a Canada Pension Plan administrative file. Kennedy does not explore how the transitory and
persistent components of earnings variation have changed over time.



                                                        13
where the permanent earnings component alb has population variance a , the transitory

component VIb, has variance a and is serially uncorrelated, and alb and VIb, are orthogonal to

each other. A nice feature of this exceedingly simple model is that it provides a clear

representation of the distinction between inequality in current and permanent earnings. The

variance in current relative earnings YIb,

(3)        Var(ylb,) =      +

which exceeds a, the variance in the permanent component of earnings, by a, the variance of

transitory earnings.'8

          This rudimentary model, however, possesses several weaknesses that render it

inappropriate for our purposes. To begin with, it does not allow for changes in earnings

inequality over time. Following Katz (1994), Moffitt and (ottschalk (1995), and Haider (1998),

a simple way to incorporate such changes is with the enhanced model

(4)            = p,alb +

where p, and .X, are the respective year-specific factor loadings on the permanent and transitory

components of relative earnings. Then the variance of y, becomes

(5)        Var(y,) =            +

As this expression shows, an increase in either factor loading generates increased dispersion in

current earnings. The character of the change in inequality, however, depends critically on which

factor changes. A rise in p, increases inequality in long-run earnings as well as in current

earnings. The relative advantage of workers with chronically high earnings increases, as does the


18
     The predominant role of C, in long-run earnings inequality is demonstrated for a more general model in Solon
(1999).


                                                        14
relative disadvantage of those with chronically low earnings. On the other hand, if A1 increases

without any change in Pt' inequality in current earnings rises because of an increase in year-to-

year volatility, but there is no increase in the variance of the permanent component of earnings.

       Since an increase in either factor loading increases the variance of Yjbt' variances by

themselves cannot identify which component of inequality has changed. What does identify the

source of the increased cross-sectional inequality is changes in observed autocovariances. In an

era when p rises to a higher level, the autocovariances grow along with the variances. Indeed, if

Pt increases without a change in A, the autocovariances grow in greater proportion than the

variances, so the autocorrelations increase. In other words, the increase in cross-sectional

inequality is accompanied by a decrease in mobility. In contrast, if A? increases without a change

in Pt' the rise in variances is not accompanied by a rise in autocovariances, and the

autocorrelations decline. Although this point is particularly clear in the context of the model in

equation (4), it does extend to more complex models. Heuristically, an increase in p1 preserves

the order of individuals in the earnings distribution, but spreads them out further, and this greater

spread persists from year to year. An increase in A leads to more scrambling of individuals'

order in the annual earnings distribution, and the scrambling gets redone every year.

       Although the model in equation (4) does incorporate changes in both the persistent and

transitory components of earnings inequality, it stifi overlooks several important features of

earnings dynamics that have been documented in the previous literature. First, several studies

have found evidence of persistent heterogeneity across individuals not only in their levels of




                                                  15
earnings, but in their growth rates.19 Second, some earnings shocks have permanent effects,2° and

some of the more recent literature on earnings dynamics has modeled such earnings variation with

a random-walk component (MaCurdy, 1982; Abowd and Card, 1989; Moffitt and Gottscha]k,

1995). Third, most studies have found that the transitory component is serially correlated.

Fourth, several studies have found that the variance of the transitory component is a U-shaped

function of age or experience.2'

        A generalization of equation (4) that encompasses these aspects of earnings dynamics is

(6)     Yibt = p1[a1 +Iiib(t—b—26)+uIb(]+E,bt

where

(7)     Ubt    14ibt1   + r,,,

(8)     E1b = ,°ibt—1 +

and

(9)     Var(vb) = y +y,(t—b—26)+y2(t —b—26)2 +y3(t—b— 26) +y4(t—b-- 26).

We wifi refer to the model in equations (6)-(9) as our "base model." In equation (6), I3jb is the

deviation of the individual's idiosyncratic earnings growth rate from the average growth rate of

his cohort (which already was subsumed in the ,Ubt term in equation (1)). This individual-specific

growth rate J3b is expressed as a coefficient of years since age 26, so the variance in the

individual-specific intercept alb reflects variance across individuals' earnings profiles as of age


'° See Baker (1997) and the references therein. This finding of growth heterogeneity is to be expected, since the
sources of life-cycle earnings growth -- such as human capital investment and schemes to elicit work effort --
presumably do vary across individuals.
20 One good example is the earnings losses suffered by displaced workers. See Jacobson, LaLonde, and Sullivan
(1993) and Stevens (1997). Another example, stressed by Farber and Gibbons (1996), is the wage impact of the
arrival of new information about workers' productivities.
21 See Gordon (1984), for example.



                                                        16
26, and the variance in         influences how the variance across earnings profiles evolves after age


26. We will denote the variance of $,,        as       and the covariance between a and f3              as   a.
If workers' choices about human capital investment involve trade-offs between early earnings

levels and opportunities for subsequent earnings growth, o may be negative (Mincer, 1974;

Lifiard and Weiss, 1979; Hause, 1980).

          In equation (7), which specifies a random-walk component in earnings growth after age

26,22 r is a "white noise" innovation with variance a,. The random-walk innovation ,,

unlike the transitory innovation VIb: in equation (8), accommodates any permanent re-ordering of

workers in the earnings distribution. One way to distinguish the random-walk component from

the heterogeneous-growth component is that the former implies that the cross-sectional log

earnings variances should rise linearly over the life cycle, while the latter implies a quadratic

pattern. Equation (8) incorporates serial correlation of the transitory component via a first-order

autoregressive process generalized to include year-specific factor loadings on the innovation VIb,.

This specification assumes that, if year t is a year with unusually large innovations in the

transitory earnings component (e.g., a recession year), the impact on the transitory variance in

subsequent years dies out gradually. In addition, equation (9) allows the variance of va,, to be a

quartic function of age.23

          While this model imposes a great deal of structure on earnings dynamics, it significantly

generalizes previous models by allowing for multiple sources of nonstationarity (with respect to


22
     Any such growth up through age 26 is subsumed in the a,b term.
23
  While lower-order polynomials are sufficient in some of the models we estimate, the quartic is adopted for
comparability across specifications. We also have tried extending our AR(l) specification in equation (8) to an
ARMA(1,1) specification. See the discussion in footnote 24.



                                                        17
both calendar time and stage of life cycle). Like the models of Moffitt and Gottschalk (1995) and

Haider (1998), it goes beyond earlier models by allowing for changes over calendar time in both

the persistent and transitory components of earnings inequality. The model also extends Haider's

by incorporating age-related heteroskedasticity of the transitory variance and a random-walk

component. Relative to Moffitt and Gottschalk's preferred model, it adds both age variation in

the transitory variance and heterogeneity in growth rates. Because previous researchers have had

to rely on U.S. panel surveys with relatively small sample sizes, they have been unable to identify

models with many sources of nonstationarity, and they therefore have had to make arbitrary

choices about which varieties to include. For example, they have included either a random walk

or heterogeneous growth, but not both. Our access to a large sample observed over many years

enables us to identify richer models and to examine empirically which sources of nonstationarity

play important roles in the earnings process. Consequently, in addition to generating evidence

about the nature of growing earnings inequality in Canada, our study also responds to Atkinson,

Bourguignon, and Morrisson's (1992) comment that distinguishing among competing models of

earnings mobility "is important and tests of alternative specifications should be conducted.

However, we have found few tests of that type in the literature we have reviewed."



B. Estimation Methods

       We begin by estimating p in equation (1) with the sample mean log earnings for cohort

b in year t. We then treat the deviation of observed log earnings 1 from that mean as our

measure of yth, This simple "de-meaning" procedure adjusts for year, age, and cohort effects on

average earnings in a less restrictive way than the preliminary regressions typically used, which




                                                 18
assume that the age and cohort patterns within any year can be well approximated by a low-order

polynomial in age or experience.

       Next, for each of our nineteen sample cohorts (born 1924/25 through 1960/61), we

construct the sample autocovariance matrix of y. For the nine cohorts observed for the entire

1976-1992 sample period, these are 17x 17 matrices; the matrices for the other cohorts have

smaller dimensions. (At the beginning of Section IV, we will display and discuss these matrices

for a few selected cohorts.) Then we list the distinct elements of the sample autocovariance

matrix for cohort b in a vector Cb, which contains 153=(17 x 18)/2 elements for each of the nine

cohorts observed for the full sample period and fewer elements for the others. For purposes of

standard error estimation, we also construct the matrix of fourth sample moments for each cohort.

       We stack the nineteen Cb vectors into an aggregate vector C, which contains a total of

2077 sample moments. These are the data to which we fit the model of earnings dynamics

described above. We estimate the model's parameters by generalized method-of-moments

(GMM); that is, by minimizing the distance between the observed sample moments in C and the

corresponding population moments implied by our model.

       In particular, write the population analog to C as C * and express our model's moment

                    f
restrictions as C = (0) where 0 is the vector containing all the parameters in our model. For

example, our model in equations (6)-(9) implies that one element in c *, the variance of th, in

1986 for the cohort born in 1950/1951, is



(10)   Var(y19501511986) = P9s6 (cr   + 100o + 20aap + 10a) + p2Var(E1195015985)

                              + '986 ('0 + by1 + lOOy2 + 100073 + lO,000y4)

where 10 and its multiples appear because we count this cohort as 10 years past age 26 in 1986.



                                                 19
        As ugly as this expression is, writing it out here serves at least two purposes. First, its

complexity makes clear why we are not writing out the rest of the moments! Second, the

dependence of the cohort's overall 1986 variance on its transitory variance in 1985 ifiustrates that

the autoregressive process in equation (8) induces a recursive structure in the moments. If one

traces the recursion back to the first year of the cohort's sample period (in this instance 1976),

this raises the question of what the cohort's transitory variance is in that year. In the previous

literature on earnings dynamics, it has been common to restrict the initial transitory variance to be

the same for individuals of different ages. In our richer model, which recognizes that earnings

volatility varies across cohorts because they are at different stages of the life cycle and have lived

through different times, this restriction becomes untenable. We therefore treat the initial

transitory variances of the nineteen cohorts as nineteen additional parameters to be estimated.24

                       f
        Once C* = (9) is specified, then GMM chooses 0 to minimize a distance function

(11)     D={C—f(&)]'W{C—f(O)J

where W is a positive defmite weighting matrix. The asymptotically optimal choice of W is the

inverse of a matrix that consistently estimates the covariance matrix of C. As explained by

A]tonii and Segal (1996) and Clark (1996), however, this approach can produce seriously biased

estimates of 9 in finite samples. We therefore follow the practice of the most recent literature

and use the identity matrix as the weighting matrix. This approach, often called "equally weighted

minimum distance estimation," just amounts to using nonlinear least squares to fit f (0) to C.


24 These cohort effects turn out to be important to the specification of the other parts of the transitory component.
An ARMA( 1,1) extension of equation (8) can be supported if the cohort effects are treated symmetrically in the
persistent and transitory components; that is, if the model either excludes or includes cohort effects in both
components. In a model such as equations (6)-(9), where the cohort effects appear in only one component, the
ARMA specification either clues not converge or converges to a solution with negative estimates of some variance




                                                          20
Finally, we use standard methods for estimating the covariance matrix of 6 on the basis of the

fourth moments in the sample.25



                                                  IV. Results

        In lieu of deluging the reader with all 2077 sample moments, in Tables 3 and 4 we display

the sample autocovariance matrices for just the cohorts born in 1926/27, 1942/43, and 1958/59.

For all three cohorts (as well as the other sixteen not shown), the autocorrelation patterns in the

upper right triangles of the matrices are similar to those reported in U.S. studies based on the

Panel Study of Income Dynamics. Like Baker (1997) and Haider (1998), we fmd

autocorrelations of around 0.8 at the first order, followed by gradual declines at higher orders.26

        Because these three cohorts are at different stages of the life cycle during our 1976-1992

sample period, they illustrate important life-cycle patterns in earnings dynamics as well as some

salient trends and cyclical patterns. The 1958/59 cohort, which is in its mid twenties in its first

years in the sample, initially shows very large variances (on the main diagonal), which

subsequently decline as the cohort settles into its mature career path. The lower autocorrelations

displayed by this young cohort suggest that its higher variances are driven at least partly by high

transitory variation. At the other end of the life cycle, the 1926/27 cohort shows rising variances

as it approaches retirement age during its last years in the sample. These obvious patterns suggest

the importance of including age-varying parameters in econometric models of earnings dynamics.


terms. Consistent with the evidence in Raider (1998), we find that our decompositions are not sensitive to the
choice of this part of the model.
25 See Chamberlain (1984) for a general discussion of GMM estimation and inference, and see the appendix to
Abowd and Card (1989) for a detailed application to earnings dynamics models.
26 We also have calculated sample autocovariance matrices for the first difference of y. These show
autocorrelation patterns quite similar to those reported in Abowd and Card (1989) and Baker (1997).



                                                        21
       The year effects apparent in these matrices echo the patterns already discussed in

connection with Table 2 and Figures 1 and 3. The sample variances rise dramatically with the

1982 recession and then recede a little in the late 1980's before rising to new heights during the

recession of the early 1990's. The upper-right triangles of the matrices display one more pattern

not visible in the earlier tables and figures -- there is not a striking secular trend in the

autocorrelations. As explained in Section III, an increase in only the transitory variance

component would cause the autocorrelations to decline, and an increase in only the persistent

component would make them rise. A complete absence of trend in the autocorrelations would

signify that the transitory and persistent components grew in equal proportions. Although the

autocorrelation trend is not strong enough to be visible to the naked eye, a subtle trend may be

present. Pooling all the autocorrelations for all cohorts and years, we have performed least

squares estimation of the regression of the log of the autocorrelation between years t and s on a

linear time trend variable, the unemployment rates in both years t and s, a cubic in age, and fixed

effects for the order of the autocorrelation. The estimated coefficient of the linear trend variable

is 0.0013 with an estimated standard error of 0.0006. The small magnitude of the estimated

upward trend in the autocorrelations suggests that the rise in earnings inequality was generated by

increases in both the transitory and persistent components, but there is some initial evidence that

the persistent component grew by a marginally larger proportion.

        To investigate these patterns more formally, we proceed to GMM estimation of the

earnings dynamics model laid out in Section III. Table 5 shows the resulting estimates. In the

first two columns are the parameter estimates and associated standard error estimates for the base

model described in equations (6)-(9). Recall that this model incorporates a persistent component,

composed of terms capturing individual-specific heterogeneity in the age/earnings profile as well


                                                    22
as a random walk, plus a transitory component following an AR(1) process with age-based

heteroskedastic innovations. Furthermore, each component's variance is shifted over time by a

separate year-specific factor loading.

         The estimates of a and          in the first two rows express the heterogeneity in the

intercept and slope of the age/earnings profile. They are generally smaller than the estimates

found in studies of U.S. men. For example, our estimated standard deviation in earnings growth

rates,     = .10.000090 = 0.0095, is a bit less than half of the most comparable estimates in Baker

(1997) and Haider (1998). Baker and Haider, however, do not allow for a random-walk

component, age-related heteroskedasticity in the transitory innovations, or differences across

cohorts in their initial transitory variances, so all of the age structure in earnings dispersion

necessarily gets loaded into the growth heterogeneity part of their models. Our significantly

positive estimate of o in the seventh row indicates that the random-walk component also plays a

role, and, as will be seen below, our results also point to substantial age-related heteroskedasticity

in the transitory component.

         Nevertheless, even our smaller estimate of       is both statistically and substantively

significant. It implies that a worker with a growth rate one standard deviation above the mean

would accumulate a 10 percent earnings advantage over the course of a decade. As in several

previous studies (Lifiard and Weiss, 1979; Hause, 1980; Baker, 1997; Haider, 1998), our estimate

of       in the third row is significantly negative, corresponding to a trade-off between earnings

early in the career and subsequent earnings growth.

         In the seventeen rows starting with the eighth, we report the estimates of the year-specific

factor loadings on the persistent component. For identffication, the parameter for 1976 is



                                                    23
normalized to equal 1. The estimated factor loadings are a little above 1 in the years immediately

after 1976, and then they increase sharply in the recession of 1982. There is a gradual decay over

the expansion of the late 1980's and then another sharp increase in the recession of the early

1990's. The countercydicality of the estimated factor loadings is consistent with the U.S.

evidence that the annual work hours of low-wage workers are especially sensitive to the business

cycle (Solon, Barsky, and Parker, 1994). The upward secular trend in the estimated factor

loadings, foreshadowed by the patterns in the empirical autocovariance matrices reported in

Tables 3 and 4, suggests that the persistent component plays an important role in the increase in

earnings inequality over the period. Even though the previous literature reports that the return to

education in Canada did not increase appreciably over this period, more generally the return to

persistent worker attributes did trend upwards. This finding accords with Morissette and

Berube's (1996) result that the dispersion in earnings summed over ten years increased from

1975-1984 to 1984-1993.

       In the next section of the table, we report the estimated parameters for the transitory

component. First are the estimates of the "initial variances," which capture the accumulation of

the transitory process up to the start of the sample period for each cohort. As was shown in

Table 1, age in the initial year (1976) declines monotonically for cohorts 1924/25 through

1950/51. In turn, the estimated initial variances for these cohorts display a vaguely U-shaped

pattern, although there are spikes for some of the middle cohorts. The estimated initial variances

for cohorts 1950/51 through 1960/61 document how the accumulation of the transitory process

changed for 26-year-olds over the period. The clear message here is that dispersion has been

increasing, as the variance estimates more than double from 1976 (cohort 1950/5 1) to 1986

(cohort 1960/61).


                                                 24
       In the next block are the estimates of the autoregressive parameter p and the parameters

of the quartic in age for the variance of the innovations to the transitory process. Our j3= 0.540

is quite similar to Baker and Haider's most comparable estimates. The estimated parameters of

the age quartic imply the profile shown in Figure 4. There is an initial decline in the variance of

the innovations as it falls more than 50 percent from the mid twenties to the early forties. As was

suggested above, the variance flattens out in mid-age. Finally, it rises in the fifties although not to

the levels observed at the beginning of the age profile. This pattern is consistent with other

evidence in the literature (Gordon, 1984) and points to the importance of accounting for the

systematic influence of age on transitory innovations to earnings.

       In the fmal block of the table, we report the estimated year-specific factor loadings on the

transitory innovation. Here we must use the normalization that the parameter for 1977 equals 1,

since the variance of this component in 1976 is left unrestricted to identify the initial variances of

the cohorts . Not surprisingly, here we see more cyclical variation than was apparent in the factor

loadings for the persistent component, with the transitory factor loadings rising more dramatically

in the recession of 1982.27 There is next some recovery from the recession, a fairly flat profile

over the expansion of the late 1980's, and finally another sharp increase in the recession of the

early 1990's.

        Just plotting the time series of p. and A is not sufficient to give a full characterization of

the relative contributions of the persistent and transitory components to increases in earnings

inequality. The relative roles of the two components depend not only on these two factor

loadings but also on the relative magnitudes of the factors that they load, the initial transitory

variances, and the autoregressive parameter. Therefore, in Figure 5 we use our estimates of all




                                                   25
these parameters to decompose our estimated model's predicted variance of log earnings into its

persistent and transitory components, holding age constant to abstract from any life-cycle

considerations. The decomposition is performed for males 40 years old, which is approximately

the midpoint of the ages observable in our sample, and it tells the story of individuals who in turn

should be in the middle of their working careers.28 In moving from year to year, the factor

loadings on the two components change, as does the initial variance used in generating the

transitory variance up to age 40.29

           The first thing to note in Figure 5 is the increase in the total variance, primarily in steps

corresponding to the recessions over the sample period. This, of course, duplicates the pattern

seen earlier in Figure 1 (and in previous Canadian studies based on the Survey of Consumer

Finances). The novel feature of Figure 5 is its decomposition of the total variance into persistent

and transitory components. In the early years of the sample period, the persistent component

accounts for about 70 percent of the inequality in annual earnings. The two components move

remarkably similarly over time. Both components rise substantially in the recession starting in

1982, settle down during the recovery at a higher level than before the recession, and then leap to

new heights in the recession of the early 1990's. Because the transitory and persistent

components increase by similar absolute magnitudes from 1976 to 1992, the proportional share of

the persistent component is slightly lower in 1992 than in 1976.


27
     Haider (1998) reports a similar result for the United States.
28
  We also have performed the decomposition for ages 32 and 50. The results for age 50 are qualitatively very
similar to those for age 40. The results for age 32 assign a somewhat larger portion of the growth in earnings
inequality to the transitory component.
29
     In fact, the initial variance changes every two years, corresponding to the cohort estimates reported in Table 5.
For example, in 1976 we have a direct estimate of the variance of the transitory component for males aged 40 in
the initial variance for cohort 1936/37. In 1978, we use the initial variance for cohort 1938/39, whose members
are 40 in this year.


                                                            26
       A pairwise comparison of 1976 and 1992, however, is inadequate for trend analysis

because business-cycle conditions were not identical in the two years. To control for business-

cycle effects in an analysis spanning all seventeen years, we apply least squares to estimate time-

series regressions of the persistent and transitory components on a linear time trend and the

unemployment rate. The results are reported in Table 6. The point estimates suggest that the

persistent component contributed a marginally larger absolute amount to the upward trend in

earnings inequality. The estimated coefficients of the unemployment rate indicate a slightly larger

cyclical sensitivity in the transitory component. That said, the overall inference is consistent with

the impression from Figure 5 that the two series show similar cyclical movements and contribute

similar amounts to the secular increase in annual earnings inequality.

       Our base model nests and extends most of the specifications used in U.S. studies. U.S.

researchers, who have had to rely on relatively small-scale panel surveys, have had to settle for

estimating simpler and more restrictive models than the base model used here. For example, even

though life-cycle variation in the transitory variance component is both economically plausible and

empirically supported by some earnings dynamics research, the recent U.S. studies that have

decomposed the inequality trend into persistent and transitory components have assumed away

that source of nonstationarity in the earnings process. Similarly, these studies have assumed

either heterogeneity in earnings growth rates or a random-walk process, but not both. Assuming

away one or the other is unfortunate because there are good reasons to expect both to be present.

It is hard to believe that the sources of earnings growth, such as human capital investment and

effort-elicitation schemes, operate with identical force for all individuals. It is just as hard to

believe there is no such thing as earnings shocks with permanent effects (e.g., job displacements,

disabling injuries, and new information about workers' skills).


                                                   27
       The fact that our base model encompasses these different aspects of earnings dynamics

allows us the opportunity to ask two related methodological questions. First, do our data reject

the restrictions imposed in the U.S. literature? Second, if so, does it matter? Is the imposition of

false restrictions innocuous for addressing the issues at hand, or does it distort the analysis of

those issues? In Tables 7 and 8, we explore both questions by estimating a series of restricted

models.

        In the first two columns of Table 7, we examine the implications of assuming away

permanent earnings shocks by estimating a model with no random walk (i.e., with a = 0). It is

clear that this "restricted model 1" is statistically indefensible, as the estimate of a in Table 5 is

highly significant in both the statistical and economic senses. But does the imposition of the false

restriction that c = 0 make much difference for characterizing other aspects of earnings

dynamics? Comparing the results in Table 7 to those in Table 5 reveals that assuming away the

random walk leads to a larger estimate of the autoregressive parameter p and to smaller estimates

of cr and a. Also the estimated covariance of a and /3 now becomes positive although

statistically insignificant. For purposes of the present paper, we are most interested in how the

restriction affects the decomposition of earnings inequality into persistent and transitory

components. Therefore, in Figure 6 we present the decomposition for restricted model 1 so that

we can compare it to the decomposition shown in Figure 5 for the base model. Note first that,

with the restricted model, the persistent component makes up relatively less of total inequality at

any point in time. Whereas the persistent component represented roughly two-thirds of total

inequality in Figure 5, in Figure 6 the proportion varies between 50 and 60 percent. The

implication is a higher degree of mobility in the earnings distribution, although the larger estimate



                                                   28
of p implies that transitory churning has longer persistence. A second difference is that the two

components seem less synchronous than in Figure 5. The persistent component exhibits greater

trend increase leading up to the 1982 recession, while the transitory component displays greater

increase thereafter. In Table 6 we report the results of time-series regressions of each component

on the unemployment rate and a linear trend. Relative to the base model, in the restricted model

the two components trade roles in their contributions to the inequality trend. It is now the

transitory component that makes the marginally larger contribution to rising inequality.

       The models actually used in previous studies are more restrictive than this example, and

further restrictions can have larger effects on inference. In the next two columns of Table 7

("restricted model 2"), we report estimates of a specification that, relative to the base model,

assumes away both growth-rate heterogeneity in the persistent component and age-related

heteroskedasticity in the transitory innovation. The Wald test statistics reported in the first panel

of Table 8 make clear that these restrictions not only are economically implausible, but also are

statistically indefensible with our data. The test statistic for the null hypothesis of no growth-rate

heterogeneity (a = 0 and          = 0) has a p-value that is zero to at least four decimal places. So

does the test statistic for the null hypothesis of no age-related heteroskedasticity in the transitory

innovation (y = 72 = 73 = = 0). Nevertheless, these restrictions are of considerable interest

because they are imposed in the preferred model in Moffitt and Gottschalk's (1995) influential

study. We therefore would like to know whether these restrictions are innocuous for purposes of

identifying trends in earnings inequality.

        Comparing the parameter estimates for this specification to those for the base model,

again some change very little, and others change a lot. To explore how much the changes matter,




                                                  29
in Figure 7 we plot the decomposition of total predicted inequality into persistent and transitory

components. Here there are some major differences from Figures 5 and 6. The persistent

component accounts for a little less than two-thirds of the total variance at the beginning of the

sample period. Unlike the preceding figures, however, Figure 7 shows the transitory component

increasing by more than the persistent component so that, by the end of the sample period, the

transitory component is just as large. This observation is formalized in time-series regressions

reported in Table 6. The results suggest the transitory component plays the dominant role in

trend increases in inequality. Therefore, while the estimates from the more general model indicate

that increases in the persistent component contributed marginally more to the growth in earnings

inequality, this simpler model imposing clearly false restrictions attributes most of the inequality

growth to the transitory component.

       To explore further the implications of the choice between allowing for heterogeneous

growth rates or a random walk, in the last columns of Table 7 we report estimates for "restricted

model 3." In contrast to restricted model 2, this model incorporates heterogeneous growth rates

instead of a random walk, while continuing to assume away age-related heteroskedasticity in

transitory innovations. Once again, relative to the base model this model is statistically

indefensible, but it is of interest because it is comparable to the preferred model in Haider's

(1998) study. The resulting decomposition of total inequality is depicted in Figure 8 and Table 6.

Here the results are much closer to those for the base model, though they still imply a somewhat

larger role for the transitory component in rising inequality. The distinguishing feature between

restricted models 2 and 3 is that the former accommodates only linear life-cycle growth in

persistent earnings dispersion (through the unit root) while the latter can accommodate nonlinear




                                                  30
effects (through the age profile). This distinction turns out to have a considerable impact on the

decomposition.

       What do these results imply for the U.S. evidence on persistent versus transitory

components of rising earnings inequality? Until such time as U.S. data comparable to our

Canadian data become available to researchers, it wifi be impossible to say for sure whether our

results would be replicated in the U.S. context. Our specification analysis, however, is suggestive

of the possibility that the U.S. evidence has been distorted by the model restrictions necessitated

by small data sets. With the Canadian data, we have found that assuming away some aspects of

nonstationarity in life-cycle earnings dynamics leads to exaggeration of the role of the transitory

component in rising cross-sectional earnings inequality, and it understates the role of the

persistent component. This distortion is particularly serious in the case of Moffitt and

Gottschalk' s (1995) preferred specification.

        This discussion, of course, begs the question of whether our own base model also imposes

false restrictions that affect inference. In defense of the base model, we reemphasize that it

incorporates most of the lessons of previous research, and we also note the usual trade-off

between the greater generality of a more complex model and its lesser parsimony and

inteffigibility. Nevertheless, it is very important to explore the implications of extending the model

further, and we do so in Table 5.

        One conceptually straightforward extension of our base model is to allow for quadratic

heterogeneity in growth rates. If workers differ in the steepness of their earnings/age profiles,

 why not in the curvature as well? Baker (1997) reports some evidence for heterogeneity in

 curvature, and Lillard and Revile (1999) explain why this pattern ought to be expected. While

 workers differ initially in the intensity of their human capital investment, all of them should stop


                                                   31
investing by the ends of their careers. Therefore, those with the steepest earnings growth earlier

in their careers also should display more curvature in their earnings/age profiles.

       To incorporate this possibility, we embellish equation (6) in our base model by adding an

individual-specific coefficient i,ii,, for the square of age since 26. This introduces three new

parameters -- the variance of ijf and its covariances with ab and f3ib -- into our model of

earnings covariances. Our results from estimating this "extended model 1" are shown in the third

and fourth columns of Table 5. Perhaps surprisingly, the data do not seem to care much for

adding only this embellishment to the base model. The estimated variance of V1,b is insignificantly

negative. As shown in the second panel of Table 8, a Wald test of the joint hypothesis that all

three new parameters are zero fails to reject at the 0.10 significance level. Adding the new

parameters to the model has very little effect on the other parameter estimates or on the

decomposition of earnings inequality into its persistent and transitory components.

        Another natural extension of the base model is to supplement the cohort effects already

incorporated into the transitory component with cohort effects in the persistent component. The

possibility of inter-cohort variation in skill dispersion usually has been downplayed in the U.S.

literature on inequality trends. The introduction to Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce's (1993) important

study, for example, says, "we view the trend toward increased inequality not in terms of increased

dispersion in unobserved ability (or increased measurement error etc.) but rather as an increasing

market return to skill."3°

        Nevertheless, we have two reasons for wanting to entertain the possibility of cohort

differences in the persistent component of earnings variation. First, we know of no basis for




                                                  32
believing such cohort differences are absent, and there is some evidence they are present. While it

is difficult, if not impossible, to adduce convincing evidence with respect to dispersion in

unobserved ability, there is clear-cut variation across Canadian cohorts in the distribution of at

least one measurable trait, namely years of education. In each of three Canadian censuses (1976,

1981, and 1986), we have measured the variance of educational attainment among men who

worked in the reference week and belonged to a birth cohort appearing in our T-4 sample for that

year. Education measurement differs somewhat across censuses, and the appendix to this paper

provides details of the construction of our education variable. The results in Table 9 indicate that

the variance in years of education has declined dramatically between earlier and more recent

cohorts.

        Second, even if skill dispersion did not vary across cohorts in the population, our sampling

scheme might induce inter-cohort variation in our sample. We require individuals to have

consecutive years of positive earnings in the years between 1976 and 1992 in which they satisfy

the requirement of being 24-59 years of age. For older cohorts this requires consecutive years of

positive earnings in the later stage of life, while for younger cohorts the consecutive years of

earnings are required as early as the mid twenties. It is easy to imagine that the types of

individuals who string together years of positive earnings early in life differ, in persistent ways,

from those who accomplish this feat later in the life cycle. This is another reason to question our

base model's assumption that cr,, is the same for all cohorts.

        Therefore, in "extended model 2" we introduce cohort-specific values of a . The

resulting estimates are shown in the last two columns of Table 5. The first thing to note is that

30
  Juhn, Murphy, and Pierce (1993) present compelling evidence that rising inequality has stemmed in large part
from "an increasing market return to skill," but, as they acknowledge, their evidence cannot rule out effects from



                                                         33
the data do seem to favor the addition of the new parameters. As shown in the third panel of

Table 8, a Wald test of the base model's restriction that all cohorts have the same

resoundingly rejects that restriction. The pattern shown by the point estimates is a systematic

decline across cohorts in their persistent heterogeneity until a leveling-out appears starting with

the cohort born in 1948/49. As shown in Table 9, this pattern coheres somewhat with the decline

between earlier and more recent cohorts in the variance of educational attainment. The

correlation between a cohort's variance in educational attainment and our estimate of its a

exceeds 0.8 regardless of which census we use to measure education.

         The addition of the new parameters induces some notable changes in the estimates of

other parameters of the model. First, the data now become more enamored of the quadratic

specification of heterogeneity in earnings growth. The estimate of c now becomes significantly

positive, and a Wald test of the joint hypothesis that the three parameters associated with

quadratic heterogeneity are all zero rejects with a p-value of zero to at least four decimal places.

In accordance with Lillard and Revile's (1999) analysis, the estimated covariance between V'jb

and   f31b   is now significantly negative -- workers with rapid early earnings growth experience

greater curvature later on.

             Second, the estimates of the higher-order parameters in the age quartic for

heteroskedasticity in transitory innovations become larger. We graph the implied profile in Figure

9. Relative to Figure 4, the transitory variance declines more quickly with age, and there is a

stable, fairly flat segment between ages 35 and 52.




between-cohort changes in skill dispersion.


                                                     34
       Third, and more importantly for purposes of this paper, the estimates of the factor

loadings on the persistent and transitory components change quite dramatically. Relative to the

base model, the upward time trend in the loadings on the persistent component is now

considerably larger, while the loadings on the transitory component display greater cyclical

variation and less trend. This latter point can be seen by comparing the two models' estimates of

2 for the late 1980's, when the economy was in a sustained and wide-ranging expansion. The
estimates from extended model 2 are near 1.0, last seen in the late 1970's during another

expansionary period. In contrast, the estimates from the base model for these years display a

large trend increase relative to the late 1970's.

       With respect to the persistent component, extended model 2 characterizes rising earnings

inequality as the net effect of two opposing developments. On one hand, the greater homogeneity

of the more recent cohorts has been a force toward more equal earnings. But this force has been

much more than offset by an upward trend in the factor loadings, which might be interpreted as a

rise in the returns to skill. In the base model, which assumes away cross-cohort changes in

heterogeneity, the estimated factor loadings end up reflecting the net effect of these two forces.

In extended model 2, which separates the two forces, the factor loadings are freed up to reflect

only the rapid rise in returns to skill.

        In Figure 10, we depict the extended model's implications for the decomposition of

inequality into its persistent and transitory components. The figure portrays the net effects of the

two opposing forces in persistent inequality. That is, as new cohorts arrive at age 40, we allow

both the persistent factor loadings to increase and a, to decrease. The figure is fairly similar to

Figure 5 for the base model, but despite the greater homogeneity of the more recent cohorts,

Figure 10 shows an even greater role for the persistent component in accounting for the increase


                                                 35
in overall earnings inequality. This is formalized in the time-series regressions in Table 6.

Compared to the base model, extended model 2 shows a larger estimated trend coefficient for the

persistent component and a smaller one for the transitory component. We see even greater

dissimilarity in comparisons of the extended model to the restricted models estimated in Table 7.

The restricted models' understatement of the role of the persistent component in rising inequality

and exaggeration of the role of the transitory component are accentuated in comparison to

extended model 2.

        Would further experimentation lead to still more changes in inference? We have explored

two extensions of extended model 2 and found that our results are not sensitive in these

dimensions. The first extension is to specify cohort-specific parameters for the entire age profile

of the persistent component, restricting the profile to be linear to keep the model manageable.

This is just a simple extension of the argument that led to the cohort-specific estimates of o.

The second is to specify separate factor loadings on the random-walk portion of the persistent

component. The argument here is that the sorts of events that lead to unit roots in earnings are

very different from the human capital investments that lead to heterogeneous growth rates, and

the evolution of these two types of effects over the 1980's might be different. The trend

decompositions for these models, however, turn out to be very similar to the decomposition for

extended model 2. In each case, the persistent component still makes the larger contribution to

the upward trend in inequality.31




31 The parameter estimates for these models are available from the authors on request. For the model with cohort-
specific age profiles in the persistent component, time-series regressions (as in table 6) lead to estimated time trend
coefficients of 0.0043 (0.0009) for the persistent component and 0.0013 (0.0004) for the transitory component.
The corresponding estimates for the model with the separate factor loading on the random walk are 0.003 8
(0.0005) and 0.0018 (0.0005) respectively. The factor loadings on the random walk do display a different pattern
than the loadings on the age profile of the persistent component. They decline in recessions, peak in expansions,


                                                          36
       To summarize, our results indicate that Canada's increase in earnings inequality has

stemmed from increases in both the persistent and transitory components of earnings variation.

The results from our preferred models suggest that the persistent component has played at least a

somewhat larger role. This means that, to an important extent, the growth in cross-sectional

inequality reflects a widened gap between the chronic haves and the chronic have-nots. Our

results contrast somewhat with the U.S. literature, which has concluded that increases in the

persistent and transitory components have been about equally important. This contrast seems

anomalous at first because the returns to education have increased less in Canada than in the

United States. Our specification analyses, however, reveal that the contrast may be at least partly

an artifact of specification errors in the U.S. literature. When we use our Canadian data to test

the restrictions imposed in the U.S. literature, we reject the restrictions. We also fmd that

imposing these evidently false restrictions shifts the decomposition of the increase in earnings

inequality towards the transitory component.



                                               V. Conclusions

        Using an extraordinary data set drawn from longitudinal income tax records, we have

verified that earnings inequality in Canada grew substantially over our sample period of 1976-

1992, and we have decomposed this growth in inequality into its persistent and transitory

components. Like some of the U.S. studies cited in our introduction, we have found that the rise

in inequality has stemmed from upward trends in both components. Thus, Canada's growth in

annual earnings inequality signifies an increase in long-run inequality, as well as an increase in



and range between 0.93 and 1.17. The estimated factor loadings for the age profile of the persistent component are
very similar to those reported for extended model 2.



                                                       37
earnings instability. Our estimates from our preferred models suggest that the increase in the

persistent component may have played a somewhat larger role.

       What has caused the increases in both long-run inequality and instability is an important

subject for continuing research. In the U.S. studies, the fmding of increased persistent inequality

was expected because the United States has experienced a large increase in the return to

schooling. This increase has been thoroughly documented and has been attributed in large part to

skill-biased technological change that has increased the relative demand for educated labor.32 In

Canada, however, there has been little increase in the return to education, so it was less clear

whether Canada's increase in annual earnings inequality reflects a rise in long-run inequality.

Now that we have found that it does, it is natural to ask why long-run inequality has increased in

Canada without much increase in the return to schooling. Freeman and Needels (1993)

conjecture that the wage impact of increased relative demand for educated labor has been offset in

Canada by a dramatic increase in the supply of college-educated labor. If other skifi attributes

(e.g., intelligence) have not undergone similar increases in supply, though, skill-biased

technological change could still increase the returns to those skills. Perhaps this is why the

persistent component of earnings inequality has increased in Canada despite little change in the

return to schooling.

        The increase in earnings instability is even more puzzling, both in the United States and

Canada. While the U.S. literature has intensively studied the increased return to schooling, it has

just begun to speculate about the sources of rising volatility in earnings. (3ottschalk and Moffitt

(1994), as well as their discussants, do discuss various possible explanations for the U.S. increase



32 DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996), however, stress that changes in unionization and the relative minimum
wage also have contributed to the rise in wage inequality.



                                                      38
in earnings instability, but they conclude, "We have not located any defmitive explanation for the

increased transitory variance." For example, they consider whether the large decline in the

unionization of the U.S. work force has played an important role, but they fmd this could be "only

a small part of the explanation." In Canada, de-unionization is even less promising as an

explanation because union density has not declined nearly as much there as in the United States

(Riddell, 1993).

        Another possible source of increased earnings instability is a decline in job stability. The

U.S. evidence, however, does not point to a clear-cut trend in that direction.33 Similarly, the two

Canadian studies of which we are aware -- Heisz (1996) and Green and Riddell (1997) -- do not

fmd a broad trend toward shorter job duration, but instead fmd an increasing prevalence of both

very short and very long jobs. Whether this polarization in the job tenure distribution can possibly

explain much of Canada's increase in earnings instability probably deserves some attention.34

        Another possible factor, which seems to have been overlooked so far in the literature, is

tax changes that have altered the incentives for income smoothing.35 As detailed in Shoven and

Whalley (1992), both Canada and the United States adopted a complex series of tax changes

during the 1980's. While some of these changes (such as the flattening of marginal tax rates) may

have increased earnings volatility by reducing incentives for income smoothing, others (such as

Canada's elimination of income averaging) cut in the other direction. As in the case of changes in

the distribution of job tenure, the impact on earnings instability is not immediately obvious, but

probably warrants further research.


  See Jaeger and Stevens (1998) and the references therein.
  Another empirical question relevant to this issue is whether the increased instability in annual earnings stems
from increased instability in annual work hours or in hourly wages. Unfortunately, our data set does not permit a
decomposition of annual earnings into its hours and wage components.



                                                        39
       The substantive focus of our paper has been on learning more (and raising additional

questions) about the sources of Canada's increase in earnings inequality. Along the way,

however, we also have tried to push the econometric envelope in the modeling of earnings

dynamics. Thanks to the large size of our earnings panel, we have had the opportunity to estimate

more general models than could be identified in previous research on earnings mobility.

        For example, several recent studies have modeled the fanning out of a cohort's earnings

distribution over the life cycle with either heterogeneous earnings growth or a random walk, but

limited sample sizes have prevented these studies from incorporating both in the same model. We

have succeeded in estimating the parameters of both of these aspects of the earnings process, and

we have found that both are significant. This is a reassuring fmding because there are good

economic reasons to expect both aspects to be present. Persistent differences across individuals

in their intensity of human capital investment, for example, ought to lead to heterogeneity in

earnings growth.36 Job losses and other shocks that cause permanent earnings changes ought to

generate a random-walk aspect in the earnings process. In addition, we have found that the

volatility of transitory earnings innovations varies significantly with stage of the life cycle. When

researchers specify models that arbitrarily rule out some of these factors, they run the risk of

falsely attributing some of the nonstationarity apparent in earnings data to only those sources of

nonstationarity that remain in their models.

        The practical importance of these modeling choices is ifiustrated by our experiments with

imposing restrictions commonly found in the U.S. literature on earnings dynamics and inequality

" We thank Joel Slemrod for raising this possibility and Jack Mintz for discussing it withus.
36
  It therefore is surprising that Abowd and Card's (1989) influential study claims an "absence of any permanent
individual components of variance in the rate of growth of earnings or hours." As explained in Baker (1997),
Abowd and Card fail to detect the heterogeneity of earnings growth because their samples are small and because
they view the data only in first differences.

trends. Not only do our data reject many of these restrictions, but imposing these apparently false

restrictions sometimes generates important changes in substantive results. For example, we fmd

with our data that imposing Moffitt and Gottschalk's (1995) restrictions of no heterogeneity in

earnings growth rates and no age-related heteroskedasticity in transitory innovations ascribes a

much larger share of the increase in earnings inequality to the transitory component. This raises

the possibility that some of the findings in the U.S. literature have been distorted by the modeling

restrictions necessitated by reliance on relatively small-scale panel surveys. Of course, the

happiest response to this possibility would be to acquire better U.S. data that would enable

estimation of less restrictive models. Until such time as that becomes possible, researchers need

to be cognizant of the possible sensitivity of their results to arbitrary modeling choices, and they

need to conduct and report checks of the robustness of their results across alternative

specffications.

The variables capturing education differ somewhat across the 1976, 1981 and 1986 Canadian

censuses. In the 1981 and 1986 censuses, some years of primary and secondary education are

reported in ranges, and greater detail on years of post-secondary education is available. To

construct a variable that is consistent across censuses, we measure years of education as the sum

of years of primary/secondary, years of post-secondary university, and years of post-secondary

Notes: The coefficient estimates come from ordinary least squares estimation of
regressions in which the dependent variable is the estimated persistent or transitory
component (for a male aged 40) from the indicated model and the explanatory variables
are the unemployment rate and a linear time trend variable. The sample period is 1976-
1992 (T=17).
