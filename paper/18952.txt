                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we undertake an assessment of the rapidly growing body of research on financial literacy.
We start with an overview of theoretical research which casts financial knowledge as a form of investment
in human capital. Endogenizing financial knowledge has important implications for welfare as well
as policies intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge in the larger population. Next, we draw
on recent surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and identify the least financially
savvy population subgroups. This is followed by an examination of the impact of financial literacy
on economic decision-making in the United States and elsewhere. While the literature is still growing,
conclusions may be drawn about the effects and consequences of financial illiteracy and what works
to remedy these gaps. A final section offers thoughts on what remains to be learned if researchers are
to better inform theoretical and empirical models as well as public policy.

1. Introduction

        Financial markets around the world have become increasingly accessible to the ‘small

investor,’ as new products and financial services grow widespread. At the onset of the recent

financial crisis, consumer credit and mortgage borrowing had burgeoned. People who had credit

cards or subprime mortgages were in the historically unusual position of being able to decide

how much they wanted to borrow. Alternative financial services, including payday loans, pawn

shops, auto title loans, tax refund loans, and rent-to-own shops have also become widespread.1

At the same time, changes in the pension landscape increasingly thrust responsibility for saving,

investing, and decumulating wealth onto workers and retirees. Forty years ago, older Americans

relied mainly on Social Security and employer-sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans in

retirement, with participants mainly deciding when to claim benefits. Today, by contrast, Baby

Boomers mainly have defined contribution (DC) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts

(IRAs) during their working years, which require them to decide how much to save and where to

invest.2 Moreover, during retirement, Boomers will increasingly need to take on responsibility

for careful decumulation so as not to outlive their assets while meeting their needs.

        Yet many of these widely available financial products – student loans, mortgages, credit

cards, pension accounts, annuities – have proven to be complex and difficult for financially

unsophisticated investors to master. So while financial and pension developments have their

advantages, by permitting tailored financial contracts and more people to access credit, they also

  In the early 1980’s, around 40 percent of U.S. private-sector pension contributions went to DC plans; two decades
later, almost 90 percent of such contributions went to retirement accounts (mostly 401(k) plans; Poterba, Venti, and
Wise 2008).
                                                                                                2


impose on households a much greater responsibility to borrow, save, invest, and decumulate their

assets sensibly.

       One of our goals in this paper is to offer an assessment of how well-equipped today’s

households are to make these complex financial decisions. Specifically we focus on financial

literacy, by which we mean peoples’ ability to process economic information and make informed

decisions about financial planning, wealth accumulation, pensions, and debt. In what follows, we

outline recent theoretical research showing how financial knowledge can be cast as a type of

investment in human capital. In this approach, those who build financial savvy can earn above-

average expected returns on their investments, yet there will still be some optimal level of

financial ignorance. Endogenizing financial knowledge in this way has important implications

for welfare, and offers insights into programs intended to enhance levels of financial knowledge

in the larger population. Another goal is to assess the effects of financial literacy on behavior.

We draw on surveys to establish how much (or how little) people know and which subgroups are

the least financially literate. Most important, we evaluate the impact of financial literacy on

economic decision-making in the United States and abroad, and what policies might help fill

these gaps. The paper concludes with thoughts on what remains to be learned to better inform

theoretical and empirical models, as well as public policy.



2. A Theoretical Framework for Financial Literacy

       The conventional economic approach to saving and consumption decisions posits that a

fully rational and well-informed individual will consume less than his income in times of high

earnings, and he will save to support consumption when income falls (e.g. after retirement). In

this context, building on Modigliani and Brumberg (1954) and Friedman (1957), the consumer is
                                                                                                             3


posited to arrange his optimal saving and decumulation patterns to smooth marginal utility over

his lifetime. Many studies have shown how such a life cycle optimization process can be shaped

by consumer preferences (e.g. risk aversion and discount rates), the economic environment (e.g.

risky returns on investments and liquidity constraints), and social safety net benefits (e.g. the

availability and generosity of welfare schemes and Social Security income), among other

features.3

        Theoretical models incorporating such key aspects of consumer behavior and the

economic environment implicitly assume that people are able to formulate and execute saving

and spend-down plans, all of which require expertise in dealing with financial markets,

knowledge of purchasing power, and the capacity to undertake complex economic calculations.

As we show below in more detail, this is far from true in the real world: very few people possess

the extensive financial knowledge conducive to making and executing complex plans. Moreover,

acquiring such knowledge is likely to come at a cost. In the past, when retirement pensions were

implemented and managed by governments, individual workers tended to devote little attention

to the plan details. Today, by contrast, saving, investment, and decumulation for retirement are

occurring in an increasingly personalized pension environment. Accordingly, researchers and

policymakers have begun to push for additional insights into the gaps between modeling and

reality, so as to better evaluate where the theory can be enriched, and how policy efforts can be

better targeted.

 For an older review of the saving literature see Browning and Lusardi (1996); recent surveys are provided by
Skinner (2007) and Attanasio and Weber (2010). A very partial list of the literature discussing new theoretical
advances includes Cagetti (2003); Chai, Horneff, Maurer and Mitchell (2012); DeNardi, French, and Jones (2011);
French (2005, 2008); Gourinchas and Parker (2002); Hurst and Aguiar (2005, 2007); and Scholz, Seshadri, and
Khitatrakun (2006).
                                                                                                            4


        While there is a substantial theoretical and empirical body of work on the economics of

education,4 far less attention has been devoted to the question of how people acquire and deploy

financial literacy. In the last few years, however, a few authors have begun to explore the

decision to acquire financial literacy and the links between financial knowledge, saving, and

investment behavior including Delavande, Rohwedder, and Willis (2008), Jappelli and Padula

(2011), Hsu (2011), and Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell (2013).5 The study by Delavande,

Rohwedder, and Willis (2008) presents a simple two-period model of consumer saving and

portfolio allocation across safe bonds and risky stocks, allowing for the acquisition of human

capital in the form of financial knowledge (à la Ben-Porath, 1967, and Becker, 1975). This work

posits that individuals will optimally elect to invest in financial knowledge so as to gain access to

higher-return assets: this training helps them identify better-performing assets and/or hire

financial advisers who can reduce investment expenses. Hsu (2011) uses a similar approach in an

intra-household setting where husbands specialize in the acquisition of financial knowledge, but

women are predicted to increase their acquisition of financial knowledge when it becomes

relevant, such as prior to the death of their spouse. Jappelli and Padula (2011) also consider a

two-period model but additionally sketch a multi-period life cycle model with financial literacy

endogenously determined. They predict that financial literacy and wealth will be strongly

correlated over the life cycle, with both rising until retirement and falling thereafter. They also

suggest that, in countries with generous Social Security benefits, there will be fewer incentives to

save and accumulate wealth and, in turn, less reason to invest in financial literacy.

  Glewwe (2002) and Hanusheck and Woessman (2008) review the economic impacts of schooling and cognitive
development.
5
  Another related study is by Benitez-Silva, Demiralp, and Liu (2009) who use a dynamic life cycle model of
optimal Social Security benefit claiming against which they compare outcomes to those generated under a sub-
optimal information structure where people simply copy those around them when deciding when to claim benefits.
The authors do not, however, allow for endogenous acquisition of information.
                                                                                                                    5


         Each of these studies represents a useful theoretical advance, yet none incorporates

borrowing constraints, mortality risk, demographic factors, stock market returns, and earnings

and health shocks, all now standard in theoretical models of saving. These shortcomings are

rectified in the multi-period model of Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell (2011, 2013), who

calibrate and simulate a dynamic life cycle approach where individuals not only select capital

market investments but also undertake investment in financial knowledge. This extension is

important in that it permits researchers to examine model implications for wealth inequality and

welfare. That paper posits two distinct technologies for investing: the first is a simple one which

pays a fixed low rate of return each period ( R  1  r ) , similar to a bank account, while the

second is a more sophisticated technology providing the consumer access to a higher stochastic

expected return, R ( f t ) , which depends on his accumulated level of financial knowledge. Each

period, the stock of knowledge is related to what the individual had in the previous period minus

a depreciation factor: thus ft 1   ft  it , where  represents knowledge depreciation (due to

obsolescence or decay) and gross investment is it . The stochastic return from the sophisticated

technology follows the process R ( ft 1 )  R  r ( f     t 1   )     t 1 (where εt is a N(0,1) iid shock and

  refers to the standard deviation of returns on the sophisticated technology). To access this

higher expected return, the consumer must pay both a direct cost (c), and a time and money cost (

 ) to build up his knowledge.6




6
 This cost function is assumed to be convex but the authors also experiment with alternative formulations, which
does not alter results materially. Kézdi and Willis (2011) also model heterogeneity in beliefs about the stock market,
where people could learn about the statistical process governing stock market returns, which reduced transactions
costs for investments. Here, however, the investment cost is cast as a simplified flat fixed fee per person, whereas
Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell (2013) evaluate more complex functions of time and money costs for investment in
knowledge.
                                                                                                                  6


         Prior to retirement, the individual earns risky labor income (y) from which he can

consume (c) or invest so as to raise his return (R) on saving (s) by investing in the sophisticated

technology. After retirement, he receives Social Security benefits which are a percentage of pre-

retirement income.7 Additional sources of uncertainty include stock returns, medical costs, and

longevity. Each period, therefore, the consumer’s decision variables are how much to invest in

the capital market, consume ( c ) , and whether to invest in financial knowledge.

         Assuming a discount rate of β and  o , y , and  which refer, respectively, to shocks in

medical expenditures, labor earnings, and rate of return , the problem takes the form of a series

of Bellman equations with the following value function Vd(st) at each age as long as the

individual is alive ( pe ,t  0) :




The utility function is assumed to be strictly concave in consumption and scaled using the

function u (ct / nt ) where nt is an equivalence scale capturing family size which changes

predictably over the life cycle; and by education, subscripted by e. End-of-period assets (at 1 )

are equal to labor earnings plus the returns on the previous period’s saving plus transfer income

(tr), minus consumption and costs of investment in knowledge (as long as investments are

positive; i.e.,  >0). Accordingly, at 1  R ( ft 1 )(at  ye,t  trt  ct   (it )  cd I ( t  0)). 8

         After calibrating the model using plausible parameter values, the authors then solve the

value functions for consumers with low/medium/high educational levels by backward recursion


7
  There is also a minimum consumption floor; see Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell (2011, 2013).
8
  Assets must be non-negative each period and there is a nonzero mortality probability as well as a finite length of
life.
                                                                                                                    7


after discretizing the continuous state variables.9 Given paths of optimal consumption,

knowledge investment, and participation in the stock market, they then simulate 5,000 life cycles

allowing for return, income, and medical expense shocks.10

         Several key predictions emerge from this study. First, endogenously-determined optimal

paths for financial knowledge will be hump-shaped over the life cycle. Second, consumers will

invest in financial knowledge to the point where their marginal time and money costs of doing so

are equated to their marginal benefits; of course, this optimum will depend on the cost function

for financial knowledge acquisition. Third, knowledge profiles will differ across educational

groups because of peoples’ different life cycle income profiles.

         Importantly, this model predicts that inequality in wealth and financial knowledge will

arise endogenously, without needing to assume cross-sectional differences in preferences or

making other major changes to the theoretical setup.11 Moreover, differences in wealth across

education groups also arise endogenously. In other words, this framework suggests that some

population sub-groups will have persistently low financial literacy, particularly those anticipating

substantial safety net income in old age. Finally, this approach implies that financial education

programs should not be expected to produce large behavioral changes for the least educated. This

is because it may not be worthwhile for the least educated to incur knowledge investment costs,

given that their consumption needs are better insured by transfer programs.12 The finding is

consistent with Jappelli and Padula’s (2011) suggestion that less financially informed individuals

will be found in countries with more generous Social Security benefits (see also Jappelli 2010).



9
  Additional detail on calibration and solution methods appears in Lusardi, Mitchell, and Michaud (2011, 2013).
10
   Initial conditions for education, earnings, and assets were derived from PSID respondents age 25-30.
11
   This may account for otherwise “unexplained” wealth inequality, as discussed in Venti and Wise (1998, 2001).
12
   These predictions directly contradict at least one lawyer’s surmise that “[i]n an idealized first-best world, where
all people are far above average, education would train every consumer to be financially literate and would motivate
every consumer to use that literacy to make good choices” (Willis 2008).
                                                                                                 8


       Despite the fact that some people will rationally choose to invest little or nothing in

financial knowledge, it is nonetheless interesting to note that it still can be socially optimal to

raise financial knowledge for everyone early in life, such as by mandating financial education in

high school. This is because even if the least educated never invest again and let their knowledge

endowment depreciate, they still will earn higher returns on their saving, which generates a

substantial welfare boost. For instance, providing pre-labor market financial knowledge to the

least educated group improves their wellbeing by an amount equivalent to 82 percent of their

initial wealth (Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell 2011). The wealth equivalent value for college

graduates is also estimated to be substantial, at 56 percent. While these estimates are specific to

the parameters of that particular model, it seems clear that consumers will value accumulating

financial knowledge early in life, even if they make no new investments thereafter.

       In sum, the theoretical literature on financial literacy has made strides in recent years by

endogenizing the process of financial knowledge acquisition, generating predictions that can be

tested empirically, and offering a coherent way to evaluate policy options. Moreover, these

models offer insights into how policymakers might enhance welfare by enhancing young

workers’ endowment of financial knowledge. In the next section, we turn to a review of

empirical evidence on financial literacy and how to measure it in practice.



3. Measuring Financial Literacy

       Several fundamental concepts lie at the root of saving and investment decisions as

modeled in the life cycle setting described in the previous section. Three such concepts are: (i)

numeracy and capacity to do calculations related to interest rates, such as compound interest;

(ii) understanding of inflation; and (iii) understanding of risk diversification. Translating these
                                                                                               9


into easily-measured financial literacy metrics is difficult, but Lusardi and Mitchell (2008,

2011b, c) have designed a standard set of questions around these ideas and implemented them in

numerous surveys in the United States and abroad.

       Four principles drove the design of these questions, namely Simplicity: The questions

should measure knowledge of the building blocks fundamental to decision-making in an

intertemporal setting; Relevance: The questions should relate to concepts pertinent to peoples’

day-to-day financial decisions over the life cycle; moreover, they must capture general rather

than context-specific ideas; Brevity: The number of questions must be kept short to secure

widespread adoption; and Capacity to differentiate: Questions must differentiate between

financial knowledge levels, so as to permit comparisons across people. These criteria are met by

the three financial literacy questions designed by Lusardi and Mitchell (2008, 2011b), whose

wording is reported below:

        Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per
       year. After 5 years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you
       left the money to grow: [more than $102, exactly $102, less than $102? Do not
       know, refuse to answer.]

        Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and
       inflation was 2% per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy: [more than,
       exactly the same as, or less than today with the money in this account? Do not
       know; refuse to answer.]

        Do you think that the following statement is true or false? ‘Buying a single
       company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.’ [Do not
       know; refuse to answer.]


The first question measures numeracy or the capacity to do a simple calculation related to

compounding of interest rates. The second question measures understanding of inflation, again in

the context of a simple financial decision. The third question is a joint test of knowledge about

‘stocks’ and ‘stock mutual funds’ and of risk diversification, since the answer to this question
                                                                                                                 10


depends on knowing what a stock is and that a mutual fund is composed of many stocks. As is

clear from the theoretical models described earlier, many decisions about retirement savings

must deal with financial markets. Accordingly, it is important to understand knowledge of the

stock market as well as differentiate between levels of financial knowledge.

        Naturally any measure of financial literacy will suffer from limitations, and it is clear that

financial literacy measures serve simply as proxies for what intertemporal models of financial

decision-making would posit that individuals will need to know, in order to properly optimize.13

Moreover, there is always the possibility of measurement error as well as the possibility that

answers might not measure ‘true’ financial knowledge. These concerns have implications for

empirical work on financial literacy, as will be discussed below.

Financial Literacy of Adults

        The three questions above were first piloted in a special financial literacy module of the

2004 Health and Retirement Study (HRS)14 on U.S. respondents age 50 and older. Results

indicated that the older U.S. population was quite financially illiterate: as described in Table 1,

only about half the HRS respondents age 50+ could answer the simple 2 percent calculation and

knew about inflation; only a third could answer all three questions correctly (Lusardi and

Mitchell 2011b). This is despite the fact that people in this age group would have made many

financial decisions and engaged in numerous financial transactions over their lifetimes.

Moreover, these respondents had experienced two or three periods of very high inflation

(depending on their ages) and had witnessed numerous economic and stock market shocks

(including the demise of Enron), which should have provided them with information about

investment risk.

   See Huston (2010) for a detailed discussion of financial literacy measures and a review of what has been proposed
so far.

Table 1 here

        These three questions were also added to several other U.S. surveys thereafter, including

the 2007–2008 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for young respondents (ages 23–28)

(Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010); the RAND American Life Panel (ALP) covering all ages

(Lusardi and Mitchell 2009); and the 2009 Financial Capability Study (Lusardi and Mitchell

2011d).15 Findings from these surveys underscore and extend the HRS results: for all groups, the

level of financial literacy in the U.S. is low.

        To supplement findings from these three questions, additional and more sophisticated

concepts have also been added to the repertoire of financial literacy questions. The FINRA

Financial Capability Survey includes a longer set of queries (Lusardi 2011), including two items

measuring sophisticated concepts such as understanding of mortgages/mortgage payments and

asset pricing. Results from this longer set of questions reveal additional gaps in knowledge: for

example, only a small percentage of Americans (21%) knows about the inverse relationship

between bond prices and interest rates. Additional studies exploring more complex but similar

financial knowledge measures include Kimball and Shumway (2006), Lusardi and Mitchell

(2009), Yoong (2011), Hung, Parker, and Yoong (2009), Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2012),

and the review in Huston (2010).16 Many of these measures include questions on the difference

between bonds and stocks, asset prices, and differences in returns and risks across financial

instruments. A pass/fail series of 28 questions covering knowledge of credit, saving patterns,

mortgages, and general financial management by Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) shows




15
  These questions were also added to the second wave of the FINRA Financial Capability Study in 2012.
16
  Surveys in other countries have also examined complex financial literacy concepts, see for example the Dutch
Central Bank Household Survey (Alessie, Van Rooij, and Lusardi 2011).
                                                                                                         12


that most people earn a failing score on these questions as well.17 Additional surveys have

examined financial knowledge in the context of debt, for example knowledge of interest

compounding, when interest rates can be rather high and therefore very salient. Lusardi and

Tufano (2009a, b) show that ‘debt literacy’ is low as well: only one-third of respondents knew

how long it would take for debt to double if one were to borrow at a 20 percent interest rate. This

lack of knowledge confirms conclusions from Moore’s (2003) survey of Washington state

residents where she finds that people frequently fail to understand interest compounding, along

with the terms and conditions of consumer loans and mortgages. Moreover, knowledge of risk

and risk diversification remains low even when the questions are formulated in many different

ways (c.f., Kimball and Shumway 2006; Yoong 2011; and Lusardi, Schneider and Tufano 2011).

In other words, all of these surveys confirm that most U.S. respondents are not financially

literate.

Financial Literacy among the Young

        As described in the earlier discussion of theoretical models, it would be useful to know

the level of financial knowledge at the start of the working life (Jappelli 2010). Several authors

have measured high school students’ financial literacy using data from the Jump$tart Coalition

for Personal Financial Literacy and the Council for Financial Education (CEE). Because these

studies include a long list of questions, they provide a quite nuanced evaluation of what students

know. Here too, as we have seen for their adult counterparts, most high school students in the

U.S. receive a failing grade in financial literacy (Mandell 2008; Markow and Bagnaschi 2005).

Similar findings are reported for financial literacy among college students (Chen and Volpe

1998; and Shim, Barber, Card, Xiao, and Serido 2010).

  Similar findings are reported for smaller samples or specific population subgroups (c.f. Agnew and Szykman
2011; Utkus and Young 2011).

International Evidence

        The goal of evaluating student financial knowledge around the world has recently been

taken up by the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), which in

2012 added a module on financial literacy. Accordingly, students across several nations will

soon be able to be compared in terms of their financial knowledge in addition to their knowledge

of math, science, and reading. In so doing, PISA has taken the position that financial literacy is

now recognized as an essential skill to be able to operate in today’s economy.18

        Rather more is known about adults’ financial literacy levels around the world, since the

three basic questions measuring financial knowledge have now been implemented in national

surveys in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden, Russia, Japan, and New Zealand (Lusardi

and Mitchell 2011c). Additionally they have been fielded in Australia (Agnew, Bateman, and

Thorp 2012; Bateman, Ebling, Geweke, Louviere, Satchell, and Thorp 2013), France (Arrondel,

Debbich, and Savignac 2012); Mexico and Chile (Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton 2008; Hastings

and Mitchell 2011; Behrman, Mitchell, Soo and Bravo 2012), India and Indonesia (Cole,

Sampson, and Zia 2011); and Switzerland (Brown and Graf 2012). They have also been used to

measure financial literacy among Sri Lankan entrepreneurs (de Mel, McKenzie, and Woodruff

2008) and a sample of U.S.-based migrants from El Salvador (Ashraf, Aycinena, Martinez, and

Yang 2011). The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2005)

confirmed extensive financial illiteracy in Europe, Australia, and Japan in an earlier survey.

More recently, Atkinson and Messy (2012) also find substantial financial illiteracy in 14

countries at different stages of development in four continents, using a ‘harmonized’ set of

financial literacy questions.19 In other words, low levels of financial literacy are evident around

the world.

        Rather than attempting to detail all existing financial literacy studies, we highlight and

summarize some key findings (see Figure 1). First, very few people across countries can answer

three basic financial literacy questions correctly. In the U.S., only 30 percent can do so, with

similar low percentages in countries having well-developed financial markets (Germany, the

Netherlands, Japan, and New Zealand), as well as in nations where financial markets are

changing rapidly (Russia). In other words, low levels of financial literacy found in the U.S. are

also prevalent elsewhere, rather than being specific to any given country or stage of economic

development. Moreover, many respondents say they ‘do not know’ the answers to the questions

(Lusardi and Mitchell 2011c).

Figure 1 here

        Second, knowledge of inflation is related to national historical experience. For example,

Italians and Germans are more likely to know the answer to the inflation question, whereas in

Japan, which has experienced deflation, many fewer people do so. Third, of the questions

examined, risk diversification is the concept people have the most difficulty grasping, Indeed,

virtually everywhere a high share of people respond that they ‘do not know’ the answer to the

risk diversification question; for example, in the U.S., 34 percent of respondents state they do not

know the answer to the risk diversification question, while in Germany 32 percent and in the

Netherlands 33 percent do so. The most risk-savvy population is to be found in Sweden which




19
  Their survey uses eight financial literacy questions and focuses on fundamental concepts including the three main
concepts discussed earlier.
                                                                                                       15


has privatized a component of its national Social Security system: here only 18 percent state that

they do not know the answer to the risk diversification question.20

        Third, research also notes that peoples’ responses to survey questions cannot always be

taken at face value, something well-known to psychometricians and economic statisticians. One

reason, as noted above, is that financial literacy may be measured with error, depending on the

way questions are worded. To test this possibility, Lusardi and Mitchell (2009) and van Rooij,

Lusardi, and Alessie (2011) randomly ask two groups of respondents the same risk question but

in different order. Thus half the group receives format (a) and the other half format (b), as

follows:

        (a) Buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual
            fund. True or false?
OR
        (b) Buying a stock mutual fund usually provides a safer return than a company
        stock. True or false?
Results show that people’s responses are, indeed, sensitive to how the question is worded, in

both the U.S. American Life Panel (Lusardi and Mitchell 2009) and the Dutch Central Bank

Household Survey (DHS; van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011). For example, fewer DHS

respondents answer correctly when the wording is ‘buying a stock mutual fund usually provides

a safer return than a company stock’; conversely, the fraction of correct responses doubles given

the alternative wording: ‘buying a company stock usually provides a safer return than a stock

mutual fund.’ This is not simply due to people using a crude rule of thumb (such as always

picking the first as the correct answer), since that would generate a lower rather than a higher

percentage of correct answers for version (a). Instead, it appears that some respondents do not

understand the question, perhaps because they are unfamiliar with stocks, bonds, and mutual

20
  Researchers have also examined answers to questions on mathematical numeracy in the England Longitudinal
Survey of Ageing (ELSA; Banks and Oldfield 2007), and in the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in
Europe (SHARE; Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula 2010).
                                                                                                                     16


funds. What this means is that some answers judged to be ‘correct’ may instead be attributable to

guessing. In other words, analysis of the financial literacy questions should take into account the

possibility that these measures may be noisy proxies of true financial knowledge levels. 21

         Another interesting feature of the data on financial literacy is that there is often a

substantial mismatch between peoples’ self-assessed knowledge versus their actual knowledge as

measured by correct answers to the financial literacy questions posed. As one example, several

surveys include questions asking people to indicate their self-assessed knowledge, as follows:

            On a scale from 1 to 7, where 1 means very low and 7 means very high, how would
             you assess your overall financial knowledge?’

Even though actual financial literacy levels are low, respondents are in general rather confident

of their financial knowledge. Indeed, overall, they tend to overestimate their levels of

knowledge. For instance in the 2009 U.S. Financial Capability Study, 70 percent of respondents

gave themselves score of 4 or higher (out of 7), but only 30 percent of the same people could

correctly answer the factual questions (Lusardi 2011). Similar findings are reported in other

surveys (Lusardi and Tufano 2009a) and they also obtain for Germany and the Netherlands (van

Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011; Bucher-Koenen and Lusardi 2011). In other words, though

actual financial literacy is low, most people are unaware of their own shortcomings.



4. Disaggregating Financial Literacy




21
  In the 2008 HRS the financial literacy questions were again modified to assess the sensitivity of peoples’ answers
to the way in which the questions were worded. Results confirm the sensitivity of question wording, especially for
the more sophisticated financial concepts (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2012). Behrman, Mitchell, Soo and Bravo
(2012) develop a financial literacy index employing a two-step weighting approach, whereby the first step weights
each question by difficulty and the second step applies principal components analysis to take into account
correlations across questions. Resulting scores indicate how financially literate each individual is, in relation to the
average and to specific questions asked. The results indicate that the basic financial literacy questions designed by
Lusardi and Mitchell (2011b) receive the greatest weights.
                                                                                                  17


       Next we turn to a disaggregated assessment of which particular subgroups may be most

likely to lack financial literacy, to draw out lessons about what might facilitate financial

knowledge acquisition. In what follows, we review evidence by income and employment status,

age and sex, race/ethnicity, and other factors of interest to researchers.

Patterns by Age

       The theoretical framework outlined above predicts a hump-shaped profile of financial

literacy over the life cycle, and survey data confirm that financial literacy is, in fact, lowest

among the young and the old. Earlier we made mention of the widespread lack of financial and

economic knowledge among high school students (Markow and Bagnaschi 2005; Mandell 1997,

2008). College and young adults also display low knowledge, confirming that many start their

working career with low levels of financial literacy (Chen and Volpe 1998; Lusardi, Mitchell,

and Curto 2010).

        At the other end of the work life, financial literacy also declines with age, as found in the

2004 HRS module on financial literacy on people age 50+ and in many other countries (Lusardi

and Mitchell 2011b, c). Of course with cross-sectional data, one cannot cleanly disentangle age

from cohort effects, and further analysis will be required to parse out these factors. Quite

remarkable, nonetheless, is the fact that older people are quite self-assured regarding their own

financial literacy, despite scoring worse on the basic financial literacy questions (Lusardi and

Mitchell 2011b; Lusardi and Tufano 2009a). Similarly, Finke, Howe, and Houston (2011)

develop a multidimensional measure of financial literacy for the old and confirm that, though

actual financial literacy falls with age, peoples’ confidence in their own financial decision-

making abilities actually increases with age. The mismatch between actual and perceived
                                                                                               18


knowledge might explain why financial scams are often perpetrated against the elderly (Deevy,

Lucich, and Beals 2012).

Patterns by Sex

       Several researchers exploring financial literacy patterns have also uncovered large sex

differences in financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell 2008, 2011d; Hsu 2011; Fonseca, Mullen,

Zamarro, and Zissimopolous 2012; Hung, Yoong, and Brown (2012); Bucher-Koenen, Lusardi,

Alessie, and Vvan Rooij 2012). Interestingly, financial literacy differences by sex are found in

over a dozen countries as different as the United States, Sweden, Italy, Russia, and New Zealand,

as well as elsewhere (Atkinson and Messy 2012). Not only are older men generally more

financially knowledgeable than older women, but similar patterns show up among younger

respondents as well (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2010; Lusardi and Mitchell 2009; Lusardi and

Tufano 2009a, b); Moreover, the gaps persist irrespective of whether one uses the basic literacy

questions or the more sophisticated ones (Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto 2012; Hung, Parker, and

Yoong 2009).

       A twist on the differences by sex, however, is that while women are less likely to answer

financial literacy questions correctly than men, they are also far more likely to say they ‘do not

know’ an answer to a question, a result that is strikingly consistent across countries. For

example, in the United States, about one quarter (26 percent) of men answered the risk

diversification question with ‘I do not know,’ but almost half (47 percent) of the women chose ‘I

do not know’ as an answer. In the Netherlands, the percentages of ‘do not know’ to the risk

diversification question are 26 percent for men and 42 percent for women; in Germany, 26

percent for men and 38 percent for women; the overall percentages are lower in Sweden but still

higher for women (15 percent for men, 22 percent for women); and in Japan, 49 percent of men
                                                                                               19


and 63 percent of women say ‘I do not know.’ And women are far more likely to rate themselves

as having low financial knowledge, consistent with their high prevalence of ‘do not know’

responses. This awareness of their own lack of knowledge may make women ideal targets for

financial education programs.

       Because these sex differences in financial literacy are so persistent and widespread across

surveys and countries, several researchers have sought to explain them. Consistent with the

theoretical framework described earlier, Hsu (2011) proposes that some sex differences may be

rational, with specialization of labor within the household leading married women to build up

financial knowledge only late in life (close to widowhood). Nonetheless, this model does not

explain why financial literacy is also lower among single women in charge of their own finances.

Studies of financial literacy in high school and college also reveal sex differences in financial

literacy early in life (Chen and Volpe 2002; Mandell 2008). Other researchers seeking to

evaluate the reasons for observed sex differences conclude that traditional explanations cannot

fully account for the observed male/female knowledge gap (Fonseca, Mullen, Zamarro, and

Zissimopolous 2012; Bucher-Koenen, Lusardi, Alessie, and van Rooij 2012). Fonseca, Mullen,

Zamarro, and Zissimopoulos (2012) suggest that women may acquire or ‘produce’ financial

literacy differently from men, and Bucher-Koenen, Lusardi, Alessie, and van Rooij (2012) point

to a potentially important role for self-confidence which differs by sex.

       To shed more light on women’s financial literacy, Mahdavi (2012) examines alumnae

from a highly selective U.S. women’s liberal arts college. Even in this talented and well-

educated group, women’s financial literacy was found to be very low. In other words, even very

well educated women are not particularly financially literate, which could imply that women

may acquire financial literacy differently from men. Nevertheless this issue is far from closed,
                                                                                                20


and additional research is warranted to more fully explain the observed sex differences in

financial literacy.

Patterns by Education and Ability

           Researchers have also found substantial differences in financial knowledge by education:

specifically, those without a college education are much less likely to grasp advanced financial

concepts such as risk diversification (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, 2011b); moreover, numeracy

is especially lacking among those with low educational attainment (Christelis, Jappelli, and

Padula 2010). How to interpret the finding of a positive link between education and financial

savvy has been subject to some debate in the economics literature. One possibility is that the

positive correlation could be driven by cognitive ability (c.f. McArdle, Smith, and Willis 2009).

In turn, this implies that one must control on an ability measure when evaluating the potential

impact of financial literacy. Fortunately, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY)

includes both measures of financial literacy and of cognitive ability (i.e., the Armed Services

Vocational Aptitude Battery). Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2010) report a positive correlation

between financial literacy and cognitive ability among young NLSY respondents, but they also

show that cognitive factors do not fully account for the variance in financial literacy. In other

words, substantial heterogeneity in financial literacy remains even after controlling on cognitive

factors.

Patterns by Income and Work Status

           Financial literacy varies strongly with income (Lusardi and Tufano 2009a) as well as by

employment type. Around the world, financial literacy is usually higher for employees than for

the non-employed (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011c). Additionally, financial literacy is usually as
                                                                                                21


high, or even higher, among the self-employed than the non-employed. This may be the result of

learning on the job and in the workplace.

Other Patterns

       Many financial literacy studies report marked differences by race and ethnicity, with

African Americans and Hispanics displaying the lowest level of financial knowledge in the U.S.

context (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, b, 2011d). These findings hold true across age groups and

across many different measures of financial literacy (Lusardi and Mitchell 2009). It is also the

case that people from rural areas score worse on financial literacy studies (Klapper and Panos

2011), perhaps reflecting the fact that city-dwellers differ from those residing in rural areas. If

financial literacy is more easily acquired via interactions with others (assuming little formal

instruction in schools), living in areas of high population density might offer an advantage. This

might also help account for the sex differences mentioned above, since in many cultures, men are

more likely than women to interact daily with financially knowledgeable individuals. Relatedly,

there are also important geographic differences in financial literacy: for example, Fornero and

Monticone (2011) report large differences in financial literacy across regions in Italy, and

Bumcrot, Lin, and Lusardi (2011) note differences across U.S. states, suggesting that local

policies may matter for financial literacy.

       The literature also points to differences in financial literacy by family background. For

instance, using the NLSY, Lusardi, Mitchell, and Curto (2010) link financial literacy of 23-28-

year-olds to characteristics of the households in which they grew up, controlling for a set of

demographic and economic characteristics. Respondents’ financial literacy proves to be strongly

and significantly correlated with parental education (in particular, that of their mothers), and

whether their parents held stocks or retirement accounts when the respondents were teenagers.
                                                                                                            22


Mahdavi (2012) also finds a connection between financial literacy and parental background; in

this case, fathers’ education is positively associated with their female children’s financial

literacy.22 In other words, financial literacy may well get its start in the family, perhaps when

children observe their parents’ saving and investing habits, or more directly by receiving

financial education from parents (Chiteji and Stafford 1999; Li 2009; Shim, Xiao, Barber, and

Lyons 2009).

        To summarize, financial illiteracy is not only widespread but also particularly notable

among specific population sub-groups. Accordingly, this heterogeneity in financial literacy

suggests that different mechanisms may be appropriate for tracking the causes and possible

consequences of the shortfalls. In the U.S., those facing most challenges are the young and the

old, women, African-Americans, Hispanics, the least educated, and those living in rural areas. To

date, these differences have not been fully accounted for, though the theoretical framework

outlined above provides some guidelines for disentangling some of these.



 5. How Does Financial Literacy Matter?

        We turn next to a discussion of whether and how financial literacy matters for economic

 decision-making.23 Inasmuch as new financial products are always arriving to market, and

 individuals are increasingly being asked to take on additional responsibility for their own

 financial well-being, there remains much to learn about these patterns. And, as we have argued,

 if financial literacy itself is a choice variable, it is important to disentangle cause from effect.

 For instance, those with high net worth who invest in financial markets may also be more likely

 to care about improving their financial knowledge as they have more at stake. In what follows,

22
   Other studies discussing financial socialization of the young include Hira, Sabri, and Loibl (2013) and the
references cited therein.
23
   For an earlier analysis of the importance of financial literacy, see Hira (2010) and the work cited therein.
                                                                                                                23


 we discuss research linking financial literacy with economic outcomes, taking into account the

 endogeneity issues which are paramount.

Financial Literacy and Consumer Behavior

        The early economics literature in this area began by documenting important links

between financial literacy and several economic behaviors. For example Bernheim (1995, 1998)

was among the first to emphasize that most U.S. households lack basic financial knowledge,

leading them to use crude rules of thumb when engaging in saving behavior. More recently,

using Swedish data, Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007, 2009) evaluate investors’ actions they

classify as ‘mistakes,’ overcoming in this way the problem of causality between financial literacy

and behavior. While these studies includes no direct financial literacy measure, the authors do

find that poorer, less educated, and immigrant households (characteristics associated with low

financial literacy) are more likely to make financial mistakes. Agarwal, Driscoll, Gabaix, and

Laibson (2009) also focus on financial ‘mistakes’, as will be discussed in more detail below, and

show that these are most prevalent among the young and the old. Several studies mentioned

earlier have shown these are the groups with the least financial knowledge.

        Moreover, the U.S. federal government has begun to express substantial concern about

another and more extreme case of mistakes, where people fall prey to financial scams. As many

have noted, scams are often perpetrated against the elderly since they are among those with the

least financial savvy.24 For example, a survey of older financial decision makers (age 60+)

showed that over half reported having made a bad investment, and one in five of those

respondents felt they were misled or defrauded but often fail to report the situation (FINRA

24
   In 2011 Americans submitted over 1.5 million complaints about financial and other fraud, up 62 percent in just
three years; these counts are also likely understatements (FTC 2012). Financial losses per capita due to fraud have
also increased over time: the median loss per victim rose from $218 in 2002 to $537 in 2011. Similarly the SEC
(2012) warns about scams and fraud and other potential consequences of very low financial literacy, particularly
among the most vulnerable groups.
                                                                                                    24


2006). As Baby Boomers age, this problem is expected to grow (Blanton 2012): this cohort is a

potentially lucrative target inasmuch as it is enormous, including some 75 million people; it is

relatively well-off and has access to its pension wealth; and it is not financially literate yet thinks

itself quite knowledgeable.

      Several researchers have explored the link between financial literacy and economic

behavior directly, though often without accounting for the endogeneity issue noted above. For

instance, Hilgert, Hogarth, and Beverly (2003) uncover strong correlation between financial

literacy and day-to-day financial management skills. Moreover, there is evidence that the more

numerate and financially literate are also more likely to participate in financial markets and

invest in stocks (Kimball and Shumway 2006; Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula 2010; van Rooij,

Lusardi, and Alessie 2011; Yoong 2011; Almenberg and Dreber 2011; Arrondel, Debbich, and

Savignac 2012). It has also been shown that those who are more financially literate are also

more likely to undertake retirement planning, and those who plan also accumulate more wealth

(Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, b, 2011a, b). This last finding has been replicated in many other

datasets and for additional sub-groups of the population in the U.S. (Lusardi and Mitchell 2008,

2009, 2011d), as well as internationally (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011c). It is also robust to the

measure of financial literacy used (basic versus sophisticated financial knowledge; Lusardi and

Mitchell 2009, 2011d), how planning is measured (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a, 2009, 2011b;

Alessie, van Rooij, and Lusardi 2011), and which controls are included (van Rooij, Lusardi, and

Alessie 2011).

       Of all the specific components of a financial literacy measure, what matters most is

advanced financial knowledge (for example, risk diversification) and the capacity to do

calculations (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011d; Alessie, van Rooij, and Lusardi 2011; Fornero and
                                                                                                  25


Monticone 2011; Klapper and Panos 2011; Sekita 2011). Moreover, financial literacy is not

related to simple decisions such as having a checking account (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula

2010), but it is linked to complex portfolio decisions. For instance experimental studies in

Mexico and Chile show that more financially literate individuals are more likely to choose

pension accounts with lower administrative fees (Hastings and Tejeda-Ashton 2008; Hastings

and Mitchell 2011; Hastings, Mitchell, and Chyn 2011). More financially sophisticated

individuals are less affected by the choices of peers in their financial decisions (Bursztyn, Ederer,

Ferman, and Yuchtman 2013)

       A smaller subset of empirical studies has accounted for the endogeneity of financial

literacy and also the fact that financial literacy may be measured with error. To this end, some

authors use instrumental variables (IV) estimation to estimate the impact of financial literacy on

financial behavior. For instance, van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2011) assess the relationship

between financial literacy and stock market participation; their instruments are the financial

experiences of siblings and parents, since these are arguably not under respondents’ control. The

authors report that instrumenting greatly enhances the measured positive impact of financial

literacy on stock market participation. Christiansen, Joensen, and Rangvid (2008) use the

opening of a new university in a local area as instrument for knowledge, and they conclude that

economics education is an important determinant of investment in stocks. Other authors have

used similar empirical strategies to estimate the effects of financial literacy on behavior. For

example, Lusardi and Mitchell (2009) instrument financial literacy using the fact that different

U.S. states mandated financial education in high school at different points in time and they

interact these mandates with state expenditures on education. Bucher-Koenen and Lusardi (2011)

use political attitudes at the regional level in Germany; the latter have a role in financial
                                                                                              26


decision-making (for example, more free-market oriented supporters are more likely to invest in

stocks, and the assumption is that individuals can learn from others around them). Interestingly,

in all these cases, the IV financial literacy estimates are always larger than the ordinary least

squares estimates, suggesting that the effect of financial literacy reported by many authors may

be an underestimate of the true effect.

       One might worry that other omitted variables might still influence financial decisions in

ways that could bias results. For example, unobservables such as discount rates (Meier and

Sprenger 2008), IQ (Grinblatt, Keloharju, and Linnainmaa 2011), or cognitive abilities can

influence saving decisions and portfolio choice (Delavande, Rohwedder, and Willis 2008;

Korniotis and Kumar 2011). Yet the analysis of panel data by Alessie, van Rooij, and Lusardi

(2011) using both fixed-effect regression and IV estimation continues to confirm the positive

effect of financial literacy on retirement planning.

       Turning to efforts to judge the effect of financial literacy on wealth accumulation,

Behrman, Mitchell, Soo, and Bravo (2012) evaluate the effects of financial literacy of

respondents of all ages on wealth holdings, and they employ several instruments including

exposure to a new educational voucher system in Chile to isolate the causal effects of financial

literacy and schooling attainment on wealth. Their results show that both financial literacy and

schooling attainment are positively and significantly associated with wealth outcomes.

Moreover, their IV estimates indicate even more potent effects of financial literacy on wealth

than suggested by ordinary least-squares regression estimates. Similar findings are reported in

van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2012), which also report potent effects of financial literacy on

wealth using IV estimates.
                                                                                                  27


        A different way of estimating the effects of financial literacy on economic outcomes has

been to use field experiments, in which one group of individuals (the treatment group) is exposed

to a financial education program and then their behavior is compared to a second group not thus

exposed (the control group). These studies are discussed in detail in a later section of this paper;

for now, it suffices to note that even in countries with less developed financial markets and

pension systems, financial literacy impacts are similar to those found when examining the effect

of financial literacy on retirement planning and pension participation (Lusardi and Mitchell

2011c). For example, Song (2011) shows that learning about interest compounding produces a

sizeable increase in pension contributions in China.

       The financial crisis has also provided a laboratory to study the effects of financial literacy

against a backdrop of economic shocks. For example, when stock markets dropped sharply

around the world, investors were exposed to large losses in their portfolios. This combined with

much higher unemployment has made it even more important to be savvy in managing limited

resources. Bucher-Koenen and Ziegelmeyer (2011) examine the financial losses experienced by

German households during the financial crisis and confirm that the least financially literate were

more likely to sell assets that had lost value, thus locking in losses. In Russia, Klapper, Lusardi,

and Panos (2012) find that the most financially literate are significantly less likely to report

having experienced diminished spending capacity and have more available saving. Additionally,

estimates in different time periods suggest that financial literacy better equips individuals to deal

with macroeconomic shocks.

       Financial literacy has been found to affect not only the asset side of the household

balance sheet, but also the liability side; indeed, here some of the strongest effects of financial

literacy may be found. As financial markets opened up over the past two decades, people gained
                                                                                                                 28


unprecedented access to credit and borrowing opportunities; this in turn demanded more

financial savvy since interest rates charged on debt are normally higher than interest paid on

saving. Moreover, high-cost methods of borrowing have proliferated over time.25 Some

researchers focus on what they call peoples’ financial ‘mistakes,’ as in Agarwal, Driscoll,

Gabaiz, and Laibson (2009). The large number of mortgage defaults during the financial crisis

has likewise suggested to some that debt and debt management is a fertile area for mistakes. For

instance, recent surveys suggest that many borrowers do not know what interest rates are charged

on their credit cards or mortgages (Moore 2003; Lusardi 2011; Disney and Gathergood 2012).

        While much research documents correlations between financial literacy and behavior

toward debt, it is again important to correct for the potential endogeneity of financial literacy as

well as the problem of measurement error. Most studies to date have not done so, suggesting a

possible avenue for future research. Moore (2003) reports that the least financially literate are

also more likely to have costly mortgages; this pattern is reiterated by Gerardi, Goette, and Meier

(2010) who further show that those with low numeracy are more likely to default on subprime

mortgages. Campbell (2006) points out that those with lower income and less education

(characteristics strongly related to financial illiteracy) are less likely to refinance their mortgages

during a period of falling interest rates. Stango and Zinman (2009) conclude that those unable to

correctly calculate interest rates out of a stream of payments end up borrowing more and

accumulating less wealth. Lusardi and Tufano (2009a) confirm that the least financially savvy

incur high transaction costs, paying higher fees and using high-cost borrowing. In their study, the

less knowledgeable also report their debt loads as excessive, or that they are unable to judge their

debt positions. Mottola (2012) finds that women with low financial literacy are more likely than

25
   The alternative financial services (AFS) industry has experienced tremendous growth in the United States: in
2009, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimated the industry to be worth at least $320 billion in terms of
transactional services (FDIC 2009).
                                                                                              29


men to engage in costly credit card behavior, and Utkus and Young (2011) conclude that the

least literate are also more likely to borrow against their 401(k) and pension accounts. Lusardi

and de Bassa Scheresberg (2012) examine those who undertake high-cost borrowing in the U.S.,

including payday loans, pawn shops, auto title loans, refund anticipation loans, and rent-to-own

shops. Those who are less financially literate are substantially more likely to use high-cost

methods of borrowing. Similar patterns arise in the U.K. where Disney and Gathergood (2012)

report that consumer credit customers systematically underestimate the cost of borrowing, while

the least financially literate have higher average debt-to-income ratios.

       Research on both stock holdings and high-cost methods of borrowing involving the

potential for high returns or high costs has suggested that educational attainment can be quite

influential. For example, those with a college degree are more likely to own stocks and less

prone to use high-cost borrowing (Haliassos and Bertaut 1995; Campbell 2006; Lusardi and de

Bassa Scheresberg 2012). Similarly, there is a very strong correlation between education and

wealth-holding (Bernheim and Scholz 1993). For our purposes, however, it is important to note

that controlling for educational attainment in empirical models of stock holding, wealth

accumulation, and high-cost methods of borrowing, does not diminish the statistical significance

of financial literacy, while often it enhances it (Lusardi and Mitchell 2011b; Behrman, Mitchell,

Soo, and Bravo 2012; van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie 2011, 2012; Lusardi and de Bassa

Scheresberg 2012). Evidently, both general knowledge (education) and more specialized

knowledge (financial literacy) both contribute to more informed financial decision-making.

Accordingly, investment in financial knowledge appears to be a specific form of human capital.

       Similarly, recognizing that financial literacy may be an important skill in an aging

population, some authors have also linked financial literacy to demand for on-the-job training
                                                                                                 30


(Clark, Ogawa, and Matsukura 2010). Others have examined financial vulnerability and looked

at the potential link with financial literacy (Lusardi, Schneider, and Tufano 2011). These are all

potential avenues for future work.

Costs of Financial Ignorance Pre-retirement

        In the wake of the financial crisis, many have become interested in the costs of financial

illiteracy as well as its distributional impacts. For instance, financial literacy can explain more

than half the wealth inequality observed in U.S. data (Lusardi, Michaud, and Mitchell 2013). In

the Netherlands, van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2011) estimate that being in the 75th versus the

25th percentile of the financial literacy index equals around €80,000 in terms of differential net

worth (i.e., roughly 3.5 times the net disposable income of a median Dutch household). They

also point out that an increase in financial literacy from the 25th to the 75th percentile for an

otherwise average individual is associated with a 17-30 percentage point higher probability of

stock market participation and retirement planning, respectively. For this reason, if the effects of

financial literacy on financial behavior can be taken as causal, the costs of financial ignorance

are substantial.

        In the U.S., investors are estimated to have foregone substantial equity returns due to

fees, expenses, and active investment trading costs, in an attempt to ‘beat the market.’ French

(2008) calculates that this amounts to an annual total cost of around $100 billion which could be

avoided by passively indexing. Since the least financially literate are unlikely to be sensitive to

fees, they are likely to bear such costs disproportionately. Additionally, many of the financially

illiterate have been shown to shun the stock market, which Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (2005)

suggest can impose welfare losses amounting to 4 percent of wealth. The economic cost of

under-diversification computed by Calvet, Campbell, and Sodini (2007) is also substantial: they
                                                                                                31


conclude that a median investor in Sweden experienced an annual return loss of 2.9 percent on a

risky portfolio, or 0.5 percent of household disposable income. But for one in 10 investors, these

annual costs were much higher, 4.5 percent of disposable income.

       Costs arise not only in the saving and investment arena, but also in the way that

consumers manage their liabilities. Campbell (2006) reports that suboptimal refinancing among

U.S. homeowners resulted in 0.5–1 percent per year higher mortgage interest rates, or in

aggregate, $50–100 billion annually. And as noted above, the least financially savvy will be

least likely to refinance their mortgages. Gerardi, Goette, and Meier (2010) show that numerical

ability may have contributed substantially to the massive amount of defaults on subprime

mortgages in the recent financial crisis. According to their estimates, those in the highest

numerical ability grouping have about a 20 percentage point lower probability of defaulting on

their subprime mortgages than those in the lowest financial numeracy group.

       One can also link ‘debt literacy’ regarding credit card behaviors that generate fees and

interest charges to paying bills late, going over the credit limit, using cash advances, and paying

only the minimum amount due. Lusardi and Tufano (2009a) show that, while less knowledgeable

individuals constitute only 29 percent of the cardholder population, they account for 42 percent

of these charges. Accordingly, the least financially savvy bear a disproportionate share of the

costs associated with fee-inducing behaviors. Indeed, the average fees paid by those with low

knowledge are 50 percent higher than those paid by the average cardholder. And of these four

types of charges incurred by the less-knowledgeable cardholders, one-third are incremental

charges linked to low financial literacy.
                                                                                                               32


        Another way that the financially illiterate spend dearly for financial services is via high-

cost forms of borrowing, including payday loans.26 While the amount borrowed is often low

($300 on average), such loans are often made to individuals who have five or more such

transactions per year (Center for Responsible Lending 2004). It turns out that these borrowers

also frequently fail to take advantage of other, cheaper opportunities to borrow. Agarwal, Skiba,

and Tobacman (2009) study payday borrowers who also have access to credit cards, and they

find that two-thirds of their sample had at least $1,000 in credit card liquidity on the day they

took out their first payday loan. This points to a pecuniary mistake: given average charges for

payday loans and credit cards and considering a two-week payday loan of $300, the use of credit

cards would have saved these borrowers substantial amounts – around $200 per year (and more

if they took out repeated payday loans). While there may be good economic reasons why some

people may want to keep below their credit card limits, including unexpected shocks, Bertrand

and Morse (2011) determine that payday borrowers often labor under cognitive biases, similar to

those with low financial literacy (Lusardi and de Bassa Scheresberg 2012).

Costs of Financial Ignorance in Retirement

        Our discussion of the impact of financial ignorance thus far has focused on how financial

knowledge impacts key outcomes including borrowing, saving, and investing decisions during

the worklife. Yet financial knowledge also appears to pay off later in life, during the retirement

period. Given that people over the age of 65 hold more than $18 trillion in wealth,27 this is an

important issue.




26
   Americans paid about $8 billion in finance charges to borrow more than $50 billion from payday lenders in 2007;
the annual interest rates on such loans are often very high, over 400%. See Bertrand and Morse (2011) and the
references therein.
27
   See for instance Laibson (2011).
                                                                                                                      33


         Above we noted that financial literacy is associated with greater retirement planning and

greater retirement wealth accumulation.28 Hence it stands to reason that the more financially

savvy will likely be better financially endowed when they do retire. A related point is that the

more financially knowledgeable are also better informed about pension system rules, pay lower

investment fees in their retirement accounts, and diversify their pension assets better (Arenas de

Mesa, Bravo, Behrman, Mitchell, and Todd 2008; Chan and Stevens 2008; Hastings, Mitchell,

and Chyn 2011).29 To date, however, relatively little has been learned about whether more

financially knowledgeable older adults are also more successful at managing their resources in

retirement.

         This is a particularly difficult set of decisions, since retirees must look ahead to a future

of uncertainty when making irrevocable choices with far-reaching consequences. For instance,

people must forecast their (and their partner’s) survival probabilities, investment returns, pension

income, and medical and other expenditures. Moreover, many of these financial decisions are

once-in-a-lifetime events, including when to retire and claim one’s pension and Social Security

benefits. Accordingly, it would not be surprising if financial literacy enhanced peoples’ ability to

make these important decisions later in life.

         This question is especially relevant when it comes to the decision of whether retirees

purchase lifetime income streams with their assets, since by so doing, they insure themselves


28
   See for instance Ameriks, Caplin, and Leahy (2003); van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie (2012); and Lusardi and
Mitchell (2007a, b; 2009). It is worth noting that education also plays a role, as pointed out by Poterba, Venti, and
Wise (2013) who find a substantial association between education and the post-retirement evolution of assets. For
example, for two-person households, assets growth between 1998 and 2008 was greater for college graduates than
for those with less than a high school degree, producing over $600,000 in assets for the richest quintile, to $82,000
for the lowest asset quintile. As in the theoretical model described previously, households with different levels of
education will invest in different assets, allowing them to earn different rates of return. It remains to be seen whether
this is because of differential financial literacy investments, or simply due to general knowledge gleaned through
education.
29
   Gustman, Steinmeier, and Tabatabai (2010) note that financial knowledge is not the same thing as cognitive
functioning, since the latter is not associated with greater knowledge of retirement plan rules.
                                                                                                                       34


from running out of income in old age.30 Nevertheless, despite the fact that this form of longevity

protection is very valuable in theory, relatively few payout annuities are purchased in practice in

virtually every country (Mitchell, Piggott, and Takayama 2011). This is partly because people

have been shown to be susceptible to framing and default effects (Agnew and Szkyman 2011;

Brown, Kapteyn, and Mitchell 2013). This conclusion is corroborated and extended by Brown,

Kapteyn, Luttmer, and Mitchell (2011), who demonstrate experimentally that people value

annuities less when they are offered the opportunity to buy additional income streams, but the

same people value annuities more if offered a chance to exchange their annuity flows for a lump

sum.31 Importantly for the present purpose, the financially savvy provide more consistent

responses across alternative ways of eliciting preferences. By contrast, the least financially

literate give inconsistent results and respond to irrelevant cues when presented with the same set

of choices. In other words, financial literacy appears to be highly influential in helping older

households equip themselves with longevity risk protection in retirement.

         Much more must be learned about how peoples’ financial decision-making abilities

change with age, and how these are related to financial literacy. For instance, Agarwal, Driscoll,

Gabaix, and Laibson (2009) report that the elderly pay much more than the middle-aged for 10

financial products.32 Thus the 75-year-olds in their sample pay about $265 more per year for

home equity lines of credit than do the 50-year-olds. How this varies by financial literacy is not



30
   Several authors have also linked financial literacy and knowledge about retirement saving. For instance, Agnew,
Szykman, Utkus, and Young (2007) show that employees who were the least financially knowledgeable were 34
percent less likely to participate voluntarily, and 11 percent less likely to be automatically enrolled, in their in their
company’s 401(k) plan.
31
    These findings are not attributable to differences in individuals’ subjective life expectancies, discount rates, risk
aversion, borrowing constraints, political risk, or other conventional explanations (Brown, Kapteyn, Luttmer, and
Mitchell 2011).
32
    These include credit card balance transfers; home equity loans and lines of credit; auto loans; credit card interest
rates; mortgages; small business credit cards; credit card late-payment fees; credit card over-limit fees; and credit
card cash-advance fees.

yet known, but it might be that those with greater baseline financial knowledge are better

protected as they move into the second half of their lifetimes.33

        Given the substantial evidence on the likely costs of financial illiteracy, we turn next to

financial education programs and examine what works.



6. Assessing the Effects of Financial Literacy Programs

        Financial education programs in the U.S. and elsewhere have been implemented over the

years in a variety of settings -- in schools, the workplace, libraries, and sometimes targeting

specific subgroups of the population. As one example, several U.S. states mandated financial

education in high school at different points in time, generating ‘natural experiments’ studied by

Berhneim, Garrett, and Maki (2001). Similarly, financial education in high schools has recently

been piloted and studied in several countries including Brazil and Italy (Bruhn, Legovini, and Zia

2012; Romagnoli and Trifilidis 2012). In some cases, large U.S. firms have launched financial

education programs including those examined by Bernheim and Garrett (2003), Clark and

D’Ambrosio (2008), and Clark, Morrill, and Allen (2012a,b). Often the employer’s intention is

to boost DC plan saving and participation (Duflo and Saez 2003, 2004; Lusardi, Keller, and

Keller 2008; Goda, Manchester, and Sojourner 2012). Programs have also been adopted for

especially vulnerable groups such as those in financial distress (Collins and O’Rourke 2010).

        Over the years a handful of authors have sought to summarize the impacts of financial

education programs.34 Rather than detailing all of the studies covered there, we instead highlight



33
   This could be particularly important inasmuch as Korniotis and Kumar (2011) find that cognitive decline is fastest
with age for the less educated, lower earners, and minority racial/ethnic groups.
34
   See for instance Collins and O’Rourke (2010); Gale, Harris and Levine (2012); Hastings, Madrian, and
Skimmyhorn (2012); Hathaway and Khatiwada (2008); Lusardi and Mitchell (2007b); Lyons, Palmer, Jayaratne,
and Scherpf (2006); and Martin (2007). Hira (2010) provides a broad overview of research on financial education
over a long time span.
                                                                                                               36


the key issues which future researchers must take into account when evaluating the effectiveness

of financial education programs.35 We also touch on key recent research not reviewed in prior

surveys.

        A concern emphasized in Section 2, above, is that evaluation studies are sometimes

conducted in the absence of a theoretical model explaining how financial knowledge is

developed. That is, if we define financial literacy as a form of human capital investment, it

stands to reason that some will find it optimal to invest in financial literacy but others will not.

Accordingly, if a program were to be judged based on specific behavioral changes such as

increasing retirement saving or participation in retirement accounts, it must be recognized that

the program is both theoretically and practically unlikely to change everyone’s behavior in the

same way.36 For example, a desired outcome from a financial education program might be to

boost saving. Yet for some, it may not be optimal to save; instead, such persons might rationally

reduce their debt. Unless an evaluator focuses on this larger concept of saving, however, a

program might be (incorrectly) judged a failure.

        A related concern is that, since such a large portion of the population is not financially

knowledgeable about the basic concepts of interest compounding, inflation, and risk

diversification, it is unlikely that short exposure to financial literacy training would make much

of a dent in consumers’ decision-making prowess. For this reason, offering a few retirement

seminars or sending employees to a benefit fair may be judged as relatively ineffective (Duflo

and Saez 2003, 2004). Moreover, this raises the issue of cost-benefit considerations, which to

date have rarely been undertaken in the field. It is also worth remembering that the root causes


35
   Two good discussions by Fox, Bartholomae, and Lee (2005) and Lyons and Neelakantan (2008) highlight the
limitations of existing financial education program evaluations.
36
   Moreover, practitioner discussions often equate success as ‘financial capability,’ a term often identified with
behavior change rather than knowledge.
                                                                                                     37


of financial illiteracy still must be better understood: for instance, the sex gap in financial literacy

still requires additional explanation.

    The evidence reported previously also shows there is vast heterogeneity, both in financial

behavior and also in financial literacy. Rarely do programs account for such important baseline

differences, yet programs that target specific groups are likely to be more effective than one-size-

fits-all financial education programs. For example, Lusardi, Michaud and Mitchell (2013) show

that there is substantial heterogeneity in individual behavior so that given the costs and benefits

of financial literacy, not everyone would gain from financial education. Thus we should not

expect a 100 percent participation rate in financial education programs. That is, people differ one

from another, and they have different preferences and economic circumstances. Accordingly,

saving should optimally be at zero (or negative) sometimes, and financial education programs in

this case would not be expected to change that behavior. In this respect, the model delivers an

important prediction: in order to change behavior, financial education programs must be targeted

to specific groups of the population.

       As in other fields of economic research, program evaluations must be rigorous if they are

to persuasively establish causality and effectiveness. As noted by Collins and O’Rourke (2010),

the ‘golden rule’ of evaluation is the experimental approach in which a ‘treatment’ group

exposed to financial literacy education is compared with a ‘control’ group that is not (or that is

exposed to a different treatment). Thus far, unfortunately, few financial educational programs

have been designed or evaluated with these standards in mind, making it difficult to draw

inferences.

       A related point is that confounding factors may bias estimated impacts unless the

evaluation is carefully structured. As an example, we point to the debate over the efficacy of
                                                                                                 38


teaching financial literacy in high school, a discussion that will surely be fed by the new

financial literacy module in the 2012 PISA mentioned above. Some have argued against financial

education in school (e.g., Willis 2008), drawing on the findings from the Jump$tart Coalition for

Personal Financial Literacy (Mandell 2004, 2008). The Jump$tart studies concluded that students

scored no better in financial literacy tests even if they attended school in states having financial

education; in fact, in some cases, Mandell (1997, 2008) found that they scored even worse than

students in states lacking these programs. Yet subsequent analyses (see Walstad, Rebeck, and

MacDonald 2010) and the references therein) point out that this research was incomplete, since it

did not account for course content, test measurement, teacher preparation, and amount of

instruction. These points are underscored by Tennyson and Nguyen (2001) who revisit the

Jump$tart analysis by looking more closely at state education requirements for personal finance

education. They conclude that when students are mandated to take a financial education course,

they perform much better than students in states with no personal finance mandates.

Accordingly, there is reason to believe that mandating personal finance education may, in fact,

be effective in increasing student knowledge -- but only when it requires significant exposure to

personal finance concepts.

       It is likewise risky to draw inferences without knowing about the quality of teaching in

these courses. For instance, Way and Holden (2009) examine data from more than 1,200 K–12

teachers, prospective teachers, and teacher education faculty representing four census regions,

along with teachers’ responses to questions about their personal and educational backgrounds in

financial education. Almost all of the teachers recognized the importance of and need for

financial education, yet fewer than one-fifth stated they were prepared to teach any of the six

personal finance concepts normally included in the educational rubrics. Furthermore, prospective
                                                                                               39


teachers felt least competent in the more technical topics including risk management and

insurance, as well as saving and investing. Interestingly, these are also the concepts that the

larger adult population struggles with, as noted above. That study concludes that state education

mandates appear to have no effect on whether teachers take courses in personal finance, teach the

courses, or feel competent to teach such a course, consistent with the fact that the states

mandating high school financial education do not necessarily provide or promote teacher training

in the field.

          One might also investigate whether the knowledge scores tested actually measure what is

taught in school and whether students self-select into financial education classes. Walstad,

Rebeck, and MacDonald (2010) use a quasi-experimental set up to assess a well-designed video

course covering several fundamental concepts for both students and teachers. The test they

employ is aligned with what was taught in school and measures the initial level of understanding

of personal finance so as to capture improvements in financial knowledge. Results indicate a

significant increase in personal finance knowledge among the ‘treated’ students, suggesting that

carefully crafted experiments can and do detect important improvements in knowledge. This is

an area that certainly requires more research of the type proposed by Collins and O’Rourke

(2010).

          If anything, evaluating workplace financial education presents even greater problems. It

does appear that employees who attend a retirement seminar are much more likely to save and

contribute to pension accounts (Bernheim and Garrett 2003). Nevertheless, those who attend

such seminars are unlikely to be randomly drawn from the entire working population. In other

words, since attendance is voluntary, those who attend may already have a proclivity to save.

Another problem is that researchers have often little or no information on the content and quality
                                                                                                                40


of the workplace seminars. A few authors have measured the information content of the seminars

(Clark and D’Ambrosio 2008; Lusardi, Keller, and Keller 2008); they also conduct pre- and post-

evaluations to detect behavioral changes or intentions to change future behavior. Their findings

suggest that this information is very valuable in assessing programs. One notable recent

experiment involved exposing a representative sample of the U.S. population to short videos

explaining several fundamental concepts including the power of interest compounding, inflation,

risk diversification, the topics that most people fail to comprehend (Heinberg, Hung, Kapteyn,

Lusardi, and Yoong 2010). Compared to a control group that did not receive such education,

those exposed to the informational videos were more knowledgeable and better able to answer

hypothetical questions about saving decisions.37 Thus, while more research is needed, it seems

that when researchers target concepts using carefully-designed experiments, they are likely to

detect changes in knowledge and behavior critical for making financial decisions.

        It is often difficult to evaluate empirically how actual workers’ behavior changes after an

experimental treatment of the type just discussed. Goda, Manchester, and Sojourner (2012) ask

whether employee decisions to participate in and contribute to their company retirement plan is

affected by information about the correlation between retirement savings and post-retirement

income. This is a difficult concept for many, as the computation involves complex relationships

between contributions, investment returns, retirement ages, and longevity. In that study,

employees were randomly assigned to a control and a treatment group; the treatment group

received an information intervention while nothing was sent to the control group. The

intervention contained a customized projection of the additional account balance and retirement

37
  The difference in the knowledge of risk diversification, tax benefits of retirement accounts, and the benefits of
employers’ matches between the two groups (measured by the proportion of correct answers) was on the order of 10
percentage points. While these videos were targeted to young adults, older respondents who viewed them also
increased knowledge and capacity to correctly answer questions concerning saving decisions (Heinberg, Hung,
Kapteyn, Lusardi, and Yoong, 2010).
                                                                                                                   41


income that would result from additional hypothetical contribution amounts, customized based

on the employee’s current age. Results show that the treatment group members were more likely

than the control group to boost their pension contributions and contribution rates; the increase

was an additional 0.17 percent of salary. Moreover, the treatment group felt better informed

about retirement planning and was more likely to have figured out how much to save. This

experiment is notable in that it rigorously illustrates the effectiveness of interventions—even

low-cost informational ones—in increasing pension participation and contributions.38

         Very promising work assessing the effects of financial literacy has also begun to emerge

from research in developing countries. Analysts often focus on people with very low financial

literacy and in vulnerable subgroups which may have the most to gain. Many of these studies

also use the experimental method described above, now standard in development economics

research. These studies contribute to an understanding of the mechanisms driving financial

literacy as well as economic advances for financial education program participants. One

example, by Carpena, Cole, Shapiro, and Zia (2011), seeks to disentangle how financial literacy

programs influence financial behavior. The authors use a randomized experiment on low income

urban households in India who underwent a five-week comprehensive video-based financial

education program with modules on savings, credit, insurance and budgeting. They conclude that

financial education in this context did not increase respondent numeracy, perhaps not

surprisingly given that only 4 percent of respondents had a secondary education. Nevertheless,

financial education did positively influence participant awareness of and attitudes toward

financial products and financial planning tools. In a related study, Cole, Giné, Tobacman,

Topalova, Townsend, and Vickery (2013) find that demand for rainfall insurance is higher in

villages where individuals were more financially literate. Song (2011) shows that when Chinese

farmers are taught about interest compounding, it produces a sizeable increase in pension

contributions.39

        In sum, while much effort has been devoted to examining the effectiveness of financial

education programs in a variety of settings, relatively few studies have been informed by either a

suitable theoretical model or a carefully-designed empirical approach. And since the theory

predicts that not everyone will invest in financial knowledge, it is unreasonable to expect all

‘treated’ by a program will dramatically change their behavior. Moreover, a short program that is

not tailored to specific groups’ needs is unlikely to make much difference. For these reasons,

future analysts would do well to emulate the more recent rigorous field experiments that trace

how both knowledge and behavior changes result from additional purpose-designed financial

information and training.



7. Implications and Discussion

        As we have shown, a relatively parsimonious set of questions measuring basic concepts

such as interest compounding, inflation, and risk diversification has now become the starting

point for evaluating levels of financial literacy around the world. Using these questions,

researchers have demonstrated that low levels of financial knowledge are pervasive, suggesting

that it will be quite challenging to provide the tools to help people function more effectively in

complex financial and credit markets requiring sophisticated financial decision-making. While

research in this field continues to spread, it seems clear that there are likely to be important

benefits of greater financial knowledge, including savvier saving and investment decisions,


39
  A broad perspective on how financial education programs can be made more effective in developing countries is
available in Holzmann (2011).
                                                                                               43


better debt management, more retirement planning, higher participation in the stock market, and

greater wealth accumulation. Though it is challenging to establish a causal link between financial

literacy and economic behavior, both instrumental variables and experimental approaches

suggest that financial literacy does play a role in influencing financial decision making, and the

causality goes from knowledge to behavior.

       Much work remains to be done. Very importantly, there has been no carefully-crafted

cost-benefit analysis indicating which sorts of financial education programs are most appropriate,

and least expensive, for which kinds of people. Some research from developing countries speaks

to this point, comparing educational treatments with other approaches such as simplifying

decisions (Cole, Sampson, and Zia 2011; Drexel, Fischer, and Schoar 2011), but this remains a

high priority area. Nevertheless, the estimated aggregate costs of financial illiteracy point to

possibly high returns, especially in the areas of consumer debt and debt management.

       A related issue has to do with which sorts of problems are best suited to remedying

through financial education, versus removing choice options from consumers’ menus altogether

or simplifying the options that people face. In this vein, Thaler and Sunstein (2010) have

emphasized the importance of devoting careful attention to the design of the environments in

which people make choices, or the so-called ‘choice architecture.’ An important example arises

in the context of employer-provided pensions which in the past left it to individual employees to

decide whether to save and how to invest their defined contribution contributions. When

employers automatically enroll workers into these plans rather than let them opt in, this can

dramatically increase pension participation (from under 40 percent to close to 90 percent;

Madrian and Shea 2001). Several other studies have also reported that automatic enrollment

leads to large and persistent increases in pension participation (Choi, Laibson, and Madrian
                                                                                                           44


2004; Choi, Laibson, Madrian and Metrick 2006; Thaler and Benartzi 2004), and better

diversified portfolios (Mitchell and Utkus 2012).

        In the wake of the recent financial crisis, attention has been increasingly devoted to

methods of protecting people from their own financial illiteracy and inability to make informed

financial decisions. Indeed there is substantial concern that consumers may not be sophisticated

enough to appreciate and take advantage of the many opportunities offered by complex financial

markets and hence they may easily fall prey to scams (Deevy, Lucich, and Beals 2012). The

Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, establishing the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, had as a

key goal the development of a government entity that could better protect consumers and specify

uniform standards for financial products.40

        In our view, there is room for improvement in both the choice architecture approach and

the effort to educate people about financial basics. As Thaler, Sunstein, and Balz (2010: np) note:

‘choice architects do not always have the best interests of the people they are influencing in

mind.’ Moreover, expanding automatic enrollment to the decumulation phase for example by

having automatic annuitization of pensions upon retirement – a topic of some interest recently in

policy circles – may be deleterious to some, who would have to cut consumption during their

worklives and render them ineligible for government benefit programs after retirement (such as

Medicaid or Supplemental Security Income). Plan sponsors also have avoided high saving rates

targets in their default auto-enrollment arrangements. For instance, the auto-enrollment

contribution rate for new hires was set at 3 percent of salary in the company studied by Madrian

and Shea (2001). But at that firm, a 6 percent contribution rate would entitle the worker to

receive a 50 percent employer match; in other words, the low default rate did not enable workers


40
  Among other things, the Bureau’s mandate is to promote financial education and monitor financial markets for
new risks to consumers; see http://www.consumerfinance.gov/the-bureau/.
                                                                                                              45


to take full advantage of the employer’s match.41 Of additional concern is the fact that the

employer’s 3 percent default rate was taken by existing employees as a signal of a suggested

target saving level, since many of them reduced their contributions to 3 percent as well.

Additional examples of people acting as though the default were the employer-endorsed target

include a study by Beshears, Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2012), who show that workers tend to

stick to the ‘wrong’ default for long periods of time. Interestingly, those likely to do so are

disproportionately low income and less educated – factors correlated with low financial literacy.

        As noted in Section 2, above, the human capital approach to financial literacy suggests

that there will be substantial heterogeneity in both financial knowledge and economic behavior,

so it is unlikely that a single default rate or environment will enhance individual wellbeing. For

example, when workers are carrying credit card debt or high-interest mortgages, it may be more

sensible to pay off these debts rather than raise their pension contributions. Similarly, borrowing

from one’s 401(k) may be more cost-effective for financially strapped households, compared to

taking out higher-cost debt elsewhere (Lu, Mitchell, and Utkus 2010). Additionally, only about

half of the U.S. workforce is employed at firms that offer pensions, so for the remaining several

million employees, automatic enrollment in company-based plans will be unable to boost saving

rates for those untouched by this system.

        An alternative method of enhancing peoples’ performance in an increasingly financially

complex world might be to outsource the job: to rely on financial advisors. Yet in the U.S., only

a small fraction of households currently consults financial advisors, bankers, certified public

accountants, or other such advice professionals, with most still relying on informal sources of

advice. Even among those who indicate they might be willing to use professional investment


41
   Note, however, that when left to their own devices, many employees simply fail to enroll in pensions and hence
fail to exploit the employer match at all, if or when one is available.
                                                                                                               46


advice, two-thirds state they would probably implement only the recommendations in line with

their own ideas (Employee Benefit Research Institute 2007). In other words, financial advice

may not have much of an impact if individuals fail to seek out and act on the recommendations

of their advisors. Additionally, there are many different types of ‘advice professional’

credentials, each regulated by different private and/or public sector entities. As Mitchell and

Smetters (2013) point out, it is often difficult or even impossible for consumers to determine

whether the quality of advice provided is accurate, suitable, and consistent with their own goals.

Moreover, existing compensation structures may not well-align households’ and advisors’

interests. And those least likely to be knowledgeable may also face obstacles in identifying good

advice sources: indeed Collins (2011) and Finke (2013) suggest that financial literacy and

financial advice may be complements rather than substitutes.42

           Finally, relatively little is known about the effects of financial advice and whether it can

improve financial decision-making. Some preliminary evidence suggests that financial

counseling can be effective in reducing debt levels and delinquency rates (Agarwal, Amromin,

Ben-David, Chomsisengphet, and Evanoff 2011; Collins and O’Rouke 2010; Elliehausen,

Lundquist, and Staten 2007; and Hirad and Zorn 2002). In practice, most people continue to rely

on the help of family and friends for their financial decisions, particularly among those with low

education.

           If, as argued previously, saving decisions are very complex, one way to help people save

may be to find ways to simplify those decisions. For example, it could be useful to find ways to

ease people into action. Such a strategy is analyzed by Choi, Laibson, and Madrian (2004), who

studied the effects of Quick Enrollment, a program that gives workers the option of enrolling in

the employer-provided saving plan by opting into a preset default contribution rate and asset
42
     A detailed analysis of the issues surrounding financial advice appears in Mitchell and Smetters (2013).
                                                                                                47


allocation. Unlike defaults, workers have a choice of whether or not to enroll, but the decision is

much simplified as they need not decide their contribution rates or how to allocate their assets.

When new hires were exposed to the Quick Enrollment program, participation rates in 401(k)

plans tripled, going from 5 percent to 19 percent in the first month of enrollment. When the

program was offered to previously hired non-participants, participation increased by 10 to 20

percentage points. Moreover, Quick Enrollment proved popular among African-Americans and

lower income workers (those earning less than $25,000) who, as noted above, are less likely to

be financially literate.

        Another approach designed to simplify the decision to save and, in addition, motivate

employees to make an active choice is discussed by Lusardi, Keller, and Keller (2008), who

devised a planning aid distributed to new hires during employee orientation. This planning aid

embodies several critical features. First, it breaks down the process of enrolling in supplementary

pensions into several small steps, describing to participants what they need to do to be able to

enroll online. It also provides several pieces of information to help overcome barriers to saving,

such as describing the low minimum amount of income employees can contribute (in addition to

the maximum) and indicating the default fund that the employer has chosen for them (a life-cycle

fund). While their evaluation was not performed in an experimental setting, the study provides

some useful insights. First, the qualitative data collected reveals important heterogeneity across

employees, even within the same firm. Second, economic incentives such as employer matches

or tax advantages do not exhaust the list of options to induce people to save. In fact, given

peoples’ lack of information and financial knowledge, there may be other, more cost-effective,

programs that can encourage saving. Third, the authors conclude that employees are more prone

to decision-making at some times rather than others. For example, starting a new job is a good
                                                                                               48


time to think about saving, often because people must make decisions about their pension

contributions.

       In the developing countries as well, much work is needed to assess whether simplification

can help individuals make financial decisions, spanning from using rather simple financial

instruments, such as checking accounts, to more complex contracts, such as insurance, or

decisions related to entrepreneurial activities. Early research is promising: Drexel, Fischer, and

Schoar (2011) show that a simplified rule-of-thumb training program enhanced business

practices and outcomes among microentrepreneurs in the Dominican Republic. Kast, Meier, and

Pomeranz (2012) also find that self-help peer groups and text messaging boosted employee

saving patterns in Chile.



8. Conclusions and Remaining Questions

       In the wake of the global financial crisis, policymakers around the world have expressed

deep concern about widespread gaps in financial knowledge. Also, efforts are underway to fill

these gaps with specific programs to ‘identify individuals who are most in need of financial

education and the best ways to improve that education’ (OECD 2005). The U.S. President’s

Advisory Council on Financial Literacy (PACFL 2008, np) has stated that ‘far too many

Americans do not have the basic financial skills necessary to develop and maintain a budget, to

understand credit, to understand investment vehicles, or to take advantage of our banking system.

It is essential to provide basic financial education that allows people to better navigate an

economic crisis such as this one.’ U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Bernanke (2011: 2) has

similarly opined: ‘In our dynamic and complex financial marketplace, financial education must

be a life-long pursuit that enables consumers of all ages and economic positions to stay attuned
                                                                                                49


to changes in their financial needs and circumstances and to take advantage of products and

services that best meet their goals. Well-informed consumers, who can serve as their own

advocates, are one of the best lines of defense against the proliferation of financial products and

services that are unsuitable, unnecessarily costly, or abusive.’

       Despite policymaker agreement on the need to fill these gaps, there is still much to learn

about the most cost-effective ways to build financial knowledge in the population at large. The

literature to date has showed that, around the world, many people are financially illiterate.

Econometric models and experiments have done much to confirm the causal impact of financial

literacy on economic decision-making, and to separately identify this effect from other factors,

including education. Research on efforts to enhance financial literacy suggest that some

interventions work well, but additional experimental work is needed to explore endogeneity and

establish causality.

       Nonetheless, several tasks remain. First, theoretical models of saving and financial

decision-making can be further enriched to incorporate the fact that financial knowledge is a

form of human capital. Second, efforts to better measure financial education are likely to pay off,

including gathering information on teachers, training programs, and material covered. Third,

outcomes beyond what have been studied to date are likely to be of interest, including, for

instance, borrowing for student loans, investment in health, reverse mortgage patterns, and when

to claim Social Security benefits, decisions that all have far-reaching economic consequences.

Additional work is also needed to learn more about the directions of causality between financial

knowledge and economic wellbeing, though the early results offered here are promising. It also

appears that more and careful field experiments and cross-national research might be useful in

learning more about the financially illiterate and drawing out the causal links between financial
                                                                                           50


knowledge, costs, and benefits. While the costs of raising financial literacy are likely to be

substantial, so too are the costs of being liquidity-constrained, over-indebted, and poor, in

retirement.
