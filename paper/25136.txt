                                                ABSTRACT

How do political connections affect firm dynamics, innovation, and creative destruction? To answer
this question, we build a firm dynamics model, where we allow firms to invest in innovation and/or
political connection to advance their productivity and to overcome certain market frictions. Our model
generates a number of theoretical testable predictions and highlights a new interaction between static
gains and dynamic losses from rent-seeking in aggregate productivity. We test the predictions of our
model using a brand-new dataset on Italian firms and their workers, spanning the period from 1993
to 2014, where we merge: (i) firm-level balance sheet data; (ii) social security data on the universe
of workers; (iii) patent data from the European Patent Office; (iv) the national registry of local politicians;
and (v) detailed data on local elections in Italy. We find that firm-level political connections are widespread,
especially among large firms, and that industries with a larger share of politically connected firms
feature worse firm dynamics. We identify a leadership paradox: when compared to their competitors,
market leaders are much more likely to be politically connected, but much less likely to innovate. In
addition, political connections relate to a higher rate of survival, as well as growth in employment
and revenue, but not in productivity – a result that we also confirm using a regression discontinuity
design.

1     Introduction
In May 2018, Mr. Carmelo Zuccaro, the chief prosecutor of the Sicilian port city of Catania, uttered
the above quote during his press conference on the “Black Job” operation against the misconduct
of local politicians. This quote succinctly demonstrates how some firms can secure preferential
treatment in the market, thanks in no small part to their connections to local politicians. How
widespread are such connections to local politicians, and how do they affect firm dynamics, market
competition, innovation, and the overall productivity process in the economy? This paper studies
these questions, both theoretically and empirically.
     A growing body of literature argues that factor reallocation from less productive to more produc-
tive firms is an important source of productivity growth (e.g., Bartelsman and Doms, 2000; Foster
et al., 2001, 2006). Similarly, innovation-based endogenous growth models (e.g., Grossman and
Helpman, 1991; Aghion and Howitt, 1992) assert that the process of creative destruction, whereby un-
productive incumbents are replaced by innovative new entrants, is the key ingredient for economic
growth. These models assume that it is sufficient for an entrepreneur to innovate the most superior
product or production technology to seamlessly replace an incumbent firm, and thus become the
new market leader. However, many examples, such as the one in the opening paragraph, illustrate
that there might be more to it than that. Political connections can help some firms dominate a
market, even if they do not necessarily introduce a more superior product or process.
     Our analysis begins with a theoretical investigation of how political connections could influence
an economy’s business dynamism, new firm creation, factor reallocation, and innovation. To orga-
nize our thoughts, we build an illustrative Schumpeterian creative destruction model where firms
face regulatory burdens.2 As in Restuccia and Rogerson (2008); Hsieh and Klenow (2009); Garicano
et al. (2016), we model these regulatory burdens as wedges in the production process of a firm that
may be alleviated by connecting with politicians, but those connections are costly. The static prob-
lem implies a threshold rule of firm size, above which firms find it profitable to incur the cost of
connections to lower the burden of regulations – hence larger firms (market leaders) are more likely
to be politically connected. We also discover that firms that become connected enjoy temporarily
higher employment and sales growth but have lower labor productivity growth. However, in a dy-
namic perspective, industries that have politically connected incumbents face lower entry by new
firms. Intuitively, new firms need to compete with incumbents not only in productivity, but they
also need to overcome the regulatory or bureaucratic burden, to which the connected incumbent is

                                                                   1

already immune. An additional amplification comes from the fact that incumbents anticipate this
dynamic effect and strategically choose to become politically connected to preempt competition.
   The model highlights the important contrasting facets of firm-level connections for the aggregate
economy. Statically, connections may be beneficial in overcoming certain market frictions; however,
they may also bring dynamic losses, since the incumbents’ connections give them an unfair ad-
vantage over other market participants. In this way, while political connections might be desirable
for static considerations, they distort competition and firm dynamics, resulting in markets that are
dominated by older and larger firms with low innovation and productivity growth. This interplay
is at the heart of both our empirical and theoretical constructs.
   The second part of the paper is devoted to the study of these theoretical ideas using a brand-new
micro-level confidential data, focusing on Italian firms and politicians from 1993 to 2014. There are
three main reasons for this. First, as hinted by our opening story, there is ample anecdotal evidence
for the link between political power and the corporate sector in Italy. Perhaps the largest manifesta-
tion of this presumption is the historical episode of Mani Pulite (“Clean Hands”) – an investigation
into a huge political scandal, which eventually uncovered a dense network of corruption and bribery
throughout Italy in the early 1990s.
   Second, to rigorously study all the channels through which political connections affect firm
dynamics, we need a very detailed, large-scale micro dataset on firms and their political connections.
To this end, we construct a new dataset for the Italian economy, spanning the entire period of 1993-
2014, wherein we merge: (i) firm-level balance sheet data; (ii) social security data on the universe
of workers; (iii) patent data from the European Patent Office; (iv) the national registry of local
politicians; and (v) detailed data on local elections in Italy. We define a firm as being politically
connected at time t if the firm employs at least one local politician at time t. The nature of this data
allows us to exploit rich heterogeneity in the type of connection – based on the level or rank of a
position, or the party affiliation of a politician employed. Our unique, five-way data match allows
us to examine at the micro level how firms change their competition strategy as they gain market
power, or what firm-level outcomes are associated with (or implied by) political connections. In
addition, we study how factor reallocation among incumbents and new firms is affected by the
presence of political connections.
   Third, the Italian economy has been performing poorly, particularly in terms of productivity
growth, since the 1990s (see, for instance, Bugamelli and Lotti, 2018). While many reasons could
be at play for low and stalling aggregate productivity, we try to shed some light on the aggregate
implications of firm-level political connections through their effect on firm dynamics, innovation
incentives, and competition.
   The focus on local politicians – at the municipal, provincial, and regional level – is also a dis-
tinctive feature of our analysis relative to most of the empirical literature that looks at high-profile
connections. Indeed, local-level connections are much more pervasive and usually harder to iden-
tify. In addition, local politicians hold extensive power: among other duties, they have authority
over and responsibility for the provision of local public goods and services; administrative author-
ity over the issuing of various permits and licenses; and are responsible for the majority of the




                                                   2

administrative burden faced by private firms in Italy.3
    We find that firm-level political connections are widespread, especially among large and old
firms. While the average share of connected firms by industries is 4.5%, connected firms account for
one third of employment across industries. Our analysis uncovers the following important findings
that are consistent with our theory:

Fact 1 More connected industries face lower firm entry, but conditional on entry, entrants are more likely to
be connected than in other industries.

Fact 2 Industries with a higher share of politically connected firms have a lower share of young firms and
exhibit lower growth and productivity.

    As our model highlights, market competition comes with a certain level of tension between the
market leader and its competitors. While followers try to leapfrog the leader with new products or
technological innovation, the leader may often rely on various defensive strategies to maintain its
market position. These defensive strategies could include the establishment of political connections.
In our empirical analysis, we identify some strong evidence to support this leadership paradox:

Fact 3 Market leaders are the most politician-intensive but the least innovation-intensive, relative to their
direct competitors.

    In addition, we find:

Fact 4 Politically connected firms are more likely to survive, and their survival probability increases in the
political power of the politicians they employ.

Fact 5 At the firm level, political connections are associated with higher employment and revenue growth but
not with productivity growth.

    We also exploit a quasi-random discontinuity caused by local elections decided on a thin margin
in order to gauge causality in our firm-level results (Lee, 2008). We collect new data on all local
elections in Italy and, based on vote allocation, identify elections that have been decided on a thin
margin. Our regression discontinuity (RD) design compares firms that have been connected right
before a marginally contested election with a politician from marginally losing versus marginally
winning parties. Since the results of closely contested elections can be considered as pure chance
(breaking news, weather shock, etc.), discontinuity in outcomes between marginally winning and
losing firms after the election can be attributed to the causal effect of majority-level connections on
the firms’ outcomes. We find that differences in post-election outcomes between marginally winning
and marginally losing firms are large: firms on the winning side grow much more in terms of size
but not in productivity.
    Finally, given the nature of our social security data, we can also observe the compensation levels
of politicians inside the companies and give a back-of-the-envelope estimate for the rent (static
surplus) sharing between firms and their worker-politicians. As a result, we find that:

Fact 6 Worker-politicians earn significant wage premiums relative to their co-workers. This premium in-
creases with the political rank of a worker.

2     Related Literature
The process of creative destruction is at the center of most of the endogenous growth models
(Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Grossman and Helpman, 1991; Klette and Kortum, 2004; Lentz and
Mortensen, 2008; Aghion et al., 2014; Acemoglu et al., 2018; Akcigit and Kerr, 2018; Jones and Kim,
2018, among many others).4 Likewise, a growing body of empirical literature shows that creative
destruction and factor reallocation are important contributors to aggregate productivity growth
(Bartelsman and Doms, 2000; Foster et al., 2001, 2006). Less is known, however, about what factors
are significant impediments to such reallocation. While addressing this question, our study brings
out the interaction of two separate strands of literature: the literature on idiosyncratic distortions
and implied static misallocation (Restuccia and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009), and the
literature on dynamic creative destruction discussed above. We show that the existence of polit-
ical connections that alleviate certain market frictions can lead to an asymmetric distribution of
distortions between incumbents and entrants – impeding creative destruction and growth.
     Our study provides micro evidence on how political connections could influence market power
and business dynamism through their impact on entry deterrence, factor reallocation, creative de-
struction, and firm dynamics. In that regard, our paper contributes to a recently growing macroe-
conomics literature on market power and declining business dynamism. Syverson (2019) explains
in detail why the macroeconomic discussion on market power should rely more on microeconomic
foundations. In a recent work, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2019) focus on the political economy of
business dynamism and argue that the existence of supranational regulators could adopt policies
that would hurt competition and business dynamism. Andrews et al. (2019) document a widening
productivity gap between market leaders and followers, and Akcigit and Ates (2019a,b) and Ar-
gente et al. (2020) argue that the declining knowledge diffusion from market leaders to followers
due to defensive and strategic use of patenting would prevent rivals from leapfrogging the market
leaders. One way to act strategically and defend the market could be to connect to the political
system through politicians as shown in the current paper. Cooper et al. (2019) argue that changing
adjustment costs might cause a decline in responsiveness of firms to firm-level shocks and hence
lower the business dynamism. Several other papers, such as Gutiérrez and Philippon (2016, 2017),
Aghion et al. (2019) show that an increase in market power is related to the decline in investments
in the U.S. Similarly, in this paper, we demonstrate that an increase in firm power through politi-
cal connections potentially creates dynamic costs by lowering firms investments in innovation and
growth.
     On the other hand, our study contributes, both empirically and theoretically, to a separate body
of literature on firm-level political connections and their implications. Politicians and entrepreneurs
have often found themselves along the road in the pursuit of power. Recent empirical evidence
shows that political connection is a widespread phenomenon; politically connected firms have been
observed both in developed and developing countries, including the US, the UK, France, Italy,
Turkey, China, Malaysia, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, and Singapore (Fisman, 2001; Johnson and
Mitton, 2003; Khwaja and Mian, 2005; Leuz and Oberholzer-Gee, 2006; Fan et al., 2007; Cingano and
    4 Some
        prominent examples of endogenous growth models without creative destruction are Romer (1990); Jones (1995);
Acemoglu (2002); Lucas and Moll (2014); and Perla and Tonetti (2014).

Pinotti, 2013; Schoenherr, 2015).
    The reasons that might lead a private company to pursue political connections are most certainly
linked to profit maximization; surely, then, expected benefits must exceed the costs of establishing
said connections, but the channels through which this is realized are manifold. The range of benefits
provided by governments to favored firms include preferential access to credit (Joh and Chiu, 2004;
Cull and Xu, 2005; Johnson and Mitton, 2003; Khwaja and Mian, 2005); preferential treatment by
government-owned enterprises (Backman, 2001; Dinc, 2005) and for procurement (Goldman et al.,
2013); relaxed regulatory oversight of the company in question or stiffer regulatory oversight of its
rivals (Kroszner and Stratmann, 1998); lighter taxation (De Soto, 1989; Arayavechkit et al., 2017);
allocation of public subsidies to R&D (Fang et al., 2018); and government bailouts of financially
distressed firms (Faccio and Parsley, 2006). While political connections increase equity returns and
are valued positively in the stock market (Faccio and Parsley, 2006; Akey, 2015; Acemoglu et al.,
2017), they become especially valuable wherever there are high levels of regulation, corruption, and
population concentration – like in many capital cities, for instance.
    There are different views on the social costs stemming from corruption and rent-seeking. On
the one hand, if connections are aimed at reducing the burden of bureaucracy and administrative
regulation, they do not necessarily imply a negative effect on welfare. This mechanism, known
also as the greasing wheels hypothesis (Kaufmann and Wei, 1999), is expected to have a positive effect
on welfare, since it increases efficiency through a relief of the burden of regulation (Shleifer and
Vishny, 1994). On the contrary, if a connected firm exerts a rent seeking behavior, for example by
diverting public demand (Goldman et al., 2013), the entailed social cost may be high. This second
effect, named the grabbing hand hypothesis (Shleifer and Vishny, 2002), is consistent with the results
provided by Cingano and Pinotti (2013) on political connections in Italy. Focusing on a small sample
of Italian manufacturing firms surveyed by the Bank of Italy, representative of those with at least
50 employees, matched with data on politicians appointed at the local level, they find that firms
experience revenue premium from connections mainly coming from public demand shift towards
politically connected firms.
    We contribute to the empirical literature on political connections by analyzing a newly con-
structed, large-scale dataset based on multiple administrative datasets for the universe of firms and
workers from Italy. This allows us to provide a detailed analysis of the effect of connections on firm
outcomes, including a causal RD design, as well as the effect on the entire firm and industry dy-
namics in the economy – aggregate aspects that have received less attention in the literature so far.
Specifically, we bring new evidence on the relationship between political connections and firms’ in-
novation, survival, and industry entry and competition.5 In addition, we provide some new facts on
how politically connected firms are compensating their worker-politicians – another unique feature
of our analysis.
    On the theory side, surprisingly little has been done to understand social costs of rent-seeking
through its impact on business dynamics, innovation, and aggregate productivity growth – aspects
that are the focus of this article. Two exceptions are Krusell and Rios-Rull (1996) and Mukoyama
   5 An interesting new evidence coming from historical data from the Venetian Republic shows that politically connected
craft guilds patented less (Comino et al., 2017) – possibly, indicating that guilds were substituting formal intellectual
property protection with political protection.

and Popov (2014), where the authors study the models with tensions between new and old tech-
nologies/incumbents and entrants in the environments where firms can influence entry policies.
Relatedly, Comin and Hobijn (2009) show that lobbying dampens technology adoption when new
technologies have close predecessors in the adopting country. In his seminal paper, Baumol (1990)
maintained that large growth differences between or within countries should, to a great extent,
be driven by differences in the allocation of entrepreneurial talent between productive and growth-
enhancing entrepreneurship or unproductive and destructive entrepreneurship, such as rent seeking
or organized crime. Countries’ institutions, policies, and social reward schemes drive the alloca-
tion of entrepreneurial talent between those activities. Relatedly, seminal works by Murphy et al.
(1991) and Shleifer and Vishny (2002) focus on the problem of occupational choice between high-
productivity sectors (entrepreneurs, engineers, etc.) and low-productivity sectors that are centered
on rent-seeking and intermediation (law, financial services, etc.). In societies that reward rent-
seeking activities more, a lower pace of growth is observed. While those papers focus on the allo-
cation of talent and discuss potential consequences for growth, more recent papers by Arayavechkit
et al. (2017) and Garcia-Santana et al. (2016) point out static capital misallocation across different
firms, resulting from preferential treatment by the various governments.
    Our theory takes a different approach to understanding potential benefits and social costs asso-
ciated with political connections. Our focus is on the effect of connections on innovation, creative
destruction, and firm dynamics. We show that in an environment with high market frictions (such
as regulations or bureaucracy) – where a firm’s route to success often runs through the political
system – political connections may impede growth by lowering innovation and reallocation.
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 3 provides a theoretical framework and a list of
testable implications. Section 4 provides an overview of the data and variable construction, pro-
vides some insights on the institutional background, and discusses relevant industry-level facts and
summary statistics. Section 5 shows the firm-level analysis at the micro level. Section 6 describes the
regression discontinuity design. Section 7 then explores politicians’ compensation, while Section 8
concludes.


3   Theoretical Model
In this section, we build a simple model of a firm’s innovation and political connections. The
model illustrates that, even if political connections may be beneficial to alleviate certain types of
market frictions for the firms, dynamically, they may induce important social costs through lower
reallocation and growth.


How to model political connections? Political connections might affect firms through various
channels. As was exemplified in the opening paragraph of the paper, political connections might
help firms overcome regulatory or bureaucratic burden and get around existing “red tape”. To
understand if the data supports this channel, in Section 4.2 we examine the patterns of political con-
nection in more heavily versus less heavily regulated industries. We observe a strong relationship
between the amount of regulations or bureaucracy that an industry faces and the share of firms


                                                  6
           Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


relying on political connections.
      That bureaucratic and regulatory burden is pervasive and represents a common obstacle for
businesses is also reflected in the recent report by the Ministry for Simplification and Public Admin-
istration of Italy.6 The estimated administrative burden faced by private firms in Italy is a staggering
31 billion Euros per year (representing 1.7% of the Italian GDP7 ).8 Perhaps not surprisingly, based
on Doing Business Indicators by the World Bank, Italy ranks among the worst in the friendliness of
business regulations across developed countries.9 An interesting new study by Gratton et al. (2017)
provides extensive evidence that after the First Republic, the bureaucratic efficiency in Italy has col-
lapsed. Hence, in the period of our analysis, the importance of political connections to relieve red
tape seems even more relevant.
      Motivated by the above evidence, we build a model where political connections help to overcome
particular market frictions – bureaucracy and regulations. We follow the literature (e.g., Restuccia
and Rogerson, 2008; Hsieh and Klenow, 2009; Garicano et al., 2016) and model these market frictions
as wedges in the production process of a firm. A priori, the model gives a chance to political
connections to have a positive impact by reducing existing regulations. As we will see, however,
even in this model, connections will imply dynamic costs by lowering entry and reallocation.

Sectoral output producers are perfectly competitive, and we normalize the price of sectoral good
to one. In this production function, ym denotes the output of a producer of vintage m. Different
vintages differ by their qualities qm . Different vintages are perfect substitutes after adjusting for their
qualities. Among the implemented M vintages, the latest vintage M has the highest quality. Note
that in this model, some of the new vintages by potential new entrepreneurs, even though they have
superior quality when compared to the current incumbent’s quality, might not be implemented in
equilibrium, due to the incumbent’s political connections, as we describe in Section 3.2.
      Production function (1) implies that the demand faced by vintage-m producer is given by:

will ensure that the producing firm will also charge the monopoly price. Hence, we will study the
monopolist’s problem throughout this section.

Assumption 1 Producers of different-quality vintages play a two-stage pricing game. In the first stage,
producers choose to pay a fee ε (which we assume to be arbitrarily small, i.e., ε ≈ 0) to enter a price competition
in the second stage. In the second stage, all firms that already paid the fee bid prices.

     This assumption ensures that only the firm with the highest cost-adjusted quality pays the fee
and goes to the second stage where price is determined. Therefore, the producing firm charges the
unconstrained monopoly price.10
     Production technology for each intermediate goods producer is one-for-one in labor:

                                                                    y=l                                                                   (3)

     The wage rate of the worker is given by w. Hence, in the absence of any regulatory burden, the
marginal cost of production is simply w.


Politically Non-Connected Firms.                     A sector is characterized by regulatory or bureaucratic burden,
which we capture by a wedge τ ≥ 0 that increases marginal cost of production from w to (1 + τ )w,
as in Hsieh and Klenow (2009). Therefore, a monopolist maximizes its profit, subject to the demand
function it faces, as follows:

                                                  π n = max { py − (1 + τ )wl }
                                                                l

     This maximization delivers the following equilibrium labor (l n ), output (yn ), revenue (Revn ),
profits (π n ), and labor productivity (LPn ) for non-connected firms that face regulatory burden:

Political Connections.                 Firms can escape regulation and bureaucracy costs by getting politically
connected. If a firm gets politically connected, it can avoid paying the wedge τ, yet it has to incur
a cost of political connection w p , which we take for now as exogenous and endogenize it later in
Online Appendix A through the Nash bargaining between a firm and a politician. We can think
of w p as a compensation to the politicians or as search or other type of cost that a firm incurs to
maintain its political connection. However, in order to be able to acquire political connection, a firm
has to become familiar with the network of politicians. We capture the ability to become politically
connected by assuming that firms can be in two states, s ∈ {0, 1} . In particular, s = 0 indicates that
the firm is not yet familiar with the political network, whereas s = 1 implies that firms are already
familiar with the network and can acquire political connections, “if they want to”.
  10 This   structure also gives us theoretical tractability, since we do not have to worry about limit pricing.

     If a firm is in state s = 1 and is politically connected, then it solves the following maximization
problem:

     The important result here is that the connected firms eliminate the regulatory burden and there-
fore grow more in labor and revenue – even though they do not necessarily grow in productivity.
Hence, political connections are associated with higher employment and revenue growth, but not
with labor productivity growth.
     When do firms decide to get connected? Figure 1 provides a graphical illustration of the answer.
Panel (a) plots the profits of connected and non-connected firms as a function of the quality levels of
their product. Panel (b), on the other hand, plots the equilibrium connection decision and indicates
the resulting static return — the outer envelope (i.e., the maximum) of the two lines.
     Firms that have the option of being connected (i.e., s = 1) choose to do so if π p (q) > π n (q).
Since both profits are linear in q, the static equilibrium is such that firms follow a cut-off rule (q̂s )
and get connected if and only if q > q̂s , where

and π ≡ β             w               . Hence, larger firms find it optimal to become connected in order to remove
regulatory burden. In what follows, for simplicity, we assume β = 0.5 and we rewrite this static
threshold as

                                                                     wp 1 + τ

Note that the threshold declines in the regulatory burden τ, implying that firms are more likely to
be connected in more regulated industries. We will come back to this threshold in the next section,
after discussing a firm’s dynamic problem.


3.2       Dynamics

Accessing a network of politicians takes time. We assume that α share of entrants start with s = 1,
and 1 − α start with s = 0. Firms switch from state s = 0 to s = 1 at the Poisson arrival rate ζ. We
assume that state s = 1 is an absorbing state. Note that consistent with the empirical evidence we
provide below, these assumptions imply that connected firms are older, even after controlling for
firm size.
      At each point in time, there is a potential entrant who receives a new innovative idea with
Poisson arrival rate p and can produce a new vintage. A new idea of quality λ improves the latest
vintage quality q M according to the following law of motion

                                                        q M +1 = (1 + λ ) q M

where λ ∼ F (0, ∞) is the realization of the innovation quality that is distributed according to some
distribution F (·).
      Importantly, not all entrants that have a better-quality product will be able to replace existing
incumbents.11 For an entrant to replace the incumbent, its quality-adjusted cost should be lower
  11 If
     a higher-quality vintage is not able to enter the market, we assume that the vintage is lost. Hence, ideas are
implemented right away or are lost.


                                                                     10

than that of an incumbent. When there is an asymmetry in connections between an entrant and
incumbent, the quality advantage of an entrant has to be very high in order to overcome the cost
advantage of an incumbent, who is immune to the regulatory costs. To see this, consider the
following three cases.

Case 1 Incumbent is not connected.

If incumbent is not connected, any quality improvement λ > 0 by an entrant will lead to creative
destruction. Hence, creative destruction rate is simply equal to entry rate p. This case is a standard
Schumpeterian case as in Aghion and Howitt (1992), for instance.

Case 2 Incumbent is connected, entrant is connected.

This case is equivalent to Case 1: any quality improvement by λ > 0 will lead to creative destruction
at the rate p.

Case 3 Incumbent is connected, entrant is not connected.

In this asymmetric case, when the incumbent is connected and the entrant is not connected, creative
destruction is lower. This is because an entrant should not only produce a superior technology, but
it should also overcome the regulatory burden that the incumbent is not subject to. In the rest of
this subsection, we will show this formally.
   Let us first start with the price competition between an entrant and the incumbent. Let us denote
the current incumbent by M and the new entrant by M + 1. The demand for each vintage is given
by (2). As a result, for an entrant to win the pricing game, the quality per price has to be greater:

                                               q M +1  q
                                                      > M.                                           (5)
                                               p M +1  pM

Now we can look for a threshold innovation quality λ∗ that can ensure that entrant will produce
in equilibrium. In the price competition, the lowest price that the incumbent can charge is w,
whereas the lowest possible price for the entrant’s vintage is (1 + τ )w. Since the entrant’s quality is
q M+1 = (1 + λ)q M , the condition in (5) gives us the innovation quality threshold λ∗ , above which
entrants successfully replace incumbents:

                                               λ > λ∗ ≡ τ.

This result in intuitive. Since the incumbent has a cost advantage thanks to its political connection,
the entrant has to produce a sufficiently large innovation that can overcome the cost advantage. This
threshold is exactly equal to the regulatory advantage of the incumbents, which is τ.
   This leads us to a key question: when do incumbents decide to become connected in this dy-
namic environment? To answer this question, we first need to express the value functions of incum-
bents. We will pose that the firms will follow a cutoff rule such that firms with q > q̂d will decide
to connect in this dynamic model. We will ultimately solve for this dynamic threshold q̂d .



                                                   11
           Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


        First, consider a firm with q < q̂d and denote its value by V−1 . Then

                                          rV−1 (q) = π (1 + τ )−1 q − pV−1 .

where r > 0 is the exogenous interest rate. This value function simply equates the safe return
rV−1 (q) to the risky return on the right-hand side. Firms collect their instantaneous profits π n (q) =
π (1 + τ )−1 q and get replaced at the rate p, in which case they exit. Rearranging this value function
implies
                                                                 π (1 + τ ) −1
                                              V−1 (q) =                        q.                                   (6)
                                                                    r+p
Intuitively, firm value decreases in the regulatory burden τ and rate of creative destruction p.
        Now, we can solve for the value of a firm that has a quality that is above the threshold q ≥ q̂d ,
but is not yet exposed to the political network (i.e., s = 0). Denoting this value by V0 , we can express
it as:
                                    rV0 (q) = π (1 + τ )−1 q − pV0 + ζ (V1 − V0 ) ,

This value function is very similar to (6), with the exception that firms that are not exposed to the
political network will get exposed to it at the rate ζ. In this case, their state switches from s = 0 to
s = 1, and we denote the value of the latter case as V1 .
        For a firm in state s = 1 with q ≥ q̂d , the value function can be expressed as:
                                                                                                          

                      rV1 (q) = πq − w p − p  |{z} +                      (1 − α) Pr(λ > λ∗ )              V1 .   (7)

                                                     connected        non-connected but major innovation


This time, the value function contains some additional terms that affect the rate at which the in-
cumbent is replaced by an entrant. If the entrant is already exposed to the political network (with
probability α), any innovation is sufficient to replace the incumbent. If the entrant is not yet ex-
posed to the political network (with probability 1 − α), the entrant cannot get around the regulatory
burden and, therefore, is at disadvantage compared to the incumbent. In this case, the entrant has
to come up with a large enough innovation (λ > λ∗ ) to make-up for the regulatory disadvantage,
which can happen with probability Pr(λ > λ∗ ).
        Rearranging (7) delivers:

                                                            πq − w p
                                      V1 (q) =                                  .                                   (8)
                                                 r + p[α + (1 − α) Pr(λ > λ∗ )]

        Firms connect to politicians if and only if the value of connection is bigger than of non-connection:

                                                      V1 (q) > V−1 (q).

Using (6) and (8), this condition holds if and only if the quality level is above the dynamic threshold
q̂d :
                                                                        wp

                                                                 12

where p̃ ≡ p[α + (1 − α) Pr(λ > λ∗ )]. This result shows again the importance of the level of
regulation and firm size for political connection.
    First, the dynamic cut-off, just like the static cut-off, is decreasing in τ. This implies that in
more regulated industries, firms are more likely to get politically connected. This follows from the
fact that more regulation imposes larger costs on firms. Hence, eliminating these burdens through
political connections becomes more profitable when the regulations are heavier.
    Second, (9) shows that large firms are more likely to be connected. The key difference of this
result from the earlier result on connections and firm size highlighted in Table 1 is the direction of
causality. Our model predicts a two-way relationship between political connections and firm size:
as firms grow in size, they find it worthwhile to incur the connection cost to eliminate the regulatory
burden. Hence, larger firms are more likely to be connected. In addition, when they obtain political
connections and remove the regulatory burden, they can grow even further (Table 1).


Preemptive Motive.            Now we can compare the static cut-off in (4) and the dynamic cut-off in (9):12

An important insight emerges from the comparison between the static and dynamic cutoffs. We
see that q̂d < q̂s , as illustrated in Figure 2. In the region with q ∈ [q̂d , q̂s ], there is an additional
preemptive motive to acquire political connections. Incumbents anticipate that, by getting connected,
they discourage entry and survive longer, hence they optimally choose to seek a connection earlier.
Notice that the difference between the two cutoffs in (4) and (9) disappears if α → 1, i.e., if all
entrants are able to get connected. Likewise, if there is no regulatory burden (τ = 0), the static and
dynamic thresholds collapse to the same value, q̂d = q̂s . In those two extreme cases, there is no room
for strategic entry deterrence. Hence, strategic motive becomes more apparent when the industry is
heavily regulated (i.e., τ ↑) or when the social asymmetry between incumbents and entrants is big
(i.e., α ↓).
    Note that the entry rate is:
                                                 (
                                                     p if incumbent is not connected,
                                Entry rate =
                                                     p̃ if incumbent is connected.

    In other words, in connected industries, entry rate is lower, hence connected incumbents are less
likely to exit. The intuition for this result comes from the fact that, since an entrant is relatively
disadvantaged in getting connected, it must come up with a larger (more radical) innovation in
order to overcome the effective advantage of the incumbent due to its political connections. Since the
probability of a larger innovation is lower, this also lowers the entry probability and the probability
that the incumbent gets displaced. Notice that if α = 1 so that all entrants are able to get connected,
  12 Note   that π p > 0 when q > q̂d . Hence, connected firms never make any static loss in equilibrium.

creative destruction is equal to entry rate p. In fact, politically connected incumbents are more likely
to be replaced by connected entrants.13 Hence, the co-existence of red tape (τ) and the asymmetry
in connections (α < 1) are the factors that generate lower creative destruction.
      The model generates additional intuitive predictions when we allow the compensation w p to
be endogenously determined. To save space, we delegate this extension to Online Appendix A.
We consider a model extension, wherein politicians are heterogeneous in their political power and
compensation is determined through Nash bargaining between the firm and the politician. The
model implies that: 1) compensation increases with political power of a politician; and 2) the greater
the political power of the politician, the higher the rate of survival for the connected incumbent.


3.3       Taking Stock

The distinction between static and dynamic effects of political connections is important: statically,
connections reduce frictions, but dynamically, the model implies lower entry and reallocation, result-
ing in markets that are dominated by older and larger firms with low innovation and productivity
growth.
      Notice that the negative effect of connections on firm entry and competition is not hard-wired
in our model. To the contrary, we considered the positive side of political connections by assuming
that political connections help remove red tape in the input market. However, an interesting result
of our model is that firms use these connections also to prevent dynamic entry. Reduction in
entry is an endogenous response of the economy to the market conditions, where the ability to get
connected is distributed unequally between entrants and incumbents. This response arises only
dynamically; in a static environment, political connections are socially beneficial and represent the
second best, given the market frictions. Hence, starting with the “well-intended" nature of political
connections, without imposing any direct negative effect from them, a simple glimpse into dynamic
effects from misallocation uncovers important aggregate costs. This intuitive model provides some
  13 If
      an incumbent is not connected, its probability of getting replaced by a connected entrant, conditional on an inno-
vation is 1. In the case of a connected incumbent, this probability is: α + (1 − α) Pr(λ > λ∗ ) < 1.



                                                                 14

new theoretical insights into understanding the social costs of political connections.
      Below we summarize the implications of the model we discussed above:

Implication 1: In industries where incumbents are politically connected, creative destruction is
lower. Connected incumbents are more likely to be replaced by connected entrants.

Implication 2: Industries with politically connected firms have older firms and lower productivity
growth.

Implication 3: Large firms are more likely to be connected, but entrants are more innovative.

Implication 4: Connected firms are less likely to exit, especially if the firms are connected with
politicians with higher political power φ.

Implication 5: Political connections are associated with higher employment and revenue growth for
a firm, but not with higher labor productivity growth.

Implication 6: Politician’s compensation w̄ p (φ) increases in his/her political power φ.


3.4     Alternative Mechanisms

Our model that emphasizes the role of political connection in removing red tape (wedges) has sharp
implications about i) who optimally chooses to get connected, ii) firm-level growth in productivity
and size, and iii) aggregate implications for entry and reallocation. In this section, we briefly dis-
cuss other potential mechanisms through which political connections could affect firms and the
implications thereof.
      First, firms may rely on connections in order to help their new technologies or services penetrate
the market. In this sense, connections may be catalyzers for incumbents’ innovation, by reducing
its effective cost. This mechanism would imply that 1) at the firm level, connections and innovation
should go hand-in-hand and that 2) firms should grow both in size and productivity as a result of
connections. These implications are in contrast to the implications from out model. By empirically
exploring the relationship between political connections and innovation as well as firm growth, we
will be able to differentiate between these alternative theories.
      Second, one could imagine a completely negative scenario where incumbents use their connec-
tions to directly block entry by competitors. While this may be plausible, we do not have direct
evidence for this mechanism and, if anything, it would strengthen the negative results from the
model.
      Finally, we believe alternative channels, including such elements as preferential bank lending or
procurement contract allocation to connected firms, could also be empirically relevant.14 However,
in both cases – similar to the current model – these alternative channels could generate asymmetric
wedges in the effective cost of capital and in the demand shifter, respectively. This would lead to
similar implications to the current model. Exploring the quantitative importance of these various
channels is an important question that we do not tackle in this paper. Instead, the purpose of our
  14 Unlike a strong correlation between industry’ intensity of political connections and the industry’s degree of bureau-

cracy and regulatory burden, we do not find a significant correlation of connections intensity with industry’s government
dependence that proxies, for example, for firms’ reliance on procurement contracts (see Section 4.2).

illustrative model is to uncover a new tradeoff between static benefits and dynamic losses from lower
reallocation and innovation.
      Using a new large-scale dataset from Italy, in the next sections, we will focus on a set of empirical
facts that speak to the implications of our model. We organize these facts to line up with the list of
model implications above.


4      Data and Aggregate Statistics
We tap on data from multiple administrative sources to build a comprehensive dataset on firms,
workers, and local politicians in Italy for the period of 1993-2014. The core of this data construction
is the newly available individual-level data from the Italian Social Security Administration (INPS).15
We combined the rich Social Security (SS) data with administrative data on firms’ balance sheets
(Cerved) to obtain a detailed matched employer-employee dataset for Italy. On the firms’ side, the
data is further augmented with information on firm-level innovation activities derived from patent
records in PATSTAT. Crucially, on the workers’ side, we combine SS data with individual records
on the universe of local politicians from the Italian Registry of Local Politicians (RLP). This allows
us to track whether a politician works in the private sector while holding office. The literature has
coined the term “moonlighting politicians” to refer to such politicians: it is exactly the existence of
moonlighting politicians that helps us to identify political connections at the firm level. Finally, we
also construct new data on all local elections in Italy held between 1993-2014. Together, RLP and
elections data allow us to define various attributes of an individual’s political career, such as type
of political position, rank, party affiliation, and participation in marginally contested elections.
      Below, we provide an overview of the data and main steps undertaken during the data construc-
tion, while we delegate a more detailed discussion of data cleaning and variable construction to
Online Appendix B. Table 2 gives a summary of the data sources.


4.1     Data Sources

Dataset #1: Social Security Data (INPS)

We access the Italian SS data at the Italian National Institute of Social Security within the VisitINPS
Scholars program. INPS data covers the universe of private sector workers, whose employers make
social security contributions in Italy. Part-time workers, as well as temporary-contract workers, are
part of the INPS data, while self-employed, public employees, agriculture workers, or contractors
are not. This data provides us with information about both workers and firms.
      On the workers’ side, the SS data provides complete information on employment histories.
Among other things, we obtain information on the identities of firms where workers are employed,
job start and separation dates, gross labor income (including bonuses and overtime), number of
months/weeks worked in a year, type of contract (e.g., full-time or part-time, permanent or tem-
porary), and broadly defined occupation description (from which we create white-collar and blue-
collar classification). In addition, the data provides individual demographic information on the

workers.
    On the firms’ side, we have information on all workers they employ and the corresponding
characteristics of those workers described above. This lets us construct a reliable variable on firm
size, average wages paid, or various work-force composition variables. Importantly, we also have
complete demographic data on the firms – firm industry classification (ATECO 2007), location, entry
and exit dates.16 For our purposes, this data is essential since this firm-level data on the universe
of private-sector firms allows us to construct aggregate moments on firm entry, exit and turnover
across industries, location, and time.


Dataset #2: Firm Financials Data (Cerved)

We use proprietary firm-level data from Cerved, administered by Cerved Group.17 The data pro-
vides balance sheets and income statements for all incorporated firms in Italy for the 1993-2014
period. Firms not covered are mainly small firms – sole proprietorship or small household pro-
ducers. We make use of standard company accounts variables such as assets, intangible assets,
value added (VA), and profits. We compute a firm’s labor productivity, LP, as value added per
worker. Total factor productivity, TFP, is calculated as the residual z from a standard Cobb-Douglas
  16 It is hard to identify establishments using this data, hence our unit of analysis is a firm. However, in Italy the average

number of establishment per firm is just 1.07 (Istat, Census 2011 data).
  17 This data gives rise to the Italian segment in ORBIS (Aida).




                                                               17

specification Y = zK α L1−α , where Y is measured as value added, K is measured as total assets, L
is employment, and labor share (1 − α) is equal to the average industry-level labor share from the
data.


Dataset #3: Patent Data (PATSTAT)

Our patent data source is the European Patent Office Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (EPO
PATSTAT).18 PATSTAT provides coverage of all patents published (granted or not) at the EPO up to
the spring 2016. This amounts to nearly 60 million patent applications from 1978 to 2014. We use
this data to understand the patenting activity of firms in Italy. For this purpose, we match patent
records to firms in Cerved, identifying 13,904 Italian companies that had filed for patents.
   For all patents, we extract information on their patent families, technology classification, appli-
cation date, grant status, number of claims, and backward and forward citations. This data allows
us to construct various patent-based innovation measures for firms. In particular, we focus on: (i)
yearly patent counts by firms; (ii) citations-adjusted patent counts to reflect quality heterogeneity
across patents; and (iii) family-size-adjusted patent counts. Patent family size can serve as another
proxy for patent quality as it may indicate the extent of geographical protection an applicant is
seeking. We report the details of the PATSTAT matching, as well as summary statistics of these
measures, in Online Appendix B.3.


Dataset #4: Registry of Local Politicians (RLP)

We obtain administrative data on local politicians (RLP) from the website of the Ministry of the
Interior. RLP contains information on all local politicians at the municipal (8,110 municipalities),
provincial (103 provinces) and regional (20 regions) levels from 1985 to 2014. For each individual,
we have his/her detailed demographic information, location, position (e.g., council member, mayor,
regional president, vice-president, etc.), and appointment date. The data contains information on
515,201 unique politicians during our benchmark period of 1993-2014.
   In order to link individual politicians to the Social Security data on private-sector employees,
we recover social security numbers from the demographic information on politicians. Next, we
define an individual’s majority affiliation – whether a politician is a member of a majority party
(or a coalition) at the local level. Finally, based on politician’s position attributes, we identify a
politician’s regional rank (e.g., municipality, province, or region). Similarly, we identify his/her
hierarchical rank (i.e., mayor, president, vice-president, etc.). Online Appendix B.3.1 reports the
details on data cleaning and variable construction in RLP.
   Table 3 reports some summary statistics on local politicians. In our data, most of the politicians
(96.6%) work at the municipal level. Around 11.3% of the politicians have high-rank positions (e.g.,
mayor, president, vice-mayor or vice-president) and an additional 19.6% have executive roles (“as-
sessore”). Finally, 73% of the politicians are part of the majority party or coalition. Characteristics
on politicians that are employed in the firms are shown in Table A.3. Almost 10% of politicians hold
top- or middle-management positions, while 55% perform other white-collar jobs.

Notes: Summary statistics on the distribution of politicians across regional rank, hierarchical rank, and their local majority affiliation
from the Registry of Local Politicians (RLP). Statistics are from the period between 1993 and 2014 with 2,888,480 observations on 515,201
distinct politicians.


Dataset #5: Elections Data

We derive data on elections at the regional, province, and municipality level from the Ministry of
Interior and complement it with our own data collection from various sources online (online election
archives, Wikipedia). The final data covers all local elections during the period 1993-2014. We have
information on the identities of all the candidates (names and demographics); parties/coalitions
participating in the elections and candidates that they support; votes obtained (for candidates or
parties) in each election round, if multiple; and the allocation of seats in the councils.
      This data serves two purposes. First, it helps complement majority party/coalition identifica-
tion from RLP (and hence to define politician’s majority affiliation more accurately as described in
details in Online Appendix B.3.2 and B.3.3). Second, and more importantly, we identify marginally
contested elections and party affiliations of marginally winning and losing parties/coalitions, as
discussed in Section 6.1.


4.2     Descriptive Statistics

In this section, we provide some descriptive statistics of the final matched data. We first start with
the main variable definitions.
      We label a firm as being “connected at time t” if at least one politician is working in that firm in
the same year t. Notice that our definition, more conservatively, is based on the contemporaneous
employment relations.19 The main political connection indicators we use throughout the paper are:

      • Connectionit : = 1 if at least one politician is working in firm i at time t.

      • Connection high − rank it : = 1 if at least one high-rank politician, defined as either mayor,
        region or province president, vice-mayor or vice-president, or a (vice-)president of a council,
        is working in firm i at time t.
  19 Interestingly, looking at the first time that a firm becomes connected, we observe that in the majority of the cases (63%)

the firm becomes connected through a worker already employed in the firm, while in the remaining cases the politician
gets hired by the firm (either moving from another firm, being a “professional politician”, or a self-employed/professional
not enrolled in INPS.)

Notes: Summary statistics of the matched data at the firm × year level. The columns under "All firms" report statistics for all firms
at INPS that are in our largest baseline sample. The columns "With balance sheet" present statistics for all observations where balance
sheet information is not missing (observations matched to Cerved). All nominal variables are expressed in thousands of 2014 Euros.
Employment is defined based on the number of employees in March. Employment growth is defined as in (14). The "All firms" sample
includes also firms that report zero employment in a particular year but still appear in INPS data. Number of observations with non-
zero employment is 27,982,454 (employment growth excluding zero-employment observations is significantly lower, so a bulk of positive
growth comes from entry years). Average weekly pay is the average gross weekly pay of all workers employed in March. Patent-related
variables are defined in Section 4.1. The statistics on number of patents are given conditional on patenting. Definitions of Connection,
Connection high-rank, and Connection majority are given in Section 4.2. The statistics on number of politicians employed are given
conditional on having a connection. Standard balance sheet variables are defined in Section 4.1.


    • Connection majorityit : = 1 if at least one politician from the majority party/coalition at local
       level is working in firm i at time t.
    Main summary statistics of the final matched dataset are reported in Table 4, Panel A. In total,
we have about 32 million observations at the firm level, with 4 million unique firms in 1993-2014.
Among these, 1 million firms match to Cerved, hence, report their financial data. Firm-level connec-
tions are a widespread phenomenon. In total, 112,333 unique firms, at some point in their existence,
can be identified as connected. Conditional on being connected, the average number of politicians
employed per year is 1.7.
    Although the average share of connected firms by industries is around 4.5%, connected firms

                                                                  20
         Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


account for 33.6% of employment across industries. Hence, connections are particularly common
among large firms. As Figure 3 shows, larger firms are disproportionately more likely to be con-
nected: 45% of firms with more than 100 workers are connected with politicians. This relationship
could arise mechanically since larger firms employ more workers and hence are more likely to be
defined as politically connected. However, Section 5.1 shows that even conditional on firm size,
larger firms are more likely to employ politicians. Figure 3 also shows that, holding size fixed, age
matters as well: older firms are significantly more likely to have political connections than younger
firms.

Notes: The figure shows share of connected firms by age and size bins.


    Some of the sectors with the highest shares of connected firms are utilities, pharmaceuticals,
banking, waste disposal, and telecommunications, among others. On the opposite side, industries
with the lowest shares of connected firms are in personal services, bars, restaurants, retail man-
agement, restoration, and others. We examine the patterns of political connections across various
industry characteristics. We build the industry-level Bureaucracy Index that measures the level of
regulatory and bureaucratic burden, based on texts of newspaper articles. This index is simply the
share of newspaper articles about a sector that have certain keywords that are related to bureau-
cracy/regulation.20 Using the sectoral input-output table for Italy, we also construct the standard
Government Dependence Index that measures the share of an industry’s output that is demanded by
public sector. We identify that the strongest correlate of the presence of political connections across
industries is the amount of regulations and bureaucracy that the industry faces. However, we do
not find a significant correlation between connection intensity of the industry and standard mea-
sures of industry’s government dependence.21 Online Appendix B.5 provides more details on the

pendix B.5 for more details.
  21 Indeed, if we look at a regression of the share of connected firms in an industry as a function of an industry’s

Bureaucracy and Government Dependence Indices jointly, we find that one standard deviation increase in the Bureaucracy
Index is associated with 44% increase in the share of connected firms from the mean. To the contrary, a coefficient on the

construction of these indices and their correlations with political connections.


4.2.1   The Role of Local Politicians in Italy: Institutional Background

We provide a short excursus of two decades of Italian history to understand the roots of local
political power and how, after a series of events, this power has increased.
    In February 1992, the investigation into the biggest corruption scandal, known as Mani Pulite
(“Clean Hands"), started in Milan with the arrest of Mario Chiesa, a socialist manager of a public
hospice, and subsequently widened to the entire country and saw a huge increase in the number of
involved politicians, bureaucrats, and entrepreneurs. Mani Pulite uncovered a dense network of cor-
ruption and bribery throughout Italy (Vannucci, 2009). As a result, Italian parties were completely
disrupted, leading to a big change in the political arena. The radical change in the political class
following the “Mani Pulite” scandal, in fact, delineated the transition from the First (1946-1993) to
the Second Republic (since 1993).22 One of the peculiarities of the transition to the Second Republic
was the replacement in the political arena of the so-called “professional politicians” with political
newcomers, most of whom came from the business sector (Mattozzi and Merlo, 2008).23 At the
same time, high-rank politicians – including mayors, presidents, vice-mayors, and vice-presidents –
acquired greater decision-making power, and hence, could be considered more valuable for firms.
In fact, since the 1990s, a few reforms were enacted to shift towards a federal government, in which
spending and decision-making centers would move from the highest levels, the central state, to the
more local ones, with the idea of “getting closer" to the citizens.
    A change in the electoral rule towards a majority system in 1993 pledged the emergence of an
effective alternation in government of competing coalitions and the almost direct electoral investi-
ture of the Prime Minister. Since 1997, a series of reforms have conferred more functions and more
autonomy to the regions, provinces, and municipalities, so as to culminate in a reform of the Con-
stitution in 2001. According to the Article 114 of the Italian Constitution, modified in 2001, “The
[Italian] Republic is made up of Municipalities, Provinces, Metropolitan Cities, Regions, and the
State. Municipalities, Provinces, Metropolitan Cities, and Regions are autonomous entities with
their own statutes, powers and functions".
    In this system, in addition to the central government (two houses of parliament, the central gov-
ernment, and the prime minister), each geographical entity (8,110 municipalities, 103 provinces, and
20 regions) has its own local government with both a legislative and an executive branch, as well as
the executive head (mayor, president of province, and president of region, respectively). The regions
were given financial autonomy to decide freely how to spend their money and organizational auton-
omy to decide how many councilors to have and how much to pay them.24 Each of these different
Government Dependence Index is statistically insignificant and indistinguishable from zero.
  22 In 1993, there was a popular referendum that led to the abolition of the proportional electoral system that character-

ized the First Republic and to its substitution by a quasi-majoritarian system.
  23 In March 1994, national elections were held: those elections saw a major turnover in the new parliament, with 452

out of 630 deputies and 213 out of 315 senators elected for the first time.
  24 Although the 1948 Constitution directly granted even the non-Special Statute Regions legislative powers for limited

matters, such as agriculture, public works, tourism and urban planning, the regions were a little more than paper entities
(Del Duca and Del Duca, 2006). In other words, the regions had no power to impose taxes, and they depended only on
the State revenue sharing.

        Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


levels of government has authority over, and responsibility for, the provision of local public goods
and services, administrative authority over the issuing of permits and licenses, and some power to
set up rates for certain categories of taxes. Hence, the majority of bureaucratic procedures firms face
in their day-to-day operations is administered by local authorities, showing the importance of local
politicians for firms.
    This short discussion of the institutional background underlines that the links between en-
trepreneurs and local politicians have evolved and possibly strengthened over time in Italy.25


4.2.2   Firm-Level Political Connections and Industry Dynamics

As highlighted by our theory, political connections might have important implications for the aggre-
gate industry dynamics. If political connections slow down competition, industries with connected
firms may feature lower business dynamism, face lower firm entry and reallocation, be dominated
by larger or older firms and, as a result, might have lower productivity and growth. In this section,
we provide descriptive statistics at the industry and regional level consistent with these conjectures.
    First, we explore empirically if markets with higher political presence show lower signs of busi-
ness dynamism. We define market at the industry × region × year level and for each market, we
compute the share of connected firms, firm entry rates, and total employment growth (to the next
period) series. We then regress entry and growth rates on the share of connected firms, control-
ling for year, industry, and region fixed effects. Figure 4 plots binscatters from these regressions,
where each dot represents outcome variables adjusted for fixed effects. Regressions are weighted
by number of firms in each market. The results show that markets with higher political presence,
on average, have lower entry of new firms – Panel (a), and grow less – Panel (b).
    We quantify these relationships in Table 5 and, in addition, consider other measures for business
dynamism: productivity, share of young firms, and share of small firms. We find that more politi-
cally connected markets are less productive, have a lower share of young firms, and are dominated
by large firms – a clear signal of a lower degree of creative destruction. Interestingly, conditional on
entry, in those markets that are more populated by connected firms, new firms tend to start off with
connections, as evident from the last column of the table. In connected markets, in order to compete
with incumbents, entrants might need to seek protection before entering the market. However, we
cannot exclude that other time-variant factors at the market level that led incumbents to resort to
political connections could also make entrants do the same.
    Even if these relationships cannot be interpreted as being causal, our results show a strong
and negative correlation between our measures of connections and business dynamism in Italy.
We summarize our results in the following stylized facts that are in line with Implication #1 and
Implication #2 from the model:

  25 Evenif the core of our analysis is based on the 1993-2014 period, data on local politicians is available back to 1985
– allowing us to look at the evolution of firm-level political connections in Italy over time. Interestingly, we observe a
permanent increase in the level of high-rank connections around mid-1990s – the time that delineated the transition to the
Second Republic (see Online Appendix Figure A.1). We interpret this trend as a smoking gun for a regime shift from a
more “under the table” relationship between firms and politicians involving corruption and bribes towards a more formal
“moonlighting” relationship.

Notes: Each outcome variable at the industry × region × year level is regressed on the share of connected firms, control-
ling for industry, year, and region fixed effects. Each dot represents the adjusted outcome variable, namely the outcome
from which we subtract all covariates (except the share of connected firms) times their estimated coefficients. Regression
lines are depicted in each panel. Regressions are weighted by number of firms in each industry × region × year. The
x-axis is divided into 20 quantile bins and each dot represents average value within that bin. In Panel (a), the outcome is
entry rate of new firms. Panel (b) considers aggregate employment growth to the next period.

                 Fact 1.        More connected markets face lower firm entry, but conditional on entry, entrants are more
                 likely to be connected than in other industries.

                 Fact 2.    Markets with a higher share of politically connected firms have a lower share of young firms
                 and exhibit lower employment growth and productivity.

5      Firm-Level Empirical Analysis
In this section, we present results from the micro analysis at the firm level.


5.1      Leadership Paradox: Market Rank, Political Connections, and Innovation

How does market leadership influence a firm’s growth strategy? One possibility is for market
leaders to become even more innovative and extend their lead by pushing the technology frontier
forward. An alternative possibility is to follow some anti-competitive strategies to defend their lead
against their competitors. Our theory implies that market leaders are likely to follow the latter
strategy and rely on political connections to preempt competition and creative destruction. We now
examine this relationship empirically.
      We rank each firm based on its employment share in a market, where market is defined at the
(6-digit) industry × region × year level.26 We then zoom in on the top 20 firms across markets and
plot various measures of political connections and of innovation over firm’s market rank.
      Figure 5 shows the relationship between politician intensity and innovation intensity over a
firm’s market rank. We measure politician intensity (blue triangles) as the number of politicians
employed in a firm, normalized by 100 white-collar employees.27 We measure innovation intensity
(red squares) as the number of patent applications in a year, normalized again by 100 white-collar
employees. Both outcome variables are adjusted for industry, region, and year fixed effects. The blue
and red lines depict regression lines from regressing politician intensity and innovation intensity,
respectively, on market rank, controlling for industry, region, and year fixed effects. We observe
that market leaders – the largest firms – are the most politician-intensive, but also the least patent-
intensive.
      This “leadership paradox” is robust to alternative specifications. Online Appendix Figure B.1
presents a similar figure, but with alternative measures of politician and innovation intensities.
There, we measure politician intensity as the number of majority-party politicians employed in a
firm, normalized by 100 white-collar employees, and innovation intensity as intangible assets over
a firm’s value added. Again, politician and innovation intensities go in the opposite direction with
market rank.
      For visibility, Figures 5 and B.1 zoom in on the top 20 firms, however, we show that this rela-
tionship is preserved in the total sample of firms. Online Appendix Table B.1 shows coefficients
from OLS regressions of various measures of connection and innovation intensity on market rank
dummies, conditional on year, industry, and region fixed effects. Innovation intensity monotoni-
cally declines, while politician intensity monotonically increases with market rank. Age turns out
to be a crucial factor, too: older firms are less innovation intensive, but more politician intensive. In
the Appendix, we show that the observed relationship between innovation and connection intensity
over market rank is robust to alternative definition of market share. Online Appendix Figure B.2
plots similar figures over market rank, based on value added. In addition, Online Appendix Figure
    26 Defining
             market by industry, excluding regional dimension leads to similar results.
    27 Since
          politicians are mostly employed in white-collar positions, a more relevant normalization is the number of
white-collar workers in a firm. However, normalizing by total employment does not alter results significantly.

Notes: Figure plots politician intensity and innovation intensity over firm’s market rank for top 20 firms in the markets.
Market is defined at (6-digit) industry × region × year level. Markets in which top 1 firm holds less than 10% share
are excluded. Politician intensity (blue triangles) is the number of politicians employed in a firm normalized by 100
white-collar employees. Innovation intensity (red squares) is the number of patent applications in a year normalized by
100 white-collar employees (conditional on patenting). Both outcome variables are adjusted for industry, region, and year
fixed effects. The blue and red lines depict regression lines from regressing politician intensity and innovation intensity,
respectively, on market rank, controlling for industry, region, and year fixed effects.

B.3 illustrates that negative relationship between innovation intensity and market rank is also ro-
bust, if we consider quality-adjusted patents, where quality is measured by 5-year patent citations
or patent family size. Interestingly, this means that a reduction in the quantity of innovation by
market leaders is not offset by a better quality of innovation.
    These results on innovation are consistent with earlier findings on U.S. firms: using U.S. Census
data, Akcigit and Kerr (2018) show that larger firms are less innovation-intensive and come up with
less impactful innovation. Likewise, Argente et al. (2020) show that larger firms in the consumer
goods sector introduce new products at a declining pace, and their products are less novel. Hence,
an observation that large firms and market leaders are less innovative is perhaps less surprising, but
what characterizes these firms is that they rely more on political connections.

       Fact 3.    Market leaders are the most politician-intensive but the least innovation-intensive, relative to
       their direct competitors.


    This fact is in line with Implication #3 of our theory. The theory shows that larger firms have
higher incentives to be politically connected both because of static returns from removing market
frictions and dynamic motives to preempt competitors. Hence, Fact 3 corroborates our theoretical
intuition.

5.2     Political Connections and Firm Survival

The fourth implication of the model predicted that politically connected firms enjoy higher survival
probabilities. This section explores this prediction empirically.
      In the data, differences in survival probabilities of firms with different connection statuses are
large. To illustrate this, Figure 6 presents Kaplan-Meyer survival estimates splitting the sample of
firms based on their connection status over the lifecycle. Different curves plot cumulative survival
probabilities of firms that have never been connected; that have been connected, but never with a
majority-level or a high-rank politician; that have at some point been connected with a majority-
level politician but never one with a high-rank; and that have been connected with both a majority-
level and high-rank politician at some point in their life. We see that these survival probabilities
monotonically increase with the strength of connections that firm has established.

Notes: Kaplan-Meyer Survival estimates by maximum level of connections over the lifetime of a firm. Black curve
denotes firms that have never been connected with a politician; blue curve – firms that have been connected but never
with a politician from a majority party or a high-rank politician; green curve – firms that have been connected with a
politician from a majority party but never with a high-rank politician; red curve – firms that have been connected with a
high-rank politician. See Section 4.2 for the definitions of high-rank and majority politicians.


      These differences might be driven by the fact that connected firms are also larger, and large
firms are both more likely to be connected and more likely to survive. To address this concern, we
conduct a parametric Cox survival analysis on all firms in our sample. Table 6 reports the results.
The main explanatory variables for a firm’s survival are connection dummy (column 1), majority-
level dummy (column 2), and high-rank connection dummy (column 3). The model also controls
for firm size, a firm’s market share, and year and industry dummies.
      Conditional on observables, firms that are connected have lower hazard and therefore they sur-
vive longer. Survival time increases even further if a firm is connected with a majority-level or
a high-rank politician. Relative to non-connected firms, firms that are connected with high-rank
politicians experience a 0.275 decline in yearly log hazard rate, while connections with a majority-
level politician is associated with a 0.109 decline in yearly log hazard rate. This brings us to our

                                                                                          27

        Fact 4.     Politically connected firms are more likely to survive, and their survival probability increases
        in the political power of the politicians they employ.


5.3     Political Connections and Firm Growth

Do political connections help firms grow? Do firms use their political connections to push the
technology frontier? The answers to these questions could shed some light on the two alternative
hypothesis that connections are useful for or detrimental to technological progress. If firms use their
connections to push the frontier, employment growth should be coupled with productivity growth.
Alternatively, if political connections are used to gain certain types of preferential treatment (as
it was in our theoretical model) or to directly eliminate competition, the freed-up workers from
competitors would be reallocated to the connected firms. However, such growth in employment
would be detached from growth in productivity.
      In Tables 7, we estimate the following regressions:


                  yit = β 0 + β 1 Connectionit + β 2 Connection majorityit + ζxit + ηxt + γxi + ε it                   (10)

where yit is a firm i’s growth from t to t + 1. The main explanatory variables Connectionit and
Connection majorityit are dummy variables defined in Section 4.2. xit includes time-varying firm-
level controls – log total assets, log size (employment), and age. xt includes time dummies, while xi
includes a firm’s region and industry dummies for columns 1, 3, 5, and 7, and firm fixed effects for
columns 2, 4, 6, and 8.

Notes: Firm-level regressions described in equation (10). Dependent variables are growth in employment (columns 1
and 2), value added (columns 3 and 4), labor productivity (columns 5 and 6), and TFP (columns 7 and 8) from time t to
time t + 1. TFP is calculated using Cobb-Douglas specification where capital is measured as total assets, labor is given by
employment level from INPS, and labor share is taken equal to average industry-level labor share from the data. Main
control vaiables are Connection – a dummy variable equal to one if the firm is connected with a politician, and Connection
major – a dummy equal to one if the firm is connected with a majority-member politician at time t. The regressions, in
addition, control for a firm’s log assets, log size, age, as well as year, region, and industry fixed effects in columns 1 3, 5,
and 7; and for year dummies and firm fixed effects in columns 2, 4, 6, and 8. Robust standard errors clustered at firm
level reported in parentheses. ∗ p < 0.1,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01.

    Column 1 of Table 7 reports employment growth regression, controlling for a firm’s assets, size,
and age, as well as year, region, and industry fixed effects. The results show that connected firms
grow 3 percentage points faster, on average. Being connected to a majority party is associated with
an additional 0.3 percentage point employment growth. Column 2 shows similar coefficients using
identification within firms, including firm fixed effects. Columns 3 and 4 show that connected firms
grow 1 to 4 percentage point faster in value added.
    These results indicate that firms that are getting connected expand in terms of size and revenue.
However, this growth is not accompanied by a corresponding growth in these firms’ productivi-
ties. Columns 5 and 6 of Table 7 show similar regressions, but for the growth of labor productiv-
ity. Columns 7 and 8 repeat the same analysis for total factor productivity growth. We see that
connections are associated with a weak decline in productivity growth, while connections with
majority-level politicians are not significant.
    Overall, these results tell us that political connections are associated with positive growth in
size, but not in productivity. Online Appendix Table B.2 summarizes these opposing results but
extends the analysis to other dependent variables. Panel A looks at growth in size – employment,
white-collar employment, value added, and profits. Connections are positively associated with all
these outcomes. On the other hand, in Panel B, connections are associated negatively with future
growth in productivity measures – labor productivity, TFP, intangibles intensity, or patents growth.
    A major concern with these regressions is a potential endogeneity of the political connections.
Therefore, we perform a regression discontinuity analysis in the next section. We conclude this
section by summarizing our findings:

       Fact 5.     At the firm level, political connections are associated with higher employment and revenue
       growth, but not with productivity growth.

    This empirical fact is in line with Implication #5 of our model. Taken together, Fact 3 and Fact

                                                               29

5 suggest that the primary role of political connections is to help firms alleviate certain market
frictions and obtain preferential treatment that they do not necessarily use to innovate and advance
their productivities.


6       Causal Inference
In the spirit of Lee (2008), we exploit a quasi-random discontinuity caused by local elections decided
on a thin margin to gauge the causality of our firm-level growth results. The idea behind this method
is to compare the post-election performance of two different firms that were politically connected
to different competing parties right before a marginally-contested election. Since the outcomes of
closely contested elections can be considered as pure chance, discontinuity in outcomes between
marginally winning and losing firms after the election can be attributed to a causal effect of majority-
level connections on firms’ outcomes. Before we go into the details of the methodology, it is useful
to describe the institutional setting of the Italian local elections and the identification of closely
contested elections in our data.


6.1         Institutional details on elections.

Elections at the municipal level. Local elections are typically held every five years, and voters are asked
to choose a mayor and members of the local council. There are around 8,100 municipalities in Italy,
with populations ranging from 100 inhabitants to 3 million inhabitants. Electoral law could have
some size-dependent nuances across municipalities.
      Elections generally take place through the “one-shot” voting mechanism with a majoritarian
system for both the mayor and the council members. Votes are cast both for mayor candidates
and the parties that support those candidates.28 In large municipalities (population > 15, 000), if
no candidate gets an absolute majority, i.e., more than 50%, then the election goes to the second
round. Votes cast for the candidates not only determine the identity of a mayor, but also determine
the allocation of seats to parties with the candidates. Importantly, the winning candidate gets a
majority premium, and hence his/her party/coalition is guaranteed to have a majority of the seats
on the council.29 After determining the total allocation of seats to a winning coalition, the further
allocation of seats within a winning coalition or outside of it is determined by the votes cast for each
party.
      Elections at the provincial level. Elections are normally held every 5 years, and voters choose the
president of the province and the council composition. Electoral rules for province-level elections
are very similar to the ones for large municipalities (population > 15, 000) as described above.30
    28 In
        general, separate voting is not allowed, so that voters cannot pick candidates and parties from competing tickets,
except in large municipalities.
  29 Specifically, 2/3 of the seats in smaller municipalities and at least 60% in larger municipalities.
  30 Major reform concerning province-level elections was enacted around 2014. The reform in essence removed province-

level elections. The Budget Law for 2012 (L214/2011: Disposizioni urgenti per la crescita, l’equitáe il consolidamento dei
conti pubblici) has laid the foundations for a provincial reform in Italy that came to an end in 2014 with the so-called
Delrio Law (L56/2014). In the transitory regime, elections in the provinces of Como, Belluno, Vicenza, Genova, La Spezia,
Ancona, and Caltanissetta e Ragusa were not held. As a result, in the transition period (2012-2014), many provinces did
not hold scheduled elections. Instead, they extended the mandate of the incumbent politicians. Hence, in those cases, we
impute results from the previous elections by extending the results to more than 5 years.


                                                           30
        Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


    Elections at the regional level. Regional elections are generally held every 5 years in the twenty
regions of Italy. Before 1995, voters did not directly choose a regional president. Instead, they cast
votes for parties/coalitions that formed a council. Allocation of seats between parties was based on a
proportional system. However, since 1995, it is possible to cast votes for a presidential candidate, as
well as for parties/coalitions forming a government (with lists running at district or regional level).
There is no possibility of runoff. The coalition associated with a winning president is generally
assured a majority of the seats in the government (at least 55%). The rest of the seats are determined
by the number of votes cast for each party.31


Identifying marginally contested elections.             Our detailed data allows us to identify elections that
have been contested on a thin margin. As described above, votes cast for the candidates (not for
parties) determine the margin of victory and the identity of a majority party/coalition in a particular
election.32 In most cases, the minimum threshold of votes is 50%, and if that threshold is not reached
by anyone, a runoff is expected. Important exceptions to the 50%-threshold are elections in small
municipalities with a population below 15, 000 inhabitants, as well as in regional elections. In such
cases, a second round is never held and the winner is the one who receives the largest share of votes
in the first round.
    We identify the marginal elections as follows: let p1 denote the share of votes obtained by a
winner and p2 the share of votes held by a runner-up. We define a margin of victory as the difference
between the share of votes of the highest-share candidate (p1 ) and of the second-highest share
candidate (p2 ) in a decisive round. Hence, margin of victory ≡ p1 − p2 .
    There were 36,513 municipal elections during the 1993-2014 period. Out of those, 19,589 were
decided within a 20% margin, 5,879 within a 5% margin, and 2,395 within a very narrow 2% margin.
At the provincial level, 846 out of 1,162 elections were decided within a 20% margin, and 266 and 62
– within 5% and 2% margins, respectively.33 This provides us with a large sample for our regression
discontinuity analysis.34 Online Appendix Figure B.4 shows that the distribution of victory margins
in our sample period is smooth, while B.5 shows that marginal elections are geographically scattered
all over Italy with no particular geographic concentration.


Random outcomes of marginal elections.                Our identification strategy relies on the randomness
of election outcomes when the margin of victory is close to zero. A threat to this randomness
could come from incumbency advantage – incumbent politicians may have higher chances of re-
election even in tight contests. We examine this possibility by looking at the re-election probability
of incumbent parties. If the outcomes of close elections cannot be anticipated, then the odds of
winning for an incumbent party/coalition should be the same as odds of non-incumbents. Figure 7
   31 Parties may decide to compete within district or regional lists, and this will have an effect on how the seats are

allocated. However, in our data, we have information on the allocation of final seats, hence we do not need to work out
all these details to determine how many seats a party/coalition got.
   32 We cannot define marginal elections for regional elections before 1995, as presidents were not chosen directly and

seats were allocated proportionally based on votes for parties.
   33 At the regional level, 62 out of 266 elections were decided within a 20% margin and 21 were decided within a 5%

margin, and just 10 elections were decided within a 2% margin.
   34 For example, even for elections within 4% victory margin (for example, an election with 48%-52% outcome), we have

more than 20,000 RLP politicians for whom we have detailed party affiliation and social security information from INPS.

plots the probability of re-election – the share of elections won by an incumbent party as a function
of the margin of victory. The sample contains all those elections (within the 20% margin) where
an incumbent party/coalition is either a winner or a runner-up. We see that elections with a wide
victory margin feature a large incumbency advantage in terms of re-election. However, closer to the
zero margin of victory, the outcome of an election resembles a coin flip – an incumbent is exactly as
likely to win as the other candidate.

Notes: Share of elections won by an incumbent party against the margin of victory in those elections. Re-election is equal
to one if a winning party is the same (or shares at least one common party, in the case of coalitions) as an incumbent
party/coalition that won the last election. Margin of victory is equal to the difference between share of votes received by
a winning candidate minus the share of votes by a runner-up. The sample focuses on all the elections, where margin of
victory is less than 0.2 and an incumbent party/coalition is either a winner or a runner-up.


    Another potential concern could be that our identification of treated and control groups in RD
could be noisy if, in anticipation of a closely contested election, firms employ politicians from
both competing parties. We check for this possibility in Figure 8, where, across firms, we plot the
distribution of the share of winning politicians at firm i in the election held at time t. Share of
winning politicians is defined as


                                                                              Winning-party membersit−1
    Share o f winning politiciansit =

and is simply the number of workers employed in a company i at t − 1 who were members of the
winning party/coalition of the election in t, divided by the total number of politicians employed
in i at t − 1. An interesting finding here is that only 4% of firms employ politicians from both
competing parties simultaneously.35 We see that firms almost always “bet” only on one side of an
election. While 75% of the firms employ only from the winning party, 20% of the firms employ only
from the losing party.36
  35 In   the subsequent analysis, we drop those observations.
  36 Though     it is tempting to infer from this figure that firms seem to anticipate election outcomes just because there is a

Notes: Figure shows distribution of firms over share of winning politicians in their companies in elections within 10% victory
margin. We compute share of winning politicians in a company i as the number of workers employed in the company i at
t − 1 who were members of the winning party of the election in t, divided by the total number of politicians employed in
i at t − 1. We see that firms usually “bet” on one side of an election, and the share of firms employing politicians from
the competing parties is very low.

6.2     Regression Specification

Now we are ready to describe our econometric specification. Let m denote an election that has been
decided with a victory margin Victory marginm , T (m) – the year in which it was held, yiT (m) – the
outcome variable (e.g., firm i’s employment or labor productivity growth from T (m) to T (m) + 1),
winning dummy WiniT (m)−1 – a dummy equal to one if firm i at time T (m) − 1 employs a politician
from a party that wins the election m. We ultimately estimate the following relationship:

           yiT (m) = α + βWiniT (m)−1 + f (Victory marginm ) + δ1 XiT (m) + δ2 Xm + δ3 XT + νiT (m) ,                     (11)

where f (Victory marginm ) is a polynomial function in margin of victory of election m estimated on
both sides of the threshold, XiT (m) are firm-level controls, such as the firm’s age and size at time
T (m), Xm is a set of province dummies, XT is a year dummy, and νiT (m) is the error term. The
parameter of interest β identifies the causal effect of treatment (winning) at the threshold.
      Our benchmark specification includes WiniT (m)−1 and f (Victory marginm ). When the assignment
of treatment is random, our estimate of β should be invariant to the inclusion of additional controls
XiT (m) , Xm or XT , since they should be orthogonal to treatment. We validate this assumption in
Section 6.5 below and show our results with and without those additional controls. We follow the
recent literature (see Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and Cattaneo et al. (2018) for an excellent review)
and in our baseline results approximate the regression functions above and below the threshold
with local linear polynomials, with weights implied by triangular kernel. Hence, our benchmark

larger mass at one than zero, as opposed to 50-50, this inference is not correct. Recall from Table 3 that Majority affiliation
is equal to one for 73% of observations in RLP. If every firm had employed only one randomly-chosen politician, by
construction, we would have observed 73% of the firms at 1 and 27% at 0 in Figure 8.



                                                               33
          Connecting to Power: Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics


f (Victory marginm ) is the first-order polynomial interacted with winning dummy. The benchmark
bandwidth is chosen following the optimal bandwidth choice of Imbens and Kalyanaraman (2012).
We demonstrate robustness to different choices of the order of a local polynomial, a weighting
function, and a bandwidth in Section 6.4.


6.3     Graphical Analysis

We first illustrate a discontinuity at the threshold graphically in Panel (a) of Figure 9, where the
outcome variable is firm-level employment growth. We plot a firm’s growth from T to T + 1 against
margin of victory at time T. Positive margins of victory denote firms that have been connected
at time T − 1 with a politician from a party that won an election at time T with a corresponding
margin of victory. Likewise, negative margins of victory depict firms that are connected with losing
politicians. The figure focuses on all the elections that were decided with no more than a 10%
margin. For visibility, we divide the x-axis into 0.01-wide intervals of the margin of victory at time
T. Each point denotes average growth of firms in that interval; the solid lines represent predicted
flexible polynomial fits from a regression that includes third order polynomial in margin of victory,37
a win dummy WiniT −1 , and an interaction of the dummy with the polynomial. As a robustness
check, we repeat the same plot for the elections within 20% victory margin in Online Appendix
Figure B.6.
      A large positive discontinuity at the zero victory margin threshold visible in Panel (a) identifies
the existence of a positive causal effect of majority-level connections on the employment growth after
elections. This confirms that the direction of causality in previous firm-level regressions does (also)
run from political connections to growth. An interesting observation is that firms connected with
barely losing politicians have lower post-election growth rates than firms connected with politicians
whose parties lost by a wide margin. Since power of political connection for losing firms closer to
the margin is presumably stronger than that of firms losing further away from the margin (as the
latter belong to a party controlling fewer seats), one might expect connections to have a relatively
stronger positive effect for firms closer to the threshold. However, note that for firms losing on a
wide margin, election outcome was anticipated, while losing was a negative shock for firms at the
threshold who now would need to downsize relative to their expectations (for example, expectation
of a lucrative contract or the expectation of receiving a permit, or a speedy removal of certain
bureaucratic burden, etc.). These anticipation and selection differences aside, one could still argue
that firms connected with fierce competitors of barely winning candidates could be performing
worst because, for example, of a strong competition for the same resources. In addition, marginal
elections are quite different from standard elections: in tightly contested elections, connected firms
on both sides may allocate significant financial resources before the elections, especially hurting
post-election growth opportunities of losing firms.
      RD plots also confirm a causal interpretation of firm-level results on labor productivity growth.
Panel (b) of Figure 9 shows no positive effects of connections on productivity growth. As a robust-
ness check, we again repeat the same plot for the elections within a 20% victory margin in Online
Appendix Figure B.6.
 37 The   fourth-order polynomial fits look very similar.

Notes: Figure plots a firm’s growth from T to T + 1 against margin of victory at time T. Positive margins of victory
denote firms that have been connected at time T − 1 with a politician from a party that won an election at time T with
the corresponding margin of victory. Likewise, negative margins of victory depict firms that are connected with losing
politicians. For visibility, we divide the x-axis into 0.01-wide intervals of the margin of victory at time T, and each
point denotes average outcome of firms in that interval. The solid lines represent predicted third order polynomial fits
from the regression that includes third order polynomial in margin of victory, a dummy Winit−1 , and an interaction of
the dummy with the polynomial. The dashed line represents 90% confidence intervals. Outcome variable in Panel (a)
is employment growth, while in Panel (b) it is labor productivity growth. Figures are normalized such that outcome
variables for marginal losers at the threshold are equal to zero.


6.4       RD Estimates

We now illustrate the estimates from the RD setup described in Section 6.2. Table 8 reports our
benchmark results. Columns 1 and 3 correspond to the regression 11 including WiniT −1 and
f (Victory margin), without additional controls. Coefficient on winning dummy is large and sig-
nificant for employment growth, translating into a 4-percentage-point difference in growth rate,
which is economically sizable. The effect on productivity growth is not statistically different from
zero.
      Table 9 illustrates robustness to the choice of kernel function for local polynomial regression,
polynomial order, and bandwidths. Panel A repeats our benchmark results but uses uniform kernel
weighting for the local linear regression; Panel B uses a second-order local polynomial approxi-
mation for f (Victory margin); while Panels C and D report benchmark results on 20% and 10%
bandwidths. Our results are robust to these variations.


6.5       Tests for Quasi-Random Assignment

Additional controls. Our identification strategy relies on the assumption of the random assign-
ment of the winner in marginally contested elections. This implies that marginally winning and
marginally losing firms are very comparable and should not show systematic differences in pre-
determined covariates. We provide some tests to support the quasi-random assignment in our RD

Notes: RD estimates for employment growth (columns 1 and 2) and labor productivity growth (columns 3 and 4) based
on regression specification 11. Growth rates are defined from T to T + 1. In the columns 1 and 3, regressions include
win dummy, WiniT −1 , and f (Victory margin) – a linear polynomial interacted with win dummy. Columns 2 and 4 also
include additional controls such as year and firm province fixed effects, log size, and age. The local linear regressions

design. First, the inclusion of additional covariates in the regressions (XiT (m) , Xm , XT in equation
11) should not change the main effect of the treatment. Indeed, after including additional controls,
such as year and province fixed effects, log size and age in columns 2 and 4 of Tables 8 and 9, we
see that the magnitude of the main coefficients does not significantly change.


Pre-trends.     Next, we examine the pre-trends in outcome variables. Figure 10 illustrates RD plots
similar to the above plots, but for the employment growth and labor productivity growth at T − 1,
right before the elections. Panel (a) shows the result for employment growth and Panel (b) shows
it for productivity growth. We see no significant difference in pre-elections growth rates at the
threshold, which implies that the firms on the winning and losing sides do not show any systematic
difference in main outcome variables prior to the election.


Balancing tests.      Lastly, we show balancing tests for various pre-determined firm-level variables at
time T − 1. To analyze any discontinuity of pre-determined covariates at the zero margin threshold,
we use the same techniques as in our benchmark RD setup. Specifically, for each covariate of interest,
we employ a local linear estimation with an optimal bandwidth and triangular kernel. We report
estimates of discontinuity for the before-election firm size, value added, assets, intangible capital,
labor productivity, profits, previous-period growth in size and productivity, age, and geographic
location in various columns of Table 10. These results show that the treatment and control groups
are comparable around the threshold. The only statistically significant difference emerges in firm’s
age, however the magnitude of one year is economically small.

Notes: Different panels illustrate robustness checks on the results reported in Table 8. Growth rates are defined from T to
T + 1. In the columns 1 and 3, regressions include win dummy, WiniT −1 , and f (Victory margin). Columns 2 and 4 also
include additional controls such as year and firm province fixed effects, log size, and age. Panel A repeats the benchmark
results but uses uniform kernel weighting for the local linear regression. Panel B employs a local polynomial regression
of order 2. Panels C and D report benchmark results with 20% and 10% bandwidths.

7    Politicians’ Compensation
In this section, we speak to the final model implication about the politicians’ compensation and rent
sharing between a politician and a firm. Thanks to the earnings information from the Social Security
data, we can also provide some empirical estimates of the return to worker-politicians, measured by
additional wage premium firms pay to their workers-politicians.
    In the absence of any controls, we observe a 21% wage premium for politician-workers, relative
to their co-workers in the same firm. Clearly, differences in worker characteristics and the types of
jobs that they perform could account for this difference. We address this concern with two types of
analysis: within-group and within-individual comparisons.

Notes: Figure plots a firm’s growth from T − 1 to T against margin of victory at time T. Positive margins of victory
denote firms that have been connected at time T − 1 with a politician from a party that won an election at time T with
the corresponding margin of victory. Likewise, negative margins of victory depict firms that are connected with losing
politicians. For visibility, we divide the x-axis into 0.01-wide intervals of the margin of victory at time T, and each
point denotes average outcome of firms in that interval. The solid lines represent predicted third order polynomial fits
from the regression that includes third order polynomial in margin of victory, a dummy WiniT −1 , and an interaction of
the dummy with the polynomial. The dashed lines represent 90% confidence intervals. Outcome variable in panel (a)
is employment growth, while panel (b) depicts labor productivity growth. Figures are normalized such that outcome
variables for marginal losers at the threshold are equal to zero.

Within-group comparison. First, we compute wage premiums of politicians relative to their co-
workers in the same groups, defined by type of job – white-collar or blue-collar, and gender (see
Online Appendix Table B.3 for more details). Figure 11 reports these within-group wage premiums
for white-collar politicians by political position’s hierarchical rank and geographic level. Panel (a)
shows that politicians obtain significant wage premiums, starting from 10% for any-rank politician,
going up to 25% for high-rank female politicians. Panel (b) further shows that while municipality-
level politicians secure, on average, about a 9% wage premium over similar co-workers, province-
level and regional politicians earn premiums that are much higher and go up to a staggering 108%
for white-collar male regional politicians.

Notes: Wage premium – the percentage difference between politician’s weekly wage and other co-workers’ average weekly
wage of the same job collar and gender in the same firm × year. Panel (a) reports the wage premium of white-collar
politicians of any rank versus high-rank politicians. Panel (b) reports the wage premium of white-collar politicians at any
level versus other levels (municipal, provincial, or regional – in the hierarchical order). Appendix Table B.3 also reports
wage premiums for blue-collar politicians.




Within-individual comparison. Figure 11 might still reflect differences in other job and worker
characteristics between politicians and non-politicians. To mitigate these concerns, in the second
analysis, we take an event study approach. We focus on workers who become politicians while
working in a firm and we look at the evolution of their wage premiums relative to co-workers in
the same firm before and after becoming politicians. Specifically, denote by t=0 the year in which
an individual becomes a politician for the first time. All years that the individual works in the same
firm are indexed relative to that year. We consider a panel of individuals who become politicians
while working in a firm and who work in the same firm at least a year before and after the event.
We study the evolution of their wage premiums in the 10-year windows before and after the event,
as a function of event time. Specifically, we estimate the following specification for the event study
(Kleven et al., 2018):




                                                                                                   39

                       yist =     ∑        α j I [ j = t ] + ∑ β k I [k = agest ] + ∑ γy I [y = s] + εist ,                           (12)
                                j 6 = −1                   k                             y

where yist is the wage premium – the percentage difference between politician’s weekly wage and
other co-workers’ average weekly wage – of individual i in year s at event time t. Hence, the
regression includes time event dummies, full set of year dummies, and individual’s age dummies.
    Figure 12 plots the α j coefficients on the event time dummies from this regression.38 Coefficient
on t = −1 is normalized to zero. Since, in this exercise, all the fixed worker, firm, and colleague
characteristics are conditioned on, a jump in the premium at zero can be attributed to the acquisi-
tion of political power by the worker. Not surprisingly, the jump at t = 0 is gradual, as political
appointments usually do not start in the first month of the year. This graph suggests that a worker
might become more valuable to his/her firm after s/he enters politics. This result could also be
driven by the fact that workers have a greater outside option after acquiring political power and
hence can bargain higher wages. To the contrary, we do not find an evidence of a decline (neither of
an increase) in politicians’ wage premium after they lose their political seats but continue working
in a firm.
    Clearly, a change in the wage premium that we calculate is a lower bound for the total financial
benefit of holding political office. First, workers that are also employed in a political job could
reduce their private-sector working hours or level of effort. In the absence of detailed data on
hours or level of effort, we underestimate the true change in wage premium. Second, the official
private-sector wage premium should, presumably, be a small part of the total financial benefits.
Non-wage benefits, like bribes, access to better financing, or other rent-seeking activities may largely
contribute to the wealth accumulation of politicians during their term in office (Fisman et al., 2014).
Nevertheless, we find it interesting that the monetary returns for being a politician show up even in
the most transparent way – through private sector wages.


Rent sharing.         The evidence above indicates that firms value their politician-workers and share the
surplus with them. To get a sense of how the surplus is shared, we perform a back of the envelope
calculation for the share of additional profits associated with political connections that are accounted
by wage premiums paid to politicians. This is suggestive evidence for the amount of (static) rent
sharing between a firm and politicians, the evidence of which is the first step in understanding the
bargaining process between a firm and the political system.
Notes: Figure 12 depicts within-individual within-firm wage premium evolution before and after becoming a politician. Wage premium
is the percentage difference between politician’s weekly wage and other co-workers’ average weekly wage. Red dots depict event time
dummy coefficients from regression (12). Omitted dummy is at t = −1. The dashed grey lines denote 95% confidence intervals. Standard
errors are clustered at the individual level. The vertical shaded area corresponds to the time around the event when a worker becomes
a politician for the first time while working in a firm. The sample (700, 622 observations) includes all the workers who at some point
during their career in a firm become politicians and are observed in the firm for at least a year before and after the event. An increase in
the wage premium is even higher if we calculate the premium only relative to stable co-workers from the previous period (instead of all
co-workers). Figure 13 shows a back of the envelope calculation for the rent division between a firm and politicians. Total rent consists
of firm’s yearly profit gain from connections (blue area) and an additional income gain for worker-politicians estimated from the event
study in 12 (orange area). See the main text for the details of the calculation.

  38 The estimated wage premium slightly increases if we look at the premium only relative to stable co-workers from the

last year, instead of all co-workers. Hence, a potential change in the composition of co-workers does not play a role.

    To calculate the nominal wage premium paid to politicians, we use an estimate of a change in
wage premium after becoming a politician from equation (12). Since wage contracts adjust gradu-
ally, we take the average percentage change in the wage premium for several years after acquiring
the connection – roughly 0.035 percentage points. Taking the average weekly pay of (non-politician)
co-workers in a firm of 747 Euros, and given that on average firms employ 1.7 politician-workers
conditional on being connected, we obtain an estimated yearly income gain of 2, 311 Euros for
politicians in a firm. To the extent that firms could anticipate the future political career of a worker,
estimating the wage gain only from a change in the wage premium is a conservative measure of
the rents paid by a firm to the politicians. To estimate gains in profits associated with political
connections, we use estimates from the firm-level fixed effect regression of yearly profit growth on
connection dummy (Table B.2), which amounts to 2.8 percentage points. Given the average value of
profits in the sample, we obtain an estimated 9, 037 Euros of static yearly profit gain for a firm. Then
our back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that an additional wage premium paid to politicians
can account for 26% of the gains by the firm. In other words, politicians’ gains as a percentage of the
total surplus from the interaction of a firm and politicians is 20% (= 26%/(100% + 26%)). Figure
13 depicts the division. As discussed above, because of anticipation and other potential monetary
transfers from a firm not captured by the official private-sector wages, these calculations should be
considered as a lower bound for a surplus captured by politicians.

             Fact 6. Worker-politicians earn significant wage premiums relative to their co-workers. This premium
             increases with the political rank of a worker.



8   Conclusion
In this paper, we studied the link between political connections and firm dynamics, both theoreti-
cally and empirically, with Italy as our example. Our brand-new data, matching multiple admin-
istrative datasets together for the first time, enabled us to uncover new findings at the micro and


                                                              41

macro levels. We showed that hiring/employing a local politician is a common practice, especially
among large market leaders. Politician-workers earn significant wage premiums, relative to their co-
workers, that are not explained by their individual characteristics. We also showed that politically
connected firms grow in employment and revenues, survive longer in the market, but at the same
time, have lower productivity growth. This finding is consistent with the view that political connec-
tions help firms remove particular market frictions or block competition, as opposed to help them
push the productivity and technology frontiers. Our analysis also showed that firms lower their
innovation efforts and increase their political connections as they become the market leaders. At the
more aggregate level, political connections tend to be associated with worse industry dynamics –
lower entry, reallocation, growth, and productivity. This indicates that the effects of firm-level po-
litical connections go beyond the micro-level effects on connected firms, and may imply significant
social costs.
    A growing body of literature has argued that factor reallocation from low-productivity incum-
bents to high-productivity entrants is an important source of economic growth. Our results suggest
that political connections might be an important impediment to such factor reallocation and produc-
tivity growth. While these connections might alleviate certain market frictions, such as regulatory
barriers or bureaucratic burden, dynamically – by giving incumbents a powerful advantage over
entrants – their detrimental impact on market competition and creative destruction might reverse
the static benefits. Our results could also shed some light on the declining business dynamism in
the U.S. and in Europe, where market concentration has increased and lobby spending has grown
to record levels (Zingales, 2012; Decker et al., 2016; Loecker and Eeckhout, 2018). Future work
should incorporate these opposing effects that have been highlighted in our model and assess their
quantitative importance for aggregate growth and welfare in different countries.

A    Model Extension: Endogenizing Politician’s Compensation
Our benchmark model in the main text has focused on the static gains and dynamic losses. To
keep these aspects tractable, we kept the determination of the politician’s compensation exogenous.
However, it is fairly straightforward to incorporate a Nash bargaining framework that would pro-
vide some additional insights. To this end, let us assume that politicians have different political
powers φ ∈ (0, 1), in line with their hierarchies. A politician with a political power φ is able to re-
move red tape by the same fraction φ, thus the firm has to pay (1 + (1 − φ)τ )wl for hiring l workers
(our benchmark model corresponds to φ = 1). This implies that a firm with a politician with power
φ earns the following gross profit:
                                                     πq
                                                               .
                                                1 + (1 − φ ) τ
    Denote the bargaining power of the politician by γ and assume his/her outside value is simply
η (φ), where η 0 (φ) > 0. For simplicity, we also assume that the firm’s outside option is to operate
without a politician, hence it is V−1 (q). Once the firm and the politician decide to match together,
they stay together until the firm is replaced by another firm. It is convenient to formulate the prob-
lem in terms of the lump-sum compensation of the politician, which we denote by w̄ p . We denote
the dynamic value of being connected to a φ-power politician (including politician’s compensation)
     φ
by V1 and of not being connected by V−1 . Then the Nash bargaining problem is simply
                                 h                           i 1− γ
           w̄ p (φ) ≡ arg max V1 (q) − V−1 (q) − w̄ p (φ)           [w̄ p (φ) − η (φ)]γ
                                   φ
                            p
                          w̄ (φ)
                                                                              
                                          1                           1
                    = γπq                                  −                      + (1 − γ ) η ( φ ) ,   (13)
                              [1 + (1 − φ) τ ] [r + p̃ (φ)] [1 + τ ] [r + p]

where p̃ (φ) is creative destruction rate faced by a firm connected with φ-power politician, while p is
creative destruction rate faced by a non-connected firm. Note that by connecting to a politician with
φ, the incumbent manages to generate a cost advantage equal to φτ. Hence, the quality threshold
for the creative destruction to take place becomes λ∗ (φ) = φτ.
    This time, the rate at which a connected incumbent gets replaced is

                                     p̃(φ) = p[α + (1 − α) Pr(λ > φτ )],

    which implies p̃0 (φ) < 0. This implies that a firm that is connected to a more powerful politician
is more likely to survive.
    Next, we interpret the compensation of the politician as a function of its political power. The
compensation w̄ p (φ) increases in φ through three channels evident from equation (13): first, a more
powerful (large φ) politician brings higher static profits due to lower wedges ((1 − φ)τ) that the

                                                       46
                 Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


firm is required to pay. Second, a more powerful politician leads to lower replacement rate of
the incumbent ( p̃ (φ)). Finally, a more powerful politician has a better outside option, which allows
him/her to extract a bigger fraction of the joint surplus. We conclude this section with the following
implication. Politician’s compensation w̄ p (φ) increases in his/her political power φ.


B       Data Construction
This section provides more details on the steps undertaken during the data and variables construc-
tion.


B.1     Dataset #1: Social Security Data (INPS)

The Italian SS data contains rich information on the universe of private-sector firms and their work-
ers making social security contributions at INPS. At the individual level, we calculate an individual
weekly wage – weekly gross labor income (including bonuses and overtime) as total yearly labor
income, divided by number of weeks worked. We classify a worker as a white-collar if s/he is a
manager, executive, professional, or an office worker (qualifica1 variable from UniEMENS equal to
2, 3, 7, 9, or P).
    At the firm level, we describe a construction of three variables from INPS – employment, average
weekly pay, and age. To construct yearly employment at the firm level39 – a variable firm Size –
we count the number of workers present in a firm in March.40 Some observations may be zeros,
especially when firm is just starting or before it exits the business. We define employment growth
at time t as employment growth to the next period:

                                                            Lit+1 − Lit
                                                 gLit = 2               ,                                             (14)
                                                            Lit+1 + Lit

where gLit stands for growth rate and Lit for employment. This measure follows Davis et al. (1998)
and is bounded between -2 and 2 and reduces impact of outliers – which is especially important at
the entry and exit of a firm.
    At the firm level, Average weekly pay refers to the average weekly pay (in thousands of 2014 Euros)
of workers who are present in March. A firm’s Age is calculated from the first year when it gives a
formal notice of operations to the INPS office intending to have an employee on the payroll.


B.2     Dataset #2: Firm Financials Data (Cerved)

We use the following main company accounts variables from Cerved: a firm’s total assets, intangible
assets, value added, and profits. In addition, we compute labor productivity, LP, and total factor
productivity, TFP.
  39 Note  that firm-level employment variable in Cerved data is of very poor quality, so INPS data is crucial to construct
a complete firm-level dataset.
  40 This is consistent with data construction by (Haltiwanger et al., 2013) using the U.S. Census data. Alternatively, one

can look at average monthly employment in a year, but the measures are very similar.




                                                            47
              Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


   VA is the yearly value added of a firm – revenue less the cost of intermediates. We replace
with missing any negative value added (valore_aggiunto_operativo). Profits is value added less
operating expenses, depreciation, and financial costs. Assets (attivo) is the total assets of a firm.
Intangibles is intangible fixed assets. For tangible assets (immob_mat) and intangible fixed assets
(immob_immat), we replace missings with zeros when possible. In most cases, Cerved data does not
distinguish between missing values and zeros: observations whose value is less than 1 (in 1000) and
observations that are truly missing in the report will both appear as missing. This is the case with
tangible and intangible fixed assets variables. We impute with 0.5 (in 1000) the value of intangible
assets if value of tangible assets is not missing, and vice versa for tangible assets. We verify these
imputations with another simple imputation of missing values in the panel of firms – by simply
imputing the missing value with latest non-missing observation. If such an imputation is too far off
from the initial imputation of 0.5, we revert back to the missing value.
   LP – labor productivity – is defined as value added per employee. We calculate a firm’s total
factor productivity, TFP, using a standard Cobb-Douglas specification: Y = zK α L1−α . Output (Y)
is measured as value added, capital (K) is measured as total assets, labor (L) is employment, and
labor share (1 − α) is the average industry-level labor share from the data. This gives us z – our TFP
measure.
   Corresponding growth rates of the above variables at time t are calculated as a growth from t to
t + 1. All nominal variables are deflated with GDP deflator (2014 is the base year). In the analysis,
we winsorize all these variables at top and bottom 1 percent.


B.3   Dataset #3: Patent Data (PATSTAT)

We use EPO PATSTAT to obtain information on patenting activities of Italian firms. This section
describes the matching procedure of EPO PATSTAT to our firm-level data, as well as the construction
of our patent-based innovation measures.
   First, we identify the sample of EPO patents applied for by Italian firms. Focusing on the
period of 1990-2014, we identify 84,085 EPO patent applications filed by Italian companies. Some
of those applications represent variants of the same patent and belong to the same patent family.
Applicants may seek for protection for their inventions in multiple national offices, resulting in
multiple applications that effectively represent the same invention. Hence, the relevant count is a
count of unique patent families: we have 71,240 EPO patent families. In what follows, when it does
not incur ambiguity, we will refer to patent families as just patents.
   Second, we need to match patent records with our firm-level datasets. Unfortunately, patent data
does not provide firm fiscal codes, which we could use to directly match PATSTAT records to Cerved
data. Hence, we turn to company name cleaning routines to help to standardize company names
in PATSTAT, and then match those names to fiscal codes. We proceed in the following three steps.
We start by using an extensive patent-firm fiscal code match conducted by Unioncamere-Dintec.
The name cleaning by Unioncamere is very precise, as it combines standard name cleaning routines
with extensive manual checks to maximize patent matches for the period of 2000-2016. We extend
the Unioncamere matches backwards by applying the Unioncamere “dictionary" from 2000-2016 to
the period 1990-1999. Combined, this procedure results in up to 90% of patent matches. We further


                                                  48
              Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


increase the matching rate (especially for the 90’s) by using name cleaning routines from Lotti and
Marin (2013) and the matched sample of patents from Thoma et al. (2010). Final matches result
in a 93% matching rate of all EPO patents for the period of 1990-2014. We identify 13,904 unique
companies who file for patents. To the best of our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive
match of Italian patent records to Italian firms spanning the longest time period.
   Third, for all patents, we extract information on their technology classification (IPC – interna-
tional patent classification), application date, grant status, number of claims, and backward and
forward citations. We take the application date of a patent to be the earliest application date of all
patents in the same patent family.
   This data allows us to construct various measures of a firm’s patenting activity considering
different measures of patent qualities.

  1. Clearly, whether a patent is granted or not is one type of patent quality measure. Hence, for
     each year, we construct a simple count of all patents and of all granted patents of a firm in a
     year.

  2. The number of claims is another quality measure often used in the literature to proxy for
     patent breadth (Lerner, 1994; Lanjouw and Schankerman, 2004); for each year, we construct
     claims-weighted patent counts of a firm.

  3. We also consider patent family size as another proxy for patent quality, as it indicates the
     extent of the geographical protection that and applicant is seeking. Hence, another measure
     of firm’s inventive activity in a year is family-size-weighted patent counts in a year.

  4. The number of citations a patent receives has traditionally been used as a measure of the
     economic and technological significance of a patent (see Pakes, 1986; Pakes and Schankerman,
     1986; Trajtenberg, 1990; Hall et al., 2001; Kogan et al., 2012; Abrams et al., 2013; Moser et al.,
     2015). Our main measure of a firm’s inventive activity is citations-weighted patent counts.
     We consider different variations when constructing this measure. First, citations received
     clearly suffer from a truncation problem – the fact that later patents have less time to get
     cited. To reduce this problem, we also consider a 5-year citations measure – the number of
     citations received by patent within 5 years from its application date. Second, our data allows
     us to see whether citations reported in a patent application originate from the applicant, were
     introduced during the prior art search at the time of application, or were introduced by an
     examiner. In the data, about one third of all citations made originate from the applicants
     themselves. Since this may be a closer proxy for the impact of a patent, we also consider a
     citations measure that just counts citations made by applicants. In all these cases, we construct
     family-to-family citations and we also count citations originating not only from the Italian, but
     all EPO patents.

   Online Appendix Table 1 presents the correlation matrix for different quality measures defined
at the patent level. Though all measures are positively correlated, in many cases, the correlation
is not very strong, indicating that these measures entail information on different aspects of patent
quality. We show summary statistics of those measures in Online Appendix Table A.2.

B.3.1   Dataset #4: Registry of Local Politicians (RLP)

The following are the steps undertaken to clean and make use of RLP data.
    Step 1. First, to link individual politicians to SS data on private-sector employees, we need to
assign fiscal codes (similar to social security numbers in the U.S.) to politicians. In Italy, the as-
signment of a fiscal code follows a specific rule that deterministically assigns a fiscal code using an
individual’s demographic information – name, surname, date of birth, place of birth, and gender.
We develop an algorithm following this rule, and use a detailed demographic information from RLP
to assign fiscal codes to each politician.



                                                            50
                  Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


    Step 2. We determine which parties are the majority or minority based on political affiliations of
politicians in RLP. The data provides either the party or coalition to which a politician is affiliated.
For example, a typical example of an observation would be an entry "A | B" meaning that politician
belongs to a list/coalition consisting of two parties A and B, which together participate in an election
in that area. To define majorities, we first clean individual party names and then define major parties
at local level.

    • Cleaning party names:
       Cleaning political party/coalition names in the data turned out to be a tedious task. The first
       challenge is misspellings and abbreviations of party names. The second is that political parties
       sometimes change their names, merge, split, form coalitions, etc. We tackle these issues by
       developing a name cleaning algorithm, based on information from extensive online searches
       and manual checks.
       More specifically, in the example above with the "A | B" entry, we parse this entry into two
       separate party names, "A" and "B", clean each of those names separately, and then combine
       those names again. To clean names, we first compile a list of full names and abbreviations of
       parties/coalitions at all levels – municipality, province, regional or national – from Wikipedia
       articles. This represents a basic dictionary that helps to spot multiple forms of the same
       party/coalition name in the data. Next, we develop a name cleaning algorithm, where we
       standardize commonly used words and special characters, correct for word misspellings and
       shortcuts. Using this name standardization and dictionary-based approach gets us a long way
       in cleaning the data. Furthermore, we iteratively improve the algorithm by manually verifying
       and updating special cases.

    • Defining majority parties/coalitions in RLP: Next, we define parties/coalitions that represent ma-
       jorities at the regional/provincial/municipal level in a given year. We start by defining two
       variants of majority party variable at the location-year level. The first definition uses the polit-
       ical affiliation of a president/mayor. Second definition uses most frequent political affiliation
       of all politicians found in RLP.41
       Specifically, we define following variables at j-location and t-year level:
       Main party ( RLP) jt - party (coalition) of a regional president/provincial president/mayor in
       year t in a j region/province/municipality, respectively.42
       #1 Party ( RLP) jt - most frequent party (coalition) affiliation of politicians in a region/province/
       municipality.
       Since the winning candidate is generally also assured the majority of seats, the first and sec-
       ond definitions should be equivalent. However, there is one main reason for why, in many
  41 For   the benchmark definition, we prefer defining majority using sample of councilmen only. In effect, presi-
dent’s/mayor’s elections determine party composition in the councils. Hence, to determine a majority – party that
has the largest representation, one needs to look at party affiliations of council members. Indeed, councilmen represent
majority of politicians in RLP and about 15% of politicians in RLP are not elected.
  42 If affiliation is missing (in less than 3% of cases), we use an affiliation of council president. If those are still missing,

we use affiliation of a vice-president/vice-mayor or a council vice-president.



                                                               51
                  Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


        cases, those definitions provide different information in RLP. Consider this example: suppose,
        a winning candidate belongs to a party "B" and is supported by a coalition consisting of parties
        "A", "B", and "C". In such a case, RLP could report the candidate’s party affiliation as either
        "A | B | C", "B", or "Z", where "Z" is some name of a coalition.43 Often, the third variant ap-
        pears. Similarly, other politicians may have an affiliation reported in one of those ways (often,
        the second variant appears for an ordinary council member). Hence, we combine informa-
        tion from both variables – an affiliation reported by a president/mayor (Main party ( RLP) jt )
        and most frequent affiliation reported by all politicians (#1 Party ( RLP) jt ) to define the ma-
        jority party/coalition in the most accurate fashion. Importantly, we will complement these
        definitions with further information from the Elections data, which we discuss below.
        Using this data on majority parties, we can define whether individual belongs to the majority
        or the minority. We postpone further discussion after we describe the Elections data below.

    Step 3. We define the following variables using political position attributes in RLP.
    Regional Rank it – a categorical variable for whether a politician i is a regional, provincial, or
municipal politician at time t. In a few cases, when a politician has multiple observations in RLP at
different position levels within a year, we keep the observation with the highest position level held
in that year.
    Hierarchical Rank it – a categorical variable for the position level (within a Regional Rank it ) of a
politician i at time t. In the first category, we group together the key positions of a municipality’s
mayor or vice mayor; provincial/regional president or a vice/president; as well as the important
positions of president/vice-president of the local councils. The second category includes so called
“assessore” that represent town councilors – executive position holders similar to local ministers.
The third category is for regular council members.44


B.3.2    Dataset #5: Elections Data

Our newly constructed, detailed dataset on local elections at the regional, provincial, and municipal
levels serves two purposes. First, using information on vote shares in the election, we identify
marginally contested elections. The details are described were Section 6.1. Second, we use this data
to construct another variable on majority parties at the local level, and combine it with the RLP
definitions of majority parties (Main party ( RLP) jt and #1 Party ( RLP) jt explained above). This
gives us confidence in the accuracy of our definition of local majorities as it taps the information
from multiple sources.

    • Defining majority parties/coalitions in the Elections data: For each election, we define a coalition
        as a set of parties supporting the same candidate (it may be just one party or multiple). Then,
        we define a coalition that gets most seats and define a coalition that supports a winning can-
        didate (mayor or president). Because of the existence of a majority premium for the winning
  43 Often, for example, coalition may be listed as "Centro Destra" (center-right), or "Lista Civica" (civil list), or using other

official name of a coalition, like "Polo per le Liberta" instead of listing its members "Forza Italia", "Alleanza Nazionale" or
others.
  44 Data also includes other positions of “questore/commissario” – a super-intendent or commissioner. But these are

temporary positions that appear on rare occasions, hence we do not report statistics on them.


                                                               52
                Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


        candidate, these two definitions should be equivalent. Indeed, these definitions are the same
        in all instances except for the rare cases, which account for well under 1% of observations.
        Hence, we define a variable:
        Main party ( Elections) jt - the party or coalition that gets the most seats in an election in re-
        gion/province/ municipality j at time t. It is equivalent to a party/coalition of a winning
        regional president/province president/municipality mayor in j at time t.



B.3.3    Combining Dataset #4 and Dataset #5 and Defining Individual Majority Affiliation

Next we describe construction of Majority A f f iliation for each politician from RLP. For that, we
combine information on local majority parties/coalitions derived from RLP – Main party ( RLP) jt
and #1 Party ( RLP) jt , and from the Elections data – Main party ( Elections) jt .45 There are two
challenges when defining majority affiliation for individual politicians.
    The first challenge has been already mentioned in Online Appendix B.3.1. Since, for any politi-
cian, RLP may report an affiliation with just one party (in our previous example, “B"), or a coalition
(“A | B | C"), or a coalition name “Z", there may be some noise in defining majorities just based on
this data. In those cases, when, for example, mayor reports “Z", we would not be able to classify
politicians reporting “A", “B" or “C" as belonging to mayor’s coalition. Hence, it is very useful to
complement this data with information from the Elections data. The main advantage of the Elec-
tions data is that we observe all party names (“A", “B", and “C" separately) that form a coalition, and
we also often observe an official coalition name (“Z"), if this exists. Hence, when defining majority
affiliation at the individual level, we compare individual affiliation with both majority definitions
from RLP and majority definition from the Elections data. This gives us confidence that majority af-
filiations can be defined as cleanly as possible. Extensive manual checks confirm that this definition
significantly improves upon the definition based on RLP only.
    The second challenge concerns politicians at the municipal level: in small municipalities, many
politicians are affiliated with local political lists/coalitions – so called, civil lists, “lista civica", that
may unite various party members. As an example, in an election held in the municipality of Cecima,
there were two coalitions “Lista Civica con Voi per Voi" and “Lista Civica per Cecima". However,
in RLP, both of them were reported as “Lista Civica" for short. If then both of those lists got at
least one seat after the election, it would not be possible to understand whether the “Lista Civica"
affiliation reported for a politician in RLP that of the winning list or not. We call such cases (elections
that have multiple “Lista Civica" coalitions that got at least one seat in the council) elections with
ambiguous “Lista Civica" names. Such cases are quite prevalent and represent half of all elections at
the municipal level. In these ambiguous cases, if a winning party is “Lista Civica" and a politician
reports “Lista Civica", we treat individual majority affiliation as missing. This results in more than
600 thousand missing values from up to 3 million individual-level observations at the municipal
level. For some of those missing cases, however, we can be certain that individuals belong to local
majorities. This happens for individuals holding key positions (the highest Hierarchical rank). This
  45 Notice that the Elections data is an unbalanced panel data with time gaps in between of elections. We impute most
recent election outcomes (up to 4 years) to fill in those time gaps.


                                                         53
                Political Connections, Innovation, and Firm Dynamics: Appendix


decreases the number of missing observations in the Majority affiliation.


B.4     The Matched Firm-level Data (Combining Dataset #1 – Dataset #5)

B.4.1   Matching INPS with Politicians Data (Combining Dataset #1 with Datasets #4 and #5)

We merge Politicians Data with INPS worker records using individual fiscal codes over time. This
allows us to identify those local politicians that are employed in private firms, while also holding
political office. Online Appendix Table A.3 shows summary statistics for the matched politician-
workers sample (in the years when they are both employed in a firm and work as politicians). We
see that, among all local politicians, about one third (162,417) have ever taken a private job while
also in office. Clearly, the overwhelming majority of connections are through politicians at the mu-
nicipal level. This is both because majority of politicians are municipality politicians and because,
proportionally, municipality-level politicians work in private sector more than other politicians. It
is also interesting to look at their education levels (this is a self-reported education level from RLP).
Relative to the full sample of politicians, worker-politicians, on average, have slightly lower edu-
cation levels (relatively more high-school graduates than university graduates, when compared to
the whole sample). The share of politicians with majority affiliation is just slightly higher among
worker-politicians. In addition, by comparing with other private-sector workers, politicians are em-
ployed disproportionally more on white-collar jobs or managerial positions and have significantly
higher wages.


B.4.2   Matching INPS with the Firm Financials and Patent Data (Combining Dataset #1 with
        Datasets #2 and #3)

We match firm-level data from INPS with Cerved using firms’ fiscal codes. Many firm observations
in INPS data do not match to Cerved, as can be seen from Table 4 – these are mainly small or short-
lived firms not filing balance sheet information, sole-proprietorships, or household producers. On
the other hand, for about 16% of observations from Cerved, firm fiscal codes were not possible to
match to INPS. This means those firms did not make any INPS social security contributions for their
workers – they might be employing only contractors or workers in agriculture. Finally, we merge
this data with firms’ patenting information from Dataset #3. Only about 4% of patents did not get
matched with INPS firms. In the data, over 12 thousand firms filed a patent at least once.

B.5    Industry-Level Bureaucracy and Government Dependence Indices
Bureaucracy Index and Political Connections
    We build on Pellegrino and Zingales (2014) and develop our own industry-level “bureaucracy
index” that measures the level of regulatory or bureaucratic burden, based on newspaper articles
from Factiva – an online search engine that searches newspaper articles.
    We look at newspaper articles from four large news providers and count the number of articles
that contain keywords that proxy for government intervention or bureaucracy level that sectors are
facing.46 Factiva groups newspaper articles into 58 sectors that roughly correspond to 2-digit NACE
Rev 2 industry classification. We focus on articles starting from 1991 and experiment with alter-
native lists of keywords. List 1 consists of “regulation*”, “regulated”, “regulator*”, “bureaucracy”,
“bureaucratic”, “deregulation*”, “deregulated”, “paperwork*”, “red tape”, “license*” and plural
forms of these words. List 2 adds additional words: “authority”, “authorities”, “liberaliz*”, “re-
form*”, “Agency”, “Agencies”, “Commission”, “Commissions”, “policy maker*”, “policymaker*”,
“government”, “official form*”, “official procedure*.” The * character denotes that variations of
these words were also included. We calculate the Bureaucracy Index 1 (2) of sector i as:

                                                              [All articles related to i] ∩ [All articles with keywords from List 1(2)]
Bureaucracy Index 1(2)i =                                                                                                               .
                                                                                         All articles related to i
                                                                                                                                    (15)
    This measure is simply the share of newspaper articles in a sector that have certain keywords that
are related to bureaucracy/regulation. Figure A.2 shows a strong and positive relationship between
industry’s Bureaucracy Indices and the share of firms that are politically connected.47 Table A.4
reports Bureaucracy Indices and connection intensities for all sectors available in Factiva.48

Notes: The binscatter plots with linear fits of the share of firms connected with politicians against the Bureaucracy Index
for all sectors available in Factiva News search. Sector-level Bureaucracy Index is defined in equation 15 and is the share
of newspaper articles in a sector that have certain keywords related to bureaucracy or regulation. Panel (a) uses the
benchmark Bureaucracy Index from the main text, while panel (b) uses Bureaucracy Index 2.

  46 These  news providers are Bloomberg, Dow Jones Adviser, Financial Times, and The Wall Street Journal. Using
international newspapers alleviates concerns of endogeneity and reverse causality, as opposed to looking at Italian news.
  47 For this exercise, we aggregate industry classification from INPS (ATECO 2007) to the 58 sectors reported in Factiva.
  48 These correlations are stronger if consider majority-level or high-rank connections instead.

Notes: Table reports measures of connections and the bureaucracy indices across industries. Industry codes are based on classifications
from the Factiva News search and the codes correspond to NACE Rev 2 classification. Column 3 reports the average share of connected
firms in an industry. Column 4 reports the average share of high-rank connected firms in an industry. Columns 5 and 6 report
Bureaucracy Index 1 and Index 2, respectively. The indices show the average share of newspaper articles about a sector from Factiva
News search that mention government regulation- or bureaucracy-related words. Industry-level Bureaucracy Index 1 is our benchmark
index defined in Section 3, while Bureaucracy Index 2 is defined in Section C.

Government Dependence Index and Political Connections
    We define industry-level indices of government dependence to proxy for the importance of
government demand and procurement contracts for the firms. For this purpose, we use a 2-digit
input-output table issued by the Italian National Statistical Institute (Istat) in 2010. Denote by Yj
total output of an industry j. Then Yj = Fj + Ij , where Fj denotes industry’s output used as final
consumption, while Ij denotes industry’s output used as an intermediate input. Our Government
Dependence Indices then measure the share of industry’s output – by type of use – demanded by
the public sector, i.e. public administration, education, health, and waste management services.
Specifically,


                                                                                FjP                                                                               IjP
       Government Dependence Index 1 =                                                                  Government Dependence Index 2 =                                 ,        (16)
                                                                                Fj                                                                                Ij

where superscript P denotes output demanded by the public sector. Government Dependence Index 2
is similar to the index defined in Cingano and Pinotti (2013). Figure A.3 shows that none of these
measures of government dependence correlate with the share of firms that are politically connected.
These correlations are essentially zero also if we look at majority-level or high-rank connections
instead.

Notes: The binscatter plots with linear fits of the share of firms connected with politicians against the Government De-
pendence Index for all 2-digit sectors from Istat. Industry-level Government Dependence Indices are defined in equation
16 and are based on input-output tables from Istat in 2010. Correspondingly, an industry’s share of connected firms is
calculated as an average for 2009-2011 period. Panel (a) uses Index 1 for the final-use output, while panel (b) uses Index
2 for the intermediate-use output.

Notes: Figure plots politician intensity and innovation intensity over a firm’s market rank for top 20 firms in the markets. Market is
defined at (6-digit) industry × region × year level. Markets in which top 1 firm holds less than 10% share are excluded. Politician
intensity (blue triangles) is the number of majority-member politicians employed in a firm normalized by 100 white-collar employees.
Innovation intensity (red squares) is intangible assets over value added. Both outcome variables are adjusted for industry, region, and
year fixed effects. The blue and red lines depict regression lines from regressing politician intensity and innovation intensity, respectively,
on market rank controlling for industry, region, and year fixed effects.

Notes: Firm-level OLS regressions of political connection and innovation intensity over firm’s market rank. Market is defined at (6-digit)
industry × region × year level. Rank n is a dummy equal to one if a firm is ranked n’th in the market in that year based on its
employment level. Omitted group pools firms that are ranked 6 and above. Dependent variables: column 1 – Politicians intensity is the
number of politicians employed over 100 white-collar workers; columns 2 – Majority politicians intensity is the number of majority-party
politicians employed over 100 white-collar workers; columns 3 – Intangibles intensity is intangibles over firm value added; columns 4
– Patents intensity is the number of patents (conditional on patenting) over 100 white-collar workers. All regressions control for year,
region, and year dummies. ∗ p < 0.1,∗∗ p < 0.05,∗∗∗ p < 0.01. Similar to Figures 5 and B.1, this table shows that the largest market leaders
are more politician intensive but less innovation intensive. In addition, age has a strong effect for both connections and innovation
intensities.

Notes: Figure repeats main plots from Figures 5 and B.1 but with an alternative definition of market rank based on firms’ value
added. Market is defined at (6-digit) industry × region × year level. Markets in which the top 1 firm holds less than 10% share are
dropped. In Panel (a), politician intensity (blue triangles) is the number of politicians employed in a firm normalized by 100 white-collar
employees. Innovation intensity (red squares) is the number of patent applications in a year normalized by 100 white-collar employees
(conditional on patenting). In Panel (b), politician intensity (blue triangles) is the number of majority-member politicians employed in
a firm normalized by 100 white-collar employees. Innovation intensity (red squares) is intangible assets over value added. All outcome
variables are adjusted for industry, region, and year fixed effects. The blue and red lines depict regression lines from regressing politician
intensity and innovation intensity, respectively, on market rank controlling for industry, region, and year fixed effects. Market leaders
are less innovation-intensive and more politician-intensive relative to their competitors.

Notes: Figure plots average outcome variable over firm’s market rank for top 20 firms in the markets. Market is defined at (6-digit)
industry × region × year level. Market rank is defined by a firm’s employment level. Markets in which top 1 firm holds less than 10%
share are dropped. Outcome variables are demeaned with industry, year, and region fixed effects. The red line depicts a regression
line from regressing firm’s outcome on market rank, controlling for industry, region, and year fixed effects. In Panel (a) the outcome is
5-year citations-adjusted patent counts per 100 white-collar workers; Panel (b) considers patent family size-adjusted patent counts per
100 white-collar workers. Market leaders produce lower quality-adjusted innovation, when compared to their competitors.

Notes: Table summarizes a positive association of firm-level political connections with the next-period growth in size
(Panel A) and a negative association of connections with the next-period growth in productivity of a firm (Panel B).
Dependent variables for the growth in size in Panel A are employment, value added, profits, and white-collar employment
growth. Dependent variables for the growth in productivity in Panel B are labor productivity, TFP, share of intangibles
(intangibles over value added), and patents growth. Since patenting is a slow-moving process, we look at the average
(annualized) 3-year patent growth of firms.

Notes: The map displays the number of municipal and province-level marginal elections, decided within a 2% victory
margin. Each circle depicts the location of the main city in a province, and number of total marginal elections in 1993-
2014 in a corresponding province in that circle. Victory margin is defined as the difference between share of votes of the
winning candidate and the share of votes of the closest competitor.

Notes: Figure plots a firm’s growth from T to T + 1 against margin of victory at time T for the sample of elections within a 5% margin
of victory. Positive margins of victory denote firms that have been connected at time T − 1 with a politician from a party that won an
election at time T with the corresponding margin of victory. Likewise, negative margins of victory depict firms that are connected with
losing politicians. For visibility, we divide the x-axis into 0.01-wide intervals of the margin of victory at time T and each point denotes
the average outcome for firms in that interval. The solid lines represent predicted third order polynomial fits from a regression that
includes third order polynomial in the margin of victory, a dummy WiniT −1 , and an interaction of the dummy with the polynomial (a
regression in equation 11 that excludes additional controls). The dashed lines represent 90% confidence intervals. Outcome variable in
Panel (a) is employment growth, while in Panel (b) is labor productivity growth. Figures are normalized such that outcome variables for
marginal losers at the threshold are equal to zero.

Notes: Table shows politicians’ within-firm wage premium, by type of job and gender. Premium in each cell is defined
as the weekly wage paid to politicians, divided by the average weekly wage paid to non-politicians within the same firm,
conditional on the same type of job and gender. Four different panels present wage premiums calculated for politicians at
the municipal level, provincial level, regional level, and high-rank politicians, respectively. Cells are empty if the number
of observations in that cell is less than 100.
