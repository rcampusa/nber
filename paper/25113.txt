Cross-sectional Skewness

                                         ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates skewness in the cross-section of stock returns in light of predictions from a
well-known class of models. Cross-sectional skewness in monthly returns far exceeds what the
standard lognormal model of returns would predict. However, skewness in long-run returns
substantially understates what the lognormal model would predict. Nonstationary share dynamics
imply a breakdown in the distinction between market and idiosyncratic risk in the lognormal
model. We present an alternative model that matches the skewness in the data and implies
stationary wealth shares. In this model, idiosyncratic risk is the primary driver of growth in the
economy.

1        Introduction
Underlying the cross-section of stock returns is a universe of heterogeneous entities com-
monly referred to as firms. What is the most useful approach to modeling these firms?
For the aggregate market, there is a wide consensus concerning the form a model needs
to take to be a plausible account of the data. While there are important differences,
quantitatively successful models tend to feature a stochastic discount factor with station-
ary growth rates and permanent shocks, combined with aggregate cash flows that, too,
have stationary growth rates and permanent shocks.1 No such consensus exists for the
cross-section.
    In this paper we argue that two types of cross-sectional skewness are important for
addressing the question of how to model the cross-section. These are the skewness in
short-term returns and the skewness in long-term returns. We argue that it is useful to
consider both types of skewness together, since explanations for one type of skewness
potentially lead to problems for the other type.
    We start with a simple model for stock returns to illustrate the puzzle. Because
the literature has focused on the lognormal distribution, we assume asset returns have a
common lognormal shock and an idiosyncratic shock. This model is consistent with an
equilibrium where agents have constant relative risk aversion and dividends also feature
a common and idiosyncratic shock.
    We calibrate this model to the CRSP universe on stock returns. Despite the fact that
the lognormal model implies return skewness, we find that the degree of skewness implied
by the model is far less than monthly cross-sectional skewness in the data. On the other
hand, there is a sense in which the model predicts too much skewness. While long-term
growth in market capitalizations and cumulative returns is highly skewed in the data, we
show that it is even more skewed in the model. The model implies that, relatively quickly,
one firm takes over the entire economy. This causes a problem for definitions of market
risk and idiosyncratic risks. We show that this result is robust to idiosyncratic risk that

                                                    1
decreases in market size, and firm payout that policies that change based on the life cycle,
both features that are present in the data.
      We then present an alternative model based on the binomial distribution, and on
shocks that are additive for individual firms but growing with the economy. In con-
trast to the lognormal model, the binomial model implies stationary dividend shares and
substantial cross-sectional skewness. It also implies decreasing standard deviation as a
function of size, and increasing payout through the life cycle. We show that this model
also implies a role for idiosyncratic risk in the aggregate economy.
      Our paper relates to recent work by Bessembinder (2017), who shows that most stocks
underperform Treasury bills most of the time, thereby highlighting the importance of
skewness in the data. He also notes the high degree of skewness in market capitalizations.
Perhaps surprisingly, we show that the underperformance of most stocks in the data does
not pose a challenge to the lognormal model, while monthly and long-horizon skewness
do.
      Our work also relates to the research on power laws and firm values (Axtell, 2001;
Gabaix, 2009) in that the same mechanism that generates the power law (independent,
permanent shocks to growth rates) lies behind our results on long-run returns. Like
Gabaix (2011), who focuses on GDP, we show how idiosyncratic volatility can play a role
in aggregate outcomes through a failure of diversification.
      Since Fama (1965) established that stock returns did not approximate a normal dis-
tribution, the literature has examined the empirical linkages between this skewness and
expected returns. The initial focus was on co-skewness (Harvey and Siddique, 2000;
Dittmar, 2002), while more recent papers examine idiosyncratic skewness as well (Bali
et al., 2011; Boyer et al., 2010; Kapadia, 2006). Others work measures ex ante skewness
through options (Chang et al., 2013; Conrad et al., 2013). The focus of these papers is
on the measurement of conditional skewness for a particular stock at a given point in
time. This is a difficult measurement problem. In this paper, by contrast, we focus on the
degree of unconditional skewness relative to various benchmark hypotheses on the return



                                              2
data generating process.2 We find that it is very large.
    Indeed, while most of the literature has focused on the cross-section of expected re-
turns with the goal of establishing a correct pricing model, we focus on the measurement
of cross-sectional skewness for its own sake. Cross-sectional skewness has received little
attention, perhaps due to the view that it is not relevant in diversified portfolios because
of the central limit theorem; that is, a portfolio of sufficiently many assets is close to
normally distributed, and idiosyncratic risk does not matter. Our results indicate, how-
ever, that this reasonable intuition is model-dependent. There is no ex ante reason to
dismiss skewness as irrelevant in a diversified portfolio. Correctly characterizing the dis-
tribution of returns, therefore, is important for portfolio decisions; it is also important
for the reliability of statistics such as the mean and standard deviation, particularly the
conditional mean and standard deviation. Finally, if one wants to simultaneously under-
stand the cross-section of stock returns as well as the aggregate market, it is necessary to
model both simultaneously. In this regard, one must think about how the cross-section
aggregates, and here, the distributional assumptions on the cross-section are of first-order
importance.
    The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the benchmark lognormal for asset
returns. Section 3 takes this model to the data on return skewness. Section 3.6 discusses
the mechanism in the model that leads to failure for long-horizon returns, and tests
various potential fixes. Section 5 builds an alternative model that matches cross-sectional
skewness, and nonetheless possesses stationary firm dynamics. We discuss a connection
between aggregate growth and idiosyncratic risk. Section 6 concludes.
   2
     An underlying assumption in this literature, based on early work of Kraus and Litzenberger (1976),
is that non-increasing absolute risk aversion implies that positive co-skewness is negatively priced and
that positive idiosyncratic skewness has a price of zero. However, a lognormal distribution features both
types of skewness and admits a CAPM-type result with constant relative risk aversion. Thus the choice
of benchmark is important.

2       The standard lognormal model
Recent research in finance provides numerous models for stock returns. Most of these
models, however, take a similar form. Stock returns are subject to a common shock and
an idiosyncratic shock. In many models, stock returns are an equilibrium outcome of an
economy populated by investors who receive an endowment or who make an investment
decision subject to a technology.
    Assume there are N firms indexed by j.3 Specifically, let Rj,t+1 denote the gross
return on firm j between time t and t + 1. We assume a one-factor statistical model for
log returns:
                                 log Rjt = αj + βj log RM t + jt ,                               (1)

where jt are mean zero and iid across time, where jt and kt are independent for j 6= k,
and where jt is independent of RM t . We also assume a one-period riskfree asset with
constant (gross) return Rf . We use the notation RM t to denote the common factor
without, for now, taking a stance on whether this denotes the true market return. While
our main results do not depend on specific distributional assumptions, we assume that
jt are normally distributed for all j and t, and that log RM t is also normally distributed.
                                                                           2
                                                                             
That is, for each j = 1, . . . , N , and for all t, we assume jt ∼ N 0, σj   . We assume, for
all t, log RM t ∼ N µM − 12 σM   2    2
                                        
                                   , σM   , so that µM = log E[RM t ]. Under these assumptions
(1) is the discrete-time equivalent of a geometric Brownian motion for the stock price.
We assume a one-factor model for convenience, but our results do not depend on this
assumption.
    To illustrate how this structure can arise, we consider an iid lognormal model. Assume
a complete-markets endowment economy with a representative agent with utility

     We use the terminology firm and stock interchangeably to mean the entity with returns (1). In the
data, we identify firms with CRSP PERMNOs.

The parameter δ > 0 represents the time discount factor and γ > 0 the coefficient of
relative risk aversion. We consider assets whose dividends are characterized by:
                                                                     

and dkt are independent for j 6= k.4 We use the superscript d to denote dividend-related
parameters and shocks to distinguish them from return-related parameters and shocks.5
    Appendix A shows that (1) holds with RM t being the return on the aggregate consump-
tion claim. Because the aggregate consumption claim, is, by definition, total wealth, this
justifies our use of the M subscript. Moreover, as we show in Appendix A, a capital-asset
pricing model holds. We summarize these results in Theorem 1.

Theorem 1. Assuming (2) characterizes utility, (3) characterizes consumption, and (4)
characterizes dividends, returns satisfy (1) with


                                   log E[Rjt /Rf ] = βj log E[RM t /Rf ]                          (5)

                                                                   2
                                              log E[RM t /Rf ] = γσM ,                            (6)

where Rf is the equilibrium return on the riskfree asset, and where βj = βjd . Moreover,
jt = djt .
    4
      This is a “multiple-trees” model similar to that considered by Cochrane et al. (2008) and Martin
(2013).
    5
      Recent work focuses on the separation between risk aversion and the inverse of the elasticity of
intertemporal substitution (Epstein and Zin, 1989). However, in this iid model, it is well-known that
allowing for this separation nonetheless is observationally equivalent to the form (2), with γ as risk
aversion.


                                                         5
    The model approximates the CAPM of Sharpe (1964). It is also a special case of
the Consumption CAPM of Breeden (1979) and the ICAPM of Merton (1973) when
investment opportunities are constant.6 While this model has been generalized in various
ways, these generalizations mainly pertain to the form of the utility function (2) or the
distribution of the aggregate endowment.7 These generalizations are unlikely to make a
difference in cross-sectional skewness of firms, which is our focus.
    The results above sharpen predictions of previous work on skewness. Since the pi-
oneering work of Kraus and Litzenberger (1976), studies have linked a preference for
skewness, and thus deviations from the CAPM, to the condition of non-increasing abso-
lute risk aversion. Here, we assume utility with constant relative risk aversion, implying
strictly decreasing absolute risk aversion. Asset returns feature both co-skewness and id-
iosyncratic skewness through the lognormal distribution. However, (5) implies the CAPM
holds. How can this be? It turns out that a preference for skewness, and lognormal re-
turns interact precisely to as deliver the CAPM (5), which is of course not exactly the
same as the mean-variance CAPM of Sharpe (1964). In this study, we evaluate skewness
relative to the lognormal benchmark as opposed to the normal benchmark. Lognormality
is arguably a more plausible null hypothesis than normality.
    While simple, this model captures some important features of asset price data. First,
gross returns always are positive, as they must be because of limited liability (this would
not be true if we assumed, for example, a normal distribution). Second, stock returns are
unpredictable. This assumption has been extensively evaluated in the data, and there
does appear to be statistically significant predictability. However, for our purposes what
is important is that most return variance arises from unpredictable changes in prices,
as one would expect in an environment with utility maximizing agents.8 Third, stocks
returns have heterogeneous volatilities and are subject to idiosyncratic risks. Fourth, the
    6
      Campbell (2008) notes that (5) holds provided that returns are lognormal. The above result justifies
the assumption of lognormality.
    7
      For example, it is will known that this model cannot explain the equity premium puzzle (Mehra and
Prescott, 1985) or the volatility puzzle (Shiller, 1981; Campbell and Shiller, 1988).
    8
      See recent work by Cochrane (2008) and Welch and Goyal (2008) and the survey by Campbell (2008).
Wachter and Warusawitharana (2015) discuss economically motivated priors on predictability.


                                                    6
distribution of stock returns is stationary. Consistent with this assumption, risk premia
and interest rates appear stationary in the data in spite of exponential growth in wealth
over the last century and longer (Shiller, 1989; Golez and Koudijs, 2017) and are also
similar internationally (Campbell, 2018, Chapter 6). Finally, the model is micro-founded
in a model with utility maximizing agents where consumption and dividends are also
consistent with important data features (i.e. dividends and consumption are positive,
growing over time, with rates of change that are largely unpredictable).9



3       Empirical results

3.1     Data

The data consists of monthly returns on ordinary common shares of stocks traded on all
major exchanges, available on CRSP, from July 1926 to December 2016. Unless stated
otherwise, we use holding period returns (i.e. with invested dividends). When computing
multi-period returns, we follow entities using PERMNO. We use one-month Treasury bill
returns from Kenneth French’s website. We also consider two subsets when calibrating
our simulations.
    The first subset consists of all firms with at least 60 months of returns. We choose this
cutoff because it allows for plausible estimation of the parameters. This yields a universe
of 16,087 firms. We also consider a much smaller subset of the firms continuously in
existence between January 1973 and December 2016. For the second subset, we restrict
our universe to stocks without missing data for monthly returns. This gives us 404 firms.
This set of stocks is clearly subject to survivor bias. However, it has the advantage that
we can directly compare data to our simulated firms without the need to consider entry
and exit.
    Table 1 reports return moments for all CRSP stocks, for the subset of stocks for which
    9
     Like the predictability of stock returns, the predictability of consumption growth, and, more to our
point, dividend growth, has been extensively evaluated (van Binsbergen and Koijen, 2010). In Section 3.6
we discuss how introducing predictability in dividend growth affects our results.


                                                   7
we have more than 5 years of data, and for the stocks with continuous returns between
1973 and 2016. The mean of monthly net returns is 1.1% across all stocks. It is slightly
higher–1.3%–across the stocks with more than 5 years of data. For both sets of stocks,
the median is indistinguishable from zero. The standard deviation of returns for both sets
is 17% per month. Both are quite positively skewed, with a skewness coefficient of about
6.
     Overall, the stocks with more than 5 years of data have similar cross-sectional moments
compared with the full universe. The stocks in continuous existence, interestingly, have a
similar mean return. However, their median return is higher: it is 1% whereas the median
return is indistinguishable from zero for the wider population. The standard deviation is
10% versus 17% for the wider population, and the skewness is 1.3 versus 5.8.
     In recent work, Bessembinder (2017) notes that on average, individual stocks do not
outperform Treasury bills. Because this finding has a connection to skewness, as Bessem-
binder discusses and as we elaborate on below, we follow his study and report the percent
of stock returns exceeding the one-month Treasury bill return. Confirming his results, we
find that only 48% of stock returns exceed the Treasury bill return of that month.


3.2     Simulation strategy

We now ask how likely these and other features of the data are to occur in the econ-
omy described in Section 2. To do this, we create fictitious samples using Monte Carlo
simulation.
     An immediate question arises: how many stocks do we consider, and how do we handle
the fact that stocks move in and out of the sample? These questions make clear the benefit
of our small sample of 404 companies in continuous existence. In the case of this sample,
we can calibrate our firms to these companies. However, this approach has the problem of
survivorship bias. The distribution of means and standard deviations, for example, may
not represent the true ex-ante distribution facing investors.
     Figure 1 illustrates one challenge in modeling the cross-section of individual stocks.


                                              8
This figure shows how the number of CRSP stocks has fluctuated over time. The number
of stocks, below 1000 prior to 1950, reached a peak of about 8000 in the late 1990s,
and has since declined to around 4000. There is a jump in the number in January 1973
corresponding to the establishment of the NASDAQ.
   To roughly capture the number of firms trading in the stock market, we set the number
of firms in our simulation equal to the median value in Figure 1, which is 2,440. We then
estimate firm-level parameters as described in the next section. Clearly, there are many
more firms in the estimation than there are stocks in the simulation (16,087 versus 2,440).
We thus use the following bootstrap procedure. At the start of each fictitious sample,
we draw 2,440 stocks from the universe of 16,087 without replacement. To reflect the
fact that some firm-level parameters are statistically unlikely—the firms to which they
belong are only present on the exchanges for a small period of time— we assign different
probability weights to different firms. That is, if Nj is the number of months that firm
                                                                                    Nj
j is listed, we draw from the estimated parameters of firm j with probability    P16,087
                                                                                           Nj
                                                                                                .
                                                                                   i=1

Thus, across fictitious samples, we should roughly capture the true distribution of firms
in the cross section.
   Given a set of firm-level parameters, we simulate fictitious samples assuming returns
are distributed as in Section 2. We consider samples of two different lengths to represent
the sample with 16,087 firms from January 1973 to December 2016 and the sample with
404 firms from July 1926 to December 2016. For each type of simulation, we consider 400
such fictitious samples.
   For each sample, we draw random normal shocks M t . We then draw Nfirm sequences
of iid idiosyncratic shocks jt . Stock j’s time-t return is then

                                         1
                           log Rjt = µj − σj2 + βj σM M t + σj, jt .                    (7)
                                         2

Below, we describe the parameter estimation. We set the riskfree rate to a constant in
the simulations and equal to the average rate on the 1-month Treasury bill.



                                                9
3.3    Estimation

We estimate the firm-level parameters using CRSP data. We take the sample mean
return on the value weighted portfolio to estimate eµM = E[RM t ] and the variance of the
                        2
log return to estimate σM = Var(log RM t ).
   For each stock j, we estimate βj from the OLS regression (1). That is, we estimate
βj using log returns. While most studies use level returns, running the regression in log
returns is what the theory suggests. Given βj and µM , we compute the expected log
return on stock j as
                                µj = (1 − βj ) log Rf + βj µM .                         (8)

             2
We estimate σj, as the variance of the residuals in (1). Then if σj2 is the variance of the
total return of log Rjt , it must be that


                                      σj2 = σj,
                                             2
                                                 + βj2 σM
                                                        2
                                                          ,

                            2        2
thus the estimates of βj , σM , and σ,i provide a sample estimate of σj2 . Standard OLS
regression results tell us that this is the same estimate we would obtain if we estimated
the sample standard deviation of log returns directly. This completes the set of parameter
values we need to simulate from the model.
   As a robustness check, we directly estimate µj using the sample average. Namely,

                                                     1
                                   µj = E [log Rj ] + σj2 ,                             (9)
                                                     2

where we compute E [log Rj ] using the sample average of log returns and σj2 as the sample
variance of log returns.


3.4    Pooled monthly returns

In this section, we compare characteristics of monthly returns in the model and in the data.
In each fictitious sample path, we compute the mean, the variance, and other statistics.


                                               10
Thus for each statistic we have a sampling distribution consisting of 400 “observations.”
We report the median value, the 5th and 95th percentile values, and the minimum and
maximum across all 400 simulations. We also report population statistics computed from
pooling the entire set of simulations.
   Table 2 reports the results from the simulations. Panel A and C rely on the CAPM for
estimation, while Panels B and D use direct estimation of mean returns. Direct estimation
successfully replicates the mean return, while relying on the CAPM appears to somewhat
understate the mean return. Both methods, and both types of simulations, replicate the
standard deviation of returns almost exactly. Thus the model can successfully capture
the first two moments of returns, perhaps not surprisingly.
   The model cannot, however, capture the skewness of returns. For the full set of firms,
the skewness is 5.846, while the model predicts a skewness of mere 0.938. Moreover, the
model implies that skewness is well-estimated, with the minimum, across all 400 draws
being 0.849 while the maximum is 1.287. Skewness in the data is therefore far above what
could be possibly implied by the model. This discrepancy occurs whether or not the mean
is estimated using the CAPM or directly.
   One may think that the skewness is a feature of the potentially short-lived firms that
populate the larger sample. However, skewness that is excessive relative to the model is
also present for the 404 long-lived firms. Here, the skewness is much smaller: 1.321. It
is still far above what the model generates, however (the maximum in this calibration is
0.561).
   Note that the model fails to match skewness in the data despite the fact that returns
are positively skewed in the model due to the lognormal distribution. To highlight this
point, we also examine the skewness of log returns. Skewness of log returns in the model
is very slightly negative.10 Interestingly, skewness of log returns is also very slightly
negative in the data. Along this dimension, the model successfully matches the data, but
  10
     Skewness is not exactly zero for log returns because we are sampling from a distribution with
heterogeneous variances. The skewness of the return distribution depends on properties of the variance
distribution.




                                                 11
it is misleading: the low log skewness in the data apparently occurs not because there is a
heavy right tail, but because the left tail outweighs the right in the skewness calculation.
Looking purely at log returns, one would miss the important result that the model fails
to match the skewness of level returns.
    Motivated by results of Bessembinder (2017), we also calculate the percent of obser-
vations that exceed the riskfree rate. The model succeeds in matching the data for both
sets of simulations. For the full set of firms, the fraction of returns exceeding the riskfree
rate is 48% in the data. It is also 48% in population in the model.
    The model’s success in matching the proportion of returns exceeding the riskfree rate
is important for two reasons. First, it shows that it is possible, in an equilibrium model
with risk averse agents, to have returns on equities fall below the riskfree rate most of
the time. Second, the skewness in the data appears unrelated to this result; the model
can capture the percent of observations above the riskfree rate, but it fails to capture the
skewness.
    How is it that, in the fully rational equilibrium model, in which there is an equity
premium, stocks underperform Treasury bills most of the time? There are two reasons
why this occurs: the first is due to lognormality, and the second, which enhances the first,
is due to undiversified risk.
    Consider first the case of the market portfolio. In this case, there is no undiversified
risk.11 Define an N (0, 1) random variable M and let rf = log Rf . Because the log is a
monotonic transformation,

                                                                     1 2 
           Pr(RM > Rf ) = Pr(log RM > rf ) = Pr σM M ≥ −(µM − rf ) + σM   .
                                                                     2

Because M ∼ N (0, 1), the probability that σM M ≥ −(µM −rf )+ 12 σM
                                                                    2
                                                                      exceeds 50% if and
only if −(µM −rf )+ 12 σM
                        2
                          < 0, or equivalently if µM − 21 σM
                                                           2
                                                             −rf > 0. If µM − 12 σM
                                                                                  2
                                                                                    −rf < 0,
then we would expect the market portfolio to underperform Treasury bills more than half
   11
      Bessembinder (2017) also analyzes this result, but assumes that the excess return is lognormally
distributed. This is a less appealing assumption because the excess return could, theoretically, be negative,
while the return itself cannot.


                                                     12
of the time.
   Is it possible, under the model above, to have µM − 21 σM
                                                           2
                                                             − rf < 0? It is, because the
model only requires that µM − rf > 0. The mean return is greater than the riskfree rate,
but the median return is not.
   However, while this analysis shows that it is theoretically possible for more than half
of the observations on the market portfolio to fall below the riskfree rate, it is not likely
given the data. The equity premium, µM − rf is about 0.07 per annum, while 12 σM
                                                                               2
                                                                                 is
about 0.02 per annum. The magnitude of the equity premium is simply too large.
   However, for an individual stock, the effect above is enhanced because of idiosyncratic
volatility. Recall that, for the market return, the condition that returns exceed the riskfree
rate more than half the time is µM − 21 σM
                                         2
                                           −rf > 0. For an individual stock j, this condition
naturally becomes µj − 12 σj2 − rf > 0. However, while µM is in some sense an average of
µj across j,12 σM
                2
                  is far below the average of σj2 on account of diversification.
   Finally, note that none of this analysis depends on the horizon. If returns are log-
normally distributed, means and standard deviations both scale linearly in the horizon,
as does the riskfree rate return. The probability of long-horizon returns exceeding the
return on the Treasury bill position is the same as the probability of short-horizon returns
exceeding the Treasury bill position.


3.5       Monthly returns at a fixed point in time

So far we have reported that returns in the data are far more skewed than what the lognor-
mal model would predict. One possible reason for this skewness is that, in pooling returns
in the data, we have aggregated over many different idiosyncratic volatility regimes. If
firm-level volatilities become more dispersed—if idiosyncratic volatility is higher at some
points in time than in others (Campbell et al., 2001; Herskovic et al., 2016)—we might
expect to find skewness in pooled returns. However, at any particular point in time,
skewness in the population of returns would be much less.

where R̄t =    n    i=1   Ri,t , that is, the cross-sectional mean of the return. In a sample of
length T , we obtain T observations of cross-sectional skewness. We first examine results
for the 16,087 firms; Figure 2 shows a histogram of these skewness observations. Con-
sistent with time-varying idiosyncratic volatility, the majority of observations fall below
the pooled statistic, with a large cluster close to zero. Even so, the data firmly reject the
model. The dotted line in the figure shows the maximum skewness obtained in simula-
tions in the model. The vast majority of data observations exceed the maximum value
implied in the 400 model simulations. Figure 3, which shows analogous results for the 404
firms, tells a similar story. Finally, Table 3 shows that average cross-sectional skewness,
while below the pooled skewness, is far above what the model is capable of generating.
We can therefore conclude that the lognormal model is not capable of generating the
cross-sectional skewness observed in the data.13


3.6     Long horizon returns

The previous section shows that the lognormal model vastly under-represents positive
return skewness in monthly returns in the data.
    We now consider long-horizon returns. One advantage of the iid lognormal model is
that it makes very clear predictions about long horizon returns. Both the mean and the
variance of log returns scale perfectly in T . For a given stock j, skewness increases in T
because
                                                2      p 2
                                   skew(σj2 ) = eσj + 2   eσj −1 .
   13
      In this analysis, we simulate from a lognormal model with constant idiosyncratic volatilities. One
might argue then that we are not perhaps spikes in idiosyncratic volatility as documented by Herskovic
et al. (2016). Because of the infrequency of these spikes, however, they cannot account for the inability to
match cross-sectional skewness throughout the data sample. Moreover, the computation of idiosyncratic
volatility also depends on the underlying return generating process, a point to which we will return in
Section 5.

                                                     14
However, the percent of returns of stock j exceeding the riskfree rate depends only on the
properties of the log return, and thus is horizon-invariant.
    One striking feature of the data, is the skewness in the size of firms. The recent striking
growth in the stock-market capitalization of so-called FANG14 companies, despite their
already large size have called wide attention to this phenomenon. However, it is not a
new feature of the data. Axtell (2001) discusses the extreme skewness in firm sizes, which
he characterizes with a power law distribution.15 Bessembinder (2017) discusses the right
tail in a metric of wealth creation.
    We now ask whether our model can capture this skewness. We examine the cross-
section of cumulative returns and growth in market capitalization implied by the model
of Section 2. We consider, for each statistic, the proportion of the total value of that
statistic captured by the top 10 firms. We first compute this quantity for cumulative
returns. Table 4 confirms the skewness reported in previous studies holds for cumulative
return measures: the ten firms with the highest returns constitute 29% of the total when
measured by growth in market capitalization and 72% of the total when measured by
cumulative return. It would seem unlikely that the model, which is unable to capture the
cross-sectional skewness, could capture how a small fraction of firms could so dominate
when measured according to these statistics.
    To compare the model with the data, we cumulate returns in each simulation, with
returns given by the exponential of (1). This equation does not take a stand on whether
the return comes from price appreciation or from the dividend yield, and therefore we
report the same growth in market capitalization and cumulative return in the model. We
discuss how introducing dividend payouts would affect the model’s results later.
    Table 4’s results for methods 1 and 2 illustrate that the model overstates long-run
                                               16
skewness, rather than understating it.              In the data, the top 10 firms account for 72%
  14
      Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google
  15
      In our paper, firm sizes do not satisfy a power law distribution because there does not exist a
stationary distribution of firm sizes, as discussed below. From a technical point of view, it is helpful to
have a stationary distribution of firm sizes. It is less clear, however, that the true distribution of firm
sizes is in fact stationary.
   16
      Independently and concurrently, Bessembinder (2017) shows that a model with normally distributed


                                                    15
of the cumulative return and 29% of growth in market capitalization. For most samples
in the simulations, the top 10 firms account for a full 99% of the value.



4        Discussion

4.1      Skewness in long-horizon returns

Where does the skewness in long-horizon returns come from? It arises from the cumulative
effects of randomness. The log difference between any two returns is a random walk, and
thus, by a well-known mathematical result, must wander arbitrarily far away from zero.
It follows that “most” of the time, an economy that has run sufficiently long will feature
a highly skewed, and in fact nonconvergent distribution of returns.
    To see this more precisely, define the cumulative return for asset j between t and T :

                                                        T
                                                        Y
                                        CRj,t,t+T =           Rj,t+i .

                                                                              T

where CMR =          i=1   Rm,t+i is the cumulative market return. We then have the following
result

Lemma 1. For any two firms j, k with j 6= k, the difference between log cumulative
returns is a random walk with drift.
                                                                         PT
Proof. The result follows because both log CMRt,t+T and                   i=1 (k,t+i   − j,t+i ) are random
walks.
                                                                                        PT

idiosyncratic shocks but otherwise identical firms can also overstate the skewness in the data.

is T (σi2 + σj
              2
                 ), namely it increases linearly in the horizon. This means that the difference
between log returns can wander anywhere on the real line, and so in practical terms it will
spend most of its time at very large positive or large negative numbers. To be precise:

Corollary 1. There is a subsequence s(T ) such that for every j, k, j 6= k, log CRk,t,t+s(T ) −
log CRj,t,t+s(T ) approaches negative or positive infinity as s(T ) approaches infinity.

Proof. The result follows from Lemma 1 and results in Feller (1968).

   Now consider ratios of the form

                                           CRj,t,t+T
                                      PN                    ,

which give the percent contribution of the cumulative return on firm j to the total across
the market. Corollary 1 implies that these ratios to be either very close to 1, or very
close to zero most of the time, provided that the economy has run long enough. The
large percentages of the total gain accounted for by merely ten assets shown in Table 4
demonstrate this effect in the simulations.
   Skewness in cumulative returns is important for two reasons. First, it is at odds with
the data, as Table 4 shows. Even if we did not reject the lognormal model because it
delivers insufficient short-horizon skewness, we could reject it because of excessive long-
horizon skewness. Note, however, that while the data rejects the lognormal model, it is
not possible to tell from the data whether the underlying process for cumulative returns,
or for that matter, market capitalization growth, is stationary.
   This leads to the second reason why skewness in cumulative returns is important:
because of what it says about market values. Divergent market values cause a theoretical
problem that we describe in the next section. One could, in a model, have divergent
cumulative returns, but a stationary distribution of relative market values. Unfortunately,
however, under the assumptions in Section 2, relative market values do diverge.




                                              17
4.2    Skewness in market capitalization

The model for returns in (1) does not distinguish between returns including and exclud-
ing dividends. To address the distinction between market capitalization and cumulative
return, we need a model for the dividend yield. The iid endowment economy model
described in Section 2 is one such model.
   The model in Section 2 implies that ratios of prices to dividends are constant. Namely,

                                         Pjt      1
                                             =                                               (12)
                                         Djt   Φj − 1

for an asset-specific constant Φj such that Φj > 1 (see Appendix A). The finding of a
constant price-dividend ratio is intuitive because the growth rate of dividends and the
discount rate applied to future cash flows are both constant. Equation (12) implies that
growth rates in dividends and in market capitalizations are the same. Moreover, (4)
implies that dividend growth follows a law of motion that is analogous to that of returns.
Therefore, the results for cumulative returns also hold for market capitalizations:

Lemma 2. For any two firms j, k with j 6= k, the log ratios of market capitalizations
log Pjt /Pkt are a random walk with drift.

Proof. The result follows from (4) and the fact that the ratio of prices to dividends is a
constant (12).

Corollary 2. There is a subsequence s(T ) such that for every j, k, j 6= k, log Pj,s(T ) /Pk,s(T )
approaches negative or positive infinity as s(T ) approaches infinity.

   This result once again follows from Feller (1968) and the fact that log price differences
are random walks. Thus a small number of firms, and eventually a single firm, will come
to dominate the economy.




                                               18
   Finally note that cumulative returns and market capitalizations are closely related:

                                     T                  
                                     Y   Pj,t+i + Dj,t+i
                      CRj,t,t+T =
                                     i=1
                                                  Pj,t+i−1
                                      T                                   
                                     Y       Pj,t+i /Dj,t+i + 1 Dj,t+i
                                 =
                                     i=1
                                             Pj,t+i−1 /Dj,t+i−1 Dj,t+i−1
                                           Dj,T
                                 = ΦTj
                                           Dj,t

and thus
                           CRj,0,T = ΦTj Dj,T = ΦTj (Φj − 1)Pj,T

where we have normalized the initial price in the economy to equal 1.
   Intuitively, since returns and dividends are driven, in equilibrium, by the same set of
shocks. Thus the cross-section of firm values is nonstationary and, as with cumulative
returns, with probability one a single firm will come to take over the economy.


4.3    Idiosyncratic and market risk

A consequence of divergent ratios of market capitalization is two incompatible notions of
a market portfolio. Consider two possible definitions:

 (a) The claim to aggregate consumption

 (b) The value-weighted portfolio of dividend claims.

Note that (a) is identified with RM t in (1). It is the common factor of returns and
dividends. It represents overall wealth in the economy. Relative to this notion of the
market portfolio, the terms jt are idiosyncratic and unpriced.
   That said, (b) is directly analogous to the CRSP value-weighted return typically used
in studies of the stock market. However, (b) is necessarily dominated by a very few firms.
For these firms jt represents market risk, not idiosyncratic risk.
   How is it possible that (a) and (b) are different? Recall that in this model, the CAPM
holds, at least approximately. It then seems that investors should indeed hold the value-

                                                  19
weighted portfolio. The answer is that they do hold the portfolio with return RM t , which
pays the consumption claim as the dividend. The model in Section 2 does not enforce that
the the dividends add up to consumption. There must be another traded asset, a hidden
one, with potentially strange properties, that makes up the difference. The hypothesis
that the market portfolio does not correspond to the observed stock market is an old one
(Breeden, 1979; Jagannathan and Wang, 1996). This discussion shows not only that such
nontraded assets must exist, but that their share in the economy either goes to zero (in
which case consumption is negligible) or 1 (in which case the stock market is negligible)
as time goes by.
    Even though the definitions of the market portfolio are incompatible, it may still
seem surprising that the idiosyncratic shocks jt do not diversify away in the market
portfolio. After all, (1), because it is based on log returns, holds equally for long and
short-horizon returns. The Central Limit Theorem, and the Arbitrage Pricing Theory of
Ross (1976) should imply that it is diversified away. The problem is that the variance
of the idiosyncratic risk grows linearly in the horizon. It is necessary to add assets at a
faster rate than the the length of the horizon for the diversification to take place. Figure 1
                                             17
suggests that this has not occurred.
    How then can one model the market and individual firms at the same time? There are
other modeling options, but these come at arguably greater cost. One partial solution is
to assume away permanent shocks, a standard approach in the macroeconomics literature
(Zhang (2005) is an example of such an approach in the finance literature). In such a model
the cross-section of cumulative returns still has a nonstationary distribution. However,
market capitalization does have a stationary distribution. This itself is at potentially at
odds with the data, which suggests a heavy right tail in cumulative growth rates, just
not as heavy as in the model. Moreover, in assuming away permanent economic shocks,
   17
      Gabaix (2011) also argues that firm-level fluctuations could be important for aggregate shocks.
However, his argument is different from ours. He starts with the assumption of a stationary power law
distribution in firm sizes. Because some firms are very large, their contributions to GDP growth are
significant, are not diversified away. In our framework, there is a nonstationary distribution of firm sizes,
which creates a theoretical inconsistency in the definition of market risk.



                                                     20
these models assume away a feature of the economy that is both undeniably present and
of great consequence to asset pricing.18
    A second approach is to assume away idiosyncratic shocks. Many papers take this ap-
proach to modeling the cross section. Different implementations of this approach include
Hansen et al. (2008), Lettau and Wachter (2007), Santos and Veronesi (2010), Tsai and
Wachter (2016), Wachter and Zhu (2017).19 When one is modeling features of portfolios,
not individual firms, this is arguably reasonable, though it does take the distribution of
firm sizes in the data as given. However, in assuming away firm-specific shocks, this ap-
proach also assumes away an important feature of the economy: the empirical results in
Section 3.4 make clear that there do exist large, firm-specific shocks. By assuming them
away, we ignore the important question of the relation between these shocks and long-run
uncertain growth, which is ultimately what generates risk premia in the first place.


4.4     Mechanisms to reduce long-horizon skewness

In Section 3.6, we have seen that the lognormal model overstates long-run skewness: while
in the data the top ten firms account for 72% of the cumulative return and 29% of the
growth in market capitalization, in the simulations they account for a full 99% in most
samples. We now examine if such discrepancy persists even after incorporating mecha-
nisms that are designed to reduce the long-run skewness in our simulations. Specifically,
we consider the effect of dividends and time-varying idiosyncratic volatility.
    In the first set of modified simulations, we consider dividends. While this would
not affect skewness in long-run returns, it has the potential to decrease skewness in the
growth rate of market capitalizations. There is empirical support for the argument that
  18
      Under minor deviations from time-additive utility, temporary shocks receive a much reduced price
of risk relative to permanent shocks. Zhang (2005) and other papers avoid this problem by assuming an
exogenous stochastic discount factor.
   19
      Hansen et al. (2008) model consumption-dividend ratios as stationary and do not address the question
of the market portfolio. Lettau and Wachter (2007) and Santos and Veronesi (2010) model portfolio
shares as stationary. Tsai and Wachter (2016) model two claims that by definition add up to the market.
While the sizes are non-stationary, claims are re-issued every time a shock takes place place, and so the
resulting distribution of portfolio market capitalization is in fact stationary. Wachter and Zhu (2017)
assume portfolios differ only in their exposure to a rare event which is not realized in the sample.


                                                   21
firms initiate dividends after reaching maturity in their life cycles.20 Our simulation
procedure allows us to account for this. We use the following simple definition of maturity:
we assume firm has matured when its market capitalization exceeds that of the median
market capitalization in the previous month. We then subtract the dividend yield from the
return when computing growth in market capitalization. Once a firm initiates dividends,
it continues to pay, even if its value drops below the median in subsequent months.
    For the purposes of calibration, we compute the monthly dividend-price ratio for the
16,087 firms from our baseline simulation.21 We set the dividend-price ratio used in our
simulation to be equal to the average value computed from the CRSP data, which is
0.1786%.
    We also consider the possibility that idiosyncratic volatility might shrink as firms
become larger. Herskovic et al. (2016) document an inversely monotonic relation between
firm size quintile and return volatility. To account for this effect, we assign firms lower
values of idiosyncratic volatility as they become large relative to other firms. Specifically,
we sort firms into size deciles in the simulations. We assign firms an idiosyncratic volatility
based on their size decile. Those in the smallest market cap decile are assigned the highest
idiosyncratic volatility, and those in the largest market cap decile are assigned the smallest
idiosyncratic volatility.22 Firms idiosyncratic volatility can change, month-by-month in
the simulation.
    We obtain the idiosyncratic volatilities through the following calibration procedure.
We calculate the idiosyncratic volatility for firms in our sample, and sort these into
idiosyncratic-volatility deciles. The equal-weighted average idiosyncratic volatility then
  20
      Fama and French (2001) and Bulan et al. (2007) find that larger and mature firms are more likely
to initiate dividends.
   21
       We define the monthly dividend-price ratio as follows:
                                                P11
                                              1    i=0 Dt−i
                                                            ,
                                             12      Pt
where Pt and Dt are price and dividend in period t, respectively, and where we follow the standard
practice of using the previous twelve months of dividends to eliminate seasonality.
   22
      In the first month of the simulation, all firms are identical and thus assigned the average of the
idiosyncratic volatility.



                                                  22
becomes the assigned value for that decile. We report these values in Table 5.23
    Note that our procedure biases us against finding skewness in the simulations in two
ways. First, we no longer capture the true dispersion in volatilities reflected in CRSP
data because we assign the same volatility to firms in the same decile. This dispersion
is crucial for capturing skewness. Second, we assign firms that are small to the highest
idiosyncratic volatility decile and those that are large to the lowest. This overstates the
relation between size and volatility, thereby shrinking the volatility of larger stocks by
more than they may shrink in the data. Our procedure allows us to conduct numerically
feasible simulations while capturing the size-volatility relation in a way that works in favor
of the lognormal model.
    Results for both modifications are shown in Table 4. As might be expected, allowing
for monthly dividends implies that it is less likely for a small number of firms to take over
the economy. This is reflected in a lower percentage for the minimum and 5th percentile.
However, in most simulations, the top ten firms still entirely take over the economy when
the model is calibrated to the larger number of firms over the longer data sample. The
reason is that the effect of random growth described in the previous section still holds
among the very largest firms, even when firms pay dividends.24 Allowing for time-varying
volatility based on size has a more noticeable effect. In fact, market cap growth and
cumulative return in the data are now above the minimum that can be achieved in the
simulation. However, the median percentage, when the economy is calibrated to the larger
group of firms over the longer time period, is still 99%. The persistence of the discrepancy
between model and data seems to imply that understatement of skewness at short horizons
and its overstatement at long horizons require a more fundamental reconciliation.
   23
      For our baseline simulation, we compute these parameters after we draw the 2,440 stocks that
constitute each sample; for the simulation with 404 firms, the parameters are computed beforehand to
circumvent any redundant calculations.
   24
      We could have potentially found larger effects by forcing a strictly increasing relation between divi-
dend yield and size. However, not such relation exists in the data.




                                                    23
5     A binomial model
In this section we present a simple model that qualitatively captures many features of
that the data that are out of reach for the lognormal model. Because our intent is to
capture cross-sectional skewness, we abstract away from features like aggregate volatility,
and therefore risk premia. As will be clear, incorporating these features into the model is
straightforward.
    Consider a cross-section of firms indexed by j = 1, . . . n, and let Dj,t denote the
dividend paid by firm j at time t. For each j and t, define a Bernoulli random variable
Xj,t with parameter λ (that is, Xj,t = 1 with probability λ and zero otherwise). The
Bernoulli random variables are independently distributed across times t and firms j. Let
R denote the (constant) discount rate in the economy.
    We recursively define the processes Dj,t and Dt as follows. Let D0 = 1 and Dj0 = 1/n.
Given Dt , define
                                                      1
                                Dj,t+1 = Dj,t +         Dt ez Xjt                          (13)
                                                      n
Given Dj,t+1 , define
                                             n
                                             X
                                    Dt+1 =            Dj,t+1 .                             (14)
                                             j=1

By construction, individual firm dividends add up to the market dividend, which can then
be set equal to consumption in a representative agent model. Thus this model avoids the
pitfalls of the lognormal model described above.
    The following results characterize the aggregate dividends.

Proposition 1. The aggregate dividend follows the process:

                                                          n
                                                1Xz
                             Dt+1   = Dt + Dt e       Xj,t+1 .
                                                n j=1

                                                                    1
                                                                        Pn
    Standard binomial results can then be used to characterize      n    j=1   Xj,t+1 . As n ap-
proaches infinity, this quantity converges quickly to a normal distribution with mean λ
                                         √
and standard deviation which falls with n. However, given that this quantity is easy to

                                             24
compute numerically, characterizing its distribution is not necessary for our purposes.
   In this model, firms are subject to unusual large shocks represented by Xj,t . These
shocks generate a high degree of cross-sectional skewness, so much so that it is possible
to calibrate the skewness in the model to the data. Though shocks to the model are
identically distributed over time, firm-level volatility, as measured in the usual way by
squared differences in returns over short intervals, appears to be time-varying (Figure 4).
Time-varying volatility, however, simply reflects the rare realizations of the skewed shocks.
   From the point of view of an individual firm, the realizations of Xj,t are rare and
unpredictable (in our calculation, they occur in 2.5% of simulation months for a given
firm). A calculation of growth rate in firm’s dividends, most of the time, would lead to a
conclusion of zero growth. Yet, from the point of view of the economy as a whole, growth
occurs with near-certainty, at a rate of λez . In this model, growth in the economy is due
entirely to the rare idiosyncratic firm-level shocks.
   In expectation, firms do participate in economy-wide growth, and this is reflected in
their price:

Proposition 2. Given discount factor R, the ex-dividend price of firm j at time t equals

                                                 1 + λez
                                                                   
                              Dj,t  1                         1
                     Pj,t   =      + Dt                  z
                                                           −            ,               (15)
                              R−1 n           R − (1 + λe ) R − 1
whereas the value of the aggregate market equals

                                               1 + λez
                                  Pt = Dt                  .                            (16)
                                            R − (1 + λez )

   Equation 15 shows that the price of firm j is given by the sum of its “cash-cow”
value, namely, the value of its current dividend discounted into the future, plus a term
that accounts for future growth. In this simple model, the term that accounts for future
growth is equal across firms.
   Define the share of firm j’s dividend in the aggregate economy as αjt = Djt /Dt . Then




                                              25
αjt evolves according to

                                                                      −1
                                             1                  Dt+1
                            αj,t+1   = (αjt + eZ Xj,t+1 )                               (17)
                                             n                   Dt

Define κ = E [(Dt+1 /Dt )−1 ]. Assuming κ < 1, that is, assuming that on average the
economy grows over time, αjt has a stationary mean given by

                                                1 Z    1
                                         ᾱ =     e λ     .
                                                n     1−κ

We can expect that this model will generate a well-defined stationary distribution.
   By definition, the return on firm j equals

It is straightforward to show that this model captures the dependence between size and
idiosyncratic volatility.
   It follows from (13) that the the conditional variance of Dj,t+1 is the same for all
firms. Thus the conditional variance of Pj,t+1 is the same for all firms. It follows that the
conditional volatility of returns decreases in Pjt .
   Intuitively, investment opportunities in this economy are of a fixed size. In contrast,
in the lognormal economy, the size of investment opportunities scales with the size of the
firm. The decreasing relation between firm size and idiosyncratic volatility suggests a
mechanism such as the one presented here might be at work.
   Table 6 summarizes the properties of this model relative to the lognormal model. Un-
like the lognormal model, this model is capable of accounting for cross-sectional skewness.
It also accounts for the decreasing relation between firm size and volatility, which the log-
normal model in Section 2 does not do (in the simulations, we hard-wired this relation to
hold). It produces a stationary distribution of firm shares, which is convenient for model-
ing purposes. However, it does not produce the long-horizon skewness that characterizes



                                                  26
the data.
    The model has other potential implications. For instance, variation in the parameter λ
or z would lead to time-varying idiosyncratic volatility. If these shocks were priced (as they
would be under Epstein and Zin (1989) utility, or if they were correlated with realized
consumption), then the model would produce both common variation in idiosyncratic
volatility, and pricing effects for this factor, as shown in Herskovic et al. (2016).
    Nonetheless, the lack of long-horizon skewness suggests that this model is not a suffi-
cient description of the data. It may be that the true process lies between this model and
the lognormal model.



6     Conclusion
We have investigated skewness in the cross section of asset returns through the lens of a
lognormal model of returns with common and idiosyncratic shocks. We show a seemingly
paradoxical result: the model both dramatically understates the skewness in the cross-
section and overstates the skewness in cumulative returns. The understatement is at short
horizons, while the overstatement is at long horizons.
    The skewed long-run distribution creates an intriguing theoretical problem for the
micro-foundations of firms and the aggregate market. If firm dividends contain a per-
manent source of uncertainty, then some firms will inevitably grow and “take over” the
economy. In models, this creates a nonstationary distribution of relative firm values. As-
suming a separate market portfolio that is not the value-weighted average of firms solves
the problem in so far as one can proceed with the calculation of equilibrium expected
returns. However, such a market portfolio diverges from the value weighted portfolio of
firms, so that either the stock market, or consumption becomes negligible. Besides being
unrealistic, this inevitably creates difficulties in a true general equilibrium setting when
consumption is constrained to equal firms’ production. It also ignores the connection be-
tween innovation (which takes place at the firm level) and aggregate growth. We present
a model that confronts this problem by implying stationary firm sizes. However, this does

                                             27
not capture the long-horizon skewness in the data. The long-run distribution of firm sizes,
should it exist, and the mechanisms keeping that distribution stationary (if indeed it is
stationary) are thus of fundamental importance in asset pricing.

    Let RM t denote the gross return on the asset that pays consumption as its dividend
(namely, aggregate wealth). The Euler equation implies

                                          Ct

Let PCt be the ex-dividend price of the consumption claim. Conjecture that PCt /Ct is a
constant, and define
                                                  PCt /Ct + 1

Thus the price-dividend ratio is (indirectly) characterized by

which has a solution as long as parameters are such that the right hand side is less than
1. This confirms the conjecture. Because

RM t is also lognormally distributed. Equation A.2 also implies that RM,t+1 is perfectly
                  Ct+1
correlated with    Ct
                       ,   and that log RM,t+1 and log CCt+1

is known at time t. Therefore Rf,t+1 equals a constant Rf with

The risk premium equation, (6), follows from

(A.3), and (A.1). The fact that the risk premium is constant justifies replacing the
conditional expectation with the unconditional expectation.
   Now consider an asset paying (4) as its dividend. Let Pjt be the ex-dividend price.
Conjecture that Pjt /Djt is a constant and define

                                            Pjt /Djt + 1

                                              Pjt /Djt

Arguments similar to above show that the price-dividend ratio is characterized by
                                       "       −γ        #

provided again that the right hand side is less than 1. It follows that

                                                           Dj,t+1

                                                                                Dj,t+1
Thus log Rj,t+1 is normally distributed, and is perfectly correlated with log    Djt
                                                                                       .   More-
over, they have equal variance. Because the same is true for log RM,t+1 and log Ct+1 /Ct ,


                                             30
it follows that βj = βjd and jt = djt .

We have used the fact that consumption growth and market returns are perfectly corre-
lated. Substituting in for (A.3) shows

                                                         2
                                      µj − log Rf = γβj σM .


Note that this is a restatement of the Consumption CAPM of Breeden (1979). In the
general case, σM is replaced by the standard deviation of consumption growth, and the β
is with respect to consumption growth. The CAPM (5) follows from substituting in for
γ using (6).

ing the drift parameter (µi ). Sampling distribution of each statistic is obtained from the simu-
lations. Panels A and B are relevant to simulations using 16,087 firms with at least 60 monthly
returns from July 1926 to December 2016; Panels C and D pertain to the simulations using 404
firms without missing data for monthly returns from January 1973 to December 2016. The first
column shows the statistic for the corresponding firms. The next five columns show the distri-
bution of the statistic obtained from the simulations, and the last column illustrates the statistic
for the pooled values of 100 simulations. E[R] − 1 and σ[R] are reported in percentages.

 Notes: We conduct 400 monthly simulations of the stock market for both methods of es-
timating the drift parameter (µi ). We also consider simulations with monthly dividends
and time-varying volatility. For each simulation, we examine the percentage of the to-
tal increase in value contributed by the top ten firms, where we measure the increase in
value alternatively as market capitalization growth and cumulative return. Data values
assume we begin with an equal-weighted portfolio, and the sampling distributions of the
percentages are obtained from the simulations. A greater percentage contributed by the
top ten firms implies a greater asymmetry in the distribution of long-term returns.

each decile. The second column pertains to the set of 16,087 firms
with at least 60 monthly returns from July 1926 to December 2016,
the values of which are calculated across the entire universe. In the
simulations, the volatility parameters are estimated only from the
2,440 firms that constitute each sample. The third column pertains
to the set of 404 firms without missing data for monthly returns
from January 1973 to December 2016.

 Notes: The table compares selected features in the data and the
model. The first column examines monthly returns of all CRSP com-
mon stocks from July 1926 to December 2016. The second column
pertains to simulations using 16,087 firms from the lognormal model
and the CAPM. The third column pertains to simulations from the
binomial model, whose parameters were calibrated to match the skew-
ness in the data. The calibrated parameters are reported in Table 7.
For both models, the reported statistics are median values obtained
from 400 simulation samples.

  Figure 1: Historical Number of CRSP Common Stocks
  On the first day of each month from July 1926 to December 2016, we count the number of
  unique common stocks in the cross-section, as available in CRSP. The jump on January
  1973, from 2,623 to 5,494, roughly corresponds to the establishment of Nasdaq in February
  of 1971.
