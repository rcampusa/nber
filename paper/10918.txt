Why Are Power Couples Increasingly Concentrated in Large Metropolitan Areas?
Janice Compton and Robert A. Pollak
NBER Working Paper No. 10918
November 2004, Revised July 2006
JEL No. J61

                                            ABSTRACT

Using census data, Costa and Kahn (QJE, 2000) find that power couples - couples in which both

spouses have college degrees - are increasingly likely to be located in the largest metropolitan areas.

One explanation for this trend is that college educated couples are more likely to face a co-location

problem - the desire to satisfy the career aspirations of both spouses - and therefore are more

attracted to large labor markets than are other couples. An alternative explanation is that all college

educated individuals, married and unmarried, are attracted to the amenities and high returns to

education found in large cities and that as a result, the formation of power couples through marriage

of educated singles and additional education is more likely to occur in larger than smaller

metropolitan areas. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we analyze the dynamic

patterns of migration, marriage, divorce and education in relation to city size and find that power

couples are not more likely to migrate to the largest cities than part-power couples or power singles.

Instead, the location trends are better explained by the higher rate of power couple formation in

larger metropolitan areas. Regression analysis suggests that it is only the education of the husband

and not the joint education profile of the couple that affects the propensity to migrate to large

metropolitan areas.

1.      Introduction

     Couples in which both husband and wife have college degrees are increasingly likely to be located in

large metropolitan areas. In 1970, 39% of these couples – called “power couples” by Costa and Kahn (2000)

- lived in metropolitan areas of at least two million. In 1990, this number had jumped to 50%. By

comparison, among couples in which only one spouse has a college education - “part-power couples” - the

proportion living in large metropolitan areas increased more slowly, growing from 36% to 42% over the two

decades. Couples in which neither spouse has a college degree - “low-power couples” - have the lowest

probability of living in a large city and the lowest rate of increase, growing from 30% to 34% in twenty

years. (Costa and Kahn, 2000)

     Costa and Kahn consider two main explanations for the increasing concentration of power couples in

large metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). First, large metropolitan areas may be increasingly attractive to

the college educated, regardless of their marital status. The increase in urbanization of the college educated

may reflect higher returns to education in larger MSAs or urban amenities more commonly found there.

Thus, the observed trends may be the result of college educated singles moving to large urban areas and then

marrying. Second, the labor markets found in large metropolitan areas may hold particular attraction for

power couples. All married couples potentially face the possibility that their location preferences will differ.

This ‘co-location problem’ may arise from different preferences for amenities or proximity to family, but

economists emphasize job opportunities. If husband and wife work in the paid labor market and if they live

together, then they must both find acceptable employment in the same location. With the rise in married

women’s labor force participation, the potential for co-location conflict has increased for all couples, but may

be most acute for the college educated because they tend to have more specialized careers. Solving this type

of co-location problem may be easier in the labor markets of large metropolitan areas, and thus these areas

should be magnets for power couples.

     Costa and Kahn conclude that the ability of large MSAs to solve the co-location problem explains most

of the observed increase in the concentration of power couples in large MSAs. Although the data used in




                                                                                                              3
their analysis are cross-sectional, they suggest that the migration of power couples is the principal

mechanism underlying the changes in observed location patterns.

    In this paper we investigate the relationship between migration and the education profiles of couples.

We ask two questions. First, is there evidence that the co-location pressure faced by highly educated couples

is a determinant of migration? That is, compared to other couples, are power couples more likely to migrate

into, and less likely to leave, large MSAs? Second, do the migration patterns of power couples differ from

those of other couples? Positive responses to these questions would support Costa and Kahn’s co-location

explanation for the concentration of power couples in large urban areas. We do not, however, find evidence

supporting the co-location explanation.

    Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), we find that, holding all else equal,

power couples are more likely to migrate and, when they migrate, are more likely to migrate to large urban

areas than low-power couples. We find, however, that the factor determining couples’ migration is not their

joint education profile but the husband’s education. More specifically, we find that the migration behavior of

part-power couples in which only the husband is a college graduate is indistinguishable from that of power

couples, while the migration behavior of part-power couples in which only the wife is a college graduate is

indistinguishable from that of low-power couples.       Our conclusion that migration is affected by the

husband’s education rather than the couple’s joint education profile is unaltered when we include controls for

post-graduate education and occupation to identify those couples most likely to have specialized careers.

    Logic suggests that the observed location of power couples must be the resultant of four dynamic

processes: migration, marriage, divorce, and human capital accumulation. Looking at the stock of power

couples living in large metropolitan areas, we can conclude only that each spouse must have earned a college

degree, married a spouse who earns/earned a college degree, remained married, and migrated to and/or

chosen to remain in a large metropolitan area.

    We argue that the migration of power couples into large urban areas is unlikely to be the primary

mechanism behind the concentration of power couples in large MSAs. The formation of power couples in

large MSAs provides a more plausible explanation. Although the differences between groups are not


                                                                                                            4
precisely estimated, the patterns suggest that differences in the migration rates of power singles, in

assortative mating patterns, and in college enrollment rates by city size may be responsible for the increasing

concentration of power couples in large MSAs. This suggestion is strengthened by the 2000 census data,

data unavailable to Costa and Kahn. Between 1990 and 2000 the proportion of power couples living in large

MSAs fell, while the proportion of low-power couples in large MSAs increased. This reversal of the earlier

trend is difficult to explain in terms of power couple migration and co-location pressure.

     The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the literature on couple migration.

In section 3 we describe the data, the econometric model, and the variables we use to investigate the

relationship between the joint education profile of spouses and the probability of migration. Regression

results are presented in section 4. Section 5 provides an overview of couple migration patterns as well as the

other mechanisms that may explain the location trends – migration of singles, assortative mating, marriage

and divorce trends, and educational attainment by city size. Section 6 reports on changes in power couple

concentration in large urban areas using data from the 2000 census. Section 7 concludes.



2.      Migration of Couples

        Economists frame individuals’ migration behavior as human capital decisions (Mincer, 1978:

Sjaastad 1962). A person will migrate if the expected benefit of living in another location less migration

costs exceeds the expected benefit of remaining in the current location. The main statistical trends of

migration are consistent with this model - younger individuals are more mobile than older individuals, more

educated persons are more mobile than those with less education, rural to urban migration is more common

than the reverse, and the longer individuals have resided in an area the less likely they are to migrate. (For a

review of the migration literature, see Greenwood, 1997).

        Polachek and Horvath (1977), Sandell (1977) and Mincer (1978) were among the first to frame the

migration decision explicitly in terms of family net gain rather than individual net gain. These researchers

abstract from decision making within the family and assume that families migrate if and only if the sum of

the benefits of migrating is greater than the sum of the costs, where the sums are taken over all family


                                                                                                              5
members. Family migration is less likely than individual migration since the costs of migrating increase with

the number of family members while the benefits may not. The model suggests that one spouse, typically the

husband, is often a ‘tied-stayer’ while the wife is often a ‘tied-mover’. Tied-stayers forgo moves that would

result in positive net returns for the individual, but negative net returns for the family. Tied-movers

participate in moves that result in a loss for themselves but positive net returns for the family.

         Empirical work confirms the importance of husbands’ career opportunities in migration decisions.

Using a sample of college graduates, Duncan and Perrucci (1976) show that the higher the occupational

prestige and migration opportunities connected to the husband’s occupation, the greater the probability that

the couple will migrate. They find, however, that the occupational prestige and migration opportunities of

the wife’s career did not affect migration probabilities. Using data also from the 1970s, Bielby and Bielby

(1992) link the migration behavior of couples to gender-role beliefs. Couples who subscribe to a more

traditional “provider role” for husbands will not be deterred from moves that harm the wife’s employment

opportunities but will be deterred from moves that harm the husband’s career opportunities. More recent

studies continue to find similar gendered determinants of couple migration (Gardner et al. 2001; Nivalainen

2004).

         Unlike these large-scale statistical studies, Green (1997) uses a case-study approach to investigate

the migration/location decisions of dual-career households. On the basis of interviews with thirty such

couples, she finds that the leader in migration decisions is most often the spouse with (a) the more highly

paid career; (b) the more locationally constrained career; and/or (c) the more insecure career. In the large

majority of cases, the spouse with these job characteristics was the husband. Green notes that although the

respondents appreciate the greater career opportunities in large urban centers, many are unwilling to incur the

costs associated with such large areas – high costs of living, congestion, etc. (Green, 1997).

         Because career choice is endogenous to beliefs about migration and marriage, Frank (1978) argues

that expectations of migration based on the maximization of net family welfare help explain the male-female

wage gap. Women are less likely to invest in their own human capital when their opportunity set is limited

by their husbands’ locational choices. Similarly, if employers believe that the location decisions of women


                                                                                                             6
are determined largely by their husbands’ careers and not their own, employers may be less likely to invest in

firm-specific human capital for women. As a result, women may tend to enter more mobile careers – careers

that build largely on general, rather than specific human capital and careers in which opportunities are not

concentrated in large urban areas. Studies of couple migration by Shihadeh (1991), Morrison and Lichter

(1988), Spitze (1984), Bird and Bird (1985), Cooke and Bailey (1996), and Jacobsen and Levin (1997) are

broadly consistent with Frank’s argument.

        Robst and McGoldrick (1996) investigate the impact of destination size on outcomes for tied movers.

They began by hypothesizing that while a trailing spouse has a job search limited to the location that the

leading spouse has chosen, if the location is a large MSA and this in turn reflects higher job vacancies, then

the trailing spouse may find a wage offer near the maximum that could be obtained in a nationwide search.

This hypothesis was not supported by the data. The authors found that the size of the local labor market had

no significant effect on the likelihood of women being “overeducated”, i.e., having a higher level of

education than the average within their occupation. They suggested that it is not the market’s size that is

important, but its job composition: a small local labor market with a relatively large concentration of white-

collar employment is as beneficial to women as a large labor market without such a concentration.



3.      Econometric Model and Data Description

        Our econometric analysis addresses the following question: compared to part-power and low-power

couples, are power couples more likely to migrate to and less likely to migrate from large cities? To answer

this question, we consider the determinants of couple migration, focusing on couples’ joint education

profiles.



3.1     Data

        The regression analyses presented in the following sections use data from the Panel Study of Income

Dynamics (PSID). The PSID is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of American individuals and




                                                                                                            7
families. The original sample included members of 4800 families. All individuals from the original families

are followed as they move or form new family units. For this study we have included all married couples

who live together and all unmarried heterosexual couples who have lived together for at least one year.1 In

all that follows, we define ‘power couples’ as those in which both husband and wife have a bachelor’s

degree; ‘part-power couples’ as those in which only one spouse holds a bachelor’s degree; and ‘low-power

couples’ as those in which neither spouse holds a bachelor’s degree.2 When we refer to an individual as

“college educated” we mean that he or she holds a bachelor’s degree. The sample is limited to men aged 25-

39 and women aged 23-37. This restriction allows us to focus on those individuals and couples whose

migration decisions would be most influenced by career considerations.3

        The Geocode Match Supplement to the PSID provides detailed geographic identifiers necessary for a

migration study. Building up from the county of residence, we sort observations into Metropolitan Statistical

Areas (MSAs). The U.S. Census Bureau defines MSAs as agglomerations of counties that include a large

population nucleus and adjacent communities that share a high degree of social and economic integration.

We define migration as a move between MSAs, between an MSA and a non-MSA county, or between two

non-MSA counties. Thus, moves within an MSA are not treated as migration. The changing definition of

MSAs poses a problem for migration analysis. For example, according to the 1990 MSA definitions,

Baltimore MD and Washington DC were distinct MSAs, but according to the 2000 definitions they are part

of a single MSA. To prevent changing MSA definitions from creating the appearance of changes in

  Dropping couples who were not legally married did not alter the results in preliminary analyses.

  Some imputation was required for the education variable. Education was asked of respondents when they entered the
household but not at each subsequent round. In 1985, the education questions were re-asked of all individuals in the
sample. Since year of graduation was asked, it was possible to work backwards from 1985 to code the education
attainment for previous years. For years after 1985, only new heads/spouses were asked the education questions. For
those already in the sample, if they were enrolled in school in 1985, they were assumed to have finished their program
and so a degree was imputed to them in following years. If individuals were not enrolled in school in 1985, their
education level observed in 1985 was simply carried forward. The resulting imputations look reasonable in comparison
to average education of the individual’s occupation. A robustness test was performed in which education was raised to
be at least the minimum level of education that individuals who reported the same occupation deemed necessary to
perform the job. The results are not substantially different.

  These age categories are the focus of Costa and Kahn (2000). Similar trends in location are found with expanded age
categories.


                                                                                                                     8
migration rates, we apply the 1990 MSA definitions consistently throughout the sample.4 In the analyses that

follow, we define “large” metropolitan areas as MSAs with populations greater than two million, “midsize”

metropolitan areas as MSAs with populations between 250,000 and two million, and “small” metropolitan

areas as non-metropolitan areas and MSAs with populations less than 250,000. We choose these categories

to be consistent with those used by Costa and Kahn. Appendix A lists the large MSAs for the 1970-2000

period.

          In our regression analyses we use data for the period 1980-1993. We limit our analysis to these years

because some of the relevant variables–most importantly, the education variables—were not available for

any longer period. Since it is during this period that we observe the greatest increase in power couple

concentration in large MSAs, we would expect the co-location effect to be strongest during this period. The

panel data are pooled into twelve two-year cross-sections. For each couple-year observation, the dependent

variable captures the migration behavior observed in year two and all independent variables measured in year

one. Our sample includes 21955 couple-year observations with 638 observed migrations (3%).



3.2       Econometric Model

          We estimate two econometric models of migration. In the first we estimate the probability of

migrating without regard to the destination. The dependent variable is binary, indicating whether or not the

couple migrates. In the second model we distinguish migrants by the size of destination. Here, the couple

chooses among four alternatives: staying in the current location, migrating to a small MSA, migrating to a

midsize MSA, and migrating to a large MSA. The decision to migrate and the size of destination are

determined simultaneously.

 Costa and Kahn, whose focus is not dynamic, use the current year MSA definition for each census year that they
consider but they note that their results do not change substantially under alternative (stable) definitions.


                                                                                                                  9
3.2.1   Sample Selection Issues

        Two selection issues require attention. The first is attrition: the requirement that migration variables

be defined in year two results in the loss of observations. The second is change in marital status: because our

observations are at the household level – unmarried individual heads of households and married couples –

and are defined over a two-year period, the marital status must be constant over the two years. Hence, the

location in year two is defined only for those couples that remain married. As a result, our samples are

doubly selected to include only those observations that (i) have not been lost to attrition and (ii) have the

same marital status in year two as in year one. Beginning with a sample of 26324 couple-year observations,

we lose 2264 observations to attrition and 1354 observations to divorce. We dropped 751 additional

observations due to missing values for key variables or death.

        The model for the binary choice decision is a three-equation latent dependent variable model where

equation (1) estimates the probability of remaining in the sample in year two (i.e., no attrition), equation (2)

estimates the probability of remaining married in year two, and equation (3) is the equation of interest,

estimating the probability of migration

        qi* = Vi δ + υ i i = 1....N 1                                                                 (1)

          *
          i                                                                                           (2)
         y i* = X i β + u i i = 1....N 3 , N 3 < N 2                                                  (3)

where qi* , z i* and yi* are unobserved latent variables; Vi ,Wi and X i are K, J and M row vectors of exogenous

explanatory variables; and δ , γ and β are K, J and M column vectors of parameters to be estimated. The full

sample is denoted N1; N2 includes all couples who are present in both years; and N3 includes all couples who

remain married in year two. We assume all three disturbance terms are drawn from normal distributions. In

the absence of selection bias, we assume υ i , ω i and u i are identically and independently normally distributed

zero mean error terms.

        Following Vella (1998, 1992, 1993) and Eklof and Karlsson (1999) we test for sample selection in

the binary choice model. Rewrite equation (1) as:



                                                                                                              10
            yi* = X i β + λ1ωi + λ2υ i + η i        i = 1....N1                                                        (4)

where λ1 and λ 2 are equal to σ uω σ u2 and σ uυ σ u2 respectively. The term η i is a white noise error term.

Replacing ω i and υ i with the estimated generalized residuals from the probit models – which by Vella


(1993) are equal to their respective inverse Mills ratios, we estimate

                           ⎡ φ ( z i' γ ) ⎤      ⎡ φ (qi' δ ) ⎤
            y = X i β + λ1 ⎢
              *
                                          ⎥ + λ2 ⎢            ⎥ + ηi   i = 1....N 1 .                                  (5)
                           ⎣ Φ( zi γ ) ⎦         ⎣ Φ (qi δ ) ⎦
              i                      '                    '




Under the null hypothesis, λ1 and λ 2 are equal to zero and η i is equal to u1 .         The t-tests on λ1 and λ 2 are

tests of selection bias since under the null hypothesis the estimates are consistent. In general, however, under

the alternative hypothesis, the estimates are not consistent.

           The test results are presented in table 1. Shown are some key variables as well as the test statistics.5

Column A presents the binary choice probit regression (equation (1)) without adjusting for sample selection.

Column B presents the results from equation (5), including the two test statistics. As indicated by the t-tests,

neither λ1 nor λ 2 are significant. In the regressions presented in columns C and D we alter the modeling of

sample selection. In column C the two selection criteria are combined. In this model the first step equation

estimates the probability of being observed in year two (i.e., no divorce and no attrition). In column D the

observations that have been lost due to attrition are simply dropped and we model only the sample selection

arising from divorce.6 In both variations, the t-test indicates insignificant test variables.

         Column E estimates the abridged model of column D under a maximum likelihood probit estimation

procedure outlined by van de Ven and van Praag (1981) and implemented through STATA using the

HECKPROB command.7 The estimates in this model are consistent and asymptotically efficient even in the

presence of selection bias as it allows for the estimation of the correlation between the error terms ω i and u i .

The likelihood ratio test of independent equations – testing the null hypothesis that ρ=0 – indicates again that

sample selection bias is not a concern.

         Overall, the t-tests on the inverse Mills ratios added to the regressions in columns B through D and

the likelihood ratio test in column E indicate that sample selection bias is not significant in this model. In

the analyses that follow, we present the binary choice estimation results from the maximum likelihood probit

model.

         For the second model, in which size of the destination is determined jointly with the decision to

migrate, we rely on the above test results and estimate the model under the assumption that sample selection

bias is not significant. Here we employ a multinomial logistic specification and estimate the following model

using a maximum likelihood procedure.8                   Extending the binary model from (4), the probability that

observation i chooses outcome j is:

                               ⎧         1

married in year two.

  Maximum likelihood estimates in which the missing observations are dropped and selection is solely due to marital
stability are similar.
8
  Although we assumed a normal distribution in the first case, we assume a logistic error distribution here. As we have
no a priori beliefs concerning the distribution of the errors, the choice of error form was determined solely by ease of
computation. While it would have been more consistent to estimate multinomial probit regressions, convergence was
difficult. The binary choice regressions were run under the assumption of logistic errors and the results were very
similar.


                                                                                                                           12
Where j=1,2,3,4 denotes the four categorical outcomes (not migrating, migrating to a small MSA, migrating

to a mid-size MSA, migrating to a large MSA); the base outcome (j=1) is the choice of not migrating. In the

results that follow, we present the relative risk ratios, which are equal to the exponentiated value of a

coefficient. This allows for an easy interpretation: the relative risk ratio indicates the change in the

probability of observing outcome k, relative to the probability of not migrating, for a one unit change in the

corresponding variable.



3.2.2   Endogeneity

        Migration and education are endogenous if individuals have unobservable characteristics that are

reflected in a higher propensity to invest in human capital through both education and migration. To correct

for unobserved heterogeneity in the propensity to invest in human capital, we control for whether the current

state is the home state of either spouse and whether or not the household head (read: husband) has previously

moved in order to take a job. The inclusion of these variables weakens the endogeneity concerns as they

capture some of the otherwise unobservable propensity to invest in human capital. Indeed with the inclusion

of these variables, Hausman tests allow us to reject the null hypothesis of endogeneity at the 5% confidence

level. Column F in table 1 highlights the importance of these variables. While the results are robust to

inclusions and omissions of other control variables, the omission of these variables significantly alters the

impact of the education variables.



3.2.3   Control Variables

        In the following discussion, we focus on couples’ joint education profile as a determinant of

migration, controlling for other factors such as family, location amenities, employment, and occupation.

Appendix B shows means and standard deviations for the full sample, which includes all couple-year

observations, and separately for the migrant observations. The means show the strong importance of the

couples’ home state and previous migration behavior. Close to 80% of the couple observations are residing

in the home state of at least one spouse. Compare this with only 45% of migrant observations. In 26% of all


                                                                                                           13
observations, the head had moved previously for a job; the corresponding figure for migrant observations is

38%. In our sample, migrants are younger, slightly less likely to have pre-school children, less likely to be

home owners, and less likely to be non-white. Migrants’ origins tend to be characterized by slower growth,

higher housing value, and greater distance to any large MSAs. In terms of labor force attachment, migrants

have lower job durations and are more likely to be unemployed or out of the labor force.



4.       Regression Results

         The regression analysis provides no evidence that co-location pressure is a determinant of migration.

Tables 2-5 provide key regression results.9 For the binary model, the marginal effects of the key variables

are presented – the change in the probability of migrating due to a change in the dummy variable from zero

to one. For the multinomial model, the results are presented as relative risk ratios. For a dummy variable,

this is the change in the probability of migrating to the indicated destination size over the probability of not

migrating that occurs due to a discrete change in the variable from 0 to 1.



4.1      The Effect of Power Couple Status on Migration

         Table 2 presents the results for key variables in the binary model. Column A corresponds to column

E in table 1 and controls for sample selection using maximum likelihood estimation. The regression results

show that it is not the joint education profile of a couple but only the husband’s education that affects the

decision to migrate.

         The analysis hinges on the behavior of couples in which one spouse has a college degree and the

other does not (i.e., the part-power couples). In column A, we pool the part-power couples in which the

husband is a college graduate with the part-power couples in which the wife is a college graduate. Point

estimates indicate that power couples are more likely to migrate than both part-power couples and low-power

couples, although the Wald test shows that the difference between the coefficients on power couples and

column B, table 2 and column B, table 3a. Other regression results are similar.


                                                                                                                      14
part-power couples is not statistically significant at a 95% confidence level. Holding all else constant, the

probability of migration for a power couple is 2.2% higher than the probability of migration for a low-power

couple. In column B, we split the part-power couples into those in which the husband is a college graduate

and those in which the wife is a college graduate. We find that the migration propensity of power couples is

indistinguishable from that of part-power couples in which the husband has a college degree, and that the

migration propensity of low-power couples is indistinguishable from that of part-power couples in which the

wife has a college degree. When we ignore joint education specifications and control for the husband’s

education, we find no statistically significant effect of the wife’s education on the probability of migration

(column C). Wald tests on the coefficients confirm that the effects of husband’s and wife’s education on the

propensity to migrate are statistically different. These results suggest that it is not the joint education profile

of a couple that affects migration, but only the husband’s education. Finally, in column D we find that while

the probability of migrating is lower for couples living in large MSAs compared to couples living in small

MSAs, the interaction variables show that there is no differential impact of origin size by education.

        The coefficients on other variables are as expected. The variables included to capture past behavior

– whether or not the couple is residing in the home state of at least one spouse, and whether or not the head

has previously moved for a job – remain constant in size and significance across model specifications.

Living in the home state of at least one spouse reduces the probability of migrating by 2.2%, while prior

migrants are 0.4% more likely to migrate compared to couples in which the head has never previously moved

for a job.

        As noted above, these binary regressions are run simultaneously with a sample selection equation.

The statistical significance of the variable ρ provides a test of sample selection bias. In all but column D, we

can accept the null hypothesis that ρ = 0, that is, that the two equations are independent and controlling for

sample selection is not providing any further information.

        Tables 3a and 3b present the results from the multinomial logit regressions, which confirm the

crucial role of husband’s education in migration, especially migration to large MSAs. These regressions do




                                                                                                                15
not control for sample selection because sample selection bias was significant in only one of the binary

regressions. For columns A through C then, this omission is unimportant.

        The first regression, presented in column A, again does not distinguish between the two groups of

part-power couples.     The propensity to migrate to large MSAs is higher for both power and part-power

couples, compared to low-power couples. The results for these regressions are presented as relative risk

ratios, indicating that power couples are 2.8 times more likely to migrate to a large MSA compared to low-

power couples, while part-power couples are 3.4 times more likely. Column B distinguishes between part-

power couples in which the husband holds a college degree and part-power couples in which the wife holds a

college degree. As in the binary regressions, this distinction is important. Compared to low-power couples,

both power couples and part-power couples in which the husband has a college degree are more likely to

migrate to medium MSAs and to large MSAs. Part-power couples in which the wife holds a college degree

are indistinguishable from low-power couples in their propensity to migrate to cities of all sizes. Column C

considers only the education of each spouse, and not their joint profile. Again we find that couples in which

the husband holds a college degree are more likely to migrate to a large MSA. The estimated effect of a

wife’s college education on the probability of migrating to a large MSA is negative, although the precision of

this estimate is low.

        In all three regressions presented in columns A-C, couples living in large MSAs are less likely to

migrate to small MSAs. Couples living in midsize MSAs are more likely to migrate to large MSAs (with

slightly lower levels of significance). These trends indicate a general reluctance to move to a smaller

metropolitan area and a general preference for moving to a larger MSA. The regression results presented in

column D indicate that the education category of the couple has some impact on this preference for larger

MSAs. Couples in which only the wife has a college degree are less likely to migrate from one large MSA to

another large MSA, and more likely to migrate from a large MSA to a midsize MSA, compared to low-

power couples. However, the results for column D are questionable. Not only is sample selection bias an

issue in this specification, but we also find a violation of the assumption of independence of irrelevant




                                                                                                           16
alternatives. Hausman test results suggest that the omission of the small or medium alternatives alters the

results for the large alternative.

          We see again the robust significance of the past behavior variables. Residing in the home state of at

least one spouse lowers the probability of migration to any sized destination.           Interestingly, having

previously moved for a job has no discernable effect on the probability of migrating to a medium or large

MSA, but increases the probability of migrating to a small MSA. This suggests that we may be capturing

return migrants.

          Both the binary probit regressions and the multinomial logit regressions show that the probability of

migration, and the migration to destinations of different sizes, depends not on the number of spouses holding

a college degree (low-power, part-power, and power) but only on whether the husband holds a college

degree.



4.2       The Effect of Post-Graduate Degrees and Urban Occupations on Migration

          To link the co-location hypothesis to the education profile of couples we must assume that, for

couples with college degrees, occupational specialization makes co-location pressure more acute. But many

college educated individuals, women especially, are in occupations that are relatively portable and are not

concentrated in large urban areas - the occupational specialization story is more plausible for an economist

married to a lawyer than for a high-school teacher married to a nurse. 50% of power couples and 55% of

power singles lived in large urban areas in 1990. Economists and lawyers tend to have advanced degrees and

are relatively concentrated in large areas – 59% of economists and 55% of lawyers lived in large MSAs in

1990. In contrast, teachers and nurses are less likely to have advanced degrees and are not concentrated in

large areas - 33% of teachers and 38% of registered nurses live in large MSAs in 1990 (see appendix C). The

migration behavior of couples in which both spouses have post-graduate degrees – call these ‘super-power

couples’ - or both spouses have occupations that are concentrated in large MSAs might be very different

from the behavior of power couples without advanced degrees or urban occupations.




                                                                                                            17
        We apply the same regression analyses as above to investigate whether co-location effects can be

found for couples in which both spouses have occupations that are concentrated in large MSAs or both

spouses have advanced degrees (tables 4, 5a and 5b). There are 1778 observations in which at least one

spouse has an advanced degree. These include 257 observations in which both spouses have advanced

degrees, 986 observations in which only the husband has an advanced degree, and 535 observations in which

only the wife has an advanced degree. Likewise, there are 3493 observations in which at least one spouse

has an urban occupation, including 1740 observations in which both spouses have urban occupations, 4716 in

which only the husband has an urban occupation, and 1282 observations in which only the wife has an urban

occupation. We first include a measure of the urbanization of occupations – the percent of all individuals in

the occupation that reside in MSAs greater than 2 million.10 This variable is added as a continuous variable

(column E) and as a dichotomous variable (column F) that defines urban occupations as those where at least

40% of individuals in the occupation live in large MSAs. This cutoff was chosen to correspond roughly to

the proportion of all individuals living in large MSAs. In 1990, approximately 36% of all couples and 43%

of singles lived in large urban areas. Urban occupations then are those that are more than proportionately

located in large MSAs.11 We create categories to describe ‘urban’ and ‘part-urban’ couples by occupation in

the same way we describe power and part-power couples by education - controlling for couples in which

both spouses have urban occupations, where only the husband has an urban occupation and where only the

wife has an urban occupation. In columns G and H we add indicators for post-graduate college degrees,

again creating categories to describe the joint profile of the couple.

        We find few significant effects of urban occupation or advanced education in either the binary or the

multinomial equations. Those variables that are significant confirm the importance of the husband’s career

in migration. Couples in which only the husband is employed in an urban occupation are more likely to

migrate than couples in which neither has an urban occupation (table 4, column F). The multinomial logit

regression results (tables 5 and 5b) are difficult to interpret. Couples in which only the husband is employed

   The regression results are robust to alternative percentages used to define urban occupations.


                                                                                                                       18
in an urban occupation are more likely to migrate to a mid-size MSA compared to couples in which neither

spouse is employed in an urban occupation, while couples in which only the husband has an advanced degree

are more likely to migrate to small and large MSAs Thus even under a more stringent definition of who is

most affected by occupation specialization we find no evidence that co-location pressure affects migration

behavior. The coefficients for college education maintain statistical significance and have similar magnitude

when we control for the concentration of occupations in large urban areas. The stability of the college

education variables after controlling for occupation suggests that in addition to employment opportunities,

amenities and/or returns to education are pulling college graduates to large MSAs.12



5.      The Four Processes Underlying the Location Data

        The regression results presented above suggest that the co-location problem facing power couples

does not manifest itself through differences in their migration behavior. If co-location pressure lies behind

the concentration of power couples in large MSAs, it does not operate through couple migration. In this

section, we argue that not only is co-location pressure not affecting the migration of power couples, but the

migration of power couples is not likely to be important in affecting location patterns.

        The observed location trends of power couples may arise through differences by city size in power

couple migration, power couple formation - either through marriage or increased educational attainment--

and/or power couple dissolution (divorce rates).13 Using the PSID and Census data we examine these

dynamic processes.




12
   This suggestion depends on the assumption that individuals do not change occupations: the insignificance of the
urban occupation indicators may be caused by individuals changing occupations following migration so that their
occupation pre-migration is not indicative of their occupation post-migration.
13
   We ignore the dynamics of employment, although these are likely to differ by education and occupation. Basker
(2003) develops a model of job search and migration that highlights the distinction between highly educated
individuals, who tend to search first and then migrate, and less educated individuals, who tend to migrate without a job
and then search.


                                                                                                                    19
5.1     Migration

        The overall migration patterns of couples and unmarried individuals reported in table 6 are broadly

consistent with the predictions of human capital theory.14 Higher skilled individuals are more mobile than

lower skilled individuals, power couples are more likely to migrate than are low- and part-power couples,

and power singles are more likely to migrate than are low-power singles. The observed patterns are not

consistent with Mincer’s hypothesis that dual-career couples are less mobile than single-career couples.

        The PSID transition data suggest that the migration of power couples is not the primary explanation

for the increasing concentration of power couples in large MSAs – the migration patterns of power couples

are not substantially different from those of power singles or part-power couples in which the husband has a

college degree. There is, however, some evidence of a revealed preference for large MSAs among power

couples. The average rate of migration of power couples living in large MSAs is lower than the rates of

those living in medium and small MSAs, although the differences are not statistically significant. Among

migrants, power couples are more likely to migrate to medium and large MSAs than to small MSAs. These

trends, however, are not limited to power couples and may simply reflect a general preference for large urban

areas. For every group considered, migration rates of those in the large areas are lower than the rates of

those in small areas, and this difference is much larger, and statistically significant, for single power men and

women. An unmarried man or woman with a college degree is much more likely to migrate from a small

MSA than a power couple. Conditional on migration, single power men and single power women are also

more likely to migrate to large MSAs than small MSAs, as are part-power couples in which the husband has

a college degree. Low-power couples are more likely to migrate to smaller areas than larger and there is no

statistically significant difference among the destination choices of part-power couples in which the wife has

a college degree. The data suggest a revealed preference for large urban areas among college educated

singles and among all couples in which the husband is college educated. Again we see the need to

  Recent immigrants are under-represented in the PSID sample. However the location patterns observed in the Census--
those we are trying to explain--remain when immigrants are excluded from the Census sample.


                                                                                                                 20
distinguish between the two types of part-power couples: those in which the husband is college educated and

those in which the wife is college educated.



5.2     Education by City Size

        The proportion of power couples in large MSAs may have increased simply because individuals

living in large MSAs have a greater incentive to invest in human capital than those living in small MSAs.15

The wage premium that is earned by workers in large urban areas may be a compensating differential to

offset higher living costs and urban disamenities but must also be due in part to higher productivity of

workers in MSAs. Without higher productivity, it is difficult to explain why firms are willing to locate in

these high-wage areas. The causes of this higher productivity may lie in the ability of MSAs to attract more

able workers, or because MSAs create more productive workers by inducing human capital accumulation and

labor-market matching.    Glaeser and Maré (2001) investigate this question using a variety of data sources

and argue that the urban wage premium is due to a combination of wage-level effects and wage-growth

effects. They find that recent migrants to MSAs do experience real wage gains, but that the wage premium

is highest for long-term residents of MSAs. Thus many of the urban wage gains accrue over time as urban

workers accumulate more human capital and benefit from the better coordination of urban labor markets.

        Table 7, which shows the proportion of high school graduates without college degrees currently

enrolled in higher education, is consistent with this hypothesis. These data are from the integrated public use

samples (IPUMS) of the U.S. Census for 1980, 1990 and 2000. The IPUMS samples are 1-in-100 national

random samples of the U.S. population created by the Census Bureau as part of each decennial enumeration

(Ruggles and Sobeck, 1997).     The individual level records of the IPUMS samples include information on

age, location, marital status, education and current education enrolment. The samples also allow the linkage

of spousal records enabling us to determine the joint profile of married couples.          With a few minor

exceptions, the probability of being enrolled in education increases with population size for all groups in

15
   Glaeser (1999) suggests that urban density may increase interactions with highly skilled role models and
facilitate coordination, thus increasing the demand for human capital.



                                                                                                            21
each year.16 For example in 1990, among married men with high-school diplomas, 6.3% of those living in

small MSAs were enrolled in credit courses compared to 9.0% of those living in the largest MSAs, those

with populations over five million.

         The differences across city size indicate that the formation of power couples and power singles

through educational attainment is more likely in larger MSAs than in smaller MSAs. Holding marriage and

migration constant, an increasing concentration of power couples in large MSAs would occur if the

proportion of married individuals in large MSAs who are enrolled in credit education is higher than the

proportion of married individuals in smaller areas enrolled in credit education. For both married men and

married women, the gap in enrollment rates between the large and small MSAs grew or remained constant

between 1980 and 1990, and then fell between 1990 and 2000.



5.3      Marriage and Divorce by City Size

         The relationship between city size and marriage is not straightforward. Edlund (2005) suggests that

since large cities attract highly skilled individuals they also attract individuals (i.e., women) who seek to

marry highly skilled individuals. Drewianka (2003) argues that marriage rates are affected not by the size of

the city itself, but by the percentage of the adult population that is single. The effect is two-fold. With a

relatively large single population, the probability of meeting a potential spouse whose quality exceeds a

specified level in a given period of time is higher because people meet potential matches at a faster rate. But

the large pool of potential matches also causes marriage market participants to increase their reservation

quality level. Drewianka’s empirical results suggest that the reservation quality effect dominates such that a

10% increase in the single population lowers the hazard rate for entering marriage between 7% and 10%.

Gould and Paserman (2003) find a strong negative relationship between women’s marriage rates and the

inequality of male wages within an urban area. They argue that higher levels of male wage inequality can

explain 25% of the decline in marriage rates between 1970 and 1990. Taken together, these papers suggest a

finding similar to that of Robst and McGoldrick (1996) on the relationship between city size and labor

market success: it is not the size of the market that is important, but its composition.

        The human capital model of migration suggests a link between migration, city size, and marital

instability. Increased labor force attachment of wives makes it more likely that the location preferences of

spouses will differ which increases marital instability. This suggests two hypotheses. First, since power

couples are more likely to experience co-location problems, they may be more likely to experience marital

instability than part-power and low-power couples. Second, since co-location problems are less likely to

occur in large labor markets, power couples living in small cities may have more marital breakups than those

living in larger cities. Co-location problems may affect the location patterns observable in census data by

increasing the relative stability of marriages in larger employment markets rather than by inducing migration.

        Mincer (1978) notes that expectations of marital instability reduce the incentives for either spouse to

become a tied-mover or tied-stayer, further amplifying marital instability. If we allow for expectations of

marital instability, modeling migration as a response to maximizing net family benefits may be less

satisfactory than modeling migration as a potentially inefficient bargaining solution to the co-location

problem; these issues are more fully explored in Lundberg and Pollak (2003).

        The results reported in table 8 suggest that the formation of power and part-power couples through

marriage is more likely to occur in large urban areas compared to smaller urban areas. Table 8 shows the

probability that an unmarried individual in year one will be married in year two, conditional on the size of

the year two location.17 The probability of marriage decreases by city size for low-power singles, but there is

no statistically significant difference in marriage rates among power singles of either sex. That is, power

singles are just as likely to marry if they live in a large MSA or a small MSA, but low-power singles are

more likely to marry in a small MSA. The patterns of assortative mating also suggest that power couples are

more likely to be created in large MSAs than in small MSAs. While there is no clear differences in

assortative mating patterns for women by city size, there is a more distinct relationship between assortative

17
   These are higher than might be expected for the total population because individuals in the sample must have been the
head or spouse of a household at some point during the survey years, but this should not bias the comparison across city
size.


                                                                                                                     23
mating patterns and city size for men: college educated men living in small and midsize MSAs are as likely

to marry a college educated spouse as a non-college educated spouse, i.e., those that marry are equally likely

to create a part-power couple as a power couple. College educated men living in large MSAs, however, are

more likely to marry college educated women than non-college educated women, i.e., conditional on

marrying, the probability of creating a power couple from that marriage is greater than 50%.

        Finally, we consider the probability that a couple will divorce by city size. While the confidence

intervals on these data are too large to make any definitive statements, the differences in the means shown in

table 9 suggest that power couples are less likely to divorce than low-power couples. Furthermore, low-

power couples are more likely to divorce if they live in large metropolitan areas than in small MSAs,

whereas power couples are more likely to divorce if they live in a small city. These estimates, while not

precise, suggest that the stability of power couple marriages may be higher in large MSAs.



6.      The Decline in Power Couple Concentration in 2000

        Finally, we extend the time span of the census-based location analysis of Costa and Khan by using

data from the 2000 census, data unavailable to Costa and Kahn. Table 10 shows the proportions of power,

part-power and low-power couples living in large MSAs in each of the four census years (1970, 1980, 1990,

2000), using the 1990 MSA definitions for all years.

        Since our regression results clearly show that the gender of the college-educated spouse matters for

migration behavior, we separate part-power couples by which spouse holds a college degree. The data show

that the proportions of couples living in large MSAs are lower when the wife is more highly educated than

when the husband is more highly educated. The data also show that between 1970 and 1990, the proportion

of power couples living in large MSAs increased dramatically, as noted by Costa and Kahn. However, the

rising trend in concentration did not continue to 2000. Between 1990 and 2000 the proportion of power

couples and part-power couples living in large MSAs declined, while the proportion of low-power couples

living in large MSAs increased.




                                                                                                           24
        Can either of the two hypotheses put forth to explain the rising concentration of power couples in

large MSAs also explain the fall? Trends in women’s labor supply did not reverse during this decade: labor

force participation of married women remained steady between 1990 and 2000 and the proportion of women

in specialized professional occupations increased during the decade.18 This suggests that the co-location

pressure facing power couples did not weaken over this decade. But neither do we see evidence of a

weakening of the relative attractiveness of large MSAs for the college educated. The fall in the proportion of

power couples living in large MSAs was not mimicked in the category of power singles. and the proportions

of both college educated single men and college educated single women living in large MSAs increased

modestly between 1990 and 2000 (from 55.1 to 55.5 and from 54.2 to 54.6, respectively).



7.      Conclusion

        Using census data, Costa and Kahn (2000) show that between 1970 and 1990 couples in

which both spouses were college graduates ("power couples") were increasingly likely to be located

in the largest metropolitan areas. Costa and Kahn argued that these changes in location patterns

were driven by the migration of power couples trying to solve their co-location problem -- a

plausible-sounding hypothesis to anyone familiar with academic job markets.

        In this paper we investigate the dynamic processes underlying the changes in location

patterns found by Costa and Kahn. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID),

we find that power couples are not more likely to migrate to the largest metropolitan areas and are

no less likely than other couples to migrate from such areas once they are there. The dynamic

processes that appear to contribute most to the observed trends in location patterns include: (i) the

18
  The labor force participation rate of married women, aged 23-55 increased from 43.5% in 1970 to 58.0% in
1980, 70.8% in 1990, and 70.9% in 2000. The labor force participation rates for most subgroups - married
women with and without young children, married women with and without college education – follow the same
pattern, with a slight decline in the LFP rates between 1990 and 2000 for most groups (less than 1 percentage
point fall). Calculations by authors using the census integrated public use census samples (Ruggles and Sobeck
1997).



                                                                                                                 25
migration of power singles to large metropolitan areas, (ii) differences in rates of marriage and

divorce of men and women with and without college degrees in cities of various sizes, (iii) and

differences in the likelihood that individuals acquire additional education in cities of various sizes.

The observed trends in location patterns are primarily due to differences in the rates at which power

couples form and dissolve in cities of various sizes rather than to the migration of power couples to

the largest metropolitan areas.

       Our analysis of the PSID migration data hinges on our analysis of the behavior of part-

power couples. Unlike Costa and Kahn, who group couples by the number of spouses with a

college degree -- power, part-power, and low-power couples -- we decompose part-power couples

into two subcategories: those in which only the husband has a college degree and those in which

only the wife has a college degree. We find that couple migration patterns are determined by the

husband's education profile, not by the couple's joint education profile. The migration patterns of

couples in which both spouses have college degrees look like those of part-power couples in which

only the husband has a college degree. The migration patterns of part-power couples in which only

the wife has a college degree look like those of low-power couples.

       Our conclusion that trends in location patterns are not generated by power couples migrating

to solve their co-location problem is strengthened by data from the 2000 census. The 2000 census

shows a decline in power couple concentration between 1990 and 2000 -- a decline that is difficult

to reconcile with the co-location hypothesis.

       The plausible-sounding hypothesis based on academic job markets is misleading because the

typical power couple is not one PhD married to another PhD, but a high school teacher married to a

nurse. These more typical power couples do not need to locate in New York or Los Angeles to




                                                                                                    26
solve their co-location problem. But even when we look at super-power couples we find no support

for the co-location hypothesis.

Annual migration rates from 1970 to 1996 estimated from PSID sample. The estimates assume that the migration rates for each category remain
constant for 1970-1996, but when we split the PSID sample into the three decades, we find no significant differences in the migration rates of power
couples between the 1970s and 1980s nor between the 1970s and 1990s. Couples include those who are observed married or cohabiting in year one
and year two. Singles are also limited to those who did not change marital status during the year. Large metropolitan areas are those with at least 2M
population, midsize metropolitan areas have populations between 250,000 to 2M, smaller metropolitan areas and counties that are not contained in a
metropolitan area are included in the final category. Power couples are those in which both spouses have completed at least four years of college or
hold college degrees, part-power couples include only one spouse with a college education, low-power couples are those in which neither spouse has
a college degree. Couples are limited to those in which the wife was 23 to 37 years of age and the husband was 25 to 39 years of age. Singles fall
into the same age categories.

Power couples are those in which both spouses have completed at least four years of college or hold college degrees, part-power couples
include those couples in which only one spouse has completed at least four years of college or holds a college degree, low-power couples are
those in which neither spouse has four years of college or a college degree. Couples are limited to legally married couples residing in the
same household. For married couples, the sample is limited to those in which the wife was 23 to 37 years of age and the husband was 25 to
39 years of age. Singles fall into the same age categories. Calculations by authors using the census integrated public use census samples
(Ruggles and Sobeck 1997).
