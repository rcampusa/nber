The Case for Open-Market Purchases in a Liquidity Trap

                                           ABSTRACT

Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds
at a zero short-term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective for achieving
macroeconomic stabilization goals. We show that even were this the case, there remains a powerful
argument for large-scale open market operations as a fiscal policy tool. As we also demonstrate,
however, this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will be beneficial for stabilization
as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired in a liquidity trap for some time. Thus,
the microeconomic fiscal benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with
standard macroeconomic objectives. Motivated by Japan's recent economic experience, we use a
dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of open-market operations for an
economy in Japan's predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a substantial welfare improvement
through large open-market purchases of domestic government debt.

I. Introduction

Japan’s efforts to stimulate its economy over the past decade have led to apparent

macroeconomic policy paralysis, with short-term nominal interest rates at their floor of zero and

fiscal expansion immobilized by fears of increasing an already-huge public debt.

        Were short nominal interest rates positive, unanticipated open-market purchases of

government debt would have the dual benefits of offsetting deflation and reducing the real value

of yen-denominated public obligations. Prevalent thinking about liquidity traps, however—

whether based on the IS-LM model or on more sophisticated dynamic models such as that of

Krugman (1998)—suggests that the perfect substitutability of money and bonds at a zero short-

term nominal interest rate renders open-market operations ineffective as a stabilization tool.1

        Even in this circumstance, there remains a powerful argument for large-scale open

market operations as a fiscal policy tool. To the extent that long-term interest rates are positive

now or short-term interest rates are expected to be positive at some point in the future, trading

money for interest-bearing public debt reduces future debt-service requirements and hence the

distortions of the requisite taxes. Thus, particularly for an economy in Japan’s weakening fiscal

position, large-scale open-market operations are an attractive policy, even if these operations are

perceived to be totally ineffective at influencing current prices or output.

        Yet, our analysis shows that this same reasoning implies that open-market operations will

be beneficial as a stabilization tool as well, even when the economy is expected to remain mired

in a liquidity trap for some time. That is, under the same conditions on interest rates that make


1
  King (1999), however, speculates on other channels through which monetary policy might affect the economy
even when short-term bond rates are zero. The mechanism we emphasize below is distinct from those that King
reviews. In addition, our mechanism does not rely on Bernanke’s (2000) “arbitrage” argument for monetary policy
effectiveness.



                                                       1
open-market operations attractive for fiscal purposes, a monetary expansion will affect prices

and, in the absence of fully flexible prices, output as well. Thus, the microeconomic fiscal

benefits of open-market operations in a liquidity trap go hand in hand with standard

macroeconomic objectives.2

         Our analysis shows that beneficial macroeconomic policies need not accelerate an

economy’s escape from a liquidity trap. Indeed, zero nominal interest rates per se need not be a

problem for policy. Problems can stem, however, from the shocks that drive nominal interest

rates to zero, and it is to those shocks that policymakers may wish to respond.

         In this paper we use a dynamic general-equilibrium model to assess the welfare impact of

open-market operations for an economy in Japan’s predicament. We argue Japan can achieve a

substantial welfare improvement through large open-market purchases of debt. The Bank of

Japan has indeed been carrying out such operations through its policy of “quantitative easing,” a

policy it has accelerated recently, but our analysis suggests that Japanese policymakers should

not be timid about going much further in this direction.3

         In a flexible-price model with monopolistic competition and distorting taxes, we show

that even though Japan currently has zero short-term interest rates, an open-market purchase can

counteract deflationary price tendencies. In this setting with flexible prices, the policy will

improve welfare by reducing the real value of public debt and hence the excess burden of future

taxes. Two preconditions must hold for these effects to be possible. First, long-term nominal

interest rates must be positive at some horizon (a condition that does hold in Japan today).


2
  There is now a large modern literature analyzing alternative strategies for achieving monetary stimulus in a
liquidity trap. See Svensson (2001) and Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) for discussion and references.
3
  See Shirakawa (2002) for a discussion of quantitative easing in Japan. Bank of Japan operations that purchase
private equities, aside from the political problems involved, yield much more uncertain fiscal benefits
(corresponding to the riskier return on the equities).



                                                          2
Second, the central bank must be able to carry out credibly permanent increases in the level (not

growth rate) of the money supply, increases that can, but need not, be effected immediately. In

Krugman’s (1998) account, monetary policy is powerless precisely because of an assumption

that the central bank cannot commit itself not to reverse one-off increases in the money supply.

Future expected money supply levels are constant because the central bank is assumed unwilling

to tolerate any permanent rise in the price level.4 Within our dynamic model, however,

permanent open-market purchases can yield substantial welfare benefits with only mild

inflationary consequences, and we argue accordingly that the credibility problem Krugman

assumes is implausible as a total brake on policy effectiveness.

           We also analyze a model with staggered nominal price setting in which anticipated

deflation has negative welfare effects. In this setting too, an unanticipated open-market purchase

is expansionary. While the open-market purchase again has the advantage of devaluing

government debt, it has an additional positive welfare effect by causing a Keynesian temporary

output increase. There are further welfare impacts, moreover, due to the effects of unexpected

and expected inflation on relative price dispersion, but these are unlikely to offset the primary

gains.

           The final goal of the paper is to simulate numerically the benefits of open-market

expansion. We find that, for an economy with Japan’s tax rates and public debt to GDP ratio,

open-market purchases of government debt yield large welfare benefits. Sizable benefits can be

reaped, as we have noted, even when the accompanying inflationary impact is small.

    Eggertsson and Woodford (2003) restate this result in a more detailed dynamic model.



                                                          3
II. The Term Structure of Interest Rates in Japan

A key assumption in the model we develop below is that short-term nominal interest rates,

despite being zero today, are expected to be positive at some date (and in some state of nature) in

the future. In other words, market participants see at least some chance that the economy will

eventually escape from the liquidity trap. This assumption does not seem overly strong; on the

contrary, the assumption of a fully permanent liquidity trap is, on its face, quite implausible. We

nonetheless offer a more formal argument, based on the current term structure of interest rates in

Japan, to show that our assumption about nominal interest-rate expectations is satisfied for that

economy.

       Figure 1 shows the evolution of Japan’s term structure of interest rates since 1997. Short-

term nominal rates are effectively at zero (very slightly positive, but just by enough to cover

transaction costs). On the other hand, further out in the term structure—at maturities greater than

a year—yields to maturity are higher, with that on the 20-year government bond still around 1

percent per annum.

       A simple expectations theory of the term structure would, of course, imply some market

expectation of positive future short-term interest rates: otherwise, the entire term structure would

be flat at zero rather than upwardly sloped. The expectations theory, however, is highly

questionable both on theoretical and empirical grounds. Fortunately we do not need to rely on it.

There are other reasons for concluding that the term structure in Figure 1 is inconsistent with the

hypothesis of a permanent (with probability 1) liquidity trap. None of the standard explanations

for an upward-sloping term structure is plausible in the absence of positive expected future short-

term nominal interest rates.




                                                 4
           Consider first the possibility of conventional risk premia due to investor risk aversion. A

major source of uncertainty in bonds’ returns, however, is the future behavior of short-term

interest rates. If those rates are at zero, they cannot fall. If investors simultaneously cannot

envision an eventuality in which short-term rates might rise, then investors no longer consider

short-term rates to be random at all. Under that circumstance, it would be impossible to generate

risk premia that might justify the term differentials shown in Figure 1. The relative price of

present and all future money payments is fixed at unity, so that money is a perfect substitute for

bonds of any maturity.5

           Since the yields in Figure 1 are government bond yields, what about the possibility of

government default as an explanation for relatively high long-term interest rates? That possibility

might seem especially compelling in view of Japan’s current high debt-GDP ratio, the likely

fiscal costs of financial-sector restructuring, and the alarming forecasts for budgetary

developments down the road as the population ages.6 A moment’s reflection shows that this is

not a plausible explanation for positive long-term rates in a world where short-term rates will

never rise above zero. The reason is that, in the latter world, the government can trivially finance

all its obligations by printing money. Money creation of such a magnitude could eventually

ignite inflation, of course; but in that case, the hypothesis of short-term nominal interest rates

frozen at zero would be contradicted.

           Consider, finally, liquidity effects. With short-term nominal interest rates pegged at zero,

marketable debt instruments of different maturities all become equivalent to money, as we have



5
 Keynes argued that risk premia would keep long-term rates positive even when short-term rates were zero because
at low interest rates, bond-prices are volatile and hence bonds must yield a higher excess return in equilibrium (King
1999, p. 39). Keynes’s argument presupposes that markets expect a possible future exit from the liquidity trap.

    See, for example, Kashyap (2002) and Dekle (2002).

noted. So again, one cannot rationalize term premia of the sort shown in Figure 1 purely as a

liquidity effect.

         We conclude that the only plausible explanation for the term structure shown in Figure 1

is that investors attach some positive probability to Japan’s some day having positive nominal

short-term interest rates. That circumstance, as we now show, is enough to give monetary policy

considerable power to enhance economic welfare.


III. Setup of the Model

We consider a model in which the representative household maximizes lifetime utility of

consumption (Ct) and labor (Lt) over dates t starting at t = 0,


        ∞
            t    
U 0 = ∑  ∏ β s  U (Ct , Lt ) = β 0U (C0 , L0 ) + β 0 β1U (C1 , L1 ) + β 0 β1 ⋅ ⋅ ⋅ β tU (Ct , Lt ) ,
      t =0  s =0 


where βs is the pure discount factor between the end of period s − 1 and the end of period s. (We

                                                                                  t
assume throughout that β < 1 in the long run, so that the product                ∏β
                                                                                 s =0
                                                                                        s   converges to 0 as t →


∞.) We use the dating conventions that consumption and labor occur at the end of the period,

assets are indexed by their values at the beginning of the period, and prices are indexed by the

end of the period. Throughout most of the analysis, and where not otherwise specified, we use a

simplified version of the utility function,


U (C t , Lt ) = log(C t ) − k t Lt .                                                                                (1)


Formally, the parameter k represents the disutility of labor, so that changes in k from one period

to the next are taste shocks. However, as we will model production as a function of labor alone,


                                                           6
variations in k will have the same impact as productivity shocks, altering the social cost of

transforming forgone leisure into consumption.

          There is no capital in the model, so the household holds its financial wealth exclusively in

the form of money and interest-bearing government bonds. The household’s real wealth at the

beginning of period t (before payment of interest) is the sum of its holdings of debt (B) and

money (M), divided by the contemporaneous price level (P):


       Bt + M t
Vt =            .
         Pt −1


Wealth at the beginning of period t+1 is


          Bt (1 + it ) M t π t wt Lt
Vt +1 =               +    +    +    − Tt − C t ,
              Pt        Pt   Pt   Pt


where it is the nominal interest rate between periods t−1 and t, and wt, πt, Tt, and Ct are,

respectively, the nominal and wage rate, nominal profits, real taxes and real consumption in

period t. Combining these two equations and defining the real interest rate by

rt ≡ (1 + it )/(Pt /Pt−1) −1 yields an expression for the evolution of household wealth:


                         it M t π t wt Lt
Vt +1 = Vt (1 + rt ) −         +    +     − Tt − Ct .
                            Pt   Pt   Pt


          To model money demand, we assume that households face a cash-in-advance constraint,

needing to hold money in period t that is sufficient to purchase goods at the end of period t.

Taxes are collected in the form of consumption taxes, and households are also required to hold




                                                        7
cash in order to pay the taxes on their consumption purchases. If τt is the consumption tax rate at

date t, the cash-in-advance constraint,


Mt ≥ (1+τt)PtCt,                                                                                      (2)


is binding unless the nominal interest rate is zero, so that it is always the case that

itMt=it(1+τt)PtCt. Using this fact, we can rewrite the evolution of wealth as


                         πt       wt Lt
Vt +1 = Vt (1 + rt ) +        +         − Tt − (1 + it + τ t it )C t .
                         Pt        Pt


Because tax collections are given by Tt = τtCt, household wealth evolves as


                         πt       wt Lt
Vt +1 = Vt (1 + rt ) +        +         − (1 + τ t )(1 + it )Ct .
                         Pt        Pt


Solved forward with the transversality condition imposed, this difference equation yields the

lifetime budget constraint of the household:


       ∞
           t                                     π   wL 
V0 ≥ ∑  ∏ (1 + rs ) −1  (1 + τ t )(1 + i t )C t − t − t t  .
     t =0  s =0                                  Pt   Pt 


         Maximizing utility subject to this budget constraint results in first-order conditions for

consumption and labor at each date. Combining the conditions for consumption and labor at date

t yields a solution for household consumption at date t,


                    wt
Ct =                               ,                                                                  (3)
       k t (1 + i t )(1 + τ t ) Pt




                                                                    8
in which an increase in the labor-disutility parameter, k, has the same impact as a decline in the

real wage, discouraging work, consumption, and hence output.

          Combining conditions for consumption at successive dates t and t+1 yield the Euler

equation,


C t +1                           Pt (1 + τ t )(1 + it )                          P (1 + τ t )
       = β t +1 (1 + it +1 )                                 = β t +1 (1 + it ) t                  .   (4)
Ct                           Pt +1 (1 + τ t +1 )(1 + it +1 )                   Pt +1 (1 + τ t +1 )


Note that the cash-in-advance constraint has the effect of replacing the interest rate between

dates t and t+1 with the preceding period’s interest rate.

          We assume that consumption at each date is a composite good. A continuum of

producers supplies the individual consumption goods under conditions of market power. We

model nominal price stickiness by postulating that each producer must set a nominal price that is

maintained over two periods. That is, a posted price is good for the period in which it is set and

the following period, with all market demand supplied at that price (as long as price exceeds

marginal cost). Price setting is staggered across the two classes of goods. Half of the goods,

class 1, have their prices set in odd-numbered periods, while the other half, class 2, have their

prices set in even periods. Goods within each type enter the utility function symmetrically, and

all goods are produced subject to the simple production function Y = L. Letting cti(z) be the

type-z good in class i at date t, the relationship between the composite consumption good and

underlying individual commodity consumption is:


                                                                                       ρ

IV. Effects of Monetary Policy when Short-Term Nominal Interest Rates are
    Zero: The Flexible-Price Case

It is clearest to start by analyzing open-market operations under the temporary assumption that

nominal goods prices are perfectly flexible, that is, are set for one period only. In that case, even

though there are two sectors of the economy, monetary shocks have symmetric effects on the

sectors’ outputs, employments, and prices, and do not drive relative intersectoral prices away

from unity.

           Initially the cash-in-advance constraint (2) does not bind and the nominal interest rate i =

0, which can occur because expected money growth rates are low (and perhaps even negative)

relative to the subjective discount rates reflected in the preference parameters βs. As per our

discussion above, however, we assume that some long-term interest rate is positive (as is

currently true in Japan), so that on at least one date T in the future, iT > 0. (Perhaps on that date,

consumers become more impatient or the rate of money-supply growth rises.) We show that

under flexible prices, monetary policy can affect the price level before date T, notwithstanding

the economy’s zero nominal interest rate. That is, any prospect of future nominal interest rates

above zero, no matter how remote, implies that the economy cannot be in a monetary-policy trap




                                                       10
beforehand. Indeed it suffices, once can show, that there be some future state of nature, occurring

with any positive probability, in which iT > 0.

         Start with the Euler equation (4) for date t, expressed in terms of nominal wages rather

than prices based on the conditions (3) for the consumption-labor decisions at dates t and t+1.

The result has the very simple form of an “inverse wage Euler equation,”

       = (1 + i t +1 ) β t +1 t .                                                                              (5)
k t +1                       kt


         We have assumed, however, that the economy is in a liquidity trap and the interest rate is

zero from the present date, 0, through period T−1. At date T, the interest rate is positive and the

cash-in-advance constraint is binding. To be concrete we will also assume that short-term the

nominal interest rate also remains positive for all dates after T, but only some inessential details

of our argument change if that is not the case. Under these assumptions, from (5), the wage rate

for each date t < T−1 obeys the expression


wt   1 wt +1
   =              .                                                                                            (6)
k t β t +1 k t +1


From (6), we observe that the wages (and prices) rise, fall or remain constant during the zero-

                                                            k t +1
interest regime according to whether the term β t +1               is greater than, less than or equal to 1.
                                                             kt

         For each period t > T−1, we have, from the original Euler equation (4) and the cash-in-

advance constraint, (2),


M t +1                                   M t +1
       = β t +1 (1 + it ) ⇒ (1 + it ) =            .                                                           (7)
Mt                                      M t β t +1


                                                       11
From (5) and (6), the wage evolves from date T onward according to


wt   β M t +1 wt −1
   = t                .                                                                                        (8)
k t β t +1 M t k t −1


Thus, once we have an expression for wT-1, (7) and (8) provide us with the entire path of wage

rates both before date T−1 and after T−1.

        To solve for wT-1, write the Euler equation (3) for dates T−1 and T, substituting the cash-

in-advance constraint (2) at T and the labor-consumption condition (3) at T−1, to obtain

    MT                        w      M
               = β T , and so, T −1 = T . As a result, the general solution for the path of wages is:
wT −1 / k T −1                k T −1 βT


wt  T −1 −1  M T
   =  ∏ βs       ,               t ≤ T−1,                                                                   (9a)
k t  s =t +1  βT


wt M t +1
   =        ,                      t ≥ T−1.                                                                   (9b)
kt   β t +1


(Note that these two expressions are the same for t = T−1.)

        We can now see how a permanent step increase ∆M0 in the money supply’s level on date

0 will affect the economy. Let’s assume that the increase in the money supply on date 0 does not

change any future monetary growth rates Mt+1/Mt, t ≥ 0. In that case, MT rises by the factor 1 +

∆M0/M0 (as do all subsequent money-supply levels).7



7
  As will be discussed below, the date upon which the nominal interest rate becomes positive does not change as a
result of this policy.



                                                        12
          Equation (9) shows that, notwithstanding zero nominal interest rates prior to date T, all

future nominal wage rates, including those for dates 0 through T−1, will be scaled by the factor

1+∆M0/M0. As can be shown from the more general analysis of price-setting behavior given

below, with perfectly flexible product prices, monopolists charge a fixed percentage markup over

the wage, so that Pt = ρwt/(ρ − 1). Therefore, the current and all future price levels rise by the

same percentage as do wages. During a period of zero short-term nominal interest rates, the

price level’s path is governed by the money stock expected for the first date on which interest

rates turn positive.

          The intuition is disarmingly simple. On the first day the short-term interest rate turns

positive, the money stock determines the price level in the conventional way. As long as the

interest rate is zero, however, prices move toward that conventionally determined value at a rate

governed by consumers’ rate of time preference. By raising the money stock’s level

permanently today, the monetary authority can shift upward the date T terminal condition on the

price level. That action necessarily also shifts upward the entire time profile of prices prior to

date T.

          The irrelevance of the current money supply to the economy’s equilibrium, given money

supplies on future positive-interest-rate dates, is the essence of the liquidity trap. However, the

central bank can affect today’s equilibrium by changing expectations of future money supplies.

In our analysis, the central bank changes those expectations simply by changing the money

stock’s level immediately and allowing “base drift.”

          Our infinite-horizon model is in essence just a dynamic extension of Krugman’s (1998).

Krugman, however, assumes a liquidity trap in the initial period of his model, with an exit form

the liquidity trap in the second period and all relevant economic variables stationary thereafter.



                                                   13
In our model, however, the liquidity trap can be long-lasting, even indefinitely so in some states

of the world. If markets expect the possibility of positive interest rates at any point in the future,

however, an immediate action—increasing the date 0 money supply while making no

corresponding reduction in future money supply levels—will immediately lift prices.

       Of course, one reason that markets might expect positive short-term interest rates in the

future would be a government commitment to higher monetary growth rates then. Krugman

(1998) and others have argued that such a commitment might be problematic. There are other

mechanisms, however, that could produce zero interest rates now, coupled with expectations of

future positive interest rates: predictable shifts in productivity growth, predictable shifts in time

preference, or (outside the scope of the present model) demographic changes. To consider two

concrete examples that might apply to Japan’s current circumstances, an aging baby boom cohort

with life-cycle savings behavior could induce a very high short-run saving rate that, in the

context of our representative-agent model, would translate into a very low discount rate and a

very high value for the discount factor, β. This would be particularly true if government

promises of old-age pensions were viewed with some skepticism. A similar effect would occur

if substantial pessimism or higher risk perceptions induced a rise in precautionary saving.

         In general, it is difficult to believe that economic actors would not attach some positive

probability to the event of positive interest rates on some, perhaps distant, future date. Nor is it

plausible (as we ague in greater detail below) that they would necessarily expect any monetary

expansion to be reversed with probability 1. These conditions would be enough to render current

monetary expansion effective, as a stochastic extension of our model shows.

       It is worth noting that, although we have modeled a closed economy, extension to the

open case is easy. Under a zero domestic nominal interest rate, and with a positive nominal




                                                  14
interest rate abroad, the currency would appreciate over time so as to preserve uncovered interest

parity. Since that appreciation would exactly offset the difference between domestic and foreign

price inflation, relative international prices would not change.8


V. Welfare Analysis of an Open-Market Purchase of Government Bonds
   under Flexible Prices

Consider the impact on welfare of an open-market operation, as measured by a policy index ξ.

Given the expression for household utility, we have the general expression


dU 0     ∞
             t                 1 dC t     ∞
                                                t                     1                   1 dC t
     = ∑  ∏ β s (1 − k t C t )        = ∑  ∏ β s 1 −                                          ,               (10)
 dξ    t =0  s =0              C t dξ   t =0  s =0    (1 + i t )(1 + τ t )( Pt / wt )  C t dξ


which makes use of the fact that, with flexible prices, the aggregate consumption index Ct equals

the aggregate labor input, Lt.9 Note that this derivative will vanish if there is no seigniorage

(i = 0), no taxes (τ = 0), and no producer mark-ups (P/w = 1): with no distortions present, the

allocation is Pareto optimal and any perturbation has no first-order welfare impact. More

generally, all of these distortions will be positive and hence cumulative, and any policy that

increases consumption will increase welfare.

         Let us assume for simplicity that the tax rate τ is always set so as to be constant over

time. If we continue to assume that the experiment ξ holds Mt+1/Mt fixed in the future, then all of

the effects on utility will occur through the tax rate τ . Using expression (3), we obtain10:

  The Japanese yen’s longstanding secular appreciation process seems to have stopped despite the zero short-term
interest rate and the consequent apparent excess return on non-yen currencies. This pattern is difficult to rationalize
in a nonstochastic model. Goyal and McKinnon (2003) argue that Japanese investors attach a substantial risk
premium to dollar assets, and that this explains the current international configuration of exchange rates and nominal
interest rates.
9
  When producer prices are equal for all goods z in sector i (= 1, 2), as is true throughout our analysis, the labor input
for sector i equals that sector’s sub-index, e.g., Lti = Cti. Thus, aggregate labor input Lt = Lt1 + Lt2 = Ct1 + Ct2, while
the aggregate consumption index is Ct = 2(Ct1Ct2)1/2. With flexible prices, Ct1 = Ct2 and hence Ct = Lt.

           We can also express the change in utility in dollars (or yen). Starting again with

condition (10), use the first-order condition for consumption at each date t,

     λ    ∞
               t                                               dC

     P−1 t =0  s =0                                            dξ


Because λ is the marginal utility of real wealth at date 0, λ/P-1 is the marginal utility of nominal

wealth at date 0 (remember that real wealth at date 0 is obtained by deflating nominal wealth by

P-1). Thus we can divide both sides by λ/P-1 to get the dollar value, at date 0, of the open market

operation, say ∆,

   This expression can be simplified further if we assume that the discount factor is constant at some value, say β0,
through period T, and constant at some different value, β1, from period T+1 onward, and the net money growth rate
is constant from T onward at some rate µ - 1. For β0 < 1 (a comparable expression applies for β0 > 1), the simplified
expression is:

which is a standard result that marginal deadweight loss equals the product of the wedge (due to

taxes, seigniorage and noncompetitive producer mark ups) times the changes in the distorted

quantity (i.e., in vector notation, t′∆X).

           For the case we have considered thus far, of flexible prices, Mt+1/Mt fixed in the future,

                                              dC t        d ln(1 + τ )
and a constant tax rate τ, we have                 = −C t              , so

The summation in (12) equals the present value of revenue, from taxes and seigniorage, plus

monopoly profits, so the dollar value of the welfare effect equals that total times minus the

percentage change in (1+τ). This expression can be further evaluated using the expression for τ

derived in Equation (A1) in the Appendix.11

           Expressions (11) and (12) provide a convenient framework for considering the impact of

alternative preference assumptions on the magnitude of estimated welfare gains. One can

generalize the preferences assumed thus far, based on expression (1) for within-period utility, to


                           −1     1

in which the parameter γ, equal to the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption,

may take on values other than 1 (the logarithmic case). For this more general specification of

utility, the analysis thus far goes through with minor modifications, notably that the relationship

between consumption and labor at date t now follows the more general rule


                                        γ
                     wt               

        k t (1 + i t )(1 + τ t ) Pt    


Expression (11) is not affected by this change in assumption, but using (3′) rather than (3) to

simplify leads to a modified version of expression (12),


            d ln(1 + τ ) ∞  t                    
∆ = −γ                  ∑      ∏ (1 + i s ) −1 ((1 + τ )(1 + it ) Pt − wt )C t .                              (12′)
                dξ       t =0  s =0              


We see from (12′) that the welfare change is scaled by the intertemporal consumption elasticity,

so that, as one would expect, less sensitive preferences would lead to lower estimates of the

welfare change.12 This result should be kept in mind below as we discuss the magnitude of

potential welfare gains from policy changes.


VI. The Sticky-Price Case

Continuing to assume that wages are flexible, let us drop the temporary assumption that prices

are flexible and consider staggered two-period setting of nominal product prices. From the

assumption of profit maximization by producers and the household’s Euler equation, we obtain

the following expression for the price index for class-i goods, whose price is reset in period t:

     A full analysis of the impact of changes in γ would also need to account for differences in the induced change in τ.

Thus, the overall price level in period t is:

Note that this price level expression holds when wages, taxes and interest rates equal the values

assumed by producers when prices are set. If we consider an unanticipated policy change at date

t, then the prices set in period t-1 will not obey the above expression for Pti, ex post.

          If the interest rate, tax rate, wage inflation rate, and discount factor are all constant over

time, then the expression for Pt simplifies to


                  ρ
Pt = wt                      (1 + βµ )1 / 2 (µ −1 + β )1 / 2 ,
          ( ρ − 1)(1 + β )


where µ is 1 plus the inflation rate. From this expression, it can be shown that the mark-up,

Pt/wt, is a decreasing function of µ for µβ < 1 and an increasing function for µβ > 1; that is, the

mark-up is decreasing with inflation until the rate of inflation equals the pure rate of time

preference. Since welfare is inversely related to the markup, this is therefore a model in which

even anticipated deflation has welfare costs, and anticipated inflation has some beneficial




                                                                  19
welfare effects for sufficiently small inflation rates, consistent with the conjecture of Akerlof,

Dickens, and Perry (1996).13

         A major difference now is that it is no longer true that L = C. In essence, relative-price

distortion between the two price-staggering sectors will lower the consumption index C below

the cost of production L = C1 + C2 whenever the prices charged by the sectors are not equal. So

we must calculate aggregate labor supply as the sum of supplies to the two sectors of the

economy, which still equal their respective consumption sub-aggregates.

         Our goal is to evaluate how lifetime utility

is affected by an open market purchase of government bonds. As noted above, in the disutility of

labor term we can no longer assert that L = C because, with sticky prices, there will generally be

asymmetric labor supply to the two sectors of the economy. Since, however,

  See Wolman (2001) for another model with this property, and Woodford (2003) for a general treatment of
inflation and welfare. Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe (2002) analyze optimal monetary and fiscal policy in an economy
with nominal price rigidities.

Note that the ratio of arithmetic to geometric means is always greater than 1 unless the two

prices are equal. Thus, the second term in the period utility function incorporates the effects of

relative price distortions. Alternatively, let δ t = Pt1/Pt2 measure the relative price distortion on

date t. Then utility has the form

Define the relative-price distortion term as φ(δ) ≡ (1+δ)/2δ1/2. Notice that the derivative φ′(δ) =

(δ 1/2 − δ −1/2)/4δ, which is negative for δ < 1, and that φ(δ) = φ(1/δ).

        For simplicity assume that β is a constant. If we are initially in a position where price-

setters’ expectations have been realized and the nominal interest rate is 0, then one can show that

even with sticky prices δ = β will hold. That is, relative prices (like the price level) are falling at

the rate of time preference. In that setting, a small enough unexpected monetary expansion will

raise the prices that are currently set and (for one period) push δ closer to 1, raising welfare

through that channel. But a large enough monetary expansion will temporarily exacerbate the

relative-price distortion. This gives a rigorous account of the specific costs of unanticipated

inflation (as opposed to the better-known costs of anticipated inflation in the optimum quantity

of money discussion).14 Of course, we will have a second unanticipated inflation effect on

welfare through the output channel along with a second anticipated inflation effect on the

average markup.

        These effects are all captured in the expression below:


14
  Such effects of unanticipated inflation have been assumed on an ad hoc basis in models such as that of Barro and
Gordon (1983) in order to avoid the Calvo (1978) problem of potentially unbounded Nash-equilibrium inflation
rates.

Only in the absence of distortions—that is, with i = τ = 0 and P/w = δ = 1—is this derivative

guaranteed to be zero, of course.

         The first component of the preceding expression, involving the derivative of total

consumption with respect to the policy action ξ, can be calculated just as in the last section.

Now, though, the intersectoral relative-price distortion term φ(δ) ≥ 1 reduces the utility value of

increments in total consumption. However, with sticky prices the effect of the policy change dξ

on the future path of consumption will differ compared to the flexible-price case. In the present

setup, with two-period staggered price-setting, an unexpected monetary expansion on date 0

would raise C0 above its flexible-price level. This short-run Keynesian effect, associated with a

fall in the markup, would reinforce the positive consumption effect due to lower taxes.

         The second term above, that involving the derivatives φ′(δ), reflects the additional price

distortion associated with the policy change. Let us continue to assume that the tax rate is

constant and that the open-market purchase at date 0 leaves all future rates of monetary growth

unaltered. In that case, only the term φ′(δ0) above is nonzero; φ′(δ1) = φ′(δ2) = … = 0 because

the only unanticipated shock occurs on date 0, subsequent money-supply growth rates are



                                                             22
unchanged, and by date 1 (with two-period overlapping contracts), the pre-shock intersectoral

price distribution therefore has been restored.15

          As we have noted, when the nominal interest rate is zero it is initially the case that δ = β

(we assume for simplicity that t < T−2). Because taxes immediately rise to their new constant

level as a result of the surprise monetary expansion on date 0, the new relative price on date 0 is

given by


δ 0 = β (1 + ∆M 0 / M 0 ) .


Thus, the additional marginal welfare effect due to the induced date 0 change in intersectoral

price dispersion is


        φ ' ( β ) β d (∆M 0 / M 0 )
−                                   ,
     (1 + τ )( P / w)    dξ


where overbars indicate pre-shock levels for the tax rate and markup. As noted above, for a

small change the preceding welfare effect is positive, because the initial trend deflation at the

rate of time preference is reduced for a period.

          The preceding utility effects can be translated into dollar terms using the same

transformation we employed in Section V.


VII. Quantitative Estimates of Welfare Gains

How large might the welfare gains from open-market operations be? As just discussed, the

effects in the fixed-price case are different only in transitory ways from those of the flexible-

15
  As in the flexible-price case, it remains true that an unexpected monetary expansion on date 0 will not, under our
assumptions, change the date on which the nominal interest rate first turns positive.



                                                         23
price case, so we can get a rough first estimate of the magnitude by using expression (12), for the

welfare effects under flexible prices. That expression says that the welfare effects of an open

market operation equal the product of the present value of tax revenues, seigniorage and non-

competitive rents, multiplied by minus the percent change in the term (1+τ), roughly the absolute

reduction in the tax rate itself.

             To get some idea of the responsiveness of this term to monetary policy, consider the

special case in which the discount factor, β, is constant in the zero interest rate regime at some

value, say β0, and constant at some possibly different value, say β1 < 1, in the subsequent

positive interest rate regime. As discussed above, a temporarily low discount rate could be a

contributing cause of a liquidity trap. Under this assumption, an increase in the money stock at

date T, MT, would have the following impact on (1+τ):


     d ln(1 + τ )    1
−                 =      ,
      d ln M T      X −1

Suppose, for example, that the pure rate of time preference currently in year zero is -0.03 (β0 =

1/0.97), and that it is expected to increase to +0.02 (β1 = 1/1.02) in year T = 5. Then the term in

brackets in (13) equals (1-(0.97)6)/0.03 + 1/0.02 = 55.6. Hence, for MT = M0 initially, and a ratio

     Observe that since τ is finite, it must be true that X > 1.



                                                              24

          d ln(1 + τ )
hence −                = (1/10.1).
           d ln M T

        To obtain a lower-bound estimate of welfare effects, let’s ignore seigniorage and

noncompetitive rents in expression (12) and consider only the percentage of National Income

currently raised through taxes. (We present a more complete numerical analysis in the next

section.) Our calculation relates to a hypothetical level tax rate consistent with intertemporal

budget balance, whereas Japan’s general government deficit now exceeds 8 percent of National

Income. So we use as our tax rate the Ministry of Finance (2002, sec. II.8) estimate of the

overall “potential national burden,” which includes hypothetical tax receipts that would suffice to

eliminate the current fiscal deficit. That number was 47 percent of National Income for 2002

(and is surely over-optimistic given future social security obligations and financial-sector

restructuring costs).18 From expression (12), we therefore infer a permanent annual welfare gain

equal to 0.47/10.1, or nearly 0.05 percent of National Income for each percent increase in the

money stock at date T. This is a huge marginal welfare benefit (and as we have noted, is likely

an underestimate of the true benefit that is implied by the model). Extrapolated linearly, it

implies that a 100 percent increase in the monetary base would raise welfare permanently by an

amount equal to 5 percent of National Income per year, although linearity breaks down for such

a large monetary expansion and the true effect would be smaller. Because the model has some


17
  Japan’s current monetary base is about 18 percent of nominal GDP and the level of net outstanding general
government bond debt is roughly 70 percent of GDP (with the more widely cited gross government debt figure
about twice as high).
18
  Our model, which abstracts from government spending, implies that τ = {1 - [MT /(M0 + B0)]}/(1- X) (assuming
that µ = 1). While the model is appropriate for capturing quantitatively the seigniorage gains from government bond
buybacks and the resultant impact on the “permanent” tax rate, it predicts a tax rate that is much too low and it
therefore underestimates the deadweight tax burden. Accordingly we use the actual tax burden to substitute for τ in
expression (12).



                                                        25
specific simplifying assumptions (including logarithmic consumption preferences), this number

should be taken to indicate substantial welfare benefits rather than as a literal best estimate.


VIII. Simulating Various Policy Changes

The preceding section’s analysis illustrates the potential welfare benefits of open market

operations in a liquidity trap, but with some limits. First, it starts from the premise that a

liquidity trap exists and will end at a certain future date, and hence is applicable only to policies

that do not affect the duration of the liquidity-trap regime. Second, it is accurate only for small

open market operations. Third, it does not deal with the effects of sticky prices.

        To get a more general idea of the effects of policy changes of different sizes in a variety

of environments, including those changes that may affect the dates at which the economy exits

the liquidity trap, we turn to numerical simulations. As one cannot determine ex ante whether

the economy will be in a liquidity trap in a given period, the key to the methodology is

identifying periods in which the economy is constrained. We accomplish this through the

following backward solution technique.

        Assume first that we know the state of the economy at date t+1, including whether the

economy is in a liquidity trap (i.e., whether it+1 = 0). Whether or not there is a liquidity trap in

period t+1, we can solve for the wage in period t. If the cash-in-advance constraint binds at date

                                   wt M t +1
t+1, then (from expression (9b))      =        . If, instead, the cash-in-advance constraint does not
                                   kt   β t +1

                                                            wt   1 wt +1
bind at date t+1, then it+1 = 0 and (from expression (6))      =              . Now, consider
                                                            k t β t +1 k t +1

expressions (2) and (3). Together, they imply a notional solution for the nominal interest rate in

period t,



                                                  26
~     wt
it =        − 1.                                                                                                 (14)
     kt M t


                    ~
If the solution for it in (14) is negative, then the cash-in-advance constraint (2) is slack, with the

real money stock greater than consumption expenditures. In this case, the interest rate is equal to

zero, and the economy is in a liquidity trap, in that the current money supply is irrelevant.19

Whether or not the economy is in a liquidity trap, we may then solve for the remainder of the

date-t variables, and then proceed to a solution for date t-1. Finally, to begin the backward

solution process, assume that, for some date in the distant future, we know that the economy has

a positive interest rate.

         The procedure outlined provides a solution for the entire path of the economy for given

paths of the policy variables M and τ. In order to ensure that the government’s intertemporal

budget constraint is satisfied, we iterate, revising the value of τ (which is assumed to be constant

over time) with each iteration to meet the budget constraint. Once the iteration process

converges, the value of τ to which behavior responds is consistent with the government’s budget

constraint, given that behavior.

         Having laid out this solution algorithm, we may now demonstrate the claim made above,

that a level shift in the money stock at the initial date, with no subsequent change in money

growth rates, will have no impact on the number of periods during which the liquidity trap

applies. Consider first dates t from period T-1 onward, where T, once again, is the first date such

that iT > 0. For these dates, the current wage is proportional to the next period’s money stock.


19                           ~
  At the borderline where i is exactly equal to zero, the interest rate will equal zero and the cash-in-advance will
hold as an equality. It will not bind, though, in the sense that the equilibrium would be unaffected by relaxing the
constraint.



                                                         27
                                                                              ~
Thus, with no change in the money growth rate between t and t+1, the value of it yielded by

expression (14) does not change. Now, consider any date t before T-1. At this date, the wage is

proportional to the wage at date T-1, and hence to the money stock at date T. From (14), there
                                  ~
will be no impact of the value of it at t if the growth of the money stock between periods t and T

is unchanged.

        It is useful to note that in this model the equilibrium is unique. Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé,

and Uribe (2002) demonstrate that the zero-bound on nominal interest rates can generate

multiple equilibria when the monetary authority follows a Taylor-like rule to set the interest rate.

Our model escapes this problem because it does not include a feedback policy rule for the

nominal interest rate.20 It is easy to demonstrate, using the solution technique just described, that

changing the terminal period has no impact on the equilibrium path. That is, suppose we first

assume that the economy is permanently out of a liquidity trap as of date Ψ and solve backward

from that date. If the assumption is consistent with this solution, i.e., if the path after Ψ exhibits

positive interest rates, then starting the solution from any date Ψ′ > Ψ will yield the same

equilibrium path for the economy.

        We now turn to some numerical simulations. As noted in the previous section, the

theoretical model studied here has no government spending other than debt service. To remedy

this omission in the simulations, we add a stream of government purchases to the government’s

intertemporal budget constraint. Purchases at each date t are assumed to be exogenous and, like

consumption at that date, proportional to the term 1/kt (see expression (3)). Thus, for a given


20
  Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé, and Uribe (2002) also investigate conditions under which an anticipated switch from an
interest-rate rule to monetary-base targeting can prevent deflationary equilibria from emerging. The model
precludes self-fulfilling deflationary paths in which nominal interest rates are zero notwithstanding nonnegative
money-supply growth. Consumers’ desire eventually to spend their rapidly increasing real money balances makes
such paths inconsistent with overall equilibrium.



                                                       28
mark-up, interest rate and tax rate, government purchases will be a constant share of output and

consumption over time. We adjust this share so that the tax rate in the initial equilibrium equals

the estimate given above for government’s share of output in Japan, 47 percent. As before, we

also set the initial ratio of high-powered money to high-powered money plus debt at 0.2. For

each simulation, we consider the welfare effects of a change in monetary policy in terms of the

equivalent variation in resources that would provide the same change in utility.21

         Because we are interested in studying an economy that is initially in a liquidity trap, we

make parameter assumptions consistent with this being the case. Following the assumptions of

the previous section, we let the pure rate of time preference initially be negative (-0.03), having it

become positive (+0.02) in period 5. In terms of the discount factor itself, β initially is 1/0.97,

falling to β5 = β6 = . . . = 1/1.02 in period 5. The low initial rate of time preference pushes the

nominal interest rate lower, making a liquidity trap more likely. We also assume that the labor-

disutility parameter, k, falls at an annual rate of .05, reaching 1.0 in period 5, when it ceases

falling and remains constant thereafter. As discussed, variations in this parameter may be

thought of in the same terms as variations in the rate of productivity, with falling k being

equivalent to increasing productivity. If productivity is relatively low now but is expected to be

higher in the future, then inflation will be lower to make room for the real balances needed to

support higher income levels.22 We set the competition parameter, ρ, equal to 10, which induces

  Given the quasi-linear form of the utility function, hypothetical variations in income are absorbed by changes in
labor supply, so the calculation amounts to finding the equivalent increase or decrease in labor supply necessary to
give the same change in utility.

  In the context of present-day Japan, one cause of temporarily low productivity might be the banking system’s
distress, which makes it difficult for firms to finance productivity-enhancing investments. Hayashi and Prescott
(2002) attribute Japan’s recent output stagnation to low productivity growth, although they argue against the view
that financial-system problems have hampered investment.

a modest price-cost ratio of 10/9. Finally, in the initial equilibrium, we set the money stock to

1.0 in period 0 and assume that it grows at a constant annual rate of 2 percent thereafter.

        Figure 2 shows the initial equilibrium trajectory of the money stock, inflation rate, and

nominal interest rate for the economy just described. Despite a growing money stock, the

economy is in a liquidity trap in periods 0 through 4, with a zero nominal interest rate and prices

falling at a rate just over 2 percent per year. The period 5 shift in preferences brings the

economy out of the liquidity trap, with the interest rate rising to just over 4 percent and deflation

ending. Actually, deflation lessens starting in period 4, due to firms’ forward-looking pricing

policies.

        Figure 3 shows the impact of one-time increases in the money stock effected by open-

market operations in period 0. Recall that in our model, this family of policies has no impact on

the timing of the liquidity trap or the interest rate at any date. The figure shows the money stock

and inflation trajectories under the baseline equilibrium already discussed, and alternative paths

for period-0 increases in the money stock of 1 percent, 10 percent and 50 percent. The welfare

gains from these policies are, respectively, 0.09 percent, 0.84 percent and 2.95 percent of output

per year. The first of these annual gains is somewhat higher than the 0.05 percent derived for a

comparable experiment in the previous section, a difference explained by the presence here of

the additional distortions of price-cost mark-ups and (after period 4) positive nominal interest

rates (see expression (12)). As predicted, the gains are not linear in money stock changes—the

gain for a 50-percent increase in the money stock is about two-thirds of the value forecast by

linear extrapolation of the gain for a 1-percent increase. Still, the gain is sizable—nearly 3

percent of output. Such a large jump in the money stock does cause inflation—here nearly 20

percent per year for two years—but the severity of this temporary surge in inflation is an artifact




                                                 30
of our assumption that prices adjust over two periods. In this model, a longer period of price

adjustment likely would yield a smaller spike and a more prolonged period of inflation within the

liquidity trap regime.

         Unlike a one-time, unannounced increase in the money stock, a change in the rate of

growth of the money stock while the economy is in a liquidity trap has the potential to bring the

economy out of a liquidity trap immediately. This is illustrated in Figure 4, which presents

trajectories for the initial equilibrium and for an equilibrium in which the annual growth rate of

the money stock is raised from 2 percent per year to 7 percent per year through period 5. By the

end of this transition period, the money stock is 33 percent higher than in the base case with 2

percent money growth.

         With faster money growth, the liquidity trap ends immediately—the interest rate in

period 0 is close to its long-run value. Being out of the liquidity trap, the economy’s inflation

rate is dictated by this faster money growth rate, and exceeds that of the baseline equilibrium

throughout the initial period. This inflation is still modest—ranging from less than 2 percent in

year 5 to just below 8 percent in year 1. The welfare gain is 0.92 percent of output per year.

Though still significant, this is only slightly higher than the gain from an immediate increase in

the money stock of 10 percent, and well below the yearly gain that an immediate 33-percent

increase in the money stock would deliver—2.25 percent of output. The gradual increase in the

money stock weakens the welfare gain by pushing interest rates up immediately, lessening the

short-run output surge that accompanies an unexpected burst of inflation.23 This is illustrated in

Figure 5, which shows consumption trajectories for the baseline equilibrium, the equilibrium


23
  Our cash-in-advance model’s baseline version, which implies a unitary elasticity of consumption with respect to
the nominal interest factor, probably exaggerates the welfare cost of deviations from Friedman’s optimum quantity
of money. The effect is proportionally lower, however, for lower values of the intertemporal substitution elasticity
γ. As we have noted, of course, lowering γ will lower other welfare effects as well.


                                                         31
with faster money growth, and the equilibrium with an immediate jump in the money stock of

the same size. Note that the temporary rise in consumption is much smaller under the policy of

faster growth, and consumption actually then falls below the baseline trajectory temporarily due

to the higher nominal interest rate.

       To conclude this section, we emphasize some general lessons of these simulations. First,

the inflationary effects of a step increase in money may well be front-loaded. Even a substantial

increase in money could give way to moderate inflation, and possibly a temporary return to

deflation, after a transition period. With different parameter settings implying a strong enough

underlying deflationary trend, a policy of monetary injections might also succeed only in

reducing, but not eliminating, deflation. Nonetheless, substantial welfare gains can be reaped.

These observations are relevant in assessing the credibility of permanent monetary expansion,

the topic of the next section.


IX. Credibility of Permanent Money Supply Changes

As we have noted, Krugman’s (1998) dynamic model of the liquidity trap relies on a belief

among market actors that the central bank has a rigid future target for the money-supply level.

Under that assumption, any announced future increase in the money supply’s level lacks

credibility and markets expect any current increase to be fully reversed later on. Of course, were

Krugman’s assumption literally true in our model, the central bank would lose its ability to

influence the economy today through open-market operations. Our model and simulations,

suggest, however, that the preceding characterization of an inflation-averse central bank is

unrealistically extreme.

       In our simulations, a central bank that is acting against a deflationary trend can achieve a

substantial welfare gain while creating only mild and temporary inflation. It is hard to see why


                                                32
this outcome would not be preferred to ongoing deflation even by very hawkish central bankers.

Furthermore, there is no welfare gain to reversing a permanent money-stock increase (or,

equivalently in our setup, to reneging on a promise to raise the date T money stock). On the

contrary, such a move would have a negative welfare impact in our model compared to non-

reversal. This finding is consistent with Eggertsson’s (2003) observation that when national

policymakers internalize the fiscal benefits of monetary expansion, permanent money-stock

increases can become quite credible. Our detailed numerical results suggest, moreover, that for

Japan the fiscal benefits are large enough to overwhelm any reasonable fears about inflation,

especially starting from a position where prices actually are falling. In other words, the

government’s net debt is already so large that it should perceive very powerful fiscal incentives

to end deflation.

        Eggertsson (2003) argues, however, that an independent central banker’s preferences

might diverge from those of the government. In the extreme, the banker might have a

lexicographic abhorrence of inflation, and thus be entirely blind to the associated benefits from

public debt reduction and lower taxes. We doubt this is the case anywhere. Independent central

bankers routinely warn of the dangers of high tax levels and of high public deficits and debts. In

the specific case of Japan, the revised Bank of Japan Law that became effective in 1998 indeed

grants the central bank goal- as well as instrument-independence. Yet the Bank’s assigned

mission of pursuing “price stability, contributing to the sound development of the national

economy,” is not at all inconsistent with the simulated policy effects of the last section.24 If

Japan’s central bankers care even to a limited degree about the negative effects of tax distortions,

a policy of at least some permanent monetary expansion should be attractive to them, once they
24
  Furthermore, Article 4 of the recent Bank of Japan Law states that the Bank shall “always keep close contact with
the government and exchange views sufficiently so that its currency and monetary control and the basic stance of the
government’s economic policy shall be mutually harmonious.” See Cargill, Hutchison, and Ito (2000, pp. 97-101).



                                                        33
understand the magnitude of the fiscal benefits available. Furthermore, the likely front-loading

of inflationary effects makes a later policy reversal unlikely unless the Bank of Japan is targeting

a definite historical price level, in the mode of an interwar central bank returning to a pre-1914

gold exchange parity. This behavioral model is, fortunately, no longer plausible.

         A reflationary strategy focused on pegging the exchange rate, such as the one advocated

by Svensson (2001), is in purely economic terms quite similar in its fiscal implications. In

principle such a policy could be decided by the government without decisive central bank input,

but the approach suffers from credibility problems of its own. A substantial and purposeful

exchange rate devaluation by the government of Japan would elicit strong protests from trading

partners, and hence pressures for reversal. From a political point of view, the incremental

market-induced depreciations following gradual money-supply expansion would be easier to

defend as a side product of domestically necessary policies.25 Furthermore, if the Japanese

government is indeed viewed as committed to a low long-run price-level target, the yen currency

peg could be susceptible to a revaluation attack, as were the German and Swiss currencies near

the end of the Bretton Woods period.

     The Bank of Japan has already expanded the monetary base from a 1999 annual average of

¥63.5 trillion to a 2002 annual average of ¥90 trillion, an increase of 42 percent, with no

discernible inflationary impact. Is the seeming failure to ignite inflation evidence of deflationary

expectations so entrenched that open-market policy cannot be effective? Not necessarily.

Japan’s price level could well have fallen even more absent the monetary ease. Our findings




25
  A large immediate money-stock increase, in contrast, would have the advantage of signaling a dramatic break
with the past, and to the extent that its inflationary effects were front-loaded, any temptations to reversal would be
reduced. While the exchange-rate effects would be more obvious to trading partners, the Japanese government
could still claim in its defense that the depreciation was a side effect of other necessary policies.



                                                          34
suggest that the Bank of Japan’s quantitative operations have had a positive welfare effect, and

would help the economy further if fully maintained and carried out even more aggressively.

           The experience of the United States during the Great Depression provides a useful

perspective on Japan’s effort at monetary stimulus. Figure 6 shows that in the late 1930s, United

States interest rates looked very much like those in Japan today, roughly zero at the short end but

significantly positive at long maturities. Dollar devaluation in April 1933, followed by growing

political instability in Europe, inspired accelerating capital inflows to the United States that

increased the country’s stock of monetary gold fivefold between 1933 and 1940. Over the same

period the stock of high-powered money nearly tripled.26 Romer (1992) argues persuasively that

this monetary expansion was the main cause of U.S. recovery from the Depression, especially

the sharp 1938-1942 increase in output (by 49 percent). It is noteworthy that after a spike in

inflation due to the 1933 devaluation, the U.S. price level rose only gradually until 1941. As is

likely in Japan today, monetary expansion had to offset the deflationary pressure caused by an

output level well below full employment.27 But monetary expansion did eventually work.

           If the experience of the Great Depression is any guide, Japan will need more quantitative

easing to escape from its liquidity trap, perhaps much more. The simultaneous opportunity for

public debt reduction provides strong additional motivation for this policy.


X. Summary and Conclusion

We have confirmed the intuition that a substantial monetary expansion undertaken in a liquidity

trap should improve welfare by reducing the taxes required in the future to service the national

debt. This, in itself, is an important finding, for it suggests a role for monetary policy even if the

policy has no immediate impact on prices, output or interest rates.

       But we have also shown that this policy can effect an immediate expansion in prices and,

with less than fully flexible prices, output as well. Thus, monetary policy remains an important

policy instrument for an economy mired in a liquidity trap, even if the liquidity trap is severe and

expected to last a long time. Given the surprising clarity of these results, and the fact that they

are inconsistent with much “conventional wisdom,” it is worth asking the extent to which there

may be important institutional factors missing from our analysis that might substantially weaken

or overturn them.

       One simplification of our model has been the omission of financial intermediaries. At

first, this might appear to be a critical and questionable simplification. In reality, an expansion

of the money stock requires not only an expansion of the monetary base by the monetary

authority, but also a willingness of banks to lend the additional reserves that the central bank has

made available. Given the weakness of Japan’s banking sector, might this represent a roadblock

to successful implementation of the policy traced out above? In short, the answer is no, following

logic similar to that used above.

       As discussed, a monetary expansion undertaken in a liquidity trap “works” through its

effect on the money stock after the liquidity trap regime elapses, at date T in our notation. This

expansion can be accomplished through an immediate increase in the money stock at date 0 that

is sustained through date T, but the actual date of the initial expansion before date T is irrelevant.

If the government waited until date T to increase the money stock, for example, the effects at

date 0 would be unaffected, as long as the money stock at date T were the same. Following this

logic, we can see that it is unnecessary for banks to respond immediately to an open-market




                                                  36
increase in reserves by the central bank. Perhaps they might choose initially to hoard the

reserves in the face of zero short-term interest rates. But, when the liquidity trap regime gives

way to one with positive short-term interest rates—at date T—banks would be expected to lend

their reserves to profit from the interest differential between reserves and loans. Thus, the

presence of banks might affect the timing of the eventual monetary expansion, conditional on the

central bank’s operations, but it should not nullify the policy’s efficacy. Of course, to the extent

that expansionary monetary policies aid troubled banks in writing off bad loans and returning to

active lending, the case for central bank bond purchases is strengthened further.

       Entrenched price expectations surely are a barrier to policy success in Japan. In view of

the large economic benefits available, however, sustained policy action coupled with better

communication of strategy to the public should be able to modify the deflationary psychology.

Appendix on the Government Budget Constraint

Consider the government’s budget constraint. Starting with the expression above for the

evolution of household wealth,


                         πt        wt Lt
Vt +1 = Vt (1 + rt ) +         +         − (1 + τ t )(1 + it )Ct ,
                          Pt        Pt


we impose the national income identity equating purchases to factor incomes and obtain:


Vt +1 = Vt (1 + rt ) − [(1 + τ t )(1 + it ) − 1]Ct .


Imposing the transversality condition, we get:

⇒

            This expression relates the government’s current obligations to its future seigniorage and

tax revenue. Note that an open market operation has no impact on the left-hand side of the

expression, so one solves for the change in tax rates that keeps the right-hand side constant as the

policy changes.

         Finally, let us assume that the tax rate τ is constant over all future periods. With this

assumption, the path of wages obtained in the text of the paper, and the fact that the interest rate

is 0 through date T-1 and determined by the Euler equation based on successive money stocks

from T onward, we may use the above expression for the government’s budget constraint to

solve for the necessary tax rate, τ. We solve for τ to obtain


        M 0 + B0           ∞

τ =  t =0                                                    .                                 (A1)
              ∞
                  t                  M 0 + B0

                                    t =0     


The second term in the numerator reflects the seigniorage collected on household holdings of

                                T       
money after date T-1. The term  ∏ β t−1  M T measures the impact of the money stock at date T
                                t =0    

on the wage rate at date 0. Under the assumption that the cash-in-advance constraint only starts

to bind for cash balances held at the beginning of date T, the money stock before T is irrelevant

to the determination of wages and prices.
