          Taxes, Firm Financial Policy and the Cost of Capital:
                           An Empirical Analysis



                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper develops a theoretical model of firm behavior consistent

with the maximization of shareholder utility, and derives empirically

testable implications of different theories of equity finance. Using data

on firm   earnings   and previous investment and financial behavior, we assess

whether firms treat new share issues as a more expensive source of finance

than retentions, and whether such behavior varies across firms according

to the composition of their shareholders.

     Our results strongly support the hypothesis that firms perceive a

higher cost of capital when issuing new shares, an that the cost of capi-

tal varies significantly across firms having different estimated tax

clienteles, as theory would predict.

I.      INTRODUCTION


        The observed financial behavior of firms,        particularly   their policy of

distributing substantial dividends in the face of unfavorable tax treatment, has

proved difficult to model in a consistent way. The basic problem is that the

simplest theoretical models dictate outcomes that are clearly at variance with

reality. This has led investigators to adopt one of three strategies in dealing

with the problem:


        (i) Reality is wrong; firms     don't   really behave as we think they do.


        (2)   Firms and/or investors are irrational. Firms do not act in the
              true interests of their shareholders, either because shareholders
              misperceive   these interests or because firms do.

        (3) There are constraints, some possibly obscured from ready
              identification,   that prevent rational firms    and investors from
              behaving as the simple theory would have th do.

All of these positions present difficulties for their adherents, though there
may be an element of truth in each. However, the welfare            inlications of each

with   respect to tax changes is     very   distinct. Hence, it   is    inortant that the
roots of financial behavior be ascertained.
       The purpose   of this paper is to develop a theoretical model of firm beha-
vior consistent with the maximization of shareholder utility, and derive empiri-.
cally testable implications of the different theories of equity finance outlined
below. In particular, we wish to assess, using data on firm earnings and pre-
vious   investment behavior,    whether firms    treat   new share issues as a more expen-
sive   source of finance than retentions, consistent with the tax treatment of
                                         —2—



dividends,    and whether such behavior varies across firms accordin8 to the corn-
position   of their shareholders. By using a panel of several firms observed over

twenty   years, we have the capacity to control for effects that characterize

firms   but                                                 particularly impor-
              not their year to year changes in policy. This is

tant in the current context, allowing us to overcome many of the criticisms
leveled at related efforts in the past.
         We begin with a brief review of the related empirical literature in the

next section. Section III presents a discussion of the data used in the paper,

and sons summary statistics of the financial behavior of the companies in our

sample. Section IV develops a theoretical model of shareholder equilibrium and

firm behavior, and Section V adapts this model to a dynamic    context   to permit

empirical estimation. Section VI presents such empirical results and offers

some concluding commsnts,




II. Related Literature

     The modern theory of financial and investnent behavior begins with the work

of Modigliani and Miller (1958, 1963) and Miller and Modigliani (1961), vI

showed that in the absence of taxes, in a rational world vitht constraints,

firm financial policy is irrelevant: neither the debt equity ratio nor the

source of new equity capital (retentions versus ned- shares) has any     effect on
the wealth    of a fix' shareholders. The presence of the corporate tax,     and
interest deductibility, leads to the result that firms sha%ld finance entire]y

with debt.

     That firms do not borrow to finance all new investment has been explained

in a number of ways. l'irst of all, with personal taxes, it is the relative tax
                                                —3—




advantage       of debt, over that enjoyed by the individual, that matters.1 Since

individuals also face a higher tax rate on debt than equity income (capital

gains being lightly taxed), the total tax advantage to debt is lower. Added to

this is the fact that, without a perfect loss offset, the expected corporate

income tax deduction for interest payments declines with leverage.2
                                                                                  Thus, espe-
cially in the presence of a progressive income tax structure and individuals

with different personal tax preferences for equity versus debt, tax factors need

not require all—debt finance. Two          other   costs of debt relate to bankruptcy.

Increased leverage may make bankruptcy, with potentially high social costs, more

likely. In addition, the prospect of bankruptcy in some states of the world
introduces a moral hazard to the firm's investnent decision.3            it is encouraged

to undertake risky projects it might otherwise eschew in order to decrease the

expected payment to bondholders. The higher the firm's leverage, the greater

the moral hazard and, presumably, the higher the cost to the firm of debt

finance.

        Thus,   there are a number of possible reasons for observed corporate
leverage decisions, although they may not be           entirely satisfactory. Less expli-
cable are the dividend policies that firms fo11c-. I'bst firms pay dividends.
In the U.3. in 1981, dividends of corporations were 63.1 billion dollars,
exceeding    the 149.5   billion   dollars of earnings retained.1 Since dividends are

subject to full personal taxation, while capital gains associated with reten-

tions are subject, in the U.S., to a 60 percent exclusion from taxation, and

taxed   only at realization, this is a puzzling result. Hence, each of the
approaches mentioned above has been used to           constrijt an explanation.
     Miller      and Scholes (19T8) advanced the      theory that no one pays taxes on

dividends,      at the margin, and so   there   is no disincentive faced by firms
distributing them.       Their argument was based on various aspects of the Internal
                                          —)4 —




Revenue Code, including one that limits the use of interest deductions against

non—capital income. This argument is ingenious but refuted by empirical evi—

dence. As shown by Feenber (1981), only 2 1/2 percent of dividends received in

the U.S. in 1971 went to investors facing the limitation discussed by Miller and

Scholes, forming a rather low upper bound on the extent of such behavior. More-

over, the Miller_Scholes argument cannot even be applied to the dividend paying

behavior in countries such as the United Kingdom, where personal investors do

not have the benefit of interest deductibility.

       The   "irrationality" approach may be attrilxited to the work of Black and
Scholes (1973, 197)4) and Fama (197)4), who loci, respectively, at the valuation
response of investors to dividends and the choice of the firm anxng different
sources of finance. In these empirical studies, the results are taken to imply
that firns and individuals behave as the Modigliani—Miller theory would predict
for   a taxiess world. There is   no suggestion that such behavior is   rational when
taxes are present, merely that it continues to occur. While a sanling of
investment letters and corporate reports may evoke sympathy for such a position,
it seems at variance with the general, empirically suprorted presumption that
capital markets are generally efficent and investors behave rationally.
     Finally, there are the explanations of dividend behavior based on con-
straints. If firn are inhibited from repurchasing their own shares, or those
of   others, and therefore can only pass earnings out of the corporation as divi-
dends,   then the market   should capitalize this fact. Since earnings retained and
reinvested    must eventually be distribited, the dividend tax can never be

avoided. This will lead to firm indifference in the distribution or retention

of dividends, and to a capitalization of the dividend disadvantage in the price
of   the firm's shares.5 An important implication of this view is that the divi-
dend tax, if not anticipated, is a lump sum tax on the value of corporate
                                           —5—




equity.      A problem with this "capitalization" or "new" view   is that some firms
in the     U.S. do repurchase their shares, and others issue new shares while con-

tinuing to distribute dividends.6

      An explanation of this behavior could stan from an additional constraint

requiring     finns   not to alter their dividend policy in the short run. This might

be   the   result of a signalling model (e.g., Bhattachaxya (1919)) in which firms

observed cutting their dividends are perceived to be in financial trouble.

Thus, firms might be forced to issue new shares to raise funds in periods of

high investment. This theory does not offer convincing evidence of the exis-

tence of the kind of managerial incentives needed to support such a signalling

equilibrium, but it is well known that finn dividend policy is extremely stable.

As opposed to the capitalization result, this "double taxation" or "classical"

view suggests that, since new equity source funds must come not fran dividends

but from new shares, the issue of which does not generate a reduction in current

taxes, the dividend tax will influence investmsnt, and will not be capitalized

into the value of existing equity. Another way of distinguishing between these

two views of dividend tax incidence is the long run value of Tobin's q, the

ratio of market value to asset cost for the firm. The capitalization model pre-

dicts a q below unity, reflecting the tax savings associated with investment

through  retention. The classical model predicts a long run q of one. The luNer
q in the first case is the mechanism through which the future dividend taxes are
capitalized and hence not borne by new      investnnts.1

      The empirical literature dealing with the effect of taxes on financial
structure,    particularly equity policy, may be   divided fairly neatly into two
categories:                                                  those that deal
                those that deal with the behavior of firms, and

with the market response by investors to the behavior of firms. The current
investigation will be of the former type. While one might infer from results
                                           —6—




about    investor   behavior what the optimal behavior of firms     would be, it does not
follow    that this is the way    actually behave. Thus, both types of study
                                 firms

are required to assess the effects of taxation.
       Most of   the work on market pricing by investors has concentrated on the

relative valuation of equity returns coming in the form of dividends and capital

gains. The typical question asked is how         the   market value of a finn's shares

changes on the day it goes ex dividend ——        the date on which the owner for pur-
poses of dividend payment is determined. The results generally show that,
controlling for fluctuations in the market return, stock prices drop by signifi-
cantly    less than the value of the dividend, perhaps only 80       percent on
average.8 In addition, there is a significant variation in this discount
according to the dividend payout of the finn.9           These results have been taken to

indicate that tax effects are present in the discounting of dividends, and that
investor tax clienteles exist with respect to firm dividend behavior.
       While these studies have been criticized on various grounds,-0 they have an
important ]J.initation even if interpreted correctly: they tell us nothing about
the behavior of firms in response to taxes. As shown in Auerbach (1982b), the
equation    used to estimate ex dividend day effects is consistent with both the

"capitalization" view that firms obtain their equity capital through retentions,

and the "double—taxation" view that new shares provide the funds for new invest-

ment   and dividends are fixed in the short run. In fact, one cc*ild also derive
the   equation based on a model of totally random irrational firm       behavior. It
merely    reflects the equilibrium response to the dividend payment, when it

occurs.

       Studies of firm   behavior have focused on      three questions: the interrel&-.

tionship   among a firm's   dividend and investment policy, the reaction of a firm's
                                          —7—




investment policy to changes in its market value, and the changes in a firm's
earnings in years following investnnts financed by different methods.

       Two papers examining the first of these questions, with different conclu-

sions, are by Dhrymes and Kurz (1961) and Fama (19714). Though the empirical

methodolo&y differs between the papers, each uses simultaneous equation methods

to ask whether changes in dividends influence investment, and whether changes in

investnnt influence dividends. As suggested by Fama, the view that taxes don't

influence firm behavior is consistent with a surge in investment causing a

reduction in dividends, since according to that view dividend policy is irrele-

vant. The key relationship involves the effect of dividends on investment.

Here, since without taxes real and financial decisions are separate, there

should be no effect. Fan finds that there is none, but Dhrymes and Kurz find

that there is a sigificantly negative effect, as would be predicted if firms

consider new shares to be more expensive for tax reasons. However, the esthna—

tion procedures differ between the studies, and one can raise serious questions

about the econometrics of each. For exan1e, Fama uses current profits and

lagged   dividends as the instruments for current dividends in the tine series
investment equation he fits separately for a large number of firms. Profits
qualifies as an instrwnent only because it is excluded frcmi the investment
equation. Yet, if dividends    act as a signal of future profitability, an

increase   in current profits may   increase   both dividends   and investment. More-

over, if firms do consider retentions to be a cheaper form of finance due to tax

considerations, an increase in profits may lower the marginal cost of capital

and lead to more   investnt. Hence, for these two        reasons, the procedure used
would lead to an upward bias in the dividend coefficient. Indeed, one         suspects
from   the findings in the investnnt literature of a positive effect of "cash

flow" on investment (e.g., Coen (1968)) that the fitted values of dividends from
                                          —8—


the first stage regressions have a coefficient in the second stage that includes

a significant positive effect of the omitted profits variable. Thus, the

observed insignificant coefficients need not be inconsistent with the results of'

Dhrymes and Kurz.

       Poterba and Summers (1981) use the q     model of investment as an indirect
test   of the "capitalization" versus the "double—tax" view of firm behavior.
Since the two theories predict different long—run values of the ratio of market
value to replacement value of assets, they predict different investment behavior
for firms that, responding optimally to costs of adjustment, set investment
equal to a function of the gap between the current value of      q. and the long—run

value of q. (Abel (1979), Hayashi (1981)). Poterba and Summers estimate an

aggregate time series q investment equation, with the q variable being a

weighted average of these corresponding to the "double—tax" and "capitalization"

theories. By estimating the weights jointly with the other parameters of the

equation,   they find that the best fit is obtained when essentially all the
weight is given to the "double-tax" q. While this result does seem damaging to
the "capitalization" view, there are a number of difficulties in interpreting
it. First of all, the "double—tax" q derived by Poterba and Summers is pre-
cisely the "no tax" q: the same expression would be obtained if all personal
taxes were zero or, in keeping with the "irrationality" hypothesis, ignored by
firms. Second, a number of assumptions, including constant returns to scale and
capital stock honxgeneity,   as   well as convex adjustment costs, are required for
the estinted equations to    be valid. Our empirical findings below suggest the

existence of large "firm effects" in rates of return, which is not consistent

with this view of the world. Finally, comnxn sense intervenes to remind us that

firms do not issue shares, or repurchase shares, in every or even most years)-
                                          —9—



        A third type of study   has directly estimated the   change in earnings attri-

butable to previous investment financed by different sa.irces. Bauniol       et al
(1910) used the technique, followed by others, of regressing, over a cross

section of firms, a weighted average change in earnings pins interest on an

average of previous amounts of retained earnings, debt issues and new share

 issues. The rationale was that if firms face different costs of capital for

different sources of funds, they     will use   the least expensive scxirce first,

using the more expensive one if very profitable investments present themselves.

Such profitability should show up in subsequent earnings. The results of Baumol

et al suggested that new shares were a substantially more expensive source of

 funds   than   retentions or debt, although taxes were not suggested by the authors

to lie behind this finding. However, the coefficients of all three independent

variables were vexy unstable over different cross sections, the exact specifica-

tion estimated was not drawn from any explicit model of firm behavior, and the

estimation procedure did not control adequately for simultaneity biases

likely to be present. For these and other reasons, a number of authors criti-

cized   both the paper's methodolor and its conclusions.
     Our empirical approach will extend that of Baumol et al, but with a number
of important differences. First, we beLn by devising an estimable model from
an examination of firm behavior based on the maximization of stockholder utility
in the presence of constraints. Then, using data corrected for inflation, we
use time series cross section methods in an attent to control for firm dif-
ferences. The use of panel data also allows us to test for the influence of
taxes on firm behavior not only in the aggregate, but across firms according to
their tax   clientele, as dictated by the theory. The empirical results in

Section VI strongly supfort the hypothesis that firms perceive a higher cost of
                                           —10—



capital when    issuing new shares, and that the cost of capital varies signifi-

cantly across firms     having   different estimated tax clienteles, in a manner con-

sistent    with these differences.


III. The Data

      Our sample consists of 214 firms, this being the subsample of the 436 firms
considered in Auerbach (1982b) for which observations for all variables used       are

available    for the entire twenty—year estimation period 1958—1911. The data
set contains information on daily stock prices and returns obtained from the
CRSP (Center for Research    in Securities Prices) data file. Annual balance sheet

and   income statement information comes from Standard and Poor's Conustat file.
The main adjustments made to the data before use involved the conversion of book

values of assets and liabilities into market va3iies, and the corresponding

correction of earnings. All such stocks and flows were deflated to obtain real

quantities.

      In this section, we describe these adjustments, and also present sane sta-

tistics on   the pattern of new share    issues that will be useful in guiding the

modelling of firm behavior in subsequent sections of the paper.



A.    Data Adjustment



      1.   Long—Term Debt


      Because of fluctuations in long—term interest rates, the market value of

long—term   debt may differ from its book value. To correct for this, we must
know the maturity structure of debt and the interest rate at which each com-
ponent was    issued.
                                        —11—


     Following the techniques of Braniard, Shoven and Weiss (1980) and Salinger

and Summers (1981), we assume


     a.      all new issues of long—term debt have a maturity of 20 years;


    b.       the coupon rate on each bond is the BAA   rate   prevailing in the

             year of issue; and


             In 1958,12 the maturity distribution of bonds in each firm was

             proportional to the maturity distribution of aggregate

             outstanding issues.13


New issues of debt after 1958 were calculated by subtracting the estimated book

value of retirements of 20 year old debt from the change in the book va]ne of

all debt. If such a number was negative, indicating additional retirenents, we

assumed that new issues were zero and that the oldest outstanding issues were

retired until the change in book value was accounted for.



     2.      Inventories


    Most firms use the LIFO (last—in, first—out) accounting method or the FIFO

(first—in,    first—out) method. Roughly speaking,   the first method correctly

states    inventory changes, while the second correctly states inventory stocks. A
small   number of firms use more than one method. For such firms, we assumed that

only what was listed as the predominant method was used.14

    For FIFO inventories, we assume that stocks at the end of period t are

valued at current period prices. This amounts to assuming that inventories

turn over at least once a year, so that all inventories on the books at the end
                                                         —12—



of any year were purchased during that year. Thus, the corrected change in
inventories at current prices equals:

             INyt —
                                         Pt
(3.1)                 INVt_i            't   —l



where Pt is the price level in period t (the producer price index was used

for this) and INVt        is   the book value of inventories at the end of year t.



valuation adjustment of
                                 —1          t
Since book earnings include the change in book inventories, the inventory
                          Pt —
                                     INV_1 must be subtracted to obtain
correct earnings.

        For LIFO finns,   if book       inventories increase, then all goods sold during

the year are treated as if purchased during the year, and no correction to ear—

nings is necessary. If inventories are depleted, then, to the extent of this

depletion,   goods purchased in earlier years are taken from the books, and an
adjustment is required. We assume that such "unlayering" goes back only to the
previous year, so that earnings must                 be adjusted by subtracting



             (INVt_i —
                                             Pt —   Pt_i

which is positive for t             >    Pt—i




        3.   Depreciation

        Book depreciation of physical assets is inaccurate for two reasons. The

first is that depreciation fiires are based on historic asset costs, and thus

do not reflect changes in asset prices due to inflation. Second, the depre-

ciation figure may    not reflect the actual pattern of econcanic depreciation. We
                                                  —13—



correct       only for the first of these problems.15 The method used calculates that

rate of declining balance (exponential) depreciation 6 that, when applied to a

perpetual inventory calculation for updating capital stocks beginning with the

1958 book value of net plant and equipment, yields the stated 1911 book value of
                                                    b

                K. =         (1—6) Kt_i +    it

where ' is gross period t investment, yields the stated value of

We then assume that all assets purchased by the firm actually do depreciate at

rate 6 ,         and use this to obtain actual real capital stocks according to a f or—

mula similar to (3.3):


                     =                   +
(3.1k)          Kt           (l—ô)Kt_i

where            is the capital goods price index. It is assumed in this calculation
                         b
that K1955 =
                     K1955
         If   all assets were written off, and actually did depreciate, at rate             6 ,

this   would be t1 correct procedure to follow. Actually, assets are commonly
written       off using the straight—line method, and asset lives differ. The

constant rate declining balance depreciation is meant to approximate an average

rate of depreciation of the firm's mix             of    assets. The use of beginning and end

of sample period net capital stocks, rather than simply adding up actual book

depreciation over the period, corrects for the fact that some assets are

scrapped, representing depreciation but not showing up in depreciation allow-

        4.   Eainings

        Using the above calculations, we derive two              useful   earnings measures:

        a.   Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) equals after—tax book
                earnings, corrected for the adjustments to depreciation and
                inventories, plus interest payments, pius incon taxes)7

        b.   Earnings before interest and after taxes equals EBIT, less actual

             taxes, and less the taxes inlicitly saved              by the deduction of
             actual    interest payments.Th


        These   two measures tell us hcq     return, before and after taxes, a
                                             much of a

firm has available for the owners of its securities.


        5.   Other Variables


        Two variables measuring firm characteristics are taken from calculations,

based on the same data set, done in Auerbach (1982b). These are the coef-

ficients c and a2 from the firm time                   series   regressions (performed on daily

data):


(3.5)              =     +c   dt +   ci   rt +   c43
                                                       Rt +

where           is the observed percent change in share price, dt is the dividend

per dollar of shares, rt is the percent change in the Standard and Poor's

stock index, and Rt is the treasury bill rate.                    (l+c&) is intended to repre-

sent the "implicit't tax rate of the firm's stockholder clientele, while c is

the standard measure of the firm's "beta", or the volatility of its return with

respect to the market. The interpretation of (1 +
                                                                   c)   as a tax rate derives

from the fact that investors should be indifferent between dividends and capital
                                                —15—


gains except for differences in their tax treatment. Thus, any dependence of

the    total return g +   d   on its composition can be attributed to taxes. In par-
ticular, if all investors faced a differential tax rate Ci +                   on   dividends,
equation (.5) would describe the movement in stock prices. This interpretation
can   be extended to the case of heterogeneois investors who form tax clienteles,

causing      to differ across firms. For furt.her discussion and ana],ysis, see

Auerbach (1982b).



B.     The Pattern of New Share Issues


        It is unnecessary to perform sophisticated regressions to get a general

idea of the equity policy firms         use     in financing investment. In general, the

characteristics    of firm behavior do not fit neatly into a "double—tax" or
"capitalization" framework: firms rarely issue new shares, but do not exhaust
retentions first when they do so. In             fact, there is    no noticable depression in
dividends   associated with the issuance of new             shares.
       Of the 274 firms   in    our   sample,   54   did   not engage in issues of new

shares19 at all during the entire fifteen year period 1963—1977, and 45                  did do
only    in one year. Only 104 firms        issued    new shares in more than 2 years, and

only 15 in more than 7        years. On the other hand, less than ten percent of all
firms issuing new shares in years following one in which no new shares were
issued cut their dividend from the previous year, and more than to—thirds
actually increased their dividends at least five percent.
     How is it that firms vary their dividend very little, yet rarely find it
necessary to issue new shares. One explanation is debt: firms can adjust their

borrowing   to cover short run fluctuations in earnings or investment needs.

However,   this procedure only can be sustained withit the frequent issuance
of new shares if the dividend is fundamentally in accordance with the firm's
                                            —16—

earnings prospects. Otherwise, the debt—equity ratio will rise steadily or new

shares    will be required. Indirect evidence that firms behave in this way is
provided by the following regression.
        We constructed three variables for each firm:      the   average over the period

1973—1911 of investment relative to net capital,          I, the ratio of this variable

to its value for the period 1958—1972,           I/I, and the average ratio of the value

of new shares issued to investment for the period 1973—1977, N/I. A regression

of the last variable on the first two, across firms,         yields   the resulting

coefficients:


             N/I =           .03      +    .30   I   +    .10 (i/i)         = .031
                            (0.5)4)       (0.98)         (1.82)


where the numbers in parenthesis are t — statistics. This suggests that new
share issues play an increased role in financing a firm's investment when its
investment,     relative to its capital stock, is higher than norrral, not simply

high.     This, in turn, seems to support the view that firms         do adapt their divi-

dend payout rate to avoid regular issues of new shares.

        These   results are consistent with a theory that is a hybrid of the "double—
tax" and "capitalization" views, incorporating both the short—run rigidity of
dividends and the aversion to issuing new shares. It is important that these
characteristics be incorporated into the model to be estimated below.



IV. Portfolio Equilibrium and Optimal Firm Behavior

      The model presented below       is based on that used in Auerbach and King

(1982), and Auerbach (1982b). It extends the work of these papers by consider-
ing   the firm's investment decision as well as its financial policy, and by a
                                                —17—


more explicit treatment of the nature of equity finance. These complications

are required if we are to model the behavior of firms               as   well as that of

investors. The reader not interested in the derivation may proceed directly- to

the sunuriary     provided   in subsection D.

        We consider a      two period model with H investors and L firms. E..ch firm
i has a        fixed   endowment of resources at the beginning of period 1,          labelled

j. This         may be thought of as the firm's cash flow from previous investments.

The firm makes four simultaneous decisions at the beginning of period 1:


        (1) how much of the endowment to pay           out   to existing stockholders

                as a dividend, Di


        (2) how much to borrow,         Bi

        (3)     how much to raise by selling new shares, N
                                                           ; and


        (Li)   how much to invest in productive assets, X

Only    three   of these decisions are independent, since they are related by              the
cash flow      constraint

(.i)           Yj+Bi+N = Xi+Di

In period 2, the firm realizes the cash flow from its investment, repays its

debt with interest,20 and distributes the remaining cash as a dividend. The

firm's stochastic investment return, Zj, is governed by the relationship:


(.2)           i = f(X)         .




where     f(.) is a concave function21 and Sj is a random variable with mean                     Mi,
variance 1j            and covariance        with   the   random variable underlying firm
                                                  —18—




j's return, S. Thus, the mean, variance and covariance with the return of
firm j         of   the return Z is:
(Ii.3a)               = f(X)M1

(.3c)          Cjj =       f(Xi)f(X)ai
        Each individual investor h enters period 1 with a wealth endowment Wh

that includes an exogenous component Wh plus shares and dividends in the
various firms.22           Once the firms announce their financial and investment

policies,      investors trade securities, purchasing, in addition to corporate debt
and   equity, two kinds of government debt, taxable and nontaxable (municipal).

Since all debt is riskiess, taxable government debt is a perfect substitute for

corporate debt, and must carry the              same interest rate. Municipal debt will
carry   a lower interest rate because of its favorable tax treatment.23

       We ignore capital gains taxes, and assume investor h faces an income tax

rate th on interest and dividend income. The budget constraint facing

investor       h is:


(i.)                        Lh              -
               Bh + Bh + E njE     =   Wh = Wh +    E nj   (E1 +   (1_th)Di_Ni)
                        i=1                       i=1

          -h           h
where nj and n are individual h's fractional holdings of the (pre—new

issue) equity, before and after trading,2 Ei is the value of firm i's equity,

and Bh and Bh are individual h's purchases a taxable and nontaxable debt,

respect ivley.

       Investors seek by trading to maximize a utility function based on the mean
and   variance of terminal wealth, uh (1h,( 0h)2)•                 If we denote by R the
                                                           —19—


interest rate on taxable debt, R                    the     rate on municipal debt, and t the cor-

porate tax rate, then the mean and variance                               and (a1)2 may   be   expressed:


(4.5a)                   =      [Wh -      z nE    -   hJR(1_th)      +      + L n(pi_RBj)(l_t)(1_th)

                                     hh
(.5b)            (11)2   =
                                                  (1_t)2(1_th)2
                                1J

where     ILj,           and B are the firm variables defined above.


       Without the existence of constraints on investor behavior, no equilibrium

could exist. For exale, the presence of individuals endowed with different
relative    tax rates on taxable and tax exenpt debt would present unliuxited
arbitrage possibilities not affected by changes in interest rates. For
simplicity,       we assume that individuals face nonnegativity constraints with

respect to their purchases of each type of debt,

                         h

       If we attach the multipliers                    A1 and         to the constraints (14.6a)       and

(.6b), respectively, we obtain the Lagrangian:

which yields (using                       ) the   first—order conditions:

Since each investor will hold at most one form of debt unless                          =   (1_th)R

Since Ah/Gh =             Th/(1_Ah),    A/G xry be thought of as the "market's" tax pre—
ference for equity, taking account of          constraints. C is the firm's covariance
with   the market, and              the "price of risk", both in accordance with the
standard     results of the capital asset pricing model.

       The actual values of the interest rates R and B depend on the behavior
of firms     as   well as the supplies of both types of government debt. Since we are

concerned with the optimizing behavior of individualfirms, we sin1y take these
as fixed. Likewise we will not discuss the role of taxes in influencing port-

folio composition. For this, the reader is referred to Auerbach and King (1982)
and Auerbach (1982b).

       The individual competitive firm             takes   individual preferences and

constraints and market prices as given. What objectives should guide                    the firm's
                                         —22—


decisions? One obvious possibility is market value maximization: the maximiza-

tion of the value of securities plus concurrent distributions. However, value

maximization has been criticized on three grounds:


     (1) if there is incomplete spanning of markets, such a policy

            would not be the generally agreed on aim of stockholders,

            even in the absence of taxes;


     (2) in the presence of taxes, even more stringent "tax" spanning

            is required;26 and


     (3) value maximization differs from the presumed objective of

            wealth maximization.21

Because of the specification of multiplicative uncertainty in (.2), the first

of these criticisms does not apply here. This was first shown by Diamond

(1961).     The other arguments suggest that investors may differ with respect to

what they would wish firms to do, and that firms seeking to act in "the interest

of their stockholders", would behave differently according to who these

stockholders are.

     To explore this issue further, we calculate the effect on the utility of

investor h of a change in the various financial and investment policies of an

arbitrary firm, k. In particular, we consider the effect of an increase in
investment financed by debt, retentions or new shares. Before we begin, it is

helpful   to note that the mean of investor h's portfolio may be rewritten,

using the definition of t:

                               h             h
(4.iO)          =   [W1'-.E   niE1R(1t") +   ni(j)(1_tc)(lt")

We now proceed   to consider the effects of firm policies.

not rnaxindxe the investor's utility, since his constraint—modified tax pre-

       While    equation ()-L.16)        suggests   that    stockholders will disagree concerning

what   the firm should          do, it is difficult to      analyze     the problem in full general-

ity, for it     would       be necessary to know the conosition of ex ante and ex post

stockholder groups. In a dynamic               context,     one would also have to consider the

formation   of expectations concerning the effects of current firm policy on
future   ones, through their effect on clientele conosition. One sinler
approach is to ask what firm behavior would be consistent with a stable voting
equilibrium, assuming one exists. That is, what behavior would be consistent
with a majority vote of stockholders when no trading occurs i.e. h                        =   h?
 In such a case, the first term in -.i6) disappears, and firm k chooses its
debt policy to maximize the "implicit" value of the wealth of its majority

the individual not specialized in equity, Ah = 0                  and hence Rr = R    (l_t ):

the   investor's net—of—tax opportunity cost, R(l—t), grossed up by the cor-

porate rate.



C.    New Issues

      Here, the only difference is in the budget constraint (1.): new share

issues are not tax deductible. Thus, the analagous rate of return to those

calculated above is N = H                     or    H —         (l—t'h)

D. Summary

      Our findings with respect to the cost of capital suggest that firms will

never choose to issue new shares, and will use debt or retained earnings

according to whether the tax rate faced by their stockholders, on     interest
income,   th, the minimum of   their personal tax rate, th, and the "tax rate" on

tax exent    debt inlicit in its discount, is less than or greater than the cor-

porate rate.28 These findings are preciseiy those one wtxild expect from the

certainty case (King 197)-t) but here they have been extended to the situation

where firms have different stockholder clienteles with different tax rates. It

is possible, therefore, for different firms to find different financing schens

most attractive.
                                           —21—


         To explain the coexistence of different forms of finance, except in dege-

 nerate cases where the costs of two sources are equal, one must specify a
 structure of constraints facing the firm. Such constraints might include the
 inability     to issue negative dividends, repurchase shares, or borra more than a

 specified     amount. As a result a finn might be forced to use a less    favored

 source   of funds after having exhausted its first source. In this context, one
 can think of firms as facing an upward sloping supply—of—funds schedule, with
three    components corresponding to the different sources of     finance. Of use in
our empirical analysis will be what the results of this section predict about
the effects of a firm's tax clientele on the height of the various segments of
the supply schedule. In particular, the cost of retentions, R            should
be nonincreasing with th, since

               dth           1       if t =         th
               dth           0       if t <         th


Likewise,      the cost of new shares, R          (l—t .'
                                                                should be nondecreasing
                                            (l_tc)(l_th)
with th. The cost of debt should not depend on th.
     What remains is for us to develop an empirical methodolor for identifying
these supply schedules and tax clienteles, a task to which we now turn.



V.      A Dynamic Model of Firm Behavior


        We wish to formulate a model consistent
                                                    with the theory of Section IV and
the actual evidence on patterns of finance cited in Section III. At the same

time,   this   model must lend itself to empirical investigation.
                                                        —28-.


         Consider   a firm      that    seeks to maximize          the   utility of its shareholders by

 accepting all projects that yield a return of p = R(1 —                           tb),    where R is the
 riskiess interest rate and t'11                is the      effective tax rate on debt faced by

 these stockholders. Then (see Auerbach 19T9b)), the firm's objective is to

maximize


 (5.1)        w =      (i   +     p)_t[(1   —   th)Dt   +   Nt+i1

where th is the tax on dividends, Dt is the dividend paid at the end of
period t, and Nt+i is the new share issue at the beginning of period t+1.
         At the beginning of each period,    borrows an anunt Bt of one
                                                        the firm

period debt, which returns an interest rate it at the end of the period. At
the beginning of each period, the firm has a range of investment opportunities
that offer a total return before tax of ft(xt) at the end of the period, and
ft (xt)(l_)(_t)        at    the end of each         future period s, where                t(•)        is   a cork-
cave function and Xt                 is the anunt invested in period t.                That   is, each
period,    the firm may invest in different projects with decreasing returns, each

of which depreciates exponentially over time at rate ó                         •   We subscript the func-

tion ft(•) to allow for fluctuations in investment opportunities that may

force a firm temporarily away from its long run financial structure.29

        If we assume that assets are accorded depreciation allowances in line with

economic depreciation,3° then the after—tax return before deductions of interest,

and before depreciation, at the end of period t is

while the net of depreciation after—tax return is:

                                                                       t) st[f(x5) —      6 x51   (i   —    6)(t_S)
                                                                 —29—


        As a substitute for the explicit treatment of risk in this section, we

assume    that the interest                      rate on debt, it        ,    is   a convex, increasing function of

the   debt—capital ratio:


(5•)           1t      =      i      (                                  i',         > 0
                                         s tX5(1_)(t_5)
                                             E




        As discussed above, firms                       pay dividends         in substantial amounts and at very
stable    rates. While this may be rationalized as an                                  atthnpt to set the long run

payout rate at one where the firm can grow internally and maintain its desired
debt—equity ratio, there is still the puzzle of why, when tenorary infusions of
funds are required, dividends are not cut, and new shares are issued. For
modelling      purposes, we assume that there is some minimum                               payout rate of earnings,
      that   firms        must    meet, by issuing new shares if necessary:

                                                        tc)Bt)
Likewise,      to reflect the fact that, whether they can or cannot, firms do not

repurchase shares in inortant amounts,31 we assume the new share issues cannot

be negative:



(5.6)          Nt         0


        Using the finn's              cash        flow identity:

and letting          Ti    and               be the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constants
(5.5)    and        (5.6),        we obtain the following first—order conditions                       with respect to

       While these expressions are connlicated, they give                           siile,   intuitive results

for   special cases. Consider steady states, first. Here, the tw conditions
are combined to yield (dropping subscripts):
                                                            (1—th + )

(5.9b)            o




Expression     (5.9b   )       says   that the firm chooses the debt—assets ratio to minimize
the cost of capital, c, to which it equates                       the net marginal product of new

capital. The cost of capital itself is a weighted average of the cost of debt

and   the cost of equity, the latter of which depends on the value of                               .   Here,
we may distirl€,uish three regimes, as in Auerbach (1979a).32
     If the dividend constraint is not binding (n = 0, ii = th), then the finn
draws its equity funds from retentions. This is reflected by the fact that when
   = 0, the cost of equity finance is   p                              __
                                           = R (÷ ), the cct of retentions

from   the previous section. Note that it is independent of th, the personal tax

rate on dividends. In this regina, the value of q , the ratio of equity value
to asset replacement cost less debt, equals (1_th).33 If the new share
constraint is not binding (n                = th,    =   0),    then firms are paying minimum
                                             —31—


dividends, and issuing new shares. Here, as in Section IV, the cost of equity

finance is                            While the cost of capital is still minimized by
                 (1—t)(i
the choice of b, the resulting optiimj. value of b, bN, is hher than the

value chosen in the first regime, br, since equity is more expensive and i(•)

is a convex function. Because new shares come from after—personal—tax dollars,

the value of the firm's q is one. This regime corresponds to the classical

view of the corporate tax, where the cost of capital is directly influenced by

the tax rate on dividends.

     Finally,     there is the intermediate case where the finn would,            if allowed,

reduce    its   dividend and repurchase shares. In this case, neither retentions nor

new issues serve as the marginal source of equity; there is a shadow cost of

equity capital that lies in between. Thus, marginal finance comes thrcugh debt.

As b rises from br to bN the cost of debt finance rises from the cost of
retentions to that of new shares, with q rising siixultaneously.35

     Outside the steady state, analysis is more coirlicated by the effect of

present behavior on future constraints. For example, new issues today impose a

different cost according to whether the resulting extra earnin in future

periods   allow a reduction in new issues then, or simply            an   increase in divi-
dends.    To simplify matters, we consider a case where f inn policy falls in the

retentions regime in all future periods (n =              0).   The results, thongh messier,

would carry over to any      case    in which n     is   assumed constant in the future.

     With   this simplification, equations (5.8a) and (5.8b) yield:

(5.lOa)     (ft—o) = ct    = (1—a)cr +    a[btit +   (l—bt)(p + (l+p)      (h))1(1_tc)1
                     =
                         (1—a)cr +   ag
                                                 —32—




(5.lob)            =   a



where a =              and   Cr is the constant future cost of           capital. Now, the
cost    of capital, ct, is a weighted average, based on future as well as current

financial decisions, but the qualitative conclusions described above still hold.

             increases from zero, .g and hence Ct                rises   from Cr    and     bj
rises    from br, until at b = bN            and    c   = cN,   new shares are issued.

        Since such an increase in the cost of capital comes about due to increased

investment, we may     represent    this as a "supply of funds"          schedule, as   in   Figure
1.   Which of the three segments of this schedule the firm will actually choose

depends    on its "demand" for funds: its marginal              product of new   capital.        Three

potential    positions of the marginal product curve are also shcwn in Figure 1.
       The   heights of the retentions and new shares segments of the supply curve
depend, in part, on what regime (and value of n ) the firm will                    face in the

future. Holding this factor constant, thr still depend on the tax rate,                      th,

the firm perceives as belonging to its clientele. Following the results in the

previous section, p ,        and hence the cost of capital along the first segment,

should be non—increasing with                The cost of capital in the presence of new

issues   should be non—decreasing.
       These results suggest that in periods when firms are observed to use more
expensive forms of finance, the projects they undertake have a higher marginal
product.     These higher returns should be observed in future years. Because we

do not observe marginal products, we must make some assumption about the shape

of the return function f(.) to proceed with our eiiirical analysis. For

simplicity,    we assume that f(.) is quadratic:

(5.11)       ft (Xt) =       4 Xt   —   y   Xj
                                             —33—


with     I constant and 4      a shift paraireter driving the productivity changes
that occur   over time.6 Since ft(Xt) =                  — 2 1 Xt, it   follows that the
net, before—tax return in period t from investments made in period s is:

(5.12)         =    (1_)(tS)    f5(X5)   =    (16)(t_s)    (csxs +   y x)

Thus,    total net returns before interest and taxes in period t are:

(5.13)     E =      E     =   E(l_6)(tS) (cx         +   y x)


If we imagine the firm as      assuming that it     will be "in the long run" in all

future   periods, we may write     (5.13) as:


(5.l)      Et =    CrKt
                          st
                          + Z (1_6)(t_s) a(gs_c)x5 +s(t
                                                     y (1)(t_S) X

where g is the current component of the cost of capital, as defined in
(5.lOa), and

(5.15)     Kt =
                   s t(1_5)(S_t) x
is the capital stock of the firm in period t.

           Equation (5.1I) will form the basis for the empirical results of this
paper. However, paranterization of Cr ,              g   and the error structure of   ear-

       Equation (.i1) expresses a relationship for each firm between net—of—

depreciation, before tax returns in period t, F, and historical values of

investment and the cost of capital. However, there are a number of practical

 difficulties that we must overcome before estimating the parameters of this
relationship.
        First of all, the equation calls for an infinite history we do not have.
For all firms, our observations begin onJ in 1955. By truncating, we omit the
effects of pre—1955 values on each period's earnings. Since these effects die
out at rate 6 ,              one   method of acccunting for then would be to allow for firm
effects that decay over time at rate                        than do this, we begin our
                                                             Rather
regressions          in 1963, allowing several years of data for initial lagged values.
     A second difficulty concerns our assumption that depreciation allowances
follow economic depreciations In reality, th do not. Over most of the sanle
period, investment in equipnent qualified for an investnnt tax                   credit   of 7 per-
cent    (raised to 10 percent in 1915), and depreciation allowances, while being

accelerated in 1954, 1962 and again in 1971, were based on historic cost.8

These characteristics caused the effective tax rate on corporate investment to

be below       the    statutory rate, in the aggregate, and to differ across invest-

ments.39           That is, the required before-tax rate of return needed to earn a given
after—tax          rate was lower than that described by (5.i1i),         in which the   statutory

rate appears. This does not affect the shape of before—tax returns over time,

mereJy    their level. Therefore,            (5.14) is     still appropriate,   but the cost f

capital tenn on the right—hand side must be adjusted downward. In princijiLe,
this adjustment should be different for each fins, since the debree of deviation
from a true income tax varies across assets. However, this Is a difficult
correction to make. One potential solution would be to multiply both sides of
(5.14)        by   (1_tc),   yielding an expression for the after—tax flows At (see
(5.3)    ).    This    would solve the problem if        firms   all faced true income taxes, but

at different rates, since the patterns over time of after—tax and before—tax
                                                 —36—



flows    would be the same. Unfortunately, the method of lowering taxes in prac-

tice is by changing the timing of after—tax flows corresponding to given before-

tax flows. For exasle, accelerated depreciation allowances cause taxes to be

shifted to later years, making the flow of after—tax earnings from a given

investment decay at a rate faster than 6                ,   at   which before—tax earnings decay.

Since this degree of shifting varies with the rate of effective taxation, a firm

by firm adjustment of 6 would still be required. Rather than attempt such

corrections, we present estimates using as the dependent variable both before—

tax and after—tax returns net of corrected depreciation, Et and At ,                         respec-
tively.

        Another problea concerns the unobservability of the cost of capital in each

period. We assume the rate Cr              is   constant over time for each firm, and,

following the theory of Section V, model the deviation of ct from
                                                                                       Cr,

a(s_cr)         (See (5.11) ), as a linear function of the firm's debt—equity ratio

in the beginning of that year and a dumnV               variable   equal to one if the firm

issued new shares in that year and zero otherwise. The expected coefficients

of each of these variables is positive, since the shadow price                        rises from
                                                                                 fl


zero as debt rises above its optimal value, to th when new shares are issued.

See (5.lOa) ).

        Because our data      does not fit into    the beginning—of—peri, end-of—period
distinction      of   the previous section, period t earnings may occur before period
t  investment. Thus,          we   omit current investment from the rit—hand side of the
equation we estimate.
        These   various modifications give us the equation, based on (5.1L):


(6.i)      Eit    =   cKt_i   +    c(i—6) t—s— d5x5 + cE(i_cS)
                              +      z (l_6)(t_5_1)x1

where dt is the new share dummy variable and bit the debt—equity ratio of

firm i in period t, and the variables               and Kit represent firm    i's
investment in period t and capital stock at the end of period t. The         term
czj corresponds to the firm's "normal" cost of capital Cr,

our   parameterization of a(g5_c), and
                                                                 (d     +
                                                                            'bt)     is

                                                 represents the decreasing returns

to scale term y (see (5.1L) ).         To account for the fact that the theory pre—

diets that Cr should fall with th, the firm's "clientele't tax rate,, and that

the additional Cost of new shares, represented by      c3, should rise with th,
we let j      and        be linear functions of the estimated "implicit" tax rates

of each firm, as described in Section III. To account for fact that we have not

treated risk explicitly, we also let the estimate of the normal required return,

al, depend on the firm's "beta", also described in Section III. Since we are

looking at returns to debt plus equity, rather than debt, we multiply each

firm's beta by the average ratio over the sample of equity to debt plus equity

for the firm. To correct for potential heteroskedasticity, we divide the obser-

vations for each firm by a trend value of assets, Vj, equal to the beginning of

sample period value of each firm's assets, inflated by the average annual growth

rate in real assets for all firms between 1963 and 1977, 5.5     percent.   We also

assume that the decreasing cost term y is proportional to 1/Vu, rather than

constant. This makes more sense for comparing firms of different size. This
                                                                                2
correction   amounts to dividing the weighted sum of squared investment terms x5
by V-j   squared,   rather than
      Finally,   we must specify the error structure. Since many firms derive ear-

nings from noncapitai. sources (rent, patents, etc.), firm effects should be

accounted for. We used a fixed effects, rather than a random effects, specifi-

cation, because the presence of higher earnings in any period would be predicted
                                        —33 —



by our model to be correlated with all the right—hand side variables.2 We also
allow for fixed time effects.

        We turn now to the results, sho'm in Tables 6.1 and 6.2 for the

before—taxand after—tax earnings measures, respectiver. (Variable definitions
are provided in Table 6.3.) In each table, results without fixed effects
removed are shown in the first two columns, while those with fixed effects

removed are shown in the third and fourth. Once fixed effects are removed, the

results    generally support te model outlined in Section V the parameter     vahies

are    reasonable in addition to having the correct sign.
         Looking first at before_tax earnings in Table 6.i,   we   find in column
(6.11) the results of a basic version of the model that does not allow for the
various    costs of capital measures to vary across firms. This model with firm

and time effects removed is presented in column (6.13).

         Coaring the two columns, we find that the allowance for fixed effects

lowers the sum of squared residuals significantly, and lowers the coefficient

of new shares and the basic estimate of the cost of capital, the coefficient of

K   (the latter ceases to be si,nificantly greater than zero). This may      result

from   a positive relationshij between firms with high earnings in general and
firms that issue new shares. The coefficients in equation (6.13)        suggest a
normal   before—tax real return of near zero, and a return of i6.o percent before

tax   on assets purchased in years when new shares are issued. The effect of
the decreasing returns term, K2, is also significantly positive, as predicted.
The leverage term Kb,    which should have a positive coefficient, is insignifi—

cantly negative.

        When firm tax
                   and risk effects are introduced, in equations (6.12) and
(6.l1), the inclusion of fixed effects makes a big difference in the results.

th   —   "Implicit"    tax rate of the finn's clientele


     —   The firm's "beta", multiplied by the firm's average ratio of equity
         to total market value.
Without fixed effects, (equation (6.12) )       several   of the variables are signifi-

cant and of the wrong sign. However, with fixed effects removed (equation

(6.14)), the coefficients are much more reaonable. The "normal" return (now a

risk—free rate) is still insignificantly positive. However, the coefficient on
Kt indicates that a firm with a      of 1 has a before—tax cost of capital of
23.3 percent. The coefficient on Kth indicates that the cost of retentions is
significantly reduced by an increase in the clientele tax rate, as our theory
predicts. However, the extra cost imposed by new share issuance is not signifi-
cantly affected by ti'.      The coefficients on Kb and K2 are now      significantly
negative,     for which we have no ready explanation.

        The   results for after—tax earnings are quite similar, with essentially all
the coefficients in equation (6.24) being appropriately smaller than       their coun-

terparts in (6.i4).

         Some care must be exercised in interpreting these findings. There still

remains a potential problem of simultaneity bias if the individual finn errors,
purged   of fixed effects, remain serially correlated. If      the unexplained random
component of earnings for a particular firm is positively autocorrelated, there
are two   potential sources    of bias in the estimated coefficients. First, as long
as    dividends   do not absorb the entire fluctuation in earnings, higher earnings

makes available a greater pool of retentions, making the issue of new shares

less likely, and possibly increasing the level of investment. This would tend

to bias downward the coefficient of the new share term, KN, and bias upward

the coefficient of K and K3. On the other hand, higher earnings today         may give
the    firm information on the profitability of its potential investment. If this

information leads to greater investment today, then the future       returns to

investment,    and hence the coefficient of the investment terms K and K, will
again be biased upward. The bias this effect induces in the new shares coef—
ficient depends on how the left out profitability variable depends on the like-
lihood   of new issues, given the level of investment. Under the hypothesis that

the   cost of capital does not increase when firms issue new shares, profitabiLity
can   be summarized by the   firm's real decisions — its   level of investment. Its

finan   cial policy is irrelevant. New issues may increase with profitability,

but variations in new issues independent of variations in investment can relate

only to such things as the level of retentions, already discussed. Thus, if new

shares are perceived by the firm     to be   no more expensive than retentions, only

the first, downward bias in the new shares coefficient will be present.

Therefore, our significantly positive coefficients in both before—tax and after—

tax regressions represent strong evidence against such a hypothesis.

        If new shares are perceived by the firm as more expensive, then the like-

lihood of new issues can increase with profitability, for a given level of

investment. M example is shown in Figure 2, where lower retentions shift the

supply of funds schedule to the left, from           to S1, and increased profi-

tability shifts   the marginal prokict curve up. Together, these shifts do not
increase   investment, but do cause the firm to issue new shares. Thus, a poten-

tial upward bias is present in the new shares coefficient, but only if new

shares are perceived by the firm as more expensive, in accordance with our

hypothesis.

      To avoid these possible biases, we reestimated the earnings ecjuations

(6.13), (6.14), (6.23) and (6.24) with a correction for first—order serial

correlation,   assumed constant across firms.     While correcting for potential

simultaneity   bias,   such a technique may substantially reduce the explanatory

power of a model in which the lag specification is uncertain. While we model

 earnings to flow from investment at a geometrically declining rate beginning in

the year after an investment, the exact pattern could vary substantially from

this. Such a specification error likely will be exacerbated by differencing.

For example, if earnings don't respond until two years after an investment, the

change in earnings in the year after an investment will be independent of the

amount of the investment.

        In light of this problem, the results in Thble 6.4 offer impressive support

for   the existence of the tax effects just found. The coefficients of KN and Kth
remain quite significant in all specifications, while the coefficients on KNth
remain   insignificant. The fact that the coefficients of K are no longer signi-

ficant may signal the presence in the original earnings regressions of the sort

of upward biases discussed above.

        In summary, our results support the hypothesis that new shares are perceived

by firms to be more expensive than retentions as a means of finance. Moreover,

the systematic variation of the cost of retentions with respect to indirect estimates

of the personal tax rates of finn stockholders suggests that this differential

is related to tax considerations (rather than transaction costs, for example).

These results are not consistent with the view that personal taxes don't matter,

which would predict no effect for Kth and (unless a nontax extra cost of new

shares issues were envisioned) KN, both of which have strongly significant coef-

ficients. Nor do they support the view that firms always behave as if they were

on the margin of issuing new shares, as the classifical or double—tax view would

suggest. This would predict a zero coefficient for KN, since whether firms

actually do issue new shares would be irrelevant. It would also    predict a pos-
itive   coefficient for Kth, since the cost of new shares is nondecreasing with

respect to th.

     That new shares are issued while dividends are paid also contradicts the
naive view that firms finance out of retentions whenever possible. However, our
results do support a view that firms, facing various constraints, must in the

short run behave in a manner not optimal in the long run, issuing new shares

and, perhaps, too much debt instead of cutting dividends. To facilitate the

application of our findings to the analysis of the welfare effects of changes in

the tax policy toward corporate source income, a better understanding of these

constraints is necessary.

12.   Most of our firnE have such data going back to 1958, althaigh for a few
      firms some of the years between 1958 and 1962 are missing. For such firms,
      we start with the first year after which observations are continuously
      available.
13.   The data on aggregate outstanding issues are obtained from Historical
      Statistics of the United States, p. 1005

14. Our procedure allows for changes in the method used by a firm.

15.   It is important to remember that book depreciation figures are distinct
      from depreciation allowances for tax purfoses, which are greatly distorted
      and change over time with changes in the tax law.
16. An alternative method of estniating      as the avernge of bodi depreciation

     divided by book net capital over the sample period was also evaluated. Its
     use in the empirical work produced similar results but a somewhat poorer
     fit than those reported in Section VI.
17. An alternative way of calculating this variable would be to add to earnings in—
     cor.porating the debt adjustment described above the corrected returns to debt.
18. We assume for all firnm that all interest payments were deducted at the
     standard marginal rate for corporations, .148 for essentially the entire
     period of estin.tion.

19. We use a cut—off of 2 percent of outstanding shares in this measure, since
     smaller new issues probably are related to such things as executive stock
     option plans, etc.

20. We assume debt is riskless, and that there is no bankruptcy.

21. The function f(.) is not subscripted by finn merely as a convenience.
     This assumption has no bearing on the results of this section.

22.    The amount Wh may be thought of as interest plus   labor income less consunip—
       tion   in period 1.
23. Althongh tax exnpt municipal debt does not play a role in a number of
     countries, it is important in the U.S. For example, in 1980, according to
     the Economic Report of the President (1982), state and municipal bond
     offerings were 142.3 billion dollars, slightly greater than corlorate issues
     of bonds and notes, which amounted to 140.9 billion dollars.
214.   If new shares are issued by firm i, then (Ei — Ni) represents the value
       of pre—existing shares of thefirm, and 1'?.(E — N) the endowment of
       individual h in firm 1.                   1


25. We do not impose restrictions on short sales of equity, either in total or
       with   respect to individual firms. While this could be done (as in Auerbach
       and King (1982) and Auerbach (1982b)) it unnecessarily complicates the
       present analysis.
26. See Auerbach and King (1982).
27. See Auerbach (1979b). Since dividends are taxed, each investor's wealth in
    the firm would equal the value of shares plus the after—tax current dividend.
28.    It is important here to stress, again, that these results relate to the
       specific character of the U.S. tax system. In other tax systns, such as
       in the United Kingdom and Germany, new shares are not necessarily a domin-
       ated form of finance. See the description in King (1977).

29. As a simplification, we assume that the future return from investment made
     in period t is independent of investments made in periods s > t.
     Clearly, this type of separability is unlikely to hold in general. One
     would expect that unusually high profit opportunities would be eroded by
       future increases in related investments. To son extent, this is accomo-
       dated below by the assumption of geometric decay. The important feature we
       wish to model is that unusually profitable investnEnts should produce
       noticeably high returns in the years immediately following. One could also
       derive this type of result from alternative models; for example, one with
       homogeneous capital goods but convex capital stock adjustment costs.

30.     We will discuss below   the   effects of more general depreciation schedules.

31. While prohibited in the U.K., share repurchases do infrequently occur in
     the U.S. While not illegal, they are discouraged by a number of provisions
     in the Internal Revenue Code (see Auerbach (1919b)).

32. A similar steady state analysis for equity—financed firms
     Edwards and Keen (1981).
                                                                           is   performed by


33. Auerbach (1979a). This follows directly from the fact that, at the margin,
           are indifferent between an extra dollar of after—tax dividends,
        firms
     (1 _th), and an additional dollar of firm assets.
34. The term ci. was equal to one in the result above since second period
        retentions were zero.
35. In Auerbach (1919a), this regime was characterized by a zero change in
     investment with rising q, since only equity finance was considered.

36.     In the equation actually estimated, we scale y by a trend measure of firm
        size   to make the equation comparable    for firn of different size.

31.     Such a procedure is described in Fakes and Griliches (1982).
38. For a discussion of such changes        see Auerbach (l982a).

39.     For historical values of such effective     tax rates, see Auerbach and
        Jorgenson (1980)   or Jorgenson and Sullivan (1982).
140.    The cutoff   for new shares here was 1 percent of existing shares. If firnE
        issued any   greater quantity of shares, the dummy was set equal to one. If
        the change   was less, the dummy was set equal to zero. Negative share
        issues, or   share repurchases, are relatively infrequent.

41.     Estimates without this correction yielded somewhat different values for
        c, but had little effect on the other important coefficients.
142.    See Mundlak (1918).
143. The      F—test statistic equals (55.145          /288   =   10.59.

1414.   For example, Fakes and Griliches (1982) estimate unconstrained distributed
        lags of earnin on investment, assuming all firms' capital stocks have
        this same pattern of returns. They find the lag weights do not decline
        from the first year, but peak in the second. Application of their tech-
        nique to the current problem would be complicated by the presumed differen-
        ces in return patterns and the additional variables in the earnings
        regressions. However, further investigation in this direction would be
        quite useful.
