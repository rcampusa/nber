                                             ABSTRACT

The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we analyse the structure of wages within and between
Belgian firms. Next, we examine how the productivity of these firms is influenced by their internal
wage dispersion. To do so, we use a large matched employer-employee data set (i.e., a combination
of the 1995 'Structure of Earnings' and 'Structure of Business' Surveys). On the basis of the methodology
developed by Winter-Ebmer and Zweimuller (1999), we find that within-firm wage dispersion has
a positive and significant effect on firm productivity. This result is robust to controls for individual
and firm characteristics as well as to instrumenting the wage inequality variable. Findings also suggest
that the intensity of this effect is stronger within firms with: i) a majority of blue-collar workers, and
ii) a high degree of monitoring. These results are more in line with the 'tournament' models than with
the 'fairness, morale and cohesiveness' models.

1. Introduction

Relative wages are often considered as a key determinant of the workers’ effort. Indeed, since
workers often compare their wages with those of their co-workers, it is argued that the intra-
firm wage dispersion has an impact on the individual worker’s productivity and thus on the
average firm performance. However, there is no consensus regarding the precise impact of
intra-firm wage dispersion on firm productivity. On the one hand, the single-period rank-order
version of the ‘tournament’ models (e.g., Lazear and Rosen, 1981) stresses the positive
influence of wage inequality within a firm on the worker’s effort. This model suggests that
firms should implement a differentiated prize structure and award the largest prize to the most
productive worker. On the other hand, other theories argue for some wage compression within
a firm by emphasising the importance of fairness and cooperation among the workforce (e.g.,
Akerlof and Yellen, 1990; Levine, 1991).


Empirical studies, focusing on the relationship between wage disparities and firm
performance, are not very numerous and their results vary significantly. Due to a lack of
appropriate data, these studies often rely on economy-wide inequality indicators or use ‘self-
constructed’ indicators of firm performance. Moreover, they are generally restricted to a
specific segment of the labour force (e.g., the top-management level) or a particular sector of
the economy (e.g., the manufacturing sector, academic departments, professional team
sports). In sum, the available evidence does not appear to be very compelling yet (Frick et al.,
2003).


The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we analyse the structure of wages within and between
Belgian firms. Next, we examine how the productivity of these firms is influenced by their
internal wage dispersion. Our study is based on a unique matched employer-employee data
set. This data set derives from the combination of the 1995 ‘Structure of Earnings Survey’ and
the 1995 ‘Structure of Business Survey’. The former contains detailed information on firm
characteristics (e.g., sector of activity, size of the firm, and level of wage bargaining) and on
individual workers (e.g., gross hourly wages, bonuses, age, education, sex, and occupation).
The latter provides firm-level information on financial variables (e.g., gross operating surplus,
value added, and value of production).




                                                                                               2
To analyse the impact of wage dispersion on firm productivity, we followed the methodology
developed by Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999). It rests upon a two-step estimation
procedure. Firstly, we compute conditional intra-firm wage differentials by taking the
standard errors of wage regressions run for each firm. Next, we use these conditional wage
differentials as an explanatory variable in a firm-level productivity regression. However, as a
sensitivity test, we also analyse the impact of unconditional indicators of intra-firm wage
dispersion on firm productivity. These indicators include the standard deviation, the
coefficient of variation and the max-min ratio of the gross hourly wages within the firm. The
productivity of a firm is measured by the value-added per employee. We address the potential
simultaneity problem between wage dispersion and firm productivity using information from
the Belgian income tax system. More precisely, we apply two-stage least squares (2SLS) and
instrument the dispersion of wages including bonuses by the intra-firm standard deviation of
income taxes on gross earnings excluding bonuses.


To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to examine the effect of intra-firm wage
dispersion on firm performance in the private sector using both a conditional wage inequality
indicator and direct information on firm productivity. It is also one of the few, with Bingley
and Eriksson (2001) and Heyman (2002), to consider potential simultaneity problems.
Empirical findings, reported in this paper, support the existence of a positive and significant
relationship between wage inequality and firm productivity. Moreover, we find that the
intensity of this relationship is larger for blue-collar workers and within firms with a high
degree of monitoring. These results are more in line with the ‘tournament’ models than with
the ‘fairness, morale and cohesiveness’ models.


The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Section 2 reviews the literature (both
theoretical and empirical) dealing with the impact of intra-firm wage dispersion on firm
productivity. Section 3 summarises the main features of the wage bargaining process in the
Belgian private sector. Section 4 and 5 describe the data and variables as well as structure of
wages within and between Belgian firms. The impact of intra-firm wage dispersion on firm
productivity is analysed in Section 6. The last section concludes.

2. Review of the Literature


2.1. Theoretical Findings


A first interpretation of the relationship between within-firm wage dispersion and firm
performance has been provided by Akerlof and Yellen (1988). On the basis of the effort
version of the ‘efficiency wage’ theory (Solow, 1979), the authors argue that, in a firm where
the workers’ characteristics are not totally observable and where the monitoring of their
actions is not perfect, employers have to find well-suited incentives to maximise the workers’
effort. According to Akerlof and Yellen (1988), the effort function of a worker can be written
as follows: e = e( 2(w)), where e denotes the level of effort and            2
                                                                                 (w) the variance of wages
within the firm. This expression shows that the worker’s effort does not only depend on the
wage level but also on the degree of salary dispersion within the firm. Using this expression,
the authors argue that a compressed wage distribution improves labour relations and
stimulates the average workers’ effort. To put it differently, firms should achieve a greater
output per worker if their wage dispersion is low.


Later, Akerlof and Yellen (1990) developed the ‘fair wage-effort’ hypothesis. This hypothesis
clarifies their previous reasoning by developing in greater detail the notion of fairness and
introducing the concept of relative wages.1 The basic idea is that workers often compare their
wages either internally (i.e., with workers within the same firm) or externally (i.e., with
workers in other firms or industries). Therefore, Akerlof and Yellen (1990) consider the
following worker’s effort function: e = min [(w / ŵ ), 1] , with w the actual wage, ŵ the fair
wage and e equal to one if the level of effort is normal. This expression shows that workers
reduce their effort if their actual wage falls short of the wage they regard as fair. According to
the authors, a wage is generally considered as fair if the pay spread is lower than the
performance differential. This means that a worker would act so as to preserve a certain
equilibrium between the subjective value of input and the subjective value of return. Levine
(1991) put forward this argument by stressing that pay compression, within a firm where



1
    The ‘fair wage-effort’ hypothesis is based on the social exchange theory in sociology (e.g., Blau, 1955;
Homans, 1961) and on the equity theory in psychology (e.g., Adams, 1963). Both theories show the existence of
a relationship between effort and fairness.



                                                                                                           4
teamwork among employees is essential (i.e., participatory firms), sustains and stimulates
cohesiveness, which increases the firm’s total productivity.


The above notions of fairness, morale and cohesiveness led Hibbs and Locking (2000) to
                                                                               [       ]
define the following firm-level production function: Q = Ef σ 2 (w) F (L, ...) , with Q the real
value-added, Ef(.) the labour effectiveness depending on the within-firm wage dispersion, F a
standard production function and L the labour inputs to production. This expression shows
that the performance of a firm depends positively upon the efficiency of labour, which is
negatively correlated with the intra-firm wage dispersion (i.e., Ef’<0, Ef’’>0). As a result, this
model of ‘fairness, morale and cohesiveness’ suggests that firms have a strong incentive to
implement a wage distribution that is more compressed than the variation in workers’
productivities.


A complementary theory promoting wage compression to increase firm performance has been
developed by Milgrom (1988), and Milgrom and Roberts (1990). The authors emphasize that
(white-collar) workers have incentives to: i) withhold information from managers in order to
increase their influence and, ii) engage in costly rent-seeking activities instead of productive
work. They also argue that the implementation of some wage equity can reduce the potential
tendency of workers to take personal interest decisions, which may not be profitable for the
organisation as a whole. Moreover, they stress that it is more costly to monitor the actions of
white-collar workers. Therefore, lower levels of wage dispersion would be even more
important for the latter.


In contrast to the previous literature, the ‘relative compensation’ or ‘tournament’ model,
developed by Lazear and Rosen (1981), points to the benefits of a more dispersed wage
structure, deriving from a performance-based pay system. The single-period rank-order
version of the tournament model suggests that managers should introduce a large spread in the
rewards of workers in order to stimulate their effort. In other words, firms should establish a
prize structure and award the largest prize to the most productive worker.2 The intuition of
this model is as follows.3 Consider two identical risk-neutral workers j and k and a risk-

    There is some ambiguity in the literature about the definition of a prize. It can be seen either as a promotion
(i.e., to get a task with higher responsibilities and to rise in the firm hierarchy) or as a bonus.

neutral firm, with a compensation scheme such that the most productive worker receives a
high wage (WH) and the less productive a low wage (WL). Let us also assume that the player’s
output level is given by (1):


qi = ei + εi ,    i = j, k                                                                      (1)


with qi and ei respectively the player’s output and effort level, and εi a random component
(e.g., luck). Finally, suppose that the expected utility of the jth player is given by (2):


P(WH – C(ej)) + (1 – P)(WL – C(ej)) = P(WH – WL) + WL – C(ej)                                  (2)


where P is the probability of winning the game and C(.) is a cost function, with C’>0 and
C’’<0. In this framework, the probability for the player j to win the game is as follows:


prob(qj >qk) = prob((εk - εj) < (ej – ek))
                 = prob((ej – ek) > )
                 = G(ej – ek),                                                                  (3)


where = (εk - εj),           ~ g( ) with zero mean, and G is the cumulative density function of . A
worker maximizes his expected utility by choosing the effort level at which the marginal cost
of effort is equal to its marginal benefit. Therefore, worker i’s optimal effort choice is defined
by (4):


(WH – WL) ∂P/∂ei - ∂C/∂ei = 0                                                                   (4)


If both players are maximising (3), we find that:


∂P/∂ej = ∂G(ej – ek)/∂ej
          = g(ej – ek),                                                                        (5)


which after substitution in (4) gives player j’s best reaction function:
(WH – WL) g(ej – ek) = ∂C/∂ej                                                                  (6)




                                                                                                 6
Given the assumption of identical workers, we know that both players will choose the same
level of effort. In symmetric Nash equilibrium, ej = ek and the outcome of the game is
random, i.e. P = 0,5. Therefore, expression (6) can be rewritten as follows:


(WH-WL) g(0) = ∂C/∂ej                                                                                             (7)


Two lessons can be drawn from equation (7). Firstly, we find that ceteris paribus the level of
effort is increasing with the prize dispersion (WH – WL). Secondly, expression (7) shows that,
for a given wage spread (WH – WL), a higher density at the expectation of the random
components of the output, the more it pays to exert effort. This theory has been generalized by
McLaughlin (1988) for n players. The author shows that the number of players matters and
that the probability to win a game decreases with the number of contestants. Consequently, to
stimulate the workers’ effort, there should be a positive correlation between the prize spread
and the number of contestants.


Lazear (1989, 1995) argues, however, that high within-firm wage dispersion generates more
competition between the workers which may negatively affect firm performance. Indeed,
considering an organisation in which several workers are non-cooperative or have a sabotage
behaviour (‘hawks’) and others who are less aggressive (‘doves’), the author shows that wage
compression is crucial for firm performance.4 The point is that the non-cooperative activities
adopted by ‘hawks’ reduce the total effort level of the workers. In other words, the positive
impact of an output-based pay system on firm performance may be offset by a lower level of
work cohesion due to the sabotage behaviour of ‘hawks’. As a result, it appears profitable for
a firm to: i) adequately sort out workers before hiring them and, ii) adjust the compensation
scheme to the hierarchical level.


A further strand of the literature, developed by Frey (1997) and Frey and Osterloh (1997),
focuses on the interplay between wage dispersion and intrinsic motivation.5 This literature
shows that the implementation of explicit incentive contracts (e.g., performance-based pay

4
    According to Lazear (1989, 1995), ‘hawks’ are often found at the top level of the organisation, i.e. mainly
among white-collar workers. His arguments are thus in line with those of Milgrom (1988) and Milgrom and
Roberts (1990). The counter-productive effect should be greatest within the higher echelons of the hierarchy.
5
    It derives from the psychological literature which suggests that intrinsic motivation is the main driving force of
workers’ effort.



                                                                                                                    7
systems) can crowd out the intrinsic motivation of the workers by generating excessive
external monitoring (in particular, for workers who need autonomy in their job and who have
high responsibilities). However, it can also enhance intrinsic motivation by supporting the
workers’ own motivation, self-esteem and feeling of competence. In sum, this literature
emphasizes the importance of a correct match between the compensation scheme and the
monitoring environment within a firm (Belfield and Marsden, 2003).


2.2. Empirical Findings


Empirical studies examining the relationship between wage disparities and firm performance
are not very numerous and their results vary markedly. Due to a lack of appropriate data,
these studies often rely on economy-wide inequality indicators or use ‘self-constructed’
indicators of firm performance. Moreover, they are generally restricted to a specific segment
of the labour force (e.g., the top-management level) or a particular sector of the economy
(e.g., the manufacturing sector, academic departments, professional team sports). In what
follows, we review the main features of these studies.6


A first strand of the empirical literature provides evidence in favour of the ‘fairness, morale
and cohesiveness’ theory, developed by Akerlof and Yellen (1990) and Levine (1991).
Cowherd and Levine (1992), for instance, examine the relationship between interclass pay
equity7 and the performance of business units, by integrating the body of equity, relative
deprivation and quality management theories. Their study is based on data collected from 102
business units with more than 59 employees, in North America (72%) and Europe (28%). The
performance of a business unit is measured by the quality of its production.8 According to the
authors, product quality is a good indicator of firm performance since it is: i) difficult for
managers to control, and ii) a function of the willingness of lower-level employees to
contribute more than can formally be asked from them. Their empirical findings show the

6
    For a summary see Appendix 1.
7
    Interclass pay equity is measured by the pay relation of hourly paid employees to top-three levels of
management, controlling for the business size effect. A business unit is defined as any autonomous
organisational unit that has top management with decision-making authority in areas like manufacturing and
sales.
8
    The latter is measured by customers in relative terms, i.e. in comparison with the product quality of the main
competitors of each business unit.



                                                                                                                8
existence of a substantial positive relationship between interclass pay equity and product
quality. The authors attribute this result to the impact of pay equity on three aspects of lower-
level employee motivation, i.e. commitment to managerial goals, effort and cooperation.


Pfeffer and Langton (1993) analyse how within-academic departments wage dispersion and
pay schemes affect the individual’s satisfaction, research performance and cooperation, using
a large sample of college and university faculty in the UK.9 Their data set contains
information on circa 17,000 college and university professors from 600 academic
departments located in some 300 institutions.10 Salary dispersion is measured by an
unconditional indicator, i.e. the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the
mean) in salaries within a given academic department. Controlling for numerous predictors,
the authors observe statistically and substantively significant negative effects of pay
dispersion. To put it differently, they find that, on average, people are less satisfied, do less
collaborate on research, and have a lower productivity when the pay distribution is more
dispersed. Moreover, results show that the extent to which wage dispersion produces adverse
effects depends upon one’s position in the salary structure and factors such as information,
commitment, consensus and the level of certainty in the evaluation process.


A number of studies, essentially concentrated on the US, have been devoted to the interaction
between salary dispersion and performance in the team sports industry. Using mainly
unconditional measures of wage inequality (e.g., the Gini-index), these studies generally
conclude that pay compression is beneficial for team performance (e.g., the win-loss
percentage).11 The study of Frick et al. (2003) is the first to attempt to measure the impact of
pay inequalities on the performance of professional team sports across different leagues. Their
approach enables to implicitly control for the influence of different institutional regimes and
production technologies. Using panel data from the four major North American sports leagues
(i.e., baseball, basketball, football and hockey), their study supports neither the ‘fairness,
morale and cohesiveness’ hypotheses nor the ‘tournament’ theories. Indeed, findings vary

9
    The data come from the Carnegie Commission’s 1969 survey of college and university faculty.

     The authors confined their attention to respondents in departments with a size of 20 or larger that had a
response rate to the questionnaire greater than 50%.

substantially between the four leagues. According to their estimates, a higher degree of intra-
team wage dispersion is beneficial to the performance of professional basketball and hockey
teams.12 However, the reverse relationship is found for football and baseball teams, i.e. a team
is more successful if its pay distribution is more compressed. The authors attribute the
diversity in their results to the different degrees of ‘cooperation requirements’ in the four
leagues.


Another strand of the empirical literature offers evidence in favour of the ‘tournament’ theory,
developed by Lazear and Rosen (1981). Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999), for instance,
investigate the impact of intra-firm wage dispersion on firm performance using panel data
covering the whole Austrian workforce for the period 1975-91.13 They measure within-firm
wage inequality by the standard errors of firm-level wage equations. This conditional
indicator controls for the composition of the workforce within each firm.14 Unfortunately, the
authors did not observe the financial performance of the firms. As a result, they have
constructed their own performance indicator, i.e. standardised wages. Of course, this
instrument is not perfectly adequate. Be it as it may, controlling for several predictors, their
findings suggest the existence of a positive and hump-shaped relationship between intra-firm
wage dispersion and firm performance, for both blue- and white-collar workers. Yet, the
overall pattern appears more monotonic for blue-collar workers. These findings are in line
with the hypothesis that too little wage inequality negatively affects firm performance due to a
lack of incentives. However, they also suggest that excessive wage dispersion can be harmful
for productivity because of fairness effects. According to the authors, the contrasting results
for blue- and white-collar workers appear to be consistent both with theories of intrinsic
motivation and rent-seeking, and with the prevalence of piece rates in blue-collar jobs.


Hibbs and Locking (2000) examine the effects of changes in the overall wage dispersion,
during the periods 1964-93 and 1972-93, on the productive efficiency of Swedish industries
and plants. To do so, they firstly decompose the total variance in individual wages within and
between plants (and industries). Next, they integrate the squared coefficients of variation of

     For hockey teams, the coefficient is positive but not significantly different from zero.
13
     Their sample is restricted to firms with more than 20 employees and with at least 4 data points.

     The data report monthly earnings that are top coded. The explanatory variables in the tobit wage regressions,
ran separately for each firm, include age, age squared and dummies for sex, blue-collar, foreigner and two tenure
dummies. Information on education levels is not available.



                                                                                                               10
these components at the plant (or industry) level, in an Akerlof and Yellen’s (1990) type of
production function. The dependent variable in this equation, i.e. their performance indicator,
is the log of real value-added at the plant (or industry) level.15 Their empirical findings do not
confirm that wage levelling within plants and industries enhance productivity. Therefore, they
do not support the ‘fairness, morale and cohesiveness’ theories.


Bingley and Eriksson (2001) analyse the impact of pay spread and skewness on two
performance indicators, i.e. firm productivity and employee effort. Their study uses
longitudinal matched employer-employee data comprising information on Danish medium-
and large private sector firms during the period 1992-95. It is the first to address potential
simultaneity problems using information from the income tax system. Firm productivity and
employee effort are estimated by the total factor productivity and the sickness absence,
respectively. Differences in firm productivity effects between the occupational groups and
types of firms give support to the theories of fairness, tournaments and tastes for skewness. In
contrast, individual effort effects only back up the tournament theory.


Finally, a number of papers present evidence on the interaction between the pay structure of
top executives and firm performance. Focusing on managers in large US firms, Leonard
(1990) finds no significant relationship between the standard deviation of pay and firm
performance, i.e. the return on investment. In contrast, using respectively US and Swedish
data, Main et al. (1993) and Eriksson (1999) report a positive impact of top executive pay
dispersion on firm performance. The latter is measured by returns on assets and the
profits/sales ratio, respectively. The paper of Heyman (2002) is the first to explicitly control
for firm differences in human capital when testing several predictions from the tournament
theory for white-collar workers and in particular managers.16 Potential endogeneity problems
are addressed using lagged predetermined values of wage dispersion. On the basis of a large
matched employer-employee data set for the Swedish economy in 1991 and 1995, the author
finds a positive effect of wage dispersion on profits.

15
     Their production function is as follows: ln[Q] = ln[Ef(σ²(w)) F(.)], where Ef(σ²(w))) = Ef(CV²(W),CV²(B)). In
this expression, Q represent the real value-added, Ef(.) the labour effectiveness depending on σ²(w) (i.e., the total
variation in individual wages), and F(.) a standard production function (e.g., Cobb-Douglas, CES or Translog).
CV²(W) and CV²(B) stand respectively for the within and between components of the total variance of
individual wages (squared coefficient of variation) among workers assortment by plants (or industries).
16
     His conditional indicator of wage dispersion is the same as in Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999).

3. Wage Bargaining in Belgium


Before describing our data set and turning to the empirical analysis, we briefly summarize the
main features of the wage bargaining process in the Belgian private sector.


In the countries of North America the legal provisions offer workers the possibility of voting
for or against their companies’ joining a union in elections supervised by the public
authorities. This means that the union can earn the exclusive right to represent all the workers,
whether union members or not, in bargaining with the employers. Yet as the majority of the
collective agreements are negotiated at the level of the individual companies, the institutional
system leads to a clear distinction between the unionised establishments, in other words those
which are subject to a collective agreement, and the non-unionised establishments. Hence, the
rate of unionisation provides a good approximation of the coverage rate/the bargaining
regime.


In Belgium, as in the majority of European countries, the situation is very different. The point
is that wage bargaining in the Belgian private sector occurs at three levels : the national
(interprofessional) level, the sectoral level and the company level. They generally occur every
two years on a pyramidal basis. In principle, they are inaugurated by a national collective
agreement defining a minimum level in wage terms. This national agreement can be improved
within every sector of activity. Then we have the company negotiations where the sectoral
collective agreements may be renegotiated, except where there is a so-called imperative
clause. However, these cannot give rise to a collective agreement which would run counter to
the sectoral and/or national agreements. In other words, the wage bargained at the firm level
can only be greater or equal to the wage set at the national and/or industry level.


Belgium is characterised, in addition, by a coverage rate of about 90% (OECD, 1997). This
stems from the fact that non-unionised workers, like employers not members of an employers’
organisation, are generally covered by a collective labour agreement. The point is that Article
19 of the law dated 5 December 1968 specifies that a collective agreement is automatically
binding upon the signatory organisations, employers who are members of those organisations
or who have personally concluded the agreement, employers joining those organisations after
the date of the conclusion of the agreement, and finally, all workers, whether unionised or



                                                                                              12
not, who are employed by an employer so bound. Moreover, most of the sectoral collective
agreements have been rendered obligatory by Royal Decree. This means that they apply
compulsorily to all companies in the sector and to their workers, whether or not they are
members of the signatory organisations (employers’ organisations or unions).17


To sum up, unlike in the US or Canada, the bargaining regime in companies in the Belgian
private sector does not derive directly from the latter’s union membership. It is reflected more
through the level of wage bargaining. The heart of the wage bargaining lies at the sectoral
level in Belgium. However, in certain cases, sectoral agreements are renegotiated (improved)
within individual companies.


4. Data and Variables


Our analysis is based upon a unique combination of two large-scale data sets. The first,
conducted by Statistics Belgium18, is the 1995 ‘Structure of Earnings Survey’ (SES). It covers
all Belgian firms employing at least 10 workers and with economic activities within sections
C to K of the Nace Rev.1 nomenclature. It thus encompasses the following sectors: mining
and quarrying (C), manufacturing (D), electricity and water supply (E), construction (F),
wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household
goods (G), hotels and restaurants (H), transport, storage and communication (I), financial
intermediation (J), and real estate, renting and business activities (K). The survey contains a
wealth of information, provided by the management of the firms, both on the characteristics
of the firms (e.g., sector of activity, number of workers, level of collective wage bargaining,
type of economic and financial control, region) and on the individual employees (e.g., age,
educational level, tenure, gross earnings, paid hours, sex, occupation, type of contract, annual
bonuses).19 Gross hourly wages – without bonuses20 – are calculated by dividing total gross

17
     The trade union density in Belgium stands at around 54% (OECD, 1997).
18
     According to the instructions given by Eurostat (E-U regulation Nr. 2744/95)
19
     The SES is a stratified sample. The stratification criteria refer respectively to the region (NUTS1), the
principal economic activity (NACE-groups) and the size of the firm (determined by the data obtained from the
Social Security Organisation). The sample size in each stratum depends on the size of the firm. Sampling
percentages of firms equal respectively 10, 50 and 100% when the number of workers is lower than 50, between
50 and 99, and above 100. Within a firm, sampling percentages of employees also depend on size. Sampling
percentages of employees reach respectively 100, 20 and 10% when the number of workers is lower than 50,



                                                                                                           13
earnings (including earnings for overtime hours and premiums for shift work, night work
and/or weekend work) in the reference period (October 1995) by the corresponding number of
total paid hours (including paid overtime hours). In contrast, gross hourly wages – with
bonuses – are obtained by adding to the gross hourly wages (without bonuses) the annual
bonuses divided by: i) the number of month to which the bonuses correspond and ii) the
number of total paid hours in the reference period, respectively.


Unfortunately, the SES provides no financial information. This is why the SES has been
combined with the 1995 ‘Structure of Business Survey’ (SBS). It is a firm-level survey,
conducted by Statistics Belgium, with a different coverage than the SES in that it includes
neither the financial sector (Nace J) nor the firms with less then 20 employees. Both data sets
have been merged by Statistics Belgium using the firm social security number. The SBS
provides firm-level information on financial variables such as sales, value added, production
value, gross operating surplus and value of purchased goods and services.


The final sample, combining both data sets, covers 34,969 individuals working for 1,498
firms.21 It is representative of all firms employing at least 20 workers within sections C to K
of the Nace Rev.1 nomenclature, with the exception of the financial sector.


5. Structure of Wages Within and Between Firms


In this section, we analyse the structure of gross hourly wages, with and without bonuses, in
the Belgian private sector. In particular, we focus on the dispersion of wages within and
between firms. Between firms wage dispersion is measured by the standard deviation of each
firm’s mean wage. Within firms wage inequality is estimated by the mean over all firms of
each firm’s standard deviation, coefficient of variation and max-min ratio of wages,


between 50 and 99, and above 100. The consequence of these stratification criteria is that the number of data
points depends upon firm size. For this reason, wage inequality indicators computed in Sections 5 and 6 may be
slightly biased. Finally, let us also notice that no threshold at the upper limit of wages is to be found in the SES.
To put it differently, wages are not censored. For an extended description of the SES see Demunter (2000).
20
     Annual bonuses include irregular payments which do not occur during each pay period, such as pay for
holiday, 13th month or profit-sharing.
21
     If we only consider full-time employees (i.e., individuals working minimum 30 hours per week) and firms
with at least 25 workers, our sample still covers 31,788 individuals working for 1,445 firms.



                                                                                                                  14
respectively. As agreed, we only consider full-time employees (i.e., individuals working
minimum 30 hours per week) and firms with at least 25 workers. Statistics on the structure of
wages have been computed for the overall sample as well as by firm size (i.e., number of
employees below or above 100), level of collective wage agreement (i.e. only national and/or
sectoral collective agreement versus firm level collective agreement) and composition of the
workforce (i.e., majority of blue- versus white-collar workers). Qualitative results are similar
for gross hourly wages with and without bonuses. Therefore, in what follows, we solely
comment on the latter.22


5.1. Overall Sample


Table 1 shows that, for the overall sample, the mean individual gross hourly wage stands at
12.25 EUR with a standard deviation equal to 5.38. We also find that the dispersion of wages
between firms is slightly higher than within firms (3.01 versus 2.90). Moreover, there appears
to be a positive and significant correlation between the average and standard deviation of
wages within firms. Thus, results suggest that high-paying firms are characterized by a more
dispersed wage structure.


5.2. Firm Size


Besides, we see that the mean and dispersion of wages increase with firm size. We also notice
that for both small and large firms: i) the correlation between the average and standard
deviation of wages within firms remains positive and significant, and ii) the wage inequality
between firms is slightly larger than the wage inequality within firms. However, wage
dispersion within and between firms rises with firm size.


The positive relationship between wages and firm size is in line with neo-classical and
institutional arguments supporting the existence of a positive size-wage premium. These
arguments suggest inter alia that large employers: (i) hire more qualified workers (e.g.,
Hamermesh, 1990; Kremer and Maskin, 1996; Troske, 1999), (ii) compensate for bad
working conditions, (iii) have more market power and share their excess profits with their
workers (e.g., Mellow, 1982; Slichter, 1950; Weiss, 1966), (iv) avoid or mimic unionisation

22
     Statistics on the structure of gross hourly wages with bonuses are reported in Appendix 2.



                                                                                                  15
(e.g., Brown et al., 1990; Voos, 1983), and (v) substitute high monitoring costs with wage
premia (e.g., Eaton and White, 1983; Garen, 1985; Lucas, 1978; Oi, 1983; Stigler, 1962).23
How are we to explain that both within and between firms wage dispersion increase with firm
size ? Davis and Haltiwanger (1996) argue that because large firms are more technologically
diversified (horizontally and vertically) their workforce is more heterogeneous. Hence, within
firms wage dispersion is likely to rise with employer size. However, in contrast to our
findings, the authors expect between firms wage dispersion to fall with firm size (due to the
life-cycle dynamics of firms). Another factor that can explain higher wage dispersion within
large firms is linked to the tournament theory (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). The tournament
theory points to the benefits of a more dispersed wage structure, deriving from a performance-
based pay system. In other words, this theory suggests that firms should establish a prize
structure and award the largest prize to the most productive worker. Moreover, according to
McLaughlin (1988), to stimulate the workers’ effort there should be positive correlation
between the prize spread and the number of contestants. Since the number of contestants is
likely to rise with firm size, one may expect a more dispersed wage structure within large
firms.24


5.3. Level of Wage Bargaining


As expected, Table 1 indicates that on average workers, whose wages are renegotiated
collectively at the firm level, earn higher wages. This result is in line with earlier findings for
Belgium. Using the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, Rycx (2003) reports indeed that ceteris
paribus workers covered by a company collective agreement (CA) earn 5.1% more than their
opposite numbers who are (solely) covered by the national and/or sectoral CAs. A similar
finding is found by Plasman et al. (2006). Table 1 also shows that while within firms wage
dispersion is higher when wages are renegotiated collectively in house, between firms wage
dispersion is larger when wages are solely covered by a national and/or sectoral CA.
Although caution is required, these findings suggest that the bargaining regime has an impact
on the structure of wages even in a corporatist country like Belgium (e.g., Freeman, 1980,
1982; Gosling and Machin, 1995; Rodriguez-Gutierrez, 2001).

  Empirical evidence on the firm-size wage premium in Belgium is provided by Lallemand et al. (2005).

  Davis and Haltiwanger (1996) for the US and Lallemand and Rycx (2006) for European countries provided
empirical evidence on how and why the wage distribution differs among firms of different sizes.

5.4. Composition of the Workforce


Finally, let us also note that: i) the mean wage is around 2.3 EUR higher within firms
employing a majority of white-collar workers, and ii) the structure of wages is more
compressed when blue-collar workers compose the majority of the workforce.


6. Wage Inequality and Firm Productivity


In this section, we analyse the impact of intra-firm wage dispersion on firm productivity in the
Belgian private sector.


6.1. Methodology and Indicators


There are several ways to compute intra-firm wage inequality. On the one hand, wage
dispersion can be measured between unequal workers by unconditional indicators (e.g., the
Gini index, the white/blue-collar wage ratio or the pay gap between managers and the rest of
the workforce). On the other hand, it can be defined for workers with similar observable
characteristics. In this case, wage dispersion is measured by the residual inequality, after
controlling for human capital variables.


Although unconditional indices may have appeal if the analysis focuses on the effect of
CEO’s pay on firm performance, many theories like ‘tournaments’ or ‘hawks and doves’ refer
to wage differentials between similar workers (Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller, 1999). As a
result, a conditional indicator appears more appropriate for our study. Hence, we follow the
methodology developed by Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999). However, as a sensitivity
test, we also analyse the impact of three unconditional indicators of intra-firm wage
dispersion on firm productivity. These indicators include the standard deviation, the
coefficient of variation and the max-min ratio of the gross hourly wages within the firm.


The methodology of Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999) rests upon a two step estimation
procedure. In the first step, we estimate by OLS the following wage equation for each firm:


lnWij = α 0 + α 1′ Yij +   ij                                                               (8)


                                                                                              18
where Wij is the gross hourly wage (with bonuses) of worker i in firm j, Yij is a vector of
individual characteristics including age, age squared, sex, education (two dummies) and
occupation (one dummy) and εij is the usual error term. The standard errors of these
regressions (σj) are used as a measure of conditional intra-firm wage dispersion.


In the second step, we estimate by OLS the following firm-level performance regression:


ln Pj = β 0 + β1′σ j + β 2′ X j + β 3′Z j + υ j                                             (9)


where Pj is the productivity of firm j, σj is the conditional indicator of the intra-firm wage
dispersion, Xj contains aggregated characteristics of workers, Zj includes employer
characteristics and υj is the usual error term. The productivity of a firm (Pj) is measured by
the value-added (at factor costs) per employee. It is obtained by dividing the firm annual gross
operating income (plus subsidies, minus indirect taxes) by the number of workers in the firm.
The main explanatory variable in equation (9) is the conditional intra-firm wage dispersion
(σj) estimated in step 1. Equation (9) contains numerous control variables for the composition
of the workforce (Xj) as well as for firm characteristics (Zj). These control variables include
the share of the workforce that: i) at most has attended lower secondary school, ii) has more
than 10 years of tenure and iii) is younger than 25 and older than 50 years, respectively. The
share of women, the share of blue-collar workers, the share of workers supervising co-
workers, sectoral affiliation (5 dummies), the size of the firm (the number of workers) and the
level of wage bargaining (2 dummies) are also included.


An important problem to consider is the potential simultaneity between productivity and wage
dispersion. Indeed, it may be argued that highly productive firms pay larger bonuses, which in
turn leads to more wage inequality. We address this issue using information from the income
tax system. More precisely, we use two-stage least squares (2SLS) and instrument the
dispersion of wages including bonuses by the intra-firm standard deviation of income taxes on
gross earnings excluding bonuses. Of course, it is very difficult to find an appropriate
instrument for intra-firm wage inequality. However, we believe that our instrument is of
potential interest for breaking the simultaneity problem between productivity and wage
dispersion since it is less affected by rent-sharing. In other words, we expect the intra-firm
standard deviation of income taxes on gross earnings excluding bonuses to be uncorrelated (or


                                                                                             19
at least less correlated) with the error term and highly correlated with the endogenous variable
(i.e., wage dispersion). Statistics on workers’ income taxes, available in our data set, have
been estimated by Statistics Belgium. To do so, Statistics Belgium relied on individual gross
annual earnings, excluding bonuses and social security contributions (13.07%). After
deduction of professional costs, they obtained the assessable income. From this, they derived
the base income tax (7 different scales), the municipality taxes (7%)25, the supplementary
crisis contribution (3%) and the special social security contribution (6 different scales). The
sum of these four elements provides an estimation of the individual income taxes.26


6.2. Descriptive Statistics


The first step of our estimation procedure requires a large number of data points per firm.
Therefore, our sample has been restricted to firms with at least 200 workers. This restriction
guarantees a minimum of 10 observations per firm. Our definitive sample is representative of
all firms employing at least 200 workers within sections D to K of the Nace Rev. 1
nomenclature, with the exception of hotels and restaurants (H) and the financial sector (J).27 It
covers 17,490 individuals working for 397 firms. The mean number of data points per firm is
44 and for 75% of the firms there are between 10 and 41 observations.


Table 2 depicts the means and standard deviations of selected variables.28 We note that, on
average, the value-added per employee amounts to 61,344 EUR and that the residual pay
inequality is equal to 0.17. Moreover, we find that the estimated intra-firm wage dispersion is
highest when measured by the max-min ratio, that the mean age is around 37 years, and that,
on average, approximately 26% of the workers are women, 48% are blue-collar, and 42%

25
     Statistics Belgium had no information on the workers municipality of residence. Therefore, they applied the
average municipality tax (7%) to all employees.
26
     The most important restriction of these estimates is that they do not consider the specific situation of the
employee, e.g. composition of the family. For more information see Demunter (2000).
27
     Our sample is representative of all firms employing at least 200 workers within the following sectors: i)
manufacturing (D), ii) electricity, gas and water supply (E), iii) construction (F), iv) wholesale and retail trade;
repair of motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal and household goods (G), v) transport, storage and
communication (I), and vi) real estate, renting and business activities (K). The mining and quarrying sector (C)
and the hotels and restaurants (H) are not part of our final sample because almost all firms in these sectors
employ less than 200 workers.

have a low level of education (i.e., lower secondary school at most). Finally, Table 2 shows
that, on average, firms employ 480 workers and are essentially concentrated in the
manufacturing sector (64%); wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles (19%); and
real estate, renting and business activities (11%).

6.3. Empirical Analysis


i) Basic Specification


Table 3 reports our estimates of the effect of wage dispersion on firm productivity. These
estimates are obtained by applying respectively OLS and 2SLS, with White (1980)
heteroscedasticity consistent standard errors, to equation (9).

Findings, obtained from OLS regressions, emphasize the existence of a positive and
significant relationship between intra-firm wage dispersion and firm productivity. Overall, the
point estimates range between 1.25 and 0.08, which yields an elasticity of between 0.25 and
0.14 at sample means. These results suggest that, on average, a rise of 10% in wage inequality
increases firm productivity by between 2.5 and 1.4%.29 Yet, it could be argued that because of
the potential simultaneity between productivity and wage dispersion, OLS estimates are not
only biased but also inconsistent.30 To account for this problem, we run 2SLS regressions
instrumenting the dispersion of wages including bonuses by the intra-firm standard deviation

29
     Similar positive and significant results have been found for the unconditional indicators when we extended our
sample to all firms with 20 workers or more. These results are available on request. Yet, due to a limited number
of data points within small firms, we were not able to determine whether this is also the case using a conditional
indicator.
30
     Hausman’s (1976) specification error tests, reported in Table 3, support the existence of a simultaneity
problem.



                                                                                                                22
of income taxes on gross earnings excluding bonuses. Results from these regressions,
presented in Table 3, confirm the positive and significant impact of wage dispersion on
productivity. Moreover, we find that the elasticity between wage dispersion and productivity
is significantly larger when using 2SLS. At sample means, the elasticity now stands at
between 0.75 and 0.43. This means that, on average, when wage dispersion increases by 10%,
firm productivity rises by between 7.5 and 4.3%.31


How are we to interpret these results ? The positive impact of wage dispersion on firm
productivity tends to support the ‘tournament’ models (Lazear and Rosen, 1981). Indeed,
these models demonstrate that if the workforce is relatively homogeneous, wage differentials
stimulate workers’ effort and their productivity. To put it differently, these models suggest
that firms should establish a differentiated prize structure and award the largest prize to the
most productive workers. Lazear’s model (1989, 1995) of ‘hawks’ and ‘doves’ suggests that it
is profitable for a firm to: i) adequately sort out workers at the hiring stage, and ii) adjust the
compensation scheme to the characteristics of the workforce (i.e., the hierarchical level). This
model shows that if the majority of the workforce adopts a sabotage or non-cooperative
behaviour, a more compressed wage structure should be preferred. According to this theory,
our sample is essentially composed of ‘doves’. To put it in another way, it is because the
majority of the workforce adopts a cooperative behaviour that firms can achieve a higher
productivity by implementing a more dispersed wage structure. However, our findings offer
no support to the ‘fairness, morale and cohesiveness’ theories (Akerlof and Yellen, 1990;


31
     To test for a hump-shaped relationship, three methods have been used. Firstly, we added within-firm wage
inequality indicators in quadratic form to our regression model. Results obtained with OLS were inconclusive
because of a strong multicollinearity between indicators in level and squared. However, 2SLS estimates showed
a significant positive and hump-shaped pattern for three instrumented wage inequality indicators, i.e. the
standard deviation, the coefficient of variation, the max-min ratio of wages. Next, we divided our sample into
two homogeneous parts containing low and high inequality firms, respectively. The idea was to test whether the
impact of wage inequality on firm productivity is larger in low inequality firms. Using OLS, we found no
significant differences in the elasticities for both sub-samples (with the exception of the max-min ratio of
wages). In contrast, 2SLS estimates supported, for all instrumented wage inequality indicators, the existence of a
positive and hump-shaped relationship between wage dispersion and firm productivity. Finally, we tested for a
non-linear relationship using dummy variables (two or more) indicating the magnitude of the intra-firm wage
inequality. This methodology led to insignificant results using both OLS and 2SLS regressions. In sum, we
found some evidence in favour of a hump-shaped relationship. However, results (available on request) were not
very robust.



                                                                                                               23
Levine, 1991). Indeed, these theories suggest a negative relationship between intra-firm wage
dispersion and firm productivity.


ii) Composition of the Workforce


According to the ‘New Economics of Personnel’ (Lazear, 1995), we should expect the
elasticity of firm productivity with respect to pay inequality to be influenced by the
composition of the workforce. In particular, various theories suggest that the relationship
between pay dispersion and firm productivity depends upon the proportion of white- and
blue-collar workers within the firm. In this section, we test this hypothesis by letting our intra-
firm wage dispersion indicators interact with a dummy variable that is equal to one if the
share of white-collar workers within the firm is larger than 50% and zero otherwise. The
results of this new specification are presented in Table 4.


Whatever the indicator used for intra-firm wage dispersion, OLS estimates show that the
intensity of the relationship between pay dispersion and productivity is significantly lower in
firms that are essentially composed of white-collar workers. Indeed, the point estimates vary
between 1.70 and 0.09 for blue-collar workers and between 0.79 and 0.05 for white-collar
workers. At sample means, this yields an elasticity of between 0.39 and 0.26 for blue-collar
workers and of between 0.14 and 0.06 for white-collar workers. In sum, results suggest that
following a 10% rise in wage inequality, productivity increases by approximately 2.1
percentage points more within firms that are essentially composed of blue-collar workers.
2SLS estimates, reported in Table 4, confirm that the elasticity between wage dispersion and
productivity is positive and substantially larger within firms with a majority of blue-collar
workers. Yet, caution is required because regression coefficients associated to the interaction
variables are only significant at the 15% level. As in the basic specification, 2SLS point
estimates are larger than those obtained by OLS. Using 2SLS, the elasticity, at sample means,
ranges between 0.57 and 0.30 for white-collar workers and between 0.91 and 0.55 for blue-
collar workers, respectively. These findings suggest that if wage dispersion rises by 10%,
productivity increases by approximately 2.9 percentage points more in firms essentially
composed of blue-collar workers.

Why is the effect of pay dispersion on firm performance different for blue- and white-collar
workers ? As suggested by Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999), a first possible explanation
is that piece rates are more frequently used in firms with a majority of blue-collar workers.
The point is that the implementation of piece rates increases wage dispersion but also
productivity because, in general, workers will put in more effort and top-performers will stay
in these firms. Another argument may be that, on average, white-collar workers have a higher
degree of autonomy in their jobs, more responsibilities and superior career prospects (Winter-
Ebmer and Zweimüller, 1999). Therefore, their level of effort is thought to be more


                                                                                                                  25
determined by their intrinsic motivation. To put it differently, strong incentive schedules such
as ‘pay-for-performance’, which in general need more monitoring, could be seen as a threat to
their autonomy by white-collar workers, and as such crowd out their intrinsic motivation and
reduce the intensity of their effort (Frey, 1997). Our findings can also be interpreted on the
basis of the theory of Milgrom (1988) and Milgrom and Roberts (1990). Indeed, monitoring
costs are likely to be higher for white-collar workers. Therefore, white-collar workers may
have more incentives to: i) withhold information from managers in order to increase their
influence, and ii) engage in costly rent-seeking activities instead of productive work. This
could be an additional reason explaining why the elasticity between wage dispersion and
productivity might be lower for white-collar workers.


iii) Monitoring Environment


Another important question is whether the relationship between wage dispersion and firm
productivity is affected by the degree of monitoring within the firm. To address this question,
we have let our intra-firm wage dispersion indicators interact with a dummy variable that is
equal to one if the share of the workforce with supervising authority over co-workers is lower
than or equal to 20% and zero otherwise.


OLS estimates relative to this new specification, presented in Table 5, show that the elasticity
of productivity to pay dispersion is positive and significantly higher among firms with a high
degree of monitoring (‘supervising firms’). At sample means, the elasticity of productivity to
intra-firm pay dispersion ranges between 0.37 and 0.23 in firms with a high degree of
monitoring and between 0.20 and 0.10 in firms with a low degree of monitoring. 2SLS
estimates also show a positive and significant effect of wage dispersion on firm productivity.
However, while coefficients associated to the interaction variables remain negative, none of
them are significantly different from zero. This result suggests that findings from OLS
regressions have to be interpreted with care. Yet, it should be noted that our instrumenting
procedure may have led to some loss of information.

is equal to 1 if the share of the workforce with supervising authority over co-workers is lower than or equal to
20% and 0 otherwise. 4 Individual gross hourly wages include overtime paid, premiums for shift work, night
work and/or weekend work and bonuses, i.e. irregular payments which do not occur during each pay period, such
as pay for holiday, 13th month and profit sharing. 5 Share of the workforce that : i) at most has attended lower
secondary school, ii) has more than 10 years of tenure and iii) is younger than 25 and older than 50 years,
respectively. The share of women, the share of blue-collar workers and the share of the workers supervising co-
workers are also included. 6 Sectoral affiliation (5 dummies), size of the firm (number of workers), and level of
wage bargaining (2 dummies).


Overall, findings reported in Table 5 emphasize the importance of a correct match between
the compensation scheme and the monitoring environment within a firm. To put it differently,
results appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that “it is not so much the choice of pay
system that drives the organisational outcomes, but the combination of pay system and
monitoring environment” (Belfield and Marsden, 2003, pp. 469). It is also noteworthy that
our descriptive statistics indicate that ‘supervising firms’ have a greater proportion of blue-
collar workers (66% vs. 43%) and that their mean conditional pay inequality is larger (0.20



                                                                                                                27
vs. 0.15). Hence, our findings seem to be consistent with Milgrom (1988) and Milgrom and
Roberts (1990), who suggest a lower pay spread within firms that are mainly composed of
white-collar workers.


7. Conclusion


The objective of this paper is twofold. First, we analyse the structure of wages within and
between Belgian firms. Next, we examine how the productivity of these firms is influenced by
their internal wage dispersion. To do so, we rely on a unique combination of two large-scale
data sets (i.e. the 1995 ‘Structure of Earnings Survey’ and ‘Structure of Business Survey’).
The former contains detailed information on firm-level characteristics (e.g., sector of activity,
size of the firm, and level of wage bargaining) and on individual workers (e.g., gross hourly
wages, bonuses, age, education, sex, and occupation). The latter provides firm-level
information on financial variables (e.g., gross operating surplus, value added, and value of
production).


Our methodology is consistent with that of Winter-Ebmer and Zweimüller (1999). It rests
upon a two-step estimation procedure. Firstly, we compute conditional intra-firm wage
differentials by taking the standard errors of wage regressions run for each firm separately.
Next, we use these conditional wage differentials as an explanatory variable in a firm-level
productivity regression. As a sensitivity test, we also analyse the impact of unconditional
indicators of intra-firm wage dispersion on firm productivity. These indicators include the
standard deviation, the coefficient of variation and the max-min ratio of gross hourly wages
within the firm. The productivity of a firm is measured by the value-added per employee. The
potential simultaneity problem between wage dispersion and firm productivity is addressed
using information from the Belgian income tax system. More precisely, we apply two-stage
least squares (2SLS) and instrument the dispersion of wages including bonuses by the intra-
firm standard deviation of income taxes on gross earnings excluding bonuses.


To our knowledge, this paper is one of the first to examine the effect of intra-firm wage
dispersion on firm performance in the private sector using both a conditional wage inequality
indicator and direct information on firm productivity. It is also one of the few, with Bingley
and Eriksson (2001) and Heyman (2002), to consider potential simultaneity problems.



                                                                                              28
Empirical findings, reported in this paper, support the existence of a positive and significant
relationship between wage inequality and firm productivity. Moreover, we find that the
intensity of this relationship is stronger for blue-collar workers and within firms with a high
degree of monitoring. These findings are more in line with the ‘tournament’ models (Lazear
and Rosen, 1981) than with the ‘fairness, morale and cohesiveness’ models (Akerlof and
Yellen, 1990; Levine, 1991).


Future research in this area should rely on matched employer-employee panel data so as to
control for the non observed characteristics of the workers and/or firms. Unfortunately, at the
moment such data do not exist for Belgium. It would also be interesting to extend the analysis
to small firms using a conditional measure of intra-firm wage dispersion. However, this
option requires a rich data set with a larger number of observations per firm.
