                          Til Debt Do Us Part:
         The U.S. Capital Market and Foreign Lending: 1920-1955




                                 ABSTRACT



     This paper analyzes U.S. experience with foreign lending in the half—
century from 1920. A first question raised by this experience is what
ignited the process of U.S. foreign lending. I conclude that lending was
restrained at the beginning of the period by the debt overhang associated
with reparations and by the post World War I disruption of international
trade. Intervention by creditor country governments in the form of the
Dawes Loan, League of Nations loans to Central Europe and reconstruction
of the gold standard system was needed to initiate long—term capital flows.
A second question is how to characterize the operation of the U.S. capital
market once lending was again underway. I find that while lenders
discriminated among potential borrowers and demanded compensation for
default risk, they did so insufficiently. Neither an efficient—markets
nor a fads—and—fashions model provides an adequate characterization of
the data. A third question is whether default in the 1930s made it more
difficult for countries to borrow in the 1940s and 1950s. I find no
evidence that countries which interrupted debt service in the 1930s found
it more difficult to borrow subsequently than did countries which maintained
debt service continuously. Rather, default reduced access to private
portfolio capital flows for defaulting and nondefaulting countries alike.

1.   Introduction

     In happier times (the 1970s), countries were thought to pass through

stages of indebtedness analogous to the stages of the international product

cycle. According to the stages theory (e.g. de Vries, 1971), countries in the

initial phases of the process (before "takeoff into indebtedness") lack the

political stability and economic infrastructure required for borrowing abroad.

Once these preconditions are met, foreign borrowing commences and proceeds

at an accelerating pace. With capital inflows come development, rising

exports and steadily increasing capacity to service foreign obligations. With

rising domestic incomes come increased savings, diminishing the need to borrow

abroad. A point of inflection is reached after which a country's indebtedness

begins to decline. The rise of domestic incomes ultimately permits the debtor

to liquidate its foreign obligations and to transform itself into an

international creditor capable of lending to countries in the early phases of

the cycle. The paradigmatic case is the United States, which seemed to pass

through these stages in the century after 1820.

     In these less optimistic times, a typical stages of indebtedness model

would look rather different (e.g. United Nations, 1986). Countries' initial

inability to borrow would be ascribed not to the absence of domestic

preconditions but to caution and pessimism in international capital markets,

often themselves a legacy of previous defaults. Only when some exogenous

event such as an intergovernmental loan or domestic monetary expansion has a

catalytic effect on the market does foreign lending commence. Undue pessimism

gives way to excessive optimism as competing lenders jump on the bandwagon,
                                     —2—


pushing loans upon reluctant borrowers and failing to distinguish between good

and bad credit risks. Indiscriminate lending culminates in default,

recrimination and retaliation as lending collapses and -international trade is

disrupted at the expense of economic growth in the capital-importing regions.

Developing countries are unable to borrow for an extended period, returning in

effect to the initial stage of the indebtedness cycle. Here the paradigmatic

case is the half century commencing in 1920, when hesitancy gave way to a

burst of foreign lending after 1923, default after 1930, and a considerable

diminution of private external portfolio lending until the 1970s.

     Both characterizations of the process of foreign lending are

oversimplified and overly mechanistic. In some instances, foreign lending has

taken place in response to promising development prospects, foreign funds have

been profitably invested and debts have been repaid, as posited in the

stages-of-indebtedness model. In others, funds have been provided

indiscriminately, invested unproductively, and written off by the lenders.

The question is what mix of the two phenomena characterizes the operation of

the market. Similarly, the impact of default on the growth prospects of the

indebted nations is less clear cut than most would have it. The impact of

default on economic performance in indebted regions hinges in part upon its

implications for access to the international capital market. If nonpayment

damages the debtors reputation sufficiently to impede its ability to borrow

for an extended period, default may have serious economic consequences.

Moreover, if the consequences spill over to other nations by leading to the

collapse of the international capital market, default may have externalities,

the costs of which are incurred by third parties.

     In this paper, I view these issues through the lens of the last complete

debt cycle, that spanned by the half-century from 1920.       I start in Section 2

by considering the factors that ignited the process of foreign lending,

focusing on the case of the United States. During the early 'twenties, in

sharp contrast to the second half of the decade, relatively little U.S.

foreign lending took place. This raises the question of what first

discouraged the floatation of loans and then initiated the burst of lending.

Was the outlook of capital-market participants transformed by a newfound

ability of sovereign debtors to satisfy the preconditions for foreign

borrowing, as stages-of-indebtedness models would suggest, or by developments

largely exogenous to the debtors? I conclude that lending was restrained

initially by the debt overhang associated with reparations and by the

disruption of international trade -—   i.e.   as much by conditions -in the world

economy as by conditions in debtor countries.      I suggest that the policies of

the creditor governments --   specifically,   the Dawes Plan, the League of

Nations loans to Central Europe and reconstruction of the gold standard

system -— had a catalytic effect on the market. I consider also the

monitoring and moral suasion exercised by the U.S. Commerce and State

Departments, and ask how they influenced the flow of funds.

     In Section 3, I consider the behavior of the market once foreign lending

was underway. At stake is the effectiveness with which the market allocated

funds among competing borrowers. Did market participants discriminate

adequately among good and bad risks? Did they take into account factors

affecting the likelihood of default? To address these questions I analyze the

pricing of foreign bonds, considering the determinants of spreads over the
                                     —4—


risk-free interest rate and the implicit default probabilities they imply.

The impression conveyed by this evidence is that lenders discriminated among

borrowers and demanded compensation for the danger of default, but to a

limited extent. Neither an efficient-markets nor a fads-and-fashions model

provides a wholly adequate characterization of the operation of this market.

     In Section 4 I consider the consequences of default from the perspective

of relending. Did countries which serviced their loans through the 1930s reap

the benefits of favored access to the capital market? If not in the 1930s

then subsequently, did defaulting nations pay a price in the form of reduced

access to international capital markets?

          loans of the 1920's might be refined and corrected if more

A.   Overview

     The United States is the paradigmatic example of a country which appears

to have passed through stages of indebtedness, transfiguring itself from

international debtor to international creditor in the span of 100 years.

Foreign capital played in integral role in the development of American

industry and in the opening of the West. Although the U.S. remained an

attractive destination for foreign capital even as the economy matured, by the

turn of the century American investors had already begun to direct their

attention abroad. In the 15 years prior to World War I, U.S. foreign

liabilities increased by approximately 4.6 per cent per annum but U.S. foreign

assets increased at more than twice that rate.1 (See Table 1..)

Three-quarters of U.S. foreign lending in this period took the form of direct

investment, primarily in railways, sugar mill machinery and mining and

drilling equipment. Although on the eve of World War I the U.S. remained a

net foreign debtor, the position already was beginning to shift.

     Wartime exigencies accelerated America's transition from debtor to

creditor nation. Between 1914 and 1919, largely as a result of loans floated

on behalf of the French and British governments and the liquidation of foreign

holdings of U.S. securities, America's net debtor position of $3.8 billion was

transformed into a net creditor position of comparable magnitude.2 There

followed a surge in peacetime lending matched previously only by the United

Kingdom in the period 1900-1913. U.S. investors lent more than $10 billion to

foreigners in the 11 years ending in 1930, 40 per cent in the form of direct

foreign investment, 45 per cent through the purchase of long—term foreign

securities. Contemporaries were struck by the growth of U.S. portfolio

investment abroad, given the predominance of direct investment in American

lending over previous decades. The earliest estimates, for 189?, show more

than 90 per cent of U.S. foreign investment to have been direct, while

estimates for 1914 suggest that the share of direct investment in the total

was still more than 75 per cent; by 1930 the share of direct investment

had fallen to less than half.

     This overview of early 20th century U.S. experience suggests three

questions. First, what explains the magnitude of U.S. foreign lending in the

1920s? Second, what explains the composition --   specifically,   the rise in
                                        —6—


portfolio investment? Third, what explains the timing -—     specifically,   the

surge in the period 1925-28?


B.      Magnitudes

        A country's foreign lending is, by definition, the excess of domestic

saving over domestic investment:


(1)          NFl = S*GNP — I*GNP


where NFl is net foreign investment (U.S. investment abroad net of foreign

investment in the United States), GNP is gross national product,

S = Gross Domestic Saving/GNP and I = Gross Domestic Investment/GNP.

Differentiating yields:


(2)          dNFI = GNP*dS - GNP*dI ÷ (S-I)*dGNP


        The first term on the right-hand side is the contribution of changes in

saving to U.S. investment abroad, the second the contribution of changes in

investment, the third the contribution of GNP growth. In Table 2 this

decomposition is applied to U.S. data for the early 20th century. In contrast

to thf 1970s, when fluctuations in investment were mainly responsible for

driving the current account (Sachs, 1979), during this earlier period

punctuated by war savings fluctuations generally played the more important

role.

        If we compare the prewar decade (1904-13) with that encompassing the war

years (1909-18), the increase in the net private capital outflow is more than

accounted for by the wartime surge in saving. The resulting capital outflow

was moderated, in fact, by the concurrent rise in investment. In contrast,

the growth of GNP accounts for a relatively small share of the growth in U.S.

foreign investment. The net private capital outflow is even larger in the

subsequent period, 1914-23. Since the savings rate was almost identical

immediately before and after the war, it contributes little to changes in U.S.

foreign investment. About a third of the increased capital outflow is due to

the fall in gross private investment after the war, some two thirds to the

growth of nominal incomes.

     Moving from 1914—23 to 1919—26, net private foreign investment falls.

This reflects the fact that net private foreign investment was actually

greater during the war than during the boom period of foreign lending in the

second half of the 1920s. Wartime lending took different forms, notably the

repurchase of American obligations held by foreigners. And U.S. foreign

lending in the second half of the 1920s vastly exceeded that in any previous

peacetime period. But it is striking that the volume of net lending in the

second half of the 1920s was by no means historically unprecedented. The

decline in the capital outflow between 1914-23 and 1919-28 is fully accounted

for by the tendency of savings to return to its pre-1909 level.

    A full explanation for U.S. foreign lending must also consider the

question from the perspective of the borrowing countries. The excess of U.S.

savings over investment had as its counterpart a shortfall of foreign savings

over foreign investment. In analyzing that shortfall, it is important to

distinguish Europe from other parts of the world, as in Table 3.   In the first

half of the 'twenties, Europe's savings-investment balance reflected both a

drastic decline in savings and exceptional returns to investment. Wartime
                                    -8-


destruction of plant, equipment and infrastructure had reduced European

industrial production and national income below prewar levels.3 Since this

decline in incomes was recognized as temporary, Europeans wished to reduce

their savings to smooth consumption. Moreover, the quick returns to be reaped

from repairing industrial and commercial capacity provided exceptional

incentive to invest.

     In addition to the impact of the war on productive capacity and

utilization and its direct implications for European savings and investment,

there was the recycling associated with reparations. Although great play has

been given to similarities between German reparations in the 1920s and the

OPEC surpluses of the 1970s (e.g. Balogh and Graham, 1979), the parallels

should not be pushed too far. So far as U.S. foreign lending was concerned,

the essence of the reparations question was Germany's need to shift resources

into sectors producing traded goods and her desire to defer large resource

transfers until productive capacity, financial balance and political stability

had been restored. In addition, because the German authorities pursued a

tight monetary policy in the wake of hyperinflation, there was a persistent

high demand for working capital, further increasing the incentive to borrow

abroad. Each of these factors contributed to Germany's demand for foreign

funds. A separate question is whether it was sensible for American lenders to

willingly provide the supply, given the ongoing dispute over reparations.4

     In contrast to Europe, the economies of Latin America and the Far East

had been less severely disrupted. Hence incentives for investment in Latin

America were rather different from those in the U.S. and Europe. American

investors were attracted by the prospects for exploiting raw material

endowments and aiding government programs to promote industrialization.

Outside Europe, Americans were particularly attracted to investments in

infrastructure (public utilities, railways, etc.). Between 1917 and 1924,

U.S. investment in Latin America and the Far East remained small by the

standards of subsequent years, although there were exceptions to the rule:

$230 million and $224 million of Latin American issues were offered in 1921

and 1922 and $100 million of bonds were floated on behalf of the Netherlands

East Indies in 1922. There then followed a dramatic surge in the share of

U.S. foreign investment destined for Latin America. Between 1925 and 1929,

Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Colombia together accounted for a quarter of U.S.

foreign lending.


C.   Composition and Timing

     Although the dominance of portfolio investment was the most striking

aspect of international capital market experience in the 1920s, direct

investment continued to comprise a significant share of the U.S. total. Over

a third of U.S. direct foreign investment between 1924 and 1929 took the form

of purchases of and investment in public utilities, nearly quadrupling U.S.

holdings in this sector. Primary production (agriculture, mining and

petroleum production) accounted for 28 per cent of the total, manufacturing

for 26 per cent.5 Direct foreign investment was disproportionately destined

for South America, in contrast to portfolio investment, which was most heavily

directed toward Europe.

     Relative rates of return played some role in allocating U.S. savings

between domestic and foreign uses. Foreign bonds were attractive for their

yields, which exceeded those on U.S. government securities and high-grade

corporate bonds, if not always those on domestic medium—grade bonds. Despite

sterilization by the Federal Reserve, a steady gold influx in conjunction with

the expansion of bank credit depressed the returns on domestic assets. After

1921. the rate on bankers' acceptances declined to less than 4 per cent, while

call money rates fluctuated between 2 and 5 per cent. Domestic bond yields

declined from 1923 through 1928. In a period such as 1927-28 when

medium-grade domestic bonds yielded only 5 per cent, foreign bonds which

might yield seven or eight per cent were understandably attractive.

     Figure 1 shows the relationship of the yields on domestic and foreign

dollar bonds over the 1920s. The yield on domestic medium-grade bonds is

Moody's Baa rate, that on foreign bonds Lary's (1944) sample of 15 foreign

issues. Also plotted is the value of new capital issues on behalf of foreign

government and corporate borrowers.6 The figure shows that, as the yield on

domestic medium-grade bonds declined between 1923 and 1927 and that on foreign

bonds grew increasingly attractive, U.S. foreign lending increased. The fall

in U.S. foreign lending after 1927 coincides similarly with a fall in the

spread of foreign over domestic yields. Yet rates of return by themselves

account for little of the variation in the volume of foreign lending. The

role of other factors --   specifically   risk --   is   especially evident before

1924, when many U.S. investors seem to have been unwilling to lend to

foreigners at any price. Foreign lending rises thereafter despite the absence

of any noticeable change in relative rates of return.7

     The risks which deterred foreign lending in the early 1920s are most

evident in Central Europe. So long as the level of their reparations
                                     —11—


obligations remained uncertain, it was unclear whether the nations of this

region would have the resources needed to service additional debt. If they

had the resources, it was not evident that they would succeed in mobilizing

them. In Germany and many of the newly-created nations of Eastern Europe, the

stability of governments remained in doubt. The successor states of the

Austro-Hungarian Empire had no tax systems in place. Hyperinflation was

evidence of their failure to balance government budgets through conventional

means. In effect, the inability of these countries to borrow in the early

1920s reflected the operation of two factors also impeding borrowing in the

1980s: a large debt overhang in the form of existing obligations (which in the

1920s mainly took the form of war debts and reparations), plus questions about

ability of governments to mobilize export earnings in order to service

external debts.

     Yet the perception that foreign lending was risky was not limited to

Central Europe. It applied also to countries with relatively small debts and

relatively stable governments. Compared to the levels achieved in the

second half of the 'twenties, lending to Latin America remained depressed. In

the immediate postwar years, foreign issues consisted primarily of

high-quality Canadian bonds and loans to the governments of Norway, Sweden and

Switzerland, nations that had remained neutral during the war and whose credit

was beyond reproach. Other countries obtained long-term loans from the U.S.

only under unusual circumstances and at exceptional cost: at 7.7 per cent,

yields to maturity on long term loans issued in 1920-21 were nearly 50 per

cent higher than yields on issues floated during the early war years and 15

per cent higher than they were to become in 1922_24.8
                                        —12—


    Why did countries outside Central Europe find it so difficult to borrow

in the first half of the 1920s? The immediate postwar years were overshadowed

by the Bolshevik revolution. In many countries, labor movements and

affiliated political parties had gained new influence during hostilities, and

it was unclear how radical their programs might prove if and when they took

office. Governments deadlocked over the question of who should pay for the

war were left with no alternative but the inflation tax. The option of a

capital levy was seriously considered in every major European country, surely

discouraging investors, domestic and foreign alike, from holding claims on

governments.9 "Post-war Europe," in the words of Stoddard (1932, p.85),

"could hardly be rated as an 'A-i' investment opportunity."

     But the dominant factor was surely the depressed level of world trade and

uncertain prospects for its recovery. Export volumes worldwide remained

depressed relative to 1913 levels, as many governments retained tariffs and

quantitative restrictions imposed during the war. Unless trade recovered, the

ability of countries to generate foreign exchange receipts and service

external debts would be permanently reduced. Contemporaries saw monetary

stabilization -—   specifically   a return to the gold standard -— as a necessary

condition for the restoration of domestic prosperity and the reduction of

restrictions needed for the recovery of trade. Only with the termination of

Central European hyperinflatioris, capped by Germany's stabilization in

1923-24, and the international movement back onto the gold standard did

investors conclude that trade ultimately would recover and did the capital

markets take heart.

     The recovery of international trade hinged, -in the view of observers, on

the financial restoration of Central Europe, notably of Germany, the region's
                                     —13—


leading industrial and commercial power. Hence the 1923-24 League of Nations

Loans to Austria and Hungary and the 1924 Dawes Loan to Germany, by cementing

that restoration, had a catalytic impact on U.S. lending to the region.

(Details on the League Loans are provided in Table 4.) If a lesson for the

1980s is to be drawn from the initiation of this earlier debt cycle, it is

that when disruptions to trade and a debt overhang interrupt the flow of

lending, outside intervention by governments or international institutions may

serve to restart it.

     Why were the League Loans successfully placed? First, they offered

exceptionally attractive returns. The 1923 League Loan to Austria bore a

yield to maturity of 7.8 per cent. The 1924 League Loan to Hungary offered a

yield to maturity of 8.6 per cent; on the day it was floated in London,

British Consols were yielding only half that amount.1° But while a risk

premium of 100 per cent eliminates much of the mystery, it does not provide

the entire answer. Insofar as risk increases with the premium charged, there

may be no interest rate at which the market takes up the loan. An important

part of the explanation must lie, therefore, in governmental supervision and

sponsorship. Before the loans received League of Nations support, governments

engaged in discussions with the Financial Committee of League, involving plans

to eliminate the fiscal deficit, to reform the central bank and to strictly

control future expenditures. In both the Austrian and Hungarian cases, the

League appointed a Commissioner-General resident in the country, who was

granted extraordinary access to government officials and vested with

responsibility for supervising the collection of loan service and verifying

the government's adherence to the protocols negotiated with the League.

Thus, very extensive measures were taken not only to eliminate domestic

sources of fiscal imbalance but to establish an institutional means whereby

the borrowing country's progress might be monitored. It is no surprise that

potential investors viewed the League Loans differently from ordinary bond

issues. Moreover, in the case of the Austrian Loan, the sponsoring

governments effectively collateralized the loan by depositing bonds in its

amount in earmarked accounts. In the case of other League Loans, such as that

to Hungary, although no such collateral was provided, investors were left with

the impression that the sponsoring governments would take whatever steps

proved necessary to insure continued debt service.

     Unlike Austria and Hungary, Germany's negotiation of a foreign loan did

not occur under League of Nations aegis. Due to its entanglement with the

reparations issue, it resulted instead from an American plan to assemble a

committee of business experts to deal with the external problem. The Dawes

Plan announced to the public in April 1924 included a loan in the amount of

800 million RM, half to be floated in the U.S., a quarter in Britain, and the

remainder in France, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland. As with

the League Loans, the market's response was overwhelming. The issue was

oversubscribed in Britain by a factor of 13, in New York by a factor of ten.

     The enthusiasm with which American investors took up the Dawes Loan is

striking in the light of earlier skepticism about European floatations. Even

the bankers had greeted the plan with considerable skepticism. In part,

success resulted from propitious financial market conditions. The Federal

Reserve discount rate had been reduced in the spring of 1924 by an

exceptionally large amount, from 4i to 3 per cent, rendering foreign
                                     —15--



investments attractive for their return.11 The American tranche was sold to

the public at 92, to be redeemed at 105; together with a nominal interest rate

of 7 per cent, this meant that it yielded 7.6 per cent. In addition, the U.S.

government and New York banks had pressed for British and French involvement,

partly to create domestic interests in those countries that would oppose

giving priority to reparations over commercial liabilities. Involving foreign

investors increased U.S. confidence that Dawes Loan obligations would not be

subordinated to reparations. A final explanation for the success of the loan

lies in the aggressive publicity campaign launched in its support. Even

President Coolidge urged patriotic American investors to subscribe.

     Once the pump was primed by these measures to buttress financial

stability in Europe and to ensure the restoration of international trade, it

continued to operate on its own. For many investors, foreign dollar bonds had

been until recently an unfamiliar instrument. But American investors grew

accustomed to holding bonds through the good offices of the U.S. Treasury,

which aggressively administered the Liberty Loan campaign during World War I.

Under the Liberty Loan Act of 1917, the Secretary of the Treasury was

authorized to purchase obligations of foreign governments at war with enemies

of the United States. U.S. purchases of foreign securities were financed by

selling the American public dollar—denominated securities -in matching amounts.

The rate of interest charged the European borrowers was simply the rate

required by American investors plus a small spread to cover costs. American

investors encouraged to subscribe by extensive publicity campaigns did so in

the amounts shown in Table 5. 'tMillions of individuals who had never clipped

a coupon or owned a share of stock, now became uinvestment_mindedhu for the

first time in their lives."12

    American investors' appetite for foreign bonds having been awakened,

changes in the scope and structure of U.S. financial markets helped to satisfy

it. Sales of foreign dollar bonds were buoyed by the growth of the investing

public. In 1914, by one estimate, there were no more than 200,000 American

bond buyers in a market limited largely to Boston and its environs.13 But by

1922, when an income of $5,000 a year was required, according to reputable

investment bankers, to participate in the bond market, the annual incomes of

nearly 600,000 Americans exceeded this amount, and by 1929 there were more

than one million such individuals.'4

     Both the wartime and postwar transformation of American commercial

banking and the growth of the investment trust reinforced these trends.

Before World War I, few national banks had engaged in the securities business.

Only in exceptional instances did they do more than provide their customers

information. But the banks became heavily involved in the wartime campaign to

distribute Liberty Bonds. Following the war's conclusion, they attempted to

retain as clients purchasers of Liberty Bonds by offering them foreign

obligations. Many investors who developed a newfound interest in the bond

market grew accustomed to buying and selling through the bond departments of

commercial banks, which expanded dramatically in consequence. Between 1922

and 1931, the number of national banks engaged in securities operations

through their bond departments increased from 62 to 123.

     By establishing a security affiliate, banks could engage in the entire

range of bond—market activities without the restrictions of federal or state

banking laws. A security affiliate also permitted them to circumvent the

barriers to interstate branching. Between 1922 and 1931, the number of
                                     —17—


national bank security affiliates grew from 10 to 114. By 1919 National City

Bank's underwriting and brokerage affiliate, the City Company, had opened

branch offices in 51 cities, often on the ground floor to encourage walk-in

business. It publicized the attractions of a bond portfolio through

advertisements in popular magazines such as Harper's and Atlantic Monthly.

     Banks and their affiliates took an active role not only in retailing but

in the origination of foreign bond issues. In the 1920s American banks for

the first time expanded overseas on a significant scale. Prior to the passage

of the Federal Reserve Act, national banks had been prohibited from branching

abroad. Although private banks and some state banks were permitted to do so,

as late as 1914 there existed only 26 foreign branches of American banks. The

Federal Reserve Act relaxed the constraint on foreign branching, however, and

World War I, by disrupting the ability of European banks to extend export

credits, provided the impetus for American banks to move overseas. Although

some retrenchment occurred in the years to follow, by 1920 the number of

foreign branches of U.S. banks had increased to 181. These branches provided

a steady stream of contacts between American bankers and potential foreign

borrowers. 15

     The need for a diversified portfolio, impressed upon potential purchasers

by responsible salesmen, limited the involvement of the small investor.16

Increasingly, however, this constraint was relaxed by the growth of the

investment trust. A forerunner of the modern mutual fund, the investment

trust pooled the subscriptions of its clients, placed their management in the

hands of specialists, and issued long-term securities entitling holders to a

share of the organization's earnings. The modern investment trust originated
                                        -18-


largely in Britain, where it traditionally specialized in foreign bonds.'7

When the investment trust first appeared on a significant scale in the United

States after 1921, many of the new institutions followed British example by

investing heavily in foreign bonds.18

     Thus, in the 1920s as in the 1970s, the surge in foreign lending was

greatly facilitated by financial innovation. The rapid development of

retailing and underwriting activities and the proliferation of investment

vehicles provided financial organizations both incentive and opportunity to

increase their participation in foreign bond markets. While the growth of the

investing public and the low yields on domestic bonds created an incipient

demand for foreign assets, competition among financial institutions provided

the supply. It has been asserted, following Hiram Johnson, head of the

Senate's 1931-32 Foreign Bond Investigation, that these institutions competed

excessively, pushing loans on inexperienced foreign governments and forcing

bonds on naive domestic investors.19 The banking community counters that

established firms with reputations to protect had no incentive to promote

questionable investments, since "such securities would damage the

underwriter's credibility with investors, making it more difficulty for the

underwriter to sell securities in the future."2° While this logic is

impeccable, it may apply imperfectly to the 1920s by virtue of the fact that

many institutional participants in international bond markets were recent

entrants with little if any reputation to protect. The model fits better in

Britain, where the underwriting of foreign securities was handled almost

exclusively by a small number of long-established firms which agreed to limit

the extent of competition, dividing the field "among themselves and
                                     -19-


develop[ing] more or less permanent financing arrangements with various

foreign issuers.!t21 In the U.S., a distinctive feature of the market

environment in the 1920s was the extent of entry. Mintz (1950) notes that the

loans issued by various groups of banking houses in the 1920s fared very

differently, with only 14 per cent of the (non-Canadian) loans issued by three

participants ultimately defaulting, but nearly 90 per cent of the loans issued

by six other banking houses falling into default. Although Mintz is careful

not to identify the banking houses, the timing of their loans suggests that

the first group was comprised of long-time participants and the second of

recent entrants. One might speculate that firms in the second group were

simply less well managed, but it is also likely that their managements were

more inclined toward risky issues since they had less reputation to lose in

the event of default. If, in the long run, track record in comparison with

incumbants will drive unsuccessful entrants out of the market, there is no

reason to suppose that these forces had much effect between 1921 and 1929.

     Critics blamed loan pushing on lax regulation by public authorities.

Until 1933 many of the operations of securities affiliates remained

unregulated. The popular argument, especially after the Wall Street Crash and

the onset of default, was that the establishment of bank securities affiliates

brought into conflict the bank's obligation to provide prudent advice to its

depositor—investors and its desire to sell the security issues it originated.

Even if the affiliate did not unduly favor the securities of its customers,

with a bond distribution network in place the affiliates had an interest -in

promoting the sale of bonds even when the supply of high-quality issues

declined. This notion that the establishment of affiliates led the banks to
                                     -20--



encourage reckless investment in foreign bonds contributed to the passage in

1933 of the Glass-Steagall Act outlawing the securities affiliate.22

     The U.S. State and Commerce Departments also can be criticized for

inadequately screening individual loans. Banks originating foreign loans were

asked only to consult the State Department prior to offering an issue to

American investors. The State Department then consulted with the Treasury and

Commerce Departments before announcing whether or not it had an objection.

While the program was voluntary, bankers hesitant to cooperate risked

incurring the wrath of the Administration and losing its assistance in the

event of default. Critics such as Senator Carter Glass of Virginia complained

that the program was at the same time insufficiently stringent to prevent

dubious foreign loans and insufficiently clear to prevent potential investors

from interpreting a statement of "no objection" as the government's seal of

approval 23

     The government's activities involved both education and data gathering.

Commerce attempted to make clear to American investors that German bond issues

ranked after reparations in priority of repayment. It published summaries of

economic conditions in foreign countries. In addition, its agents furnished

information on particular enterprises and investment projects, which the

Commerce Department mailed to hundreds of American banks. These agents were

sometimes able in their official capacity to obtain financial information to

which the bankers did not have access. Flence many U.S. banks came to rely on

assessments by Commerce Department agents of potential foreign investment

projects as part of normal business practice.24

     The principal instances in which the U.S. authorities made use of their

oversight of foreign lending were in connection with foreign governments owing
                                     —21—


war debts to the United States.25 A strict loan embargo was imposed against

the Soviet Union. Washington disapproved a prospective Rumanian loan in 1922

because of the absence of a war debt funding agreement. It disapproved of

refunding issues for France until that country negotiated a war debt

settlement. Naturally, this policy proved unpopular in Europe, the French

threatening for example to impose a tariff on U.S. automobiles, which led in

1928 to permission to float French industrial securities on the American

market.26 This was only a particular instance of a general phenomenon, that

"(i]n almost all cases where the Government entered an objection, it could be

gotten round or in time removed" (Feis, 1950, p.13).

     Compared to their attitude toward other countries, U.S. authorities were

surprisingly lenient in their treatment of German loans. While Commerce

Department agents in Berlin continually reminded Washington of the magnitude

of the reparations burden and of the danger that Germany would be unable to

both pay reparations and service municipal and corporate loans, the position

of the U.S. authorities remained ambiguous. Commerce continued to supply the

leading investment houses with information on the finances of municipalities

and even the prospects for specific investment projects. While the warnings

of its agents were passed on to the U.S. investment banking community, few if

any German loan applications met with formal objection. Starting in 1925, the

Commerce and State Departments issued somewhat ambiguous warnings to the

bankers. The State Department alluded to the possibility of an embargo on

loans to German states and municipalities in instances where such loans might

hamper transfers under the Dawes Plan.27

    "While the Department of State raises no objection to this
    flotation. . itfeels that American bankers should know that the
    amount of German loans has become so large, and the control of
                                      —22—


     exchange on behalf of the Allies is such, as to raise a question as
     to whether or not it may be very difficult for German borrowers to
     make the necessary transfers.ht2b

     Why was German borrowing treated so leniently? It is not that Commerce

Department officials failed to recognize the danger of default. As early as

1925 internal memoranda warned of an investment "debacle," and in 1928 the

problem had achieved such proportions that middle-ranking officials were

warned to distance themselves from German lending to protect the government in

the event of default.29 But the State Department overrode the hesitations of

Commerce out of a desire to maintain German stability as a bulwark against

Bolshevism. Moreover, Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury for much of

the 1920s, actively represented the bankers' desire that German lending be

left unfettered. And ultimately, U.S. officials believed deeply in the

laissez faire approach to foreign lending --   that   the market knew best.



3.   Pricing Foreign Debt

     "Why did these people lend money to Austria, or Japan, or Germany,
     or Argentine, or Belgium? Here, statistics are of little value.
     Men have not yet found a way of measuring the motives of other men."

                                                       Morrow (1927).

     A standard criticism of the international capital market in the 1920s is

that it failed to discriminate adequately among borrowers. Precisely the same

criticism has been leveled at U.S. creditors in the 1970's; Guttentag and

Herring (1985) argue that rates charged sovereign borrowers on bank loans

could not have adequately incorporated the determinants of country-risk prem-ia

because they varied so little across loans. Edwards (1986) has attempted to

test this hypothesis formally for both bank loans and bonds, using regression
                                     —23—


to analyze the relationship between ex ante spreads and correlates of the

country risk premium such as debt, reserves, investment, the current account

and imports as shares of GNP, the ratio of debt service to exports, the rate

of economic growth, the real exchange rate, and characteristics of the

borrower and the loan. His results for the bond market were mixed: rates

charged borrowers were found to rise with the debt/GNP ratio, to fall with the

investment/GNP ratio, and to decline with the maturity of the loan. The first

two of these results are consistent with the notion that bondholders

distinguished among good and bad credit risks. The coefficients on the other

variables were uniformly insignificant, however, suggesting that investors

paid little attention to other plausible indicators of country risk when

pricing foreign bonds.

     These results provide a benchmark for comparison with my analysis of the

bond market in the 1920s. To analyze the determinants of the ex ante rate of

return required by bondholders in the 1920s, I employ data on the yield to

maturity on issue for bonds floated in the United States between 1920 and

1929. These data, compiled by Lewis (1938), include all foreign securities

issued and taken in the United States, both securities publicly issued and

privately taken. They exclude portions of such issues sold on foreign markets

(so far as could be determined) and securities of American-controlled

enterprises (which are considered direct investment), thereby differing from

other sources of information on the subject such as the Department of

Commerce's lists of foreign loans. (Both public and private issues are

similarly included in modern studies such as Edwards's.) The par value

of loans and the yield to maturity are provided by year of issue, domicile of
                                    -24—


borrower, maturity (long-term loans versus short-term loans of five years or

less), and type of borrower (national and provincial, municipal or corporate).

For the 1920s the required information is provided for 383 categories of

bonds. These data were then linked to information on the characteristics of

the borrowing countries. It was not possible to obtain information on all of

the independent variables used in modern analyses, regrettably insofar as this

renders the results to follow imperfectly comparable. But just as estimates

of national income, investment and related variables for the 1920s are not

available to historians, such estimates were not available to bondholders and

hence were unlikely to be used in pricing foreign bonds. The

readily-available indicators of policy stance were foreign trade and public

finance statistics.3° I therefore use the trade and budget balances as

measures of domestic policy. Contemporaries argued that a balance-of-trade

surplus should have been related negatively to the required rate of return on

bonds, since the larger the surplus the greater the export receipts available

for debt service. Similarly, a government budget surplus should have been

negatively associated with the required rate, since any budget surplus could

be used to retire domestic debt and reduce the governmentts total debt

burden.31 Data on these variables were drawn from publications of the League

of Nations for 221 of Lewis's 383 observations.32 Trade and budget surpluses

are measured as shares of imports and government expenditures, respectively.

     The dependent variable is the spread over domestic risk free rates,

defined as the foreign yield minus the yield on securities rated Baa by

Moody's (annual averages). The value of the loan is divided by the value of

exports to control for country size.33 Regression results are reported in
                                     —25—


Table 6. The omitted alternatives (1929, Venezuela and corporation) are

picked up by the constant term.34 The spread varies considerably, with a mean

of 0.46 and a standard deviation of 1.20. According to the regressions, that

on short-term loans averaged 73 basis points below that on long term loans.

Although this result contrasts with that obtained by Edwards for the 1970s,

who found the yield on short-term bonds to be higher than that on long-term

issues, it is consistent with the presumption that the yield curve should be

positively sloped. The negative coefficients on public loans (both sovereign

and municipal) indicates that the public demanded a smaller risk premium than

on corporate bonds. This contrasts with Edwards' (1986) finding for the 1970s

of no discernible difference.

     The remaining variables are dummies for countries, trade and budget

balances, and dummies for years prior to 1929. The first can be interpreted

as proxies for national reputation, the second as proxies for current policy,

the third as components of the spread not attributable to other

characteristics of the loans. The coefficients on years indicate some

tendency for the spread to rise over the course of the 1920s, as if market

participants recognized the increasingly risky nature of foreign loans.

According to the country dummies, the best bond-market reputations were

enjoyed, not surprisingly, by Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Norway,

Sweden), members of the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada, Ireland),

small Western European countries (Switzerland, the Netherlands), and small

Central American republics economically or politically dependent on the United

States (Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Panama).35 There were good

reasons to expect these countries to service their obligations promptly;

bondholders' willingness to lend to them at favorable rates indicates some

significant ability to discriminate among potential borrowers. Conversely,

high rates were charged the new nations of Eastern Europe (Bulgaria,

Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Rumania), a country engaged in an

international dispute (Greece), and Latin American nations with a history of

debt service disruptions (Bolivia, Peru). Again, given the political and

economic situation in these countries and, in the case of Latin America, their

past record of servicing debt, bondholders' tendency to demand a risk premium

indicates some ability to discriminate among borrowers. At the same time, the

relatively small risk premia charged Germany, the leading borrower of American

funds, and a number of the larger South American republics raise questions

about whether bondholders discriminated adequately.

     The coefficients on the trade and budget balances provide additional

information relevant to this question. While the coefficient on the trade

surplus is negative as anticipated, it differs insignificantly from zero.

Moreover, the coefficient on the budget surplus is positive, although

essentially zero. From this evidence, it does not appear that bondholders

attached much weight to readily—available indicators of the current

macroeconomic situation when determining the price at which to lend. It would

seem that reputation more than current economic developments influenced bond

market participants.

     The remaining variable is loan size (scaled by exports). While its

coefficient is negative, it differs insignificantly from zero, as in Edwards's

sample of bonds issued in the 1970s. It seems curious that foreign borrowers

were not charged a premium when floating larger loans, since the larger the
                                     -27—


loan, the greater the cost to the issuing house if the entire amount was not

successfully placed and had to be absorbed by the sponsoring bankers, to be

resold later at a loss. One possibility is that the bankers' commission

rather than the price to the public responded to the size of the loan.

Typically, foreign floatations in the United States in the 1920s were

sponsored by a money center bank or issue house responsible for origination.

Often shares of the issue were then sold to a syndicate of underwriting banks

which shared responsibility for advertising, marketing and ultimately

absorbing any residual amount of the bond issue which the public proved

unwilling to purchase.36 Hence the bankers' commission represented

compensation for normal costs of marketing and advertising, compensation for

underwriting risk, and possibly economic profit due to the relatively small

number of issue houses active in the market.

     Lewis (1938) provides information not only on the yield received by the

public (the variable utilized in the regression analysis reported above) but

also on that paid by the borrower; the difference measures the bankers'

commission. That commission averaged 30 basis points on foreign bonds issued

in the U.S. in the 1920s and could reach substantial levels; on Poland's 1925

national loan, for example, on which the price to the bankers was 86.3 and the

price to the public 95.5, the commission amounted to nearly a full percentage

point on a loan bearing a nominal interest rate of eight per cent.37

     The determinants of the bankers' commission are analyzed in Table 7 using

the same variables utilized to analyze the return required by the public,

except that loan value is not entered as a ratio to exports. Comparing Tables

6 and 7 reveals that commissions moved very differently over time than rates

to the public. Commissions rose gradually from 1920 through 1925 and fell

back in 1926-27, before recovering in 1928—29. Mintz (ch. 4) notes that a

number of new banking houses entered the foreign lending business after 1924,

which should have driven the commission down. Similarly, a number of houses

withdrew from the market starting in 1928, permitting the commission to

recover.

     The commission on short-term loans was 25 basis points lower than that on

long—term issues, presumably reflecting the smaller loss in the event that the

issuing house was forced to absorb any portion not taken up by the market.

This is consistent with Kuzcynski's (1932) findings based on a sample of

German bonds. Commissions on sovereign and municipal loans were slightly

lower than on otherwise comparable loans to corporations. There is a negative

association between the size of the loan and the bankers' commission,

indicating that economies of scale associated with marketing large loans may

have offset the extra risk to the issuing bankers.38 In any case, there is no

evidence in either Tables 6 or 7 that price was used to deter borrowers from

floating larger loans.

     The coefficients on the trade and budget-balance variables have the same

signs as in the regressions explaining the spread, but in the commission

regressions the trade-balance variable is significantly less than zero at

standard confidence levels. There are at least three plausible

interpretations of this difference between Tables 6 and 7. My preferred

interpretation is that specialists had more knowledge of bond market risks,

recognized the danger that it might be difficult to market the loans of

countries running trade deficits, and demanded compensation. Another
                                       —29—


possibility is that the bankers were less able than bondholders to diversify

away the risks associated with a specific issue. Given the practice of

forming syndicates to underwrite loans it would appear that considerable

diversification was possible, however. Finally, it could be that simultaneity

tending to bias the trade-balance coefficient upward (since countries charged

low commissions could borrow more and hence were permitted to run large

deficits) is less of a problem in Table 7 than in Table 6 (where a more

important source of simultaneity would arise from the ability of countries

charged low interest rates to borrow more and hence to run deficits).

      In sum, this analysis provides some evidence that lenders discriminated

among potential borrowers on the basis of reputation and political factors

conveying information about the probability of default, but little evidence

that they were responsive to current economic conditions in the indebted

countries. Did they discriminate adequately? One way to approach this

question is to compare ex ante and ex post returns. A simple model can be

used as the basis for this comparison. The expected rate of return on risky

loans 1r should exceed the risk free rate i by a risk premium:


(3)       1r =   1f   +   öa


where a is default risk so .50 is the premium on risky loans. Ex ante (of

default) the return on risky loans exceeds that required:


(4)       'ex ante =       r   + 130



where lex ante is the ex ante rate of return. The ex post return 1ex post

differs from that required by investors by their expectational error .

Substituting and solving for the ex ante return gives:

If investors' expectat-lonal errors have mean zero, in a regression of ex ante

on ex post returns the constant term (-          i) should        be negative and the

coefficient on 'ex           should be not less than unity. Only -if investors

uniformly overestimate the return on foreign lending (c<O for all loans) can

the constant term be positive.

      Using the ex ante and ex post rates of return calculated by Eichengreen

and Portes (1986) for a sample of 50 dollar bonds (national, provincial,

municipal and corporate) issued in the U.S. between 1924 and 1930, equation

(6) can be estimated, yielding:


(7)        ex ante                         'ex post
                         (45:06) (0:93)
                                    N=50       R20.018


with t-statistics in parentheses. The constant term is positive, indicating

plausibly that the extent and cost of default in the early 1930s were not

fully anticipated by investors (c significantly less than zero on average).

But this tells us little about market efficiency, since there is no reason to

suppose that an efficient market could have anticipated a single large

negative value of £ on the order of that which resulted from the macroeconomic

collapse of the 1930s. More tellingly, the coefficient
                                                                         ex post -is
significantly less than unity, which is inconsistent with the joint hypothesis

of rational expectations and market efficiency. What kind of systematic
                                       —31—


expectational errors does this imply? Instead of (6), posit investor errors

of the form:


(5')
            iexpost=ir+€_aa
which can be interpreted with a>Q as meaning that investors systematically

underestimate the cost of default on those bonds most at risk. Then it is

possible for the coefficient on 1ex          to be less than unity and, if a>ö,
                                      post
for that coefficient to be negative as in (7).

       Thus, these results suggest that investors incompletely incorporated

differential default risk into the spreads they demanded of foreign borrowers.

This is a bit surprising in light of the observed tendency (Table 6) of

bond-market participants to demand low risk premia of many borrowers which did

not default (Scandinavian and Western European nations, members of the British

Commonwealth, dependent Central American republics) and high risk premia many

borrowers which did default (Eastern European nations, other small Latin

American nations), since both tendencies should have given rise to a negative

correlation between ex ante and ex post returns. But despite demanding risk

premia in the appropriate instances, it nonetheless appears that they received

inadquate compensation. This is particularly evident in the comparison

between loans to Western European nations which performed well ex post and

loans to Germany which performed disastrously and between loans to Argentina

and Brazil.

       If default risk was imperfectly perceived at time of issue, did

bondholders recognize and act upon it subsequently? If risk neutral investors

are faced with the choice between two assets, only one of which is subject to
                                          —32—


default risk, the return on the risk-free asset should be a weighted average

of the return on the other asset in instances in which default does and does

not take place, where the perceived probability of default is the weight.

Using a to denote the share of interest and principle lost in the event of

default:


                                              =
(2)          (l+ir)*(1_P) +   (l_a)(l+ir)*P       1+f
where P is the probability of default, and              and i are the risky and risk—
free rates of return respectively. The expected capital loss aP (default

probability times per cent capital loss given default) can be derived from the

spread .39



(3)          aP =
                    [(irif)/(1+ir)]
      Moody's Aaa bond rate and the yield to maturity on the sample of 50

dollar bonds, each at the end of the calendar year, are used as measures of

the riskless and risk-free rate. Several expected losses from the sample of

50 dollar bonds described above are depicted in Figures 2-7. Figures 2 and 3

for Colombia and Brazil show that through 1929 the market's expectation of

capital loss was low (4 per cent or less). Thereafter, the expected loss due

to default began to rise. Since the first defaults occurred in 1931, while

the spreads on Colombian and Brazilian bonds rose in 1930, there is some

indication that the danger of default was anticipated by market participants.

Was this a perceived increase in the probability of default by those countries

which ultimately suspended debt service, or did market participants revise

their expectations for all Latin American bonds? Figure 4 suggests the

latter, although the timing and rate of growth of the expected loss differed

across issues. Argentine central and provincial government debt fell to

discounts even in instances where no default ultimately occurred. The

expected capital loss on the 1925 Argentine loan had risen by 1932 to the

levels achieved by Brazilian and Colombian bonds -in 1931. But Argentina's

expected loss rises later and declines once it is clear that the national

government intends to maintain service on the debt. The 1927 Province of

Tucuman issue behaves very differently: the expected loss begins to rise as

early as 1930 and reaches high levels in 1932-33 as default takes place on

other state and municipal Argentine loans. Once it becomes clear that debt

service will be maintained, spreads return to their initial levels.

     Figures 5 through 7 provide information on the pricing of European bonds.

They suggest that the externalities associated with the initial Latin American

defaults were limited largely to Latin America; significant discounts on the

German, Austrian and Hungarian bonds depicted in Figures 5-6 do not appear

until 1932, despite the spread of Latin American defaults from early 1931. It

is remarkable that more serious doubts about Central European bonds did not

materialize as early as 1930, when the Young Plan rescheduling of reparations

was needed to prevent Germany from falling into arrears. Even at this late

date National City Company was still suggesting that It is reasonable to

believe that the new loan.. .marks the beginning of a widening demand for

German bonds, both in this country and abroad. And the present, therefore,

would seem to be an opportune time for their purchase."4°

     Figure 7 depicts the behavior of spreads on three Scandinavian loans

serviced promptly throughout. Before 1932, spreads on these loans remain
                                     —34—


exceptionally low. They then rise in 1932 as default spreads to Eastern

Europe, although to nowhere near the levels of the German, Austrian and

Hungarian bonds in Figures 5-6. As in Latin America, there is evidence that

the German, Austrian and Hungarian defaults had contagion effects on the

perceived credit-worthiness of other European borrowers.

     Does this evidence suggest that default carried negative externalities by

creating doubt about the credit-worthiness of even those nations which

continuously maintained service on their obligations? In the 1930s, it

appears that such externalities existed but were confined mainly to other

countries in the same region. The first Latin American defaults did not have

a discernible impact on the bonds of countries in other parts of the world.

But when these effects occurred, they were persistent; it took four years, for

example, for the initial impact on Argentine credit-worthiness to dissipate.



4.   Default and Market Access

     "The great depression that began in 1929 brought our first great
     venture in foreign lending to a sick end. There had been a thrill
     about this swift financial ascension over the oceans. It was gone,
     and seemingly for all time.. .A general sigh of resolve was to be
     heard over the United States: never again should we lend or invest
     our money in foreign lands."
                                                  Feis (1950, p.1)

     The debt defaults of the 1930s were sobering for American investors. The

performance of U.S. portfolio investments abroad, notably debts of foreign

governments, was particularly disheartening. Approximately two thirds of

foreign securities held by American investors fell into default over the

course of the Depression decade. Contemporaries believed that the experience

of the 'thirties had a lingering impact on the attitudes of investors. The
                                     —35—


United Nations explained the postwar decline in private loans to governments

on the basis of "losses resulting from default and only partly mitigated by

subsequent agreements with the borrowers that bondholders have accepted in

order to avoid more severe loss.. "41 When transmitting to the Economic and

Social Council of the United Nations in 1949 a study by the National

Association of Manufacturers of the potential for U.S. capital exports

following the conclusion of the Marshall Plan, Curtis E. Calder, Chairman of

the Association's International Relations Committee, expressed this view as

follows:
                             -




          "We feel further that the relative undesirability of
     inter-governmental loans has been impressed equally upon grantors
     and recipients. After the experience of the 'thirties and the
     serious balance of payment difficulties now plaguing most of the
     world, the superiority of equity over loan financing has, we
     believe, a universal appeal.. .We strongly recommend that no
     reliance be placed upon inter-governmental loans outside of the
     category of those qualifying within the limits of the funds of
     Export-Import Bank and the Bank for Reconstruction and
     Development. "42

     Despite a proliferation of similar statements, it is not obvious that the

experience of the 'thirties influenced investors' actions as well as their

statements, particularly since a variety of other postwar disruptions might

conceivably have exercised an even more powerful influence over the volume and

pattern of foreign lending. Moreover, any new hesitancy to extend loans to

foreign governments did not have a sufficient half life to prevent the

astounding growth of sovereign debt in the 1970s. Still, it seems plausible

that repercussions of the debt defaults of the 1930s were felt by the capital

markets in the 1940s and 1950s. One approach to this issue is to compare U.S.

foreign lending in the ten years immediately succeeding World Wars I and II.
                                          -36-


Clearly, the second half of the 1940s and first half of the 1950s comprise a

very special period in the history of the world economy, following as they do

on the heels of a global conflagration. Since the years 1919-28 comprise an

equally special period for many of the same reasons, they provide an

especially useful basis for comparison. Admittedly, a study of the ten years

immediately following World War II is not a complete analysis of the legacy --

if   any --   of   interwar debt defaults. But if no legacy of default can be

discerned in the immediate postwar decade when interwar experience was so

immediate and the parallels were so extensive, it seems unlikely that such

evidence could be found for subsequent years.

       In comparing U.S. foreign lending in the decades immediately following

the two world wars, it is useful to distinguish three questions. First, was

total U.S. foreign lending depressed in the wake of the debt defaults of the

1930s? Second, was the relative importance of direct and portfolio investment

altered by the lingering effects of interwar defaults? Third, compared to

countries which continuously serviced their debts, did countries which had

defaulted find it more difficult to borrow abroad?

       Table 8 summarizes the volume and composition of U.S. foreign lending in

the two postwar decades. Lending from 1946 through 1955 is expressed -in

1919—28 average prices. A first fact evident from Table 8 is that US.

capital exports actually were larger in the second postwar decade (more than

three times as large at current prices, more than twice as large at constant

prices). However, the difference is due almost entirely to unilateral

transfers by government, notably the Marshall Plan.       (The amount and direction

of Marshall Plan aid are summarized in Table 9.) Net of official transfers,

U.S. foreign lending at constant prices remains almost exactly unchanged

between the two postwar decades. At the most aggregated level, then, there is

little evidence that the debt defaults of the 1930s had a damping effect on

the volume of U.S. lending.

    Only at the aggregate level, however, is there little change. Putting

aside unilateral transfers, there is a reversal in the relative importance of

lending by government and by the private sector, the public sector accounting

for just 20 per cent after World War I but for fully 51 per cent after World

War II. The real value of private lending at constant prices (long- and

short-term combined) fell by nearly one third between the post-World—War-I and

post-World—War—Il decades. Within private lending, there are equally far

reaching changes in composition. While the share of short-term capital in

U.S. private lending remains more or less unchanged, the relative importance

of direct and portfolio investment is reversed. Where portfolio investment

was more than double direct investment in the decade following World War I, it

was less than a quarter of direct investment in the decade following World War

II. Although there are other reasons why reliance on direct investment might

have increased after World War II -- such as the standard presumption that

direct investment is relatively advantageous for firms engaged in the

manufacture of goods produced with firm-specific technical knowledge, a type

of production which tended to grow more important in international

transactions as the century progressed --   it   seems implausible that these

slowly-evolving factors rather than the repercussions of default were mainly

responsible for the very dramatic rise in direct investment after 1945. Due

to both the fall in the real value of private lending and the declining share
                                     -38-


of portfolio investment, the real value of the latter fell most dramatically

between decades, by more than 80 per cent. Overall, there was a dramatic

decline in the willingness of Americans to accumulate portfolio investments

abroad, precisely what one would expect had purchasers been deterred by

defaults on foreign bonds.

     While the U.S. was far and away the leading capital exporter of the

post—World-War-Il period, she had not been so dominant after World War I. In

the period 1924—27, when U.S. capital exports fluctuated in the range of

$1.2—$1.6 billion per annum, total capital exports of the industrial countries

reached $2 billion annually and more.43 It is noteworthy, therefore, that

private capital exports of other industrial countries fell even more

dramatically between the two postwar decades than did the capital exports of

the United States. New issues for overseas account floated in London in the

period 1947-52 amounted to £45 million per annum, less than 50 per cent of the

current—price value of the period 1920—25. Meanwhile, British investors

steadily repatriated their foreign funds between 1946 and 1951. The nominal

value of the overseas investments of U.K. residents in the form of securities

quoted on the London Stock Exchange declined by £432 million.44 The outflow of

private capital from France over the period 1946-52 is estimated to have

approached a total of $1 billion; in contrast, in the period 1920—26 the total

outflow (excluding gold) had been more than $33 billion.45

    Consistent country data on the extent of foreign borrowing after World

War II are notoriously difficult to obtain. Fortunately, courtesy of

Avramovic's (1958) massive study, reasonably consistent data on stocks of debt

at three points in time are available for 36 countries. As summarized in

Table 9, these include disbursed and undisbursed long-term debt owned or

guaranteed by public bodies in debtor countries (central and local

governments, public agencies and state-owned enterprises) and exclude grants

in aid (notably Marshall Plan aid), loans repayable in local currency, loans

with a maturity of less than 12 months, and drawings on the IMF. Debt is

valued as on the books of the borrowing countries.

     In the raw data, no relationship between default in the 1930s and

borrowing after 1945 is apparent. But reputational effects are only a subset

of the factors affecting a government's willingness and ability to borrow

abroad. The United Nations, when discussing external borrowing in this

period, cited country size and the relative importance of imports in domestic

consumption as factors positively associated with borrowing.46 Standard

borrowing models suggest in addition that countries whose exports are most

variable will have the greatest tendency to borrow abroad in order to smooth

fluctuations in export receipts and domestic purchasing power.47 My analysis

of the role of these factors and of past debt-servicing records in the extent

of borrowing in the post-World-War II decade builds on the data in Table 10.

Additional information on external debt was obtained from United Nations

(1948) and the annual reports of the Council of Foreign Bondholders and

Foreign Bondholders Protective Council, permitting Argentina, Bolivia, Costa

Rica, Venezuela, Egypt, Germany and Sweden to be added to the sample.

Information on imports, exports and GNP was obtained from International

Monetary Fund (1978), supplemented as necessary by United Nations (1958) and

Wilkie (1974). These were used to calculate measures of openness (the

import/GNP ratio in 1955) and export variability (the variance of exports over

the three years 1953-55). Finally, as a measure of the extent of interwar

default, the percentage of dollar and sterling external governmental debt (all

levels of government plus government—guaranteed loans to enterprise) in

default as to interest and/or sinking fund at the end of 1935 was calculated

from the reports of the two bondholders' committees. 1935 is chosen as the

year in which to measure interwar default since almost all of these defaults

occurred between 1931 and 1934.48 Admittedly, the share of debt in default is a

crude measure of reputation; it might be desirable in future work to include

the share of contracted debt service payments actually made, as Jorgensen

(1987) or Lindert and Morton (1987), or a measure of the outcome of

debtor-creditor negotiations, such as the Foreign Bondholders Protective

Committee's endorsement.

     The absence of information on one or more of the independent variables

forced a number of countries to be dropped, leaving 32, of which 18 are Latin

American.49 Two types of regressions were run on this cross section. Those in

Table 11 analyze the determinants of net foreign borrowing by public

authorities ——   the   change in the external debt between 1945 and 1955. Those

in Table 12 follow other recent studies of sovereign debt by taking as the

dependent variable not the net flow of resources over the decade but the

terminal stock —-      the   value of the external debt -in 1955. An advantage of the

stock formulation is that elasticities can be estimated directly by defining

the 1955 debt stock in log form (which is not possible for the flow of

borrowing since that variable can be negative).

     Consider first the value of borrowing. The first equation in Table 11,

in which borrowing is regressed on only a constant term and the share of debt

in default in 1935, suggests at best a weak negative relationship between

interwar default and external borrowing in the first post-World—War-Il decade.

The point estimate can be read to suggest that countries which defaulted

(share in default = 1) borrowed $171.4 million less than countries that

serviced their entire debt (share in default =   0).   Since the mean of the

dependent variable is $334 million, this point estimate is substantial.

However, the next two equations indicate that this apparent difference among

countries is due entirely to other respects in which defaulting and

nondefaulting countries differed. Larger, more open countries borrowed more,

while countries more heavily indebted at the beginning of the postwar decade

borrowed less. These results are consistent with the observations of United

Nations (1965) and the predictions of optimal foreign borrowing models. The

only hypothesis not verified is the posited association between export

variability and the volume of borrowing, which is nonexistent in this period.

This variable is dropped, therefore, from the third equation. But the most

striking finding is that inclusion of these additional determinants of

borrowing reverses the association between interwar default and postwar

borrowing, yielding a positive correlation between default and subsequent

borrowing that is statistically significant at standard confidence levels.

There is no evidence that countries which defaulted in the interwar period

found it more difficult to borrow in the immediate post-World-War-Il years.

     An obvious suspicion is that the inclusion of 1945 debt is mainly

responsible for reversing the coefficient on interwar default. Default in the

1930s, the argument would run, permitted countries to buy back their external

liabilities at deep discounts and, by reducing their debt burdens, facilitated
                                     -42-


subsequent borrowing. This does not seem to have been the case, however,

since dropping 1945 debt alters neither the sign nor the significance of the

coefficient on 1935 default.

     The results in Table 12, concerned with variations in the terminal debt

stock, are consistent with those just discussed. Again, the value of the

external debt in 1955 is positively related to GNP and openness,

insignificantly related to export variability, and related to the 1945 debt

stock with an elasticity of less than unity (suggesting that countries heavily

indebted at the start of the period borrowed less over the interim). Most

importantly, interwar default is either positively associated or unrelated to

postwar indebtedness. Again, there is no evidence that countries which

defaulted in the 1930s found it more difficult to borrow in the 1940s and

1950s.

     While the Abramovic data have the virtue of consistency, they have the

problem of combining all types of external debt accumulated by governments,

whether extended by international agencies, creditor country governments or

private investors. There is no reason to expect public lenders, in particular

the U.S. government at the beginning of the Cold War, to have responded to

market incentives and reputational factors in the same manner as private

investors. It would be desirable to analyze private portfolio lending (to

both the public and private sectors) separately from lending by public agencies

before concluding that no trace of interwar defaults can be discerned in the

geographical distribution of postwar lending. Unfortunately, post-WWII

balance—of—payments records of bond floatations and repurchases and of loans

from private foreign banks are of dubious quality. Typically, these are

derived as a residual from the balance-of-payments accounts by deducting from

total long-term capital inflows the sum of loans granted by international

agencies and foreign governments. Total long-term capital flows for this

period are themselves exceptionally difficult to measure accurately because of

the extent of security repurchases; while relatively good records are

available of new floatations and bank loans, little reliable information is

published on transactions in outstanding public or private securities held by

foreigners.

     Nonwithstanding these difficulties, the United Nations (1965) has

published estimates of private portfolio lending to the Latin American

countries over the first postwar decade. These figures are shown in Table 13.

Table 14 combines them with the GNP, trade and default indicators described

above to analyze the association of interwar default with postwar portfolio

capital inflows for the 18 Latin American countries included in the preceding

analysis of the Abramovic data. The bivariate relationship between postwar

portfolio borrowing and interwar default, shown in the first column, is

positive but statistically insignificant. Once other correlates of the demand

for debt are added to the equation, the coefficient on interwar debt turns

negative, as the reputational hypothesis would predict, although the point

estimate of the coefficient remains smaller than its standard error. While

the sign of the coefficient on interwar default is somewhat sensitive to the

combination of other variables included in the equation (only when both GNP

and the curiously signed measure of export variability are included is the

coefficient on interwar default consistently negative), its low level of

significance is not. Once again, it is impossible to reject the null

hypothesis that variations across countries in the severity of interwar

default had essentially no impact on the relative ease with which countries

secured private portfolio capital inflows during the postwar years.

     The two central findings of this section —- a much reduced volume of

private portfolio lending and no greater difficulty of borrowing for countries

that had defaulted previously -—   are not difficult to reconcile with one
another. Recall the evidence from the previous section on the impact of one

country's default on the market's expectation of capital losses on neighboring

countries' bonds. That evidence suggests that some effects of interwar

defaults were external to the initiating country, a conclusion consistent with

the evidence from this section suggesting that the main legacy of interwar

debt defaults was to depress the volume of private portfolio lending generally,

not to divert it to faithful servicers from countries which lapsed into

default.



5.   Conclusion

     What picture of the capital market emerges from this study of the United

States' first 35 years as a creditor nation? It is patently impossible to

characterize the market as either perfectly rational or wholly irrational.

Advocates of a return to the bond market as a panacea for recent difficulties

with sovereign lending should take note of these conclusions. While switching

back from bank loans to the bond market may divert some of the risk shouldered

by creditor-country banking systems, bond market participants have shown no

greater facility than bank loan officers historically in distinguishing good

credit risks from bad. Nor were bond markets any more successful in smoothing

the flow of capital to developing-country debtors.

     What picture of the legacy of default for the subsequent behavior of the

markets emerges from this study of the last complete debt cycle? Recent

theoretical studies of sovereign lending in the presence of potential default

have posited the existence of a default penalty ,   usually   interpreted as the

costs of inferior access to international capital markets in the wake of

default. The finding that, compared to countries which maintained debt

service throughout, countries which lapsed into default in the 1930s were no

less able to borrow in the 1940s and 1950s is difficult to reconcile with this

simple view. If there were costs of default, they did not take the form of

differential credit-market access in the first postwar decade. But this does

not imply that default was costless. Evidence from bond prices in the 1930s

and from the volume and composition of lending in the 1940s-1950s suggests

that at least some of the costs of default spilled over among debtor

countries. These costs took the form of reduced access to private portfolio

capital flows for defaulting and nondefaulting countries alike.

     To say that default had costs is not to say that it was necessarily

welfare reducing. It may also have had benefits in the form of the spur to

growth and adjustment provided by a lightened debt burden. Comparisons of

economic growth and structural change in defaulting and nondefaulting

countries will be needed before welfare conclusions can be drawn. But the

fact that a substantial share of the costs were external to the individual

country indicates that there may be gains to debtors from coordinating their

decisions, whether or not that decision is to maintain service on their

external debts.

the United States (including refunding to Americans is from Dickens (1932),

P. 8. The picture for the other major creditor country, Britain, looks

broadly similar although the fluctuations in lending are considerably damped;

see Eichengreen and Portes (1986), Sec. 2.

7.   It is conceivable, of course, that the lending series is traced out not

by movements of the supply curve along a stable demand curve but by shifts in

borrowers' demand (down in 1923, up starting in 1924, and down after 1928).

argue, however, that demand remained relatively stable at high levels

throughout the decade and that changes in quantities reflected mainly shifts

in supply.

8.   Lewis's (1938, p. 370) estimates of yields to maturity are 5.3 per cent
                                      -47-


for 1915-April 1917 and 6.7 per cent for 1922—24. The 1920 Belgian Loan

illustrates the difficulties encountered by borrowers at the beginning of the

decade. It has been argued that Belgium managed to obtain these funds only

because U.S. commercial banks had a special stake in the country. The banks

had previously extended Belgium short-term credits in the amount of $50

million to purchase wheat and other essential commodities. Due to a

deterioration in the country's external position, it quickly became evident

that the government was in no position to repay. The authorities therefore

approached the bankers, who agreed to float $50 million worth of 25 year

bonds. The terms were highly favorable to investors: the bonds bore a nominal

interest rate of 7.5 per cent and were callable only at 115. Yet "the

subscription books were kept open for three days, a very unusual procedure;

every resource the bankers could command was used to induce subscription. .

Only after having taken these exceptional steps was the loan successfully
floated. See Swan (1928), from where the above quote is drawn.

9.   As Lawrence Speaker wrote in 1924 (p. 93), "From the political

standpoint, Europe today presents a very uncertain outlook. Since most of

Eastern Europe is in the hands of the radical socialists whose views on

capital are quite incompatible with those held here, since Central Europe is

threatened with political as well as economic breakdown, and the nations of

Western Europe are torn apart by contending political influences, a policy of

extreme caution in making investments in Europe seems highly advisable. It is

possible that some of these countries, in their dire necessity, may be drawn

to the confiscation of private property as well as wholesale repudiation of

their internal debts.. . .Such tendencies on the part of governments are not at
                                    —48—


all conducive to the stability and soundness of investments."

10. The Economist (July 5, 1924) described the return as follows, "The yield,

allowing for redemption in twenty years, works out at approximately £8 16s per

cent. This is a high yield and indicates to some extent the measure of risk

involved."

11. Costigliola (1976, p. 490) suggests that the Fed took this action in

order to render investment in the Dawes Loan more attractive.

19. Both types of tales are too well known to require elaboration here. On

selling the foreign borrower, one Department of Commerce expert told the

Senate Finance Committee of a time at which there were at least 29

representatives of American investment banking firms in Colombia seeking to

negotiate various loans. A Bavarian town initially wishing to borrow $125,000

was convinced to commission an issue of $3 million instead (U.S. Senate, 1932,

pp. 845—848, 1279—1280). On selling the small investor, Stoddard (1932, p.

106) writes, "Up to the slump of 1920, these new clients sought the
                                    -49—


branch-offices. After the slump, the branch-offices sought them. They did it

through hosts of young salesmen, carefully schooled in "high-pressure" methods

of breaking down "sales-resistance." They keynote was pressure —-   all   down the

line. The home office kept the branch-offices "on their toes" by a stream of

phone-calls, "flashes," "pep-wires," and so forth. The branch managers kept

the young salesmen all "burned up" with pep-talks," bonuses, and threats of

getting fired. Everybody in authority demanded "results"; which meant, more

sales. Every salesman must sell his "quota." What he sold, how he sold it,

and whom he sold it to, did not much matter. Verily, business had got -into

banking; or, rather, "banking", in the old sense of the word, had been kicked

out of doors by business."

22. The significance of this moral hazard problem is impossible to determine

in the absence of detailed study of the operations of particular affiliates.

But it is worth noting in this connection that White (1986) has found little

empirical support for other criticisms of securities affiliates.

25. Dulles (1926), pp. 35—37. There were also objections on other occasions,

such as a loan for a Czech brewery, presumably on the grounds that this was

inconsistent with a U.S. policy of Prohibition, and for a Brazilian coffee

valorization scheme and a German potash syndicate, on the grounds that the

higher prices which would result would be harmful to U.S. consumers. (Both

borrowers ultimately succeeded in obtaining funds in London.) In addition,

President Harding urged his Secretary of State to discourage U.S. lending for

foreign purchases of armaments.

26. Brandes (1962), pp. 177-178; Angell (1933), p. 101—102. France managed

to circumvent U.S. restrictions to some extent before 1928. For example, Ivar

Kreuger's Swedish Match Company loaned large sums to the French government

soon after its U.S. subsidiary floated $50 million of bonds on the American

market.

30. Madden and Nadler (1929, p. 83), for example, in a manual on securities

investment, instruct investors to consider trade and budget balances and

natural resource endowments. See also pp. 96-97. Madden, Nadler and Sauvain

(1937, p. 207) mention the trade balance, the budget balance, the position of

the central bank, and the debt of the government.

31. Consistent with this hypothesis, Eichengreen and Portes (1986) found that

government budget surpluses were negatively associated with the incidence of

default in the 1930s.

32. Principal sources include the League's Statistical Yearbook, Memorandum

on Public Finance, Review of World Trade and Balance of Payments and Foreign

Trade Balances (various years).

33. Regressions where loan value was entered alone rather than as a share of

export were virtually indistinguishable from those reported below.

included in Lewis's lists. The constant of 6.7 is to be interpreted,

therefore, as the return that would have been required of a Venezuelan

corporation in 1929 in percentage points on small (value approaching zero)

short—term loan floated by a Venezuelan corporation in 1929 had that country's

trade and government budget been balanced.

35. In certain of the Central American countries, U.S. involvement had a

military dimension with direct implications for creditworthiness. Under the

Hay-Bunau Varilla Treaty of 1904, the U.S. was permitted to intervene in

Panama City and Colon to preserve order and to supervise the expenditure of

Panamanian government loans placed in the U.S. The Platt Amendment appended

to the Cuban constitution in 1901 permitted the U.S. to object to what it

regarded "improvident or otherwise objectionable fiscal policy." An American

Receiver-General was installed in the Dominican Republic in 1907 to collect

customs revenues, and in 1912 revolution led to the landing of U.S. marines,

followed by formal military administration in 1916; even after the marines'

withdrawal in 1924, the U.S. retained the right to object to changes in

Dominican tariffs and public debt. Haiti was under U.S. martial law from 1916

to 1931, under the provisions of which the U.S. controlled the customs houses

and all aspects of the public finances. See Angell (1933), pp. 8—27.
