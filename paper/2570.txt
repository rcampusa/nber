I.     Introduction

        It is by now a well established empirical              result that research and

development (R&D)        s   a significant element in productivity growtn (see

Nadiri    [1380], Griliches 11950], TeriecKyj             1974], and Mansfield [1968]).

However, R&D investment is itself an outcome               o    a co'porate plan.   This

nvestment is influenceo by the existing technology, by prices, oy product

'emand     ha-aoberistios, arc oi toe         egacj   o    Past caoira1 accumulation

Jecsionu,         In this paper we want no nvest1gate the influences on R&D

     vestrne'n    sd   how these effects elcit an i"teraction with the other fac-

tors of production.          In particular,   we focus on the determinants and

nteract4on of          labor, physical and R&D capital.

        There are essentially three major problems which are dealt with in

this paper.        The first relates to the nature of the factor substitution

oossibiLties between the three inputs.                Specifically, we want to know how

labor and physical        capital respond to changes in the factor price of R&D

capital, and how, in turn,          R&D capital   is affected by changes in its own


price, as well as the wage rate ano rental              -'ate   on physical capital.   The

second problem pertains to the output expansion possibilities. In par-

ticular,    we investigate the magnitude by which output expansion (or what

may oe considered the same thing, product demand growth) increases labor,

physical,        and R&D capital.

        The last general problem relates directly to the dynamics of the

model.     Certain factors of production are costly to adjust, and therefore

it takes time for the firm to adopt its long run factor requirement. It
                                         -3—


is these costs of adjustment which render the model
                                                    dynamic.              Generally,

it is acknowledged that increases       in the level of physical capital       involve

adjustment costs, so that it is quasi—fixed, while labor may be considered

a variable input (sometimes       labor is disaggregated into skilled and

unskilled,     the latter is variable and the former is                        In the
                                                        quasi-fixed).

present context R&D     capital   is also modeled as a quasi—fixed factor,

because of the significant development costs incurred in this investment

process.      We estimate the extent to which adjustment costs affect factor

demands,   and measure the magnitude of these costs for physical and R&D

capital.
     An important but unresolved      issue addressed   relates to the substantial

difference between the rates of return on physical and R&D capital reported

in the literature.     Previous empirical work (see Griliches       [1980], Minasian

[1969], and Mansfield [1965]) has found, and left unexplained,             the result

that the marginal    value of R&D (measured for example by the marginal

product) exceeds both the marginal value of physical        capital   ,   and the

interest rate.     In this paper, we show that these conclusions are the out-

come of the existence of adjustment costs.         The marginal   value of R&D is

greater than the opportunity cost of funds        (i.e. the interest rate) because

the former must be sufficiently large to cover the marginal costs of

adjustment.     Moreover,   the reason that the marginal value of R&D exceeds

the value for physical capital      is due   to the fact that the marginal adjust-

ment costs associated with R&D are greater than the costs for physical

capital.     This implies that the deviation between the marginal value of R&D
                                               —4-


and the interest rate is greater than the difference between the marginal

value of physical capital          and the interest rate.

       Sections 2 and 3 of the paper detail the theoretical model and its

specification for estimation.             The data, industry characteristics and esti-

mates are discussed       in sections 4 and 5.          The results concerning factor sub-

stitution, output expansion and costs of adjustment              are analyzed in sections

6, 7, and 8.      A summary of our findings is contained in the last section.


2.    The Theoretical     Model

       Consider the production process of a firm which can be descr-ed by


       (1)     y(t)   F(K(t-1),      Kr(t_l) L(t),      K(t)    LKr(t))


where y(t) is output in period            t, F is the twice   continuously differen-

tiable concave production function,
                                    K(t-1) is the physical capital input
at the beginning       of period t,              is the R&D or knowledge capital           input
                                    Kr(t_l)

at the beginning of period t, L(t) is the labor input in period t,                             =
                                                                                  K(t)
        —                                 —
K(t)        K(t—1).    AKr(t) =   KrCt)       Kr(t_l)    The marginal products are posi-

tive and diminishing,             > 0,     < 0 for i=p,r,2 and adjustment Costs

associated with               and M(r(t) are internal with            0,        < 0    j=e,d.
                      AK(t)                                      F         Fj
Following      Treadway [1971], [1974], Mortenson [1973], Meese [1980], and

Morrison and Berndt [1981) we assume that the quasi-fixed factors (K(t)

and            are subject to increasing internal Costs of adjustment.                In
      Kr(t))

other words, as purchases of additional            units of each quasi-fixed      input

occur, the quantity of foregone output rises.               This implies that the

average cost of investment increases            in response to physical and knowledge
                                                          —5—


capital       accumulation.

        The two quasi-fixed factors accumulate by



        (2)    K(t)
                      =       1(t)   +   (l—8) K(t—1).                               i=p,r


where I(t) is gross investment                      -in   period t and       is the Fixed depre-

ciation rate.         The work of Rakes and Schankerman E1978] has shown that

knowledge capital depreciates like physical capital. Moreover, they found

that the depreciation rate on the former is the higher of the two rates.

        We assume that the firm               -is   a price taker in all markets,            so that the

flow of funds can be written as


        (3)    V(t) =     p(t)y(t)       -   w(t)L(t)       -
                                                                P(t)I(t)         Pr(tr(t)

where V(t) is the flow of funds, p(t) is the product price, w(t)                                is the
wage,             is the P&E investment price and pr(t)                    -is   the R&D investment
         (t)
price in period          t,


        In order for the Firm to maximize its expected present value of the

flow of funds, it must minimize the expected discounted value of                                -its   costs.

Thus at time t the firm chooses a plan which minimizes



        (4)     J(t) =    Et         (t,) [w()L()               +   pp()Ip ()    +




where         is the conditional             expectation operator and a(t,W) is the discount

factor applied at date t for cost incurred at date                                   The program for the

firm can be summarized in the following manner.                           The firm minimizes the
                                                       —6—


expected discounted costs by selecting the labor requirements,                               end invest-

ment in R&D and physical capital subject to the production technology,

capital   accumulation conditions,                  and expectations regaraing prices and the

auantity of output.             The conditional            expectation operator is taken over all

future values of the wage 'ate, the prices of R&D and physical capital

investment and output.

      The optimizing program can be solved by inverting                              the production Func—

ton   to obtain the labor requirmerts function,


      (5)       L(t)     =G(K       (t-1),   Kr(tl)        K(t).        Kr(t)      y(t))


nth G           0                                                  0.   By substituting
            <       i=p,r,
                             G      > 0 j=e,d and
                                                           G   >                           (2)   and (5)

into (4),       e can observe that               the   firms       intertemporal     expected cost mini-

mization problem involves the optimal selection of knoiledge and physical

capital. The first order conditions are,


   (6.1)
                Et[w(t)Ge
                                +
                                    (t)      +   a(t,t+1)      (w(t+1)    (G
                                                                               -

                     -                             =   0
                         P(t+1)       (1-o))]

   (6.2)
                Et[(t)Gd
                                +
                                    Pr(t)    +   a(t,t+l)      (w(t+1) (Gr
                                                                               —
                                                                                   Gd)
                     -                             = 0.
                         Pr(t+l)      (1ör)))



These equations           illustrate         that the net change in expected discounted

costs, from purchasing an additional                       unit of a stock at date t, is zero.

The net change consists of the marginal adjustment costs plus the purchase

price, minus the future savings                    in adjustment         costs, purchase costs, and
                                                   7




variable (i.e. labor) costs from having larger stocks of physical capital

and R&D in the present.


3.   Model Specification

        The estimating equations consist of the inverted production function,

as well as the first order conditions (6.1) and (6.2).                           Since (6.1) and

(6.2) are derived relations,             in order to render the model estimable, we

only have to specify the labor requirments function and the nature of the

error terms.       The former is assumed to be



        (7)    L(t)/y(t) =   a+a           y(t)    r1=pa      (K(t)/y(t))

                             +   1
                                     a     y2(t)        r             (K(t)/y(t))2

                             +   3                                +   I
                                     aee      (t(tfl2                     add (Kr(t)/y(t))2


                             +                          +
                                 Zrayi     K1(t-1)          apr   K(t1)       Kr(t1)/y2(t)




We have selected a linear—quadratic                labor-output           requirements function,

which is a second order approximation                  to any arbitrary labor-output func-

tion.     Note that we have not imposed any restrictions on the degree of

returns to scale.        In addition,        because there is only a single variable

factor of production, equation (7) is equivalent to specifying the average

variable cost function for the firm.                   Lastly,        incorporated   into (7) is the

reasonable condition that marginal costs of adjustment are zero at                                   =
                                                                                              K(t)
Kr(t)     =   0.   This has the effect of making the adjustment costs internal,
                                                         -8—


but separable from the output production process.

        Given equation              (7),   the first order conditions (6.1) and (6.2) become,

Our basic model consists of equations                        (7), (8.1) and (8.2).         We can observe

that equations (8.1) and (8.2) are simultaneous,                           and that the overall

system       is   nonlinear in the variables.

        To obtain parameter values For equation set (7), (8.1). and (8.2), we

must consider the nature of the error terms in each of these equations,

The first order conditions describe the expected effects on costs from

adding physical and R&D capital stocks,                         Moreover,      these expectations are

conditional           on all information available to the firm at the date the

investment decisions are made.                       Thus the errors in (8.1) and (8.2) repre-

sent unanticipated              information       (i.e. surprises)       which become available at

date    t,   and      therefore their conditional expected values are zero.                     The

error    associated with the labor requirements function represents tech—

nological    shocks which illustrate the randomness in the production

process.2     The conditional     expectation of the labor requirements function

is viewed as holding on a conditioning set of instrumental           variables which

only contain lagged variables, In this context, it is possible to employ

the results of Hansen and Singleton £1982] and Hansen £1982] who developed

a generalized method of moments estimator.         Moreover,    as shown by Pindyck

and Rotemberg    [1982(a)],      when the error terms are conditionally homosce-

dastic,   the estimator    is equivalent to the nonlinear      three—stage estimator

as developed by Jorgenson and Laffont £1974] and Amemiya [1977].


4.   The Data and

      The sample Consists of a set of firms grouped into four two—digit SIC

industry classifications,         Within SIC 20 (foods) there are five firms,

there are nine firms within SIC 28 (chemicals),         for SIC 33 (primary metals)

we have seven firms, and finally for SIC 35 (nanelectrical           machinery)   there

are fourteen firms,       The word "industry'    in this paper refers to a specific

set of firms in each classification.         The selection of firms was dictated

by the availability of consistent time series data on R&D and physical

capital (or plant and equipment) expenditures.          The time period ranges from

1959-1966.     Thus we have a sample of time series and cross section data

which were pooled in order to provide a richer set of information in which

to estimate the model under consideration.

      The list of variables and their construction are:           Plant and equipment

time depreciation allowances divided by the gross plant and equipment and

then dividing this sum by the numoer of time periods.                   The R&D capital

input (<r) was obtained from a similar procedure,

Investment in R&D                and its associated price              were obtained from
                         'r
Standard & Poors data series, and we arbitrarily chose                     =   .1   to measure

the depreciation rate for the stock of knowledge.                    The labor input (L) is

defined as the labor expense, from the Standard & Poors tape, divided by

the wage rate (w).         The latter variable was obtained from the Bureau of

Labor Statistics.        Output        (y)   is defined as sales, obtained from the

Standard & Roars data, divided by the producer price index (p).                      The price

variable comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.                    Finally, the one

period discount rate (a(t,t+1) =               l/(1+r(t))   is   measured as the corporate

bond rate (Aaa).         This variable was obtained from the Presidents Economic

Report, 1980.

        Table 1 presents the means and standard deviations of the main

variables for each industry used in the model between 1959 and 1966.

Defining variable intensities in terms of output, we see an interesting set
                                              —   11 —




of   cross   industry patterns emerging,           The food industry has the lowest

intensity     in   all   three input variables, while the chemical industry has the

highest      Although primary metals and chemicals exhibit the same physical

capital to output ratio, the standard deviation                for the latter is substan-

tially smaller.          Primary metals exhibits a physical capital intensity which

is slightly more than twice that for nonelectrical               machinery. Moreover,

the R&D intensity for the latter industry is slightly below double that for

primary metals.          Since the labor intensities (and their standard

deviations)    are the same it will be of interest to compare the results

obtained     for each of these two industries.

       The physical capital       intensity    illustrates    that there are two classes

of "industries",         the "highs"   (chemicals and primary metals)      and the "lows'

(food and nonelectrical        machinery).        However,   the R&D intensity variable

shows that there is roughly an equal              spread among the four industries.     The

R&D intensity of primary metals is approximately twice that for foods.

Nonelectrical      machinery is nearly double the value of primary metals, while

chemicals    is almost twice the magnitude           for nonelectrical   machinery.

Finally,     the labor intensity       illustrates that three out of the four

industries exhibit the same magnitude, while foods is substantially

smaller.


5.   The Estimates

       In this section we describe the empirical             estimates obtained from

-equations    (7), (8.1) and     (8.2). First,       we pooled all four industries to

obtain the aggregate         results presented in Table 2. In estimating the
                                                   -    12 —




pooled data we    introduced       industry dummy variables                 in the zero and first

order terms,    Therefore, the constants                    in the derived equations ((8.1) and

(8.2)) are also industry specific.                     Overall the fit is good, as the R2 s

are high in all three equations. Most of the estimates are significant,

and all have the correct sign.              In particular, as output increases,

according   to the first and second order parameters,                           labor intensity     (or

average variable costs) increases
                                                 (as,
                                                        >   O     a   >

the first order terms show that as physical and R&D capital intensity rise
                                                                          0).       Holding output fixed,



the labor intensity       falls
                                   (a   <   0,    a, <      0).   The second order conditions

are satisfied   as
                      a   >   0,   arr > 0 and                  arr             >   0.   Finally the cost

of adjustment coefficients are positive
                                                                           add > 0) and the physical

                                        (aee

capital   parameter   is significant.             Thus physical capital                  is in fact a

quasi-fixed factor of production.                 The troublesome aspect is that the

adjustment parameter for R&D is insignificant.3                           This result can arise for

essentially two reasons; either on average for the four industries, and

over the period 1959-1966,         R&D capital is a variable factor of production,

or else there are more industry—specific                     variations than have been pre-

sently allowed for in the model.             In other words, not only are the zero and

first order parameters different            across industries, but the second order

coefficients also vary.        Adopting this second view, we estimate the model

for each industry.

     Tables 3-6 illustrate the estimates for foods, chemicals, primary

metals and nonelectrical       machinery. In all of the industries the                           niodel

fits the data quite well, most of the variables are significant,                                all of
                                            —   13 —




them have the correct sign, and, in            particular,   the second order conditions

are satisfied.4     The cost of adjustment estimate of physical capital            is

significantly   different from zero at the           99   level of confidence for three

out of the four industries.          Only for the food industry is the coefficient

marginally    insignificant   at the      9O    level of confidence.

     Since the R&D cost of adjustment estimate was insignificant in the

industry-pooled    model, it is of interest to see if the industry-specific

estimates    are different from the former.            This test is one way of deter-

mining whether or not there was sufficient allowance for industry variation

in the industry-pooled    model.       These results are presented in Table 7.

Clearly,    the industry-specific      estimates     of the cost of adjustment para-

meter are significantly different from the industry—pooledmagnitude.                    In

three out of the four industries the estimate of add is significantly dif-

ferent from the industry-pooled           estimate at the    99   level of confidence,

while in the last industry (nonelectrical machinery) the teat is marginally

rejected at the    9O   level.   However,        in this latter industry,   although the

coefficient is small, it is significantly different from zero at the               99
level of confidence.      Hence R&D capital is a quasi-fixed Factor of produc-

tion, which implies that there are signifiant              costs to develop knowledge.


6,   Price Elasticities of Factor Demands

     There are two sets of price elasticities which are relevant to the

present model.     The first group relates to the situation when both quasi-

fixed factors have adjusted to their long run magnitudes.                Under these cir-

cumstances AK0(t) =     Kr(t)    =   0,   and all prices, output and the interest
                                                        —   14 —




rate have         adjusted to their stationary values.                     Consequently equations

(8.1) and (8.2) become


        (9)    a1K/y         +     +       +        +                = 0      i=p,r
                                                        OprKy'Y

where         =
                  p   (r +   81)/w       i=p,r    is the wage normalized rental price for the

ith quasi—fixed factor.                From equation set            (9)   which   is a simulataneous

system, equation (7)             (with
                                         K(t)
                                                    =
                                                        Kr(t)       = 0) and using the estimates from

Tables 3 to 6, all the long run price elasticities can be computed.                               These

results are presented             in Table 8.

     We can observe from this table that for the various industries there

is a great deal of similarity with respect to the signs and magnitudes of

the factor price elasticties.                    The own price elasticities of both quasi—

fixed factors are negative and similar in value to each other, and across

the four industries.              Roughly an increase of              1    in the rental price of one

of the quasi-fixed factors               leads to a         .5     decrease in its demand.      Next we

see that physical and knowledge capital                       are complements in each industry.

However, the degree of complementarity is not symmetric across industries.

In foods and chemicals,            changes in the R&D rental price exerts greater down-

ward pressure on the demand for physical capital, relative to a change in

the physical capital             rental rate on the demand for R&D capital.                  The con-

verse is true for primary metals and nonelectrical machinery products.                                 Our

interest      in emphasizing the role of R&D as an endogenous input decision,

which entails substantial              development costs, has enabled us to show that

there are significant own and cross price elasticity effects.                              These are
                                            —   15 —




usually   neglected     in treatments of R&D.5

     Changes in the wage rate illustrate that both quasi-fixed factors are

substitutes      for labor, with the degree of substitution roughly the same

order of magnitude for P&E and R&D capital.            Only in the food industry,

with the physical capital intensity of output more than twice as high as

the R&D intensity and with the lowest labor-output           ratio,   is physical capi-

tal a significantly greater substitute for labor compared to R&D.

     Finally,      we can observe that for each industry, and for each factor

demand, changes in the wage rate elicit (in absolute value) the greatest

response.       This, of course, occurs because physical      and R&D capital are

complements,      while each type of capital is a substitute for labor.

Therefore,      the results point out the importance of unit labor costs        in the

production      process,   and how changes in these costs cause significant      modi-

fications       in the factor magnitudes,    both in absolute and relative terms.

     It is often difficult to relate particular estimates to other research,

because of differences in model specification and data. However, if we look

at the cost of adjustment models using aggregate data with at least two

quasi-fixed      factors where labor and physical capital were decomposed (e.g.

into skilled and unskilled for labor), the own price elasticity of physical

capital tends to be around - .5 (see, for example, Morrison and Berndt

E1981] and Pindyck and Rotemberg [1982(b)].            This result is similar to our

findings at the industry level.6         In other models where there is a single

quasi-fixed      factor or where labor and physical capital were not decomposed,

the elasticity was approximately —.2 (besides the previously cited two
                                         -   16 —




papers    see Epstein and Denny [1963]).

       We have already noted that there are few studies which have investi-

gated the price effects on R&D, and especially in the cost of adjustment

framework.     Finally with respect to the own price elasticity of labor

demand,   the estimates    seem to vary (see Hamermesh     [1976] for a survey of

the pre—cost of adjustment literature).         What appears to be consistent,

though,   is that the wage elasticity of labor demand is greater in absolute

value to the own price elasticity of physical capital.7

       Up to this juncture, we have calculated the factor price elasticities

when both quasi-fixed Factors have adjusted to their long-run magnitudes.

Now let us suppose only one of the quasi-fixed factors has adjusted.             This

second set of experiments recognizes that there may be differential            speeds
of adjustment in the quasi-Fixed factors.           These elasticities may be termed
                     8
intermediate-run.

       The intermediate—runelasticities are presented        in Table 9.     The most

striking conclusions are that the intermediate-runown price elasticities

for each type of capital are similar to the                                and the
                                            long-run magnitudes,

own and cross wage elasticities are significantly smaller         (in absolute

value> compared to the long-run.        The first conclusion strengthens the fact

that   factor prices influence R&D, as well as P&E capital.        In particular,

even   if physical   capital   has not adjusted to its long-run   level, a   1
increase in the R&D rental price decreases its demand by .5.           The same is

true For physcial capital.       The second conclusion appears to arise from the

fact that in the long—run both quasi-fixed factors are substitutes for
                                          -   17 —




labor.     In the intermediate—run    only one of these inputs is able to adjust

to the higher wage, so the degree of substitution for labor is smaller,              and

consequently the intermediate—run own price elasticity of labor demand is

smaller in absolute value.


7.   Output Elasticities and the Returns to Scale

        Since output is exogenous,    we can calculate short, intermediate and

long—run output elasticities of factor demands.            Table 10 contains these

elasticities.     With respect to labor, we can observe that for each industry

there    is a decline in output elasticity from the short        to the long—run.

In the short-run    only labor is variable.          Hence in response to an increase

in demand for its product the firm must produce the additional           output by

increasing more than proportionately its demand for labor.            As R&D and

physical capital    adjust, given the higher level of product demand,        the firm

increases    its demand for the quasi—fixed      factors and reduces the use of the

variable factor of production.        This result occurs because as each quasi—

fixed factor increases,      the demand for labor decreases.       This is just

another way of stating that P&E and R&D capital are substitutes for labor.

Therefore in each industry we find that overshooting occurs for labor.

        This finding is consistent with Morrison and Berndt [1981], where

unskilled labor is a variable factor of production whose short-run output

elasticity is 1.349, and because they impose constant returns to scale, the

long—run elasticity is 1.       The long—run output elasticity is roughly con-

sistent with those surveyed in Hamermesh [1976], and in Pindyck and

Rotemberg    [1982(a),   1982(b)],   although our short run elasticities are quite
                                                -   18 -




different.    Another result from the model                 is that the output elasticity of

labor is affected when at least one of the quasi—fixed Factors                       (but not

necessarily   both) adjusts to its long run level,                  in   other   words, for each

industry there is virtually no difference between the intermediate                       and


long—run output elasticities of labor.                 All that is needed to dissipate

labor overshooting is the adjustment of at least one of the quasi-fixed

factors.

     The output elasticities of the physical and R&D capital stocks are

quite similar both For the different                industries    and for the intermediate

and long-runs.      It is also interesting            to compare Tables 8 and 9 to 10.           We

see that output increases         (or product demand growth) exert a larger effect

on input demands compared to any individual price change (in absolute

value).    This suggests,       in particular,        that policies which spur product

demand growth may cause more R&D and physical capital                     investment   to be ini-

tiated than policies (such as specific tax allowances) which lower the ren-

tal rates.

     Although we have not restricted the technologies to exhibit constant

returns to scale, we can observe,           from the long run output elasticities,

that the returns to scale is not significantly different from unity.9 In

fact we can compute the returns to scale for each industry.                        In order to

undertake this calculation,           consider any general specification             of the tech-

no logy,



    (10)     T(n   L, th
                           K.    2n   Kr   'I   )    = 1,
where T is the transformation function defined over the natural
                                                                                        logarithms
of the inputs and output.                  The definition of returns to scale, which is

the proportional             increase in output resulting from the common proportional

increase in all inputs, means that we need


       (11)    TLd2n L +       Td2n       K    +
                                                   Trd2fl Kr   +
                                                                   Td2n   Y =   0.

ssuming dn         L = d2n
                                K = d2n Kr = dn v               then (11) becomes


       (12)              =            +        +
                               [TL        Tp       Tr]/Ty

which    is the measure of returns to scale.

     We can represent the technology from (10) in terms of a labor
                                                                   require-
ments function defined over the natural logarithms of the inputs and out-

put.     Since the firm minimizes costs, and because there is a single

variable factor of production, the labor requirements function is equiva—

lent to the variable cost function.                      Let,


       (13)    n   L =   H(n              2n   Kr   in y)


and then the right side of (12) becomes



       (14)
                                     (H   +
                                               Hrfl/Hy

Equation      (14) permits us to compute the returns to scale in terms of the

specified     labor requirements function,                  upon which our estimates are based.
       The results are presented in Table 11.                       For each industry, we show the
                                         -   20 —




three    short run elasticities for labor demand, which are necessary for the

calculation (which correspond to      H,     H   and
                                                       Hr in equation (14)).       The
first row repeats the output eiasticty found in the first row of Table 10.

The second and third rows represent respectively short run elasticity of

labor demand with respect to the physical           and R&D capital     nputs.     If we

were to picture these elasticities they would represent the curvature of

the isoquant between labor and one of the quasi-fixed factors,
                                                               holding the

other capital input and output fixed.          There are some interesting features

of these measures.       First, as expected,     they are all negative, so labor and

the quasi—fixed      factors are short run substitutes.       Second,    in each case

labor and physical      capital are stronger substitutes      in the short       run than

labor and R&D capital.       Although in the nonelectrical      machinery       industry,
there is only a minor difference.       The only other study we are aware of

which has looked at elasticities between factor demands is Nadiri-Bitros

[1980],     They found, for the largest firms in their sample, a ranking of

the degrees of substitution which is similar to ours, with                  =   -.3430 and
     =   - .0386.   Indeed the pnysical capital     elasticity of labor demand is
er
strikingly close to the average of our industry measures, but our elasti—

city for R&D capital is substantially        greater in absolute value.
         The third result from Table 11 is that for the industry with the

lowest factor intensities of output (SIC 20, foods) and the industry with

the highest intensities      (SIC 28, chemicals) the P&E elasticity is nearly

twice as large as the R&D elasticity.          It seems that it is not the absolute

magnitude of the input intensities which matters, but rather the relative

                                             21 —




difference    beween the capital intensities of output.         This can be seen from

the fact that the greatest difference between the physical            and R&D capital

intensities of output is found       in SIC 33 (primary metals).      Table 11 shows

that this industry exhibits the greatest difference in quasi-fixed factor

short    run elasticities of labor.     Moreover,     the industry with the smallest

difference in the capital input intenstities of output is SIC 35

(nonelectrical    machinery),   and here we observe very little difference in

the degree of substitution between physical capital and R&D for labor,

        The final row in Table 11 illustrates the returns to scale.            Each

industry does not significantly       depart from constant returns to scale, but

there is some evidence of slightly decreasing returns to scale in the food

industry.


8.   Costs of Adjustment and Rates of Return

        The model that has been estimated for the different        industries    is

dynamic because of the presence of internal adjustment costs.              This implies

that, for the quasi-fixed       factors at each time period,     there is a wedge

between the rental price and the marginal value for each type of capital.

This wedge is represented       by the marginal     costs of adjustment.    Hence     the

importance    of adjustment costs can be understood by comparing the marginal

costs of adjustment to the rental price.          This ratio may be thought of as a

"coefficient    of variability."     If the ratio     is zero then the input    is per-

fectly variable,    because marginal adjustment costs are zero, and the rental

price equals the marginal value.        Moreover,    the higher the ratio the lower

the degree of variability.

        For physical capital we compute,

and for R&D capital      the ratio is



    (16)   °dd [w(t) 4Kr(t)/Y(t)       Pr(t)     (r(t) +


The results are presented 4n Taole 12.               The first point to notice is that

there is no consistent pattern across industries;               for two (SIC 20 and 33)

pnysical capital      is relatively less variable than R&D, while the converse

is true for the other two industries,               Second,   for foods, which exhibits

the lowest input intensities of output, and for chemicals, which exhibits

the highest    (see Table   1)   we find the smallest difference (in absolute

value) between the ratios; .044 for SIC 20 and .058 for SIC 28.                 Moreover,

the physical and R&D capital      ratios for chemicals are more than double that

for foods, a'though the physical capital              ratio is higher for the latter,

and lower for the former,

     The third conclusion is that there is a great deal of variation across

industries for each set of ratios.             For both physical and knowledge capital

the relative difference between the largest and smallest magnitude repre-

sents more     200,    In addition,    the industry with the most variability for

physical capital      (nonelectrical    machinery)       illustrates   that almost   50   of

its rental rate for knowledge capital consists of marginal                adjustment

costs,

     There are no equivalent numbers to compare for R&D, but with respect

to physical capital Pindyck and Rotemberg              [1982(b))   found for U.S. manufac-

turing, that equipment had a ratio of .23 and structures .34.                 These magni—
                                          —
                                               23 —




tudes seem   to be in line with our findings for physical capital, across the

four different       industries.

     The importance of marginal adjustment costs can shed some light on the

nature of the rate of return to R&D (and to physical capital).                  There has

been a great deal of interest in the result that the derived marginal

value of R&D (for example, as measured by the marginal product) has been

substantially above the interest rate in the economy.               No explanation has

been provided for this conclusion,        only that it seems to be an empricai

result found by different researchers.

     Let us step back for a moment to interpret              the relationship between

the marginal value and the interest rate.              Consider the long run situation,

when all variables do not change.         In this case equations       (8.1) and (8.2)

become



    (17)   r =   —           +   a   +   ayi   y +    apr      —
                                                                      i,j=p,r



Equation   (17) states that the firm equates the interest rate (i.e. the

opportunity cost of funds) to the marginal rate of return on each quasi—

fixed factor.     The latter consists of the per dollar decline            in   variable
(i.e. labor) costs attributable to the specific type of capital net of

depreciation.     We can call the right side of equation (17) the net marginal

value of either physical or knowledge           capital.

     The opportunity cost of funds is equated to the marginal rate of

return on physical and R&D capital,            However,     in the short run the marginal
                                         -   24 —




rate   of return consists of the net marginal value minus the marginal           costs

of adjustment.     The net marginal    value of capital must be sufficiently

greater    than the opportunity cost of funds to cover the marginal       adjustment

costs.     Therefore,   aithougri the firm equates the marginal    rate of return on

each type of capital to the opportunity cost of funds, in each time period,

the composition of the marginal       rate of return differs between the long and

short-run.

       The implication is that it is meaningful to investigate the rela-

tionship between the net marginal value and the interest rate.           As long as

marginal   adjustment costs are positive, the net marginal value must be

greater than the long run opportunity cost of Funds.         Thus the explanation,

for the differences between the interest rate,        the net marginal value of

R&D, and physical capital,      is that there are marginal costs of adjustment

for each type of capital, and these costs are not equal.

       We compute the net marginal value for R&D and physical capital, for

each of our four industries.       The results are presented in the first two

rows of Table 13.       We see that the net marginal value for physical capital

is less than the magnitude For R&D      n each industry.     The highest value for

both physical and knowledge capital is found in the chemical          industry   (see

Griliches [1980] for a similar result).         The difference between the net

marginal   values in the food and primary metal industries        is not very large.

The net marginal value for physical capital is 86% of that for R&D in

foods, and 91% in primary metals.       The differences are more significant       in

the other two industries; with 67% in cheincials and only 30% in nonelectri—
                                        —   25 —




cal   machinery.   These results are consistent with those presented in Table

12.     For example for nonelectrical   machinery,     the proportion of the margi-

nal adjustment     costs out of the rental rate for physical        capital was very

small    in absolute terms and relative to the proportion for R&D,             Thus we

would expect that the net marginal value of physical capital to be substan-

                                           also not very different from the
tially smaller than the value for R&D, and

interest    rate (which is .044 for the period under consideration).             These

conclusions are borne out in Table      13.


        In the long run (when marginal adjustment costs are zero) the net

                                               is the marginal     rate of return, and
marginal value for each type of capital

equal    to the interest rate.   Hence, by subtracting the interest rate from

the net marginal value we can determine       the marginal      cost of adjustment.

These figures are given by the last two rows in Table 13.

        We see that the marginal costs of adjustment         are consistently larger


for R&D than for physical capital       for each industry.       The largest costs are

found in the chemical     industry,   and the greatest difference between the

costs for physical and knowledge capital        is   in   the nonelectrical    machinery

products industry.

        From Table 13 it can be observed that there are substantial             differen-


ces between the short and long-run net marginal value of R&D.                 Taking the

interest rate to be the long—run net marginal value for both types of capi-

tal, for chemicals     the long—run net marginal value is about         22     of the

value in the short run (i.e. .044/.198), for nonelectrical            machinery 27,

for primary metals     44   and for foods   47.      The situation is somewhat dif-
                                         -   26 -




ferent    for physical capital.    As a percentage of the long-run net marginal

value, the long-run value for chemicals         is   33,     for primary metals   48,   for

foods    55   and for nonelectrical   machinery     989.     We see that the ranking has

changed, and the percentages have increased slightly for physical capital.

However,      in the case of machinery products,      there is virtually no dif-

ference between the short and long-run net marginal                value of physical capi-

tal.     Consequently,   our findings illustrate that the net marginal value,

for both types of capital       in the short   run and for each industry, exceeds

the interest rate, while the value for R&D is greater than the value for

physical capital.


9.     Conclusion

        In this paper we have examined the price and output effects on factor

demands,    and the role of adjustment costs in a dynamic cost minimizing

model relating to labor, R&D, and physical           capital requirements.       With

respect to factor substitjti3n possibilities,              we found a consistent pattern

emerging for the different ndustries.           R&D capital is quite responsive to

the different factor price changes, and generally R&D and physical capital

are complements,     while the quasi-fixed factors are substitutes for labor.

        Output growth exerts a significant impact           or.   factor requirements

across the various industries.        Indeed in absolute value terms output

elasticities exceed factor price elasticities.               We also found that in the

short run, when the capital inputs are fixed, overshooting occurs in the

demand for labor.        However, because the quasi—fixed factors are substitutes

for labor, as they adjust the overshooting dissipates.
                                           -    27 —




        Finally   we have detailed the importance of adjustment costs.               In fact,

we found for R&D that marginal adjustment costs represent anywhere from                      22
-   65 of   the rental rate, while for physical capital          the range is    2O to
6O.      These adjustment costs enable us to explain the large differences

between the marginal       value of R&D and physical capital,          and between    tIne


marginal    values and the interest rate.

        Important    avenues for future research remain open.          Two crucial ones

relate to the problems of financing and spiiiovers.              First, in this paper,

we have assumed that all the benefits from R&D can be fully appropriated.

We know, of course, in general this is not true, and that the accumulation

of knowledge is affected by the R&D (both present and past) decisions of

other firms.        By admitting   less than full appropriation, we could develop

a model that would permit the estimation of spillover effects.                 In addi-

tion,    it would then be possible to see how the private rate of return on

R&D differs from both the industry—specific             rate of return (when firms are

pooled),    and the economy-wide rate of return (when industries are pooled).

        Conventional    wisdom holds that R&D investment is generally financed

out of internal funds to a greater degree than physical                investment.     In

order to investigate       and test this view it       would be of   interest to develop

and estimate a model       integrating   the decisions on real capital        accumula-

tion and financial       capital   structure.    A by—product of this analysis would

be the testing of whether financial costs or adjustment costs exert the

greater influence on R&D and physical capital             investment   decisions.

     K(t)     =   Kr(t)   =   0,   which is easily seen to be the case in equation

     (7).   Ne     have also imposed the usual assumption that the adjustment

     costs of the two quasi-fixed factors (in this case P&E and R&D) are

     independent.      See Morrison and Berndt [1981] and Pindyck and Rotemberg

     [1982(b)].

     through measurement and optimization errors.

     confidence is 1.645.

4.   The second order conditions were initially imposed by the procedure

     described in Lau (1974].            With these estimates as initial conditions,

     we re-estimated the models without the imposition of the second order

     conditions.     The convergence criteria we used was .001.             In all cases

     convergence was achieved.

6.   The focus on two quasi-Fixed Factors and the decomposition of labor or

     physical capital seems appropriate     in our context, since we have two

     quasi-fixed factors with R&D essentially being an aggregate of a par-

     ticular class of labor and physical capital.

7.   Comparison   of cross price elasticities    s    even more difficult, given

     the diversity of the factors involved in the different models.

8.   Pindyck and Rotemberg   [1982(a)] calculate      intermediate run elasticities

     when labor adjusts but physical capital does not.         In the present paper

     we calculate these elasticities under the assumption that first R&D

     adjusts but P&E does not, and then for the converse case.

9.   A property of constant returns to scale is that the long-run output

     elasticity of each factor demand     is unity.     Clearly from Table 10 these

     elasticities are close to one.
