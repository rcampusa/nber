                                         ABSTRACT

Substance use disorders (SUDs) are a major social concern in the United States and other
developed countries. There is an extensive economic literature estimating the social costs
associated with SUDs in terms of healthcare, labor market outcomes, crime, traffic accidents, and
so forth. However, beyond anecdotal claims that SUD treatment centers (SUDTCs), settings in
which patients receive care for their SUDs, have a negative effect on property values, there is
scant empirical work on this question. In this paper, we investigate the effect of SUDTCs on
residential property values using data from Seattle, Washington, and SUDTC location, entry, and
exit information. To mitigate bias from the potential endogeneity of SUDTC location choices, we
apply a spatial differences-in-differences (SDD) model, which uses property and SUDTC
location to construct treatment and comparison groups. Our findings suggest that SUDTCs
endogenously locate in lower value areas, and naïve models imply that the entry of an SUDTC
leads to a 3.4% to 4.6% reduction in property values. When an SDD model is applied, we find no
evidence that SUDTCs affect property values. Overall, our findings suggest anecdotal claims that
SUDTCs reduce property values are potentially overstated.

1. Introduction

         Substance use disorders (SUDs) are chronic health conditions that impose substantial

costs, both costs fully internalized by the affected individual and costs externalized to society.

For the affected individual, SUDs hinder overall health, employment, financial stability, and

relationships, and can lead to incarceration and other legal consequences, and for some, death.

In terms of negative externalities, SUDs are incredibly costly to society in terms of direct

addiction treatment costs which have historically been financed by public payers within the U.S.,

increased costs of general healthcare, increased reliance on social services, traffic accidents, and

crime and violence (Carpenter 2005; Balsa et al. 2009; French, Fang, and Balsa 2011; Jayakody,

Danziger, and Pollack 2000; Anderson, Hansen, and Rees 2013; Markowitz and Grossman 2000;

Popovici, Maclean, and French 2017; Terza 2002).

         Overall, the annual costs of SUDs to the U.S. are estimated to be very high: $544B

(Caulkins, Kasunic, and Lee 2014). 1 For comparison, government estimates suggest that heart

disease and stroke, which are leading causes of mortality and morbidity, are associated with

$359B each year in terms of healthcare costs and lost productivity in the U.S. (Department of

Health and Human Services 2018). 2 Given these high costs, both private and public agents

allocate substantial financial resources to curtail SUDs. For instance, the U.S. spends

approximately $28B annually on direct SUD treatment, with 71% of this treatment financed by

public payers (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2014). 3 While

treatment programs are obviously heterogeneous, there is compelling evidence that numerous

treatment modalities are clinically effective and cost-effective in reducing SUDs and associated

social costs (Collins et al. 2010; Doran 2008; French and Drummond 2005; Holder 1998;

McCollister and French 2003; Murphy and Polsky 2016). Moreover, receiving SUD treatment is

not uncommon. For instance, in 2016, 3.8M Americans 12 years and older received SUD

treatment (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017).

        SUD treatment is generally regarded as valuable to society. However, situating an

SUDTC, a setting in which many patients receive care for their SUDs, is often an unpopular and

contentious decision. In particular, there is a ‘not in my back yard’ (NIMBY) sentiment, where

local residents boycott SUDTC openings as they are concerned that the introduction of an

SUDTC may increase noise, traffic, crime, nuisance behavior, and generally unpleasant activities

in the neighborhood (Keiger 2016). 4 These perceived negative attributes of SUDTCs could

plausibly translate into reductions in residential property values. As residential properties reflect

the most substantial investment that most Americans undertake in their lives (Kraft and Munk

2011), this potential external cost of SUDTCs may result in a considerable reduction in wealth

for many individuals and families. In 2016, there were 18,087 licensed SUDTCs in the U.S.

(Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2017). Thus, if NIMBY concerns

are valid, then many individuals and families are exposed to centers that may substantially

reduce the worth of their most valuable investment.

        While there is a large literature evaluating the extent to which a wide range of both

amenities and dis-amenities affect residential property values (Chay and Greenstone 2005;

Gawande and Jenkins-Smith 2001; Gibbons 2004; Muehlenbachs, Spiller, and Timmins 2015;

  For instance, recent articles by media outlets in both Massachusetts and New York document the negative
sentiment towards SUDTC openings by local residents. We refer an interested reader to the following websites:

Pope and Pope 2012; Thaler 1978; Li et al. 2015; Davidoff and Leigh 2008), there is surprisingly

little empirical work investigating the effect of SUDTCs. To the best of our knowledge, only

one study explores this question. In a real estate study, La Roche, Waller, and Wentland (2014)

apply three-stage-least squares to property sales data from Central Virginia over the period 2001

to 2011 to test for SUDTC effects. The authors document that SUDTCs are associated with an

8% reduction in residential property values. The results of La Roche, Waller, and Wentland

(2014) suggest a substantial negative effect of SUDTCs on property values and provide prime

facie support for NIMBY concerns. However, given the identification strategy employed by La

Roche, Waller, and Wentland (2014), how best to interpret these findings is unclear. In

particular, the three stage least squares approach used by LaRoche and colleagues is identified

off non-linearities in the model. Such identification departs from approaches based on quasi-

experimental variation that are used in many recent empirical economic studies studying factors

that influence property values (outlined in Section 2.1).

       Moreover, the net effect of SUDTCs on property value is ex ante ambiguous. In addition

to the potentially negative aspects of SUDTCs articulated in NIMBY concerns, there are factors

associated with SUDTCs that may in fact increase property values. First, if SUDTCs offer

effective treatment to neighborhood residents, these facilities can reduce SUD prevalence and

associated harms. Swensen (2015) shows that SUDTC entry reduces the level of SUDs, proxied

by overdose deaths, within the local area. In terms of reducing costs associated with SUDs,

recent economic work by Bondurant, Lindo, and Swensen (2018), and Wen, Hockenberry, and

Cummings (2017) shows that SUDTCs reduce crime within the local area. Clinical evidence

provides further support for the inverse treatment-crime relationship (Doran 2008; Ettner et al.

2006; McCollister et al. 2003; Rajkumar and French 1997; Westerberg et al. 2016).




                                                 5
Furthermore, Freeborn Fand McManus (2010) document that additional SUDTCs in a county

decrease alcohol-related fatal traffic fatalities in that locality. A second pathway through which

SUDTCs could raise property values is increased employment opportunities (e.g., hiring SUDTC

employees) and economic activity (e.g., demand for SUDTC-related goods and services) within

a local area. For instance, in 2016, the average SUDTC employed 22 workers and the economic

opportunities for local residents are often touted when a center opens. 5

        Finally, an empirical reason for an observed association between SUDTC entry and

property values is the potential endogeneity of SUDTC location choices. If SUDTCs

strategically locate in areas with lower (or higher) property values, such sorting could lead to

biased estimates of property value effects. This final pathway suggests that any observed

correlation between SUDTC entry and property values could be spurious and not causal.

        To empirically address endogenous location choices in estimation of amenities and dis-

amenities, several recent studies apply a spatial differences-in-differences (SDD) estimator

(Congdon-Hohman 2013; Dealy, Horn, and Berrens 2017; Linden and Rockoff 2008). The SDD

model is comparable in many ways to canonical differences-in-differences (DD) methods, which

estimate average changes in outcomes in treatment and comparison groups, pre- and post-

treatment (Angrist and Pischke 2008). In the SDD model, spatial location information (as

opposed to legislatively defined geographic areas or groups defined by their demographics, e.g.,

age and/or gender) is used to construct the treatment and comparison groups in close proximity

to the (dis)amenity. No study has applied an SDD to estimate the effects of SUDTCs.

       In this paper, we follow the recent hedonic pricing model literature and estimate the

effect of SUDTCs on residential property values using an SDD model. We use granular

residential property value and administrative SUDTC data from Seattle, Washington.

Specifically, we link property values data over the period 2003 to 2016 with geocoded

government administrative data on the exact locations of all licensed SUDTCs in Seattle.

       Several findings emerge from our analysis. First, we document that SUDTCs

endogenously locate in lower property values areas, which implies that estimates generated in

models which do not address such sorting are vulnerable to bias. Second, naïve (non-SDD)

models that do not account for endogenous location choices produce estimates that imply a

modest, but statistically significant, negative effect of SUDTC entry on property values of 3.4%

to 4.6%. Third, when an SDD estimator is used, we find no statistically significant evidence that

SUDTC entrance into a local area leads to changes property values. Indeed, in our preferred

specifications we can rule out all but modest decreases in property values. Our findings are

stable across numerous robustness checks, including alternative distance band specifications and

time dynamics. Our findings suggest that anecdotal NIMBY concerns regarding the stigma

associated with being located in close proximity to an SUDTC, and related reductions in

residential property values, may not be fully warranted.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides background on the related residential

property value literature, SUDs, and SUDTCs. Our conceptual framework and empirical model

are presented in Section 3. Data are reported in Section 4. Section 5 presents our main results

and robustness checking. Section 6 concludes.

2. Background

2.1 Background on amenities and dis-amenities, stigma, and residential property values




                                                7
       There is a large and historic hedonic pricing model literature evaluating the effect of

various amenities and dis-amenities on residential property values. Comprehensively reviewing

this vast literature is beyond the scope of this study. Instead, we attempt to briefly summarize

studies most relevant for our research question.

       In terms of amenities, access to high quality schools (Davidoff and Leigh 2008),

‘walkability’ (Rauterkus and Miller 2011), diversity (Koster and Rouwendal 2012), and

proximity to parks and green spaces (Anderson and West 2006; Voicu and Been 2008) increase

residential property values. On the other hand, dis-amenities such as airport noise (Espey and

Lopez 2000; Pope 2008), forest infestations (Price, McCollum, and Berrens 2010), nuclear waste

sites (Gawande and Jenkins-Smith 2001; McCluskey and Rausser 2003a), rail stations (Bowes

and Ihlanfeldt 2001), and wildfires (Kalhor et al. 2018) reduce residential property values.

       Similarly, undesirable and socially repugnant behaviors by neighborhood residents,

which can be viewed as dis-amenities, within the local area have been linked with lower

residential property values. In particular, several studies show that increased crime reduces

property values (Gibbons 2004; Thaler 1978; Pope and Pope 2012). For instance, Pope and Pope

(2012) find a substantial increase in residential property values following the large decline in

U.S. crime rates that occurred in the 1990s. Studies also evaluate the effect of convicted sex

offenders migrating into a neighborhood on local residential property values. Federal legislation

passed in 1996, known as ‘Megan’s Law’, requires that all states create a sex offender registry

and make information regarding sex offender residential addresses publicly available.

Evaluating this law, Larsen, Lowrey, and Coleman (2003) find a reduction in value of 17% for

residential properties in close proximity to sex offenders in Montgomery County, Ohio.




                                                   8
       In sum, the hedonic pricing literature documents that many forms of dis-amenities reduce

residential property values. In addition to an initial decline in residential property values, several

studies provide convincing evidence that this reduction in value persists over time. For instance,

several environmental risks leave a permanent, or highly persistent, ‘scar’ on property values

(McCluskey and Rausser 2003b). Put differently, even after the dis-amenity is removed from the

local area, residential property values persistently remain at a lower level. The particular

mechanisms behind a scaring effect are not entirely clear and are likely heterogeneous across dis-

amenities, but this phenomena suggests that affected property owners may persistently own a

less valuable asset. Given the importance of residential properties for overall wealth and

financial well-being, permanent reductions in property values are concerning.

       A key empirical challenge in estimating the effect of any local (dis)amenity on property

values is the potential endogeneity of (dis)amenity location. Put differently, amenities and dis-

amenities, including SUDTCs, are not likely to be randomly assigned across neighborhoods and

instead are plausibly located based on the (presumably) rational decisions of economic agents; in

our context SUDTC owners and operators. Taking such systematic location selection into

account, Linden and Rockoff (2008) reevaluate the effect of sex offenders on property values

using an SDD estimator, which creates treatment and comparison groups based on geographic

distance to the sex offender location. Applying this model to data from Mecklenburg County,

North Carolina, the authors document that, on average sex, offenders locate in lower property

value areas, and failure to account for these endogenous location choices can lead to a substantial

overestimate of the effect of a sex offender on property values. After accounting for the

endongeous location of offenders, Linden and Rockoff find that the arrival of sex offender within




                                                  9
a neighborhood reduces the average residential property values by 4%. This estimate is less than

one quarter of the Larsen et al (2003) non-SDD estimate of a 17% reduction in property values.

       The SDD approach has also recently been used to study the effect of several other dis-

amenities on residential property values. Congdon-Hohman (2013) and Dealy, Horn, and

Berrens (2017) use this technique to study the effect of clandestine methamphetamine

laboratories (‘meth labs’) on property values. The production of meth involves the combination

of explosive and deadly chemicals; this process is harmful to health. Both studies show that

meth labs endogenously locate in lower value areas and a significant decrease in property values

associated with lab discovery. Dealy, Horn, and Berrens (2017) also identify a stigma effect:

property values of residences sourrounding the meth lab remain persistently lower even after the

lab is fully decomtaiminated following a state-mandated environmental clean-up process.

Stigma effects suggest that the dis-amenity permanently, or at least persistently, alters

neighborhood characteristics (real or perceived) in a way that reduces the value of nearby

properties. For instance, clandestine meth labs may result in lingering environmental toxins in

the neighborhood that persistently harm (or are perceived to harm) residents’ health.

       Brooks, Humphreys, and Nowak (2016) study the effect of strip clubs on residential

property values in Seattle, Washington – the same location that we examine – using an SDD

model. The authors find that club openings and closing have no statistically significant effect on

the value of nearby residences. This study is important for our work as it focuses a dis-amenity

that may plausibly impose similar costs and benefits on the neighborhood as an SUDTC.

       Our contribution to this literature is twofold. First, we examine the effects of SUDTCs

on property values using an SDD estimator which will allow us to account for endogenous




                                                 10
location choices and hence recover causal estimates of SUDTC effects on residential property

values. Second, we test for potential stigma effects associated with SUDTCs.

2.2 Background on SUDs and SUDTCs

         In 2016, 20 million U.S. residents 12 years and older, or 7.5% of the population, met

diagnostic criteria for an SUD (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017).

According to the American Psychiatric Association (2013) SUDs ‘occur when the recurrent use

of alcohol and/or drugs causes clinically and functionally significant impairment, such as health

problems, disability, and failure to meet major responsibilities at work, school, or home.’

Afflicted individuals may act out in violent and reckless ways, and turn to illegal activities to

procure funds to purchase substances. Many individuals with an SUD have co-occurring mental

illness (Grant, Stinson, Dawson, Chou, Dufour, et al. 2004; Grant, Stinson, Dawson, Chou,

Ruan, et al. 2004), which plausibly exacerbates substance-related problems.

         In addition to individuals meeting the clinical definition of an SUD, millions of

Americans engage in risky substance misuse such as binge drinking, heavy drinking, and

nonmedical use of prescription drugs, and are thus at risk of developing an SUD. 6 For instance,

in 2016, 24.5% and 6.0% of U.S. residents 12 year and older were classified as binge and heavy

drinkers respectively, while 10.6% of adults used illicit drugs in the past 30 days (Center for

Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017).

         Given the high levels of substance misuse, unintentional fatal alcohol poisonings and

(overall) psychoactive drug overdoses are the leading causes of injury death in the U.S. with over




6
  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), binge drinking is defined as consuming five
(four) or more drinks in one drinking session for men (women) while heaving drinking is defined as drinking two
(one) or more drinks per day for men (women). Non-medical use of prescription medications is defined as the use
of medications without a prescription from a healthcare provider, use of the medication in a manner other than as
directed (e.g., taking a higher dosage than prescribed), and/or use only for the medication’s psychotropic experience.



                                                         11
58,000 deaths in 2016, which exceeds the deaths attributable to suicides, traffic accidents, and

firearm-related accidents (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2018a). Further, the U.S.

is currently experiencing an unprecedented rise in SUD-related mortality, largely due to OUD

overdoses (Rudd et al. 2016). For instance, each day there are 115 OUD-related overdose deaths

and this rate has more than quadrupled since 1999 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

2018b). The rise in OUD and associated harms has prompted the federal government to declare

that the country is experiencing an ‘opioid epidemic’ (Centers for Disease Control and

Prevention 2018b) and allocate billons of dollars in financing to support OUD prevention,

treatment, and harm reduction (114th U.S. Congress 2015).

       Although SUDs are incredibly harmful, numerous treatment modalities have been shown

to be effective in treating these conditions (Collins et al. 2010; Doran 2008; French and

Drummond 2005; Holder 1998; McCollister and French 2003; Murphy and Polsky 2016; Schori

2011). In 2016, 3.8M Americans ages 12 years and older received some form of SUD treatment

(Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017). However, addiction specialists

contend that treatment is substantially underused: only 10% of individuals who meet diagnostic

criteria for an SUD receive treatment in any given year (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics

and Quality 2017). While there are myriad reasons for not seeking treatment, including not

wanting to stop using substances, inability to locate a provider is a commonly stated barrier.

Taking this reason for not receiving treatment at face value, expanding the number of providers

(including the specialized SUDTCs that we examine in our study) could increase treatment

uptake and, in turn, reduce SUD prevalence and associated harms. Further, allowing providers to

locate in areas that are convenient to patients may enhance treatment uptake and outcomes.




                                                12
           SUD treatment often begins with detoxification, a process that many times involves the

use of medications to ease withdrawal symptoms (e.g., tremors, pain, and nausea) and allows the

body to rid itself of substances. After detoxification is complete, there are a wide range of

effective treatment options available to patients. For example, counselling services, outpatient

care, residential treatment, and inpatient hospital care are all widely used, and in many cases,

highly effective treatment modalities. In our analysis we focus on care that is offered in

specialized outpatient and inpatient treatment centers (residential facilities and psychiatric

hospitals). This modality of care represents the majority of care received within the U.S.

Further, specialty care involves patients residing in the center and/or regularly visiting the center

for an extended period of time (e.g., a common treatment duration is 30 days), and SUDTCs are

large in size with approximately 88 patients on any given day receiving treatment. 7 Thus, if

NIMBY concerns exist, we contend that they are most likely to be observed in this the type of

care we consider in this study. We do not consider office-based care or treatment received in

non-psychiatric hospitals. We refer interested readers to an excellent review of treatment

modalities available to patients provided by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (2018).

3. Conceptual framework and empirical approach

3.1 Hedonic pricing model

           Our empirical analysis, outlined below, is grounded in hedonic pricing theory. Within

this framework residential properties are viewed as assets that provide owners with a bundle of

characteristics that, in turn, affects utility. The characteristics that define the residential property

as an asset include structural attributes (e.g., property size and quality; 𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 ) and neighborhood




7
    Authors’ calculation based on the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).



                                                        13
attributes (e.g., schools and parks; 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 ). We augment the standard hedonic pricing framework to

incorporate proximity to an SUDTC (𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 ) as a residential property attribute that affects utility.

            Rational consumers are assumed to choose the residential property that maximizes their

utility function subject to a standard budget constraint. At market equilibrium, residential

property i will sell at price 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 according the following pricing equation:

𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 = 𝑓𝑓(𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 , 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 , 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 )                                                                                   (1)

The effect of each attribute on price is simply the partial derivate of that attribute with respect to

price in Equation (1):                 �𝜕𝜕𝑋𝑋 where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ∈ {𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖 , 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 , 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 }. All else equal, we expect amenities (e.g.,
                                            𝑖𝑖

larger properties and good schools) to increase values and dis-amenities (e.g., poor quality

properties and limited access to parks) to reduce values.

            As noted in Section 1, the relationship between proximity of a residential property i to an

SUDTC (𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 ) has an ambiguous effect the price (𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 ). SUDTCs are associated with numerous

factors in the local area that could have both positive (e.g., reduced SUD prevalence, and

increased employment opportunities and demand for local goods and services) and negative

(e.g., crime, violence, traffic, noise pollution, and nuisance behaviors) effects on property values,

leaving the net effect unclear. While we are not able to separately estimate each of the possible

pathways through which SUDTCs could influence residential property values, our objective is to

provide an estimate of the overall average SUDTC effect, which is a first order question.

3.2 SDD model

            We apply an SDD model to test for the causal effect of SUDTCs on proximal property

values. The treatment and comparison groups are constructed using geographic distance bands,

or ‘rings’, surrounding each SUDTC. Residential properties located within a ring with radius r

around the SUDTC form the treatment group. Residential properties located in a second




                                                               14
concentric ring, with radius k= r+ε with ε>0, form the comparison group. This identification

strategy compares properties adjacent to an SUDTC with a comparison group of properties in

very close proximity to, but just far enough away, so as to be unaffected by the SUDTC.

             Figure 1 displays an example of a location-defined treatment group and comparison

group. In our main specifications, we define the treatment group as those properties within 0.2

miles of a SUDTC as the treatment group and define those properties 0.2 to 0.4 miles from an

SUDTC as the comparison group. Clearly the true geographic definitions of the treatment and

comparison group are a priori unknown, and any selected definition is to some extent arbitrary.

Moreover, it is plausible that the true definition varies across (dis)amenties (e.g., clandestine

methamphetamine labs, parks, schools, and sex offenders) and, indeed, different studies use

different distances (see studies applying an SDD cited in Section 2.1). Thus, in robustness

checks, and following Dealy, Horn, and Berrens (2017), we re-estimate our SDD regressions

using alternate distance-ring specifications. Results (reported later in the manuscript) are highly

robust across these alternative specifications, which supports the hypothesis that our findings are

not driven by selection of a specific treatment and comparison group combination.

             Specifically, we apply the following SDD model:

                                          0.2              0.4                 0.2              0.4          𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
ln�𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽 + �𝜃𝜃1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃2 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � + �𝜃𝜃3 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗, + 𝜃𝜃4 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗, �𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡          + 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡   (2)

In this equation, 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the inflation adjusted sales price, where i indicates an individual

property, j indicates the location of the property (i.e., zip code) and t indicates the time period

(i.e., year) in which the property is sold. We take the logarithm to account for skewness in sales

prices. In terms of explanatory variables, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is vector of property characteristics, 𝑎𝑎𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is a

vector of year-by-area fixed effects, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the error term.




                                                                                   15
       We cluster standard errors at the zip code level. We have 34 zip codes in our sample,

which implies that we may have too few clusters in our data to generate consistent estimates of

our standard errors. However, in robustness checking reported later in the manuscript, we show

that our results are not appreciably different if we instead apply a wild-cluster bootstrap approach

to inference that has been shown to produce consistent standard error estimates when the number

of clusters is small (Cameron and Miller 2015).

       We also estimate a variant of Equation (2) in a ‘limited sales sample’ which includes only

property sales that occur within 0.4 miles of an SUDTC. Thus, sales that occur outside the

treatment and comparison groups are excluded from this analysis sample. In this specification

we include year-by-SUDTC fixed effects, and cluster standard errors at the SUDTC level. We

have 114 clusters in this specification. While the full sample is more common in the extant

hedonic pricing model literature, the limited sales sample is more analogous to the canonical DD

model in which all localities are either in the treatment or comparison group. For these reasons,

we present results based on both samples and specifications. Our results are not appreciably

different across these two specifications, however.
                                              0.2
       The treatment group is indicated by 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , which represents properties within 0.2 miles of

                                                                      0.4
where an SUDTC is located and the comparison group is indicated by 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 , which represents

properties within 0.4 miles of where an SUDTC is located. Due to the overlapping structure of

the distance variables, 𝜃𝜃2 captures preexisting level differences in properties within 0.4 of an

SUDTC compared with properties more than 0.4 miles away from an SUDTC. Analogously, 𝜃𝜃1

will capture preexisting level differences in property values for residences located within 0.2

miles of an SUDTC and properties located within 0.2 to 0.4 miles of an SUDTC. These

variables are akin to the ‘treatment’ indicator in a canonical DD model. The timing of SUDTC




                                                  16
                                           𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
opening is captured by 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡                          , which indicates the time period after the SUDTC enters a local

area and parallels the ‘treatment*post’ interaction in the canonical DD model. The parameter of

interest (𝜃𝜃3 ) estimates the change in property values for properties within 0.2 miles of an

SUDTC relative to properties 0.2 to 0.4 miles and 𝜃𝜃4 will capture any time trends associated with

properties in the general vicinity of where an SUDTC locates.

            As noted in Section 2.1, another important consideration when estimating the effect of

SUDTCs on property values is stigma, or a potential lasting effect of an SUDTC on proximal

residential property values after the SUDTC has exited the local area. To test for stigma effects,

we estimate an augmented version of Equation (2) that incorporates SUDTC exits:

                                          0.2              0.4                 0.2              0.4          𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒             0.2
ln�𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 𝛽𝛽 + �𝜃𝜃1 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃2 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 � + �𝜃𝜃3 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜃𝜃4 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 �𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡          + �𝜃𝜃5 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 +

       0.4        𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
𝜃𝜃6 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 �𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡    + 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡       (3)

                        𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒
In this specification 𝜏𝜏𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡    is an indicator variable for the time period after an SUDTC exits, and

𝜃𝜃5 will capture any rebound effect on property values of the SUDTC exiting. Thus, 𝜃𝜃3 + 𝜃𝜃5 will

represent any lasting stigma effect of an SUDTC on property values. Stigma effects may occur

if, for instance, SUDTCs permanently reduce SUD prevalence within the neighborhood, then this

change could reduce SUD-related behaviors (crime, violence, etc.). On the other hand, if an

SUDTC permanently draws individuals with SUDs and who engage in crime, violence, nuisance

behaviors, and so froth into the neighborhood, then we may observe persistently lower

residential property values. We test for such effects through Equation (3). We investigate joint

significance of these terms with an F-test.

4. Data

4.1 Residential property sales data




                                                                              17
        We use all residential property transactions in Seattle, Washington between January 1st,

2003 and December 31st, 2016 in our analysis. In 2016 Seattle was the 18th largest city in the

U.S., with 704,352 residents, and was the largest city in Washington State. Thus, our effects are

representative of a large, Pacific coast U.S. city. We obtained residential property sales data

from the King County Department of Assessments (Seattle is located in King County). This

agency provides detailed property sales through its online platform. 8 These data include all legal

sales that occurred in the county, and contain the exact location and sales price. In particular, in

Seattle all residential property sales are required to be registered with the Department of

Assessments. We convert all sales prices to 2016 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.

        The King County Department of Assessments data also contain a wide range of property

characteristics including: the number of living units, number of stories, number of bedrooms,

number of bathrooms, total living space, percentage of the property constructed with brick stone,

whether the property had been renovated prior to its sale, and the age of the property. Also, the

data contain square footage information for the basement, garage, porch, and deck. For all

properties, the King County Department of Assessment provides a variable that captures building

quality. This variable ranges from 1 to 20, where higher values indicate greater property quality.

        We exclude some observations from the analysis sample to minimize outliers and remove

other observations unlikely to be actual residential properties. Observations with sale price less

than $50,000 (n=1,157) and above $2 million (n=926) are excluded. Likewise, observations with

no bathrooms (n=1,043), no bedrooms (n=80), and living space less than 100 square feet (n=7),

and observations sold pre-construction (n=4,248) are excluded. After exclusions, the final

analysis dataset contains 131,862 residential property sale transactions.

4.2 SUD treatment centers (SUDTCs)

        We obtain SUDTC information from the Substance Abuse and Mental health Services

Administration’s (SAMHSA) National Directory of Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment

Programs (NDDAATP). 9 This directory includes all licensed specialty SUDTCs that are known

to SAMHSA and complete the National Substance Abuse Treatment Services Survey (N-

SSATS). The N-SSATS is used by SAMHSA to monitor SUD treatment service provision

within the U.S.; we do not use the N-SSATS information directly in our study.

        The NDDAATP is the premier resource available to prospective patients and providers

seeking a center that can provide specialized SUD treatment for themselves, their family

members, or their patients. Given the importance of being listed on this directory for SUDTCs,

response rates for N-SSATS (which forms the survey frame for the NDDAATP) are very high:

91% to 96% over our study period. The NDDAATP directories include the name, exact street

address (which we leverage in our study), offered services, and accepted forms of payments for

all SUDTCs licensed to provide SUD treatment that are known to SAMHSA. In 2016, there

were 18,087 known and licensed specialty SUDTCs in the U.S. (Substance Abuse and Mental

Health Services Administration 2017). Thus, we are able to capture the vast majority of licensed

specialty SUDTCs using these data. Moreover, the NDDAATP is the only dataset that includes

exact location of specialty SUDTCs and is therefore the best available data for our study.

        Specialty SUD treatment is defined by SAMHSA as a hospital, a residential facility, an

outpatient treatment facility, or other facility with a SUD treatment program. For background,

this modality represents 75% of non-self-help SUD treatment and reflects the majority of SUD

treatment expenditures in the U.S. (Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality 2017). 10

        SUDTC opening and closings offer the variation that we use to identify SUDTC effects

in our SDD model. Openings reflect the ‘entrance’ of an SUDTC into the neighborhood while

closings capture SUDTC ‘exit.’ We use the NDDAATP information to construct a year-by-year

panel of all licensed SUDTCs in Seattle. In particular, we link SUDTC entrance and exit

information to residential property sales data using geographic information system (GIS)

coordinates. Because of the annual structure of the NDDAATP directory (i.e., the N-SSATS,

which forms the survey frame, is completed once per year and the NDDAATP is thus updated

annually), SUDTC entry (exits) are coded in the year the SUDTC appeared (no longer appeared)

in the NDDAATP directories. 11 This linking process likely introduces some measurement error

into our analysis dataset. We explore the potential implications of such measurement error in

robustness checking later in the manuscript.

        Residential property sale transactions are matched to SUDTCs both in terms of geodetic

distances and timing of the proximate SUDTCs. Over the study period there are 120 SUDTC

openings and 69 SUDTC closings in Seattle. On average there are 54 operating SUDTCs in

Seattle in a given year. 12 Figure 2 graphically displays all SUDTCs that operated in Seattle over

   In particular, as noted above, SUDTCs listed on NDDAATP must complete the above-noted N-SSATS survey.
The N-SSATS is administered in the last week of March in each year of our study period and captures information
on services offered by each SUDTC, including whether or not the facility is in operation. We use March 31st as the
date on which SUDTCs opened and April 1st as the date on which they closed. Details available on request.
12
   During our study period, there are three non-psychiatric hospitals that provide SUD treatment listed on the
NDDAATP: Swedish Medical Center- Ballard, VA Puget Sound Health Care System, and Seattle Children’s
Hospital. Although these hospitals provide SUD treatment, the primary focus of non-psychiatric hospitals is to
provide general inpatient healthcare services to patients. We expect that non-psychiatric hospitals may affect
residential property values through different mechanisms than outlined in our conceptual framework. We exclude
non-psychiatric hospitals providing SUD treatment services from our analysis. Details available on request.

our study period. While there is some evidence of clustering of SUDTCs in the central portion

of Seattle, SUDTCs appear to operate in a range of different neighborhoods in the city.

           A concern with our analysis is that zoning regulations may limit the locations in which an

SUDTC may operate. As is the case with businesses in general, SUDTCs must locate in

commercial zones. However, as discussed by La Roche, Waller, and Wentland (2014), there are

numerous Federal regulations that prohibit many forms of discrimination in center location (e.g.,

the Fair Housing Act, Rehabilitation Act, Americans with Disabilities Act). In addition, we have

communicated with administrators at the Washington State Substance Abuse Agency regarding

zoning regulations related to SUDTC location. Our conversations with administrators at this

agency suggest that there are no such regulations that will limit SUDTC location choices.

Overall, our review of the available evidences suggests that SUDTCs face no additional (legal)

restrictions on location than other businesses.

5. Results

5.1 Summary statistics

           Table 1 presents the summary statistics of characteristics for all properties within 0.2

miles of where an SUDTC has located, and properties within 0.2 and 0.4 miles of where an

SUDTC locates. Between 2003 and 2016, there was a total of 131,862 residential property sales,

8,982 of which were within 0.2 miles of an SUDTC and 22,671 that were within 0.2 and 0.4

miles. Median sale prices in Seattle are relatively high ($554K in January of 2016) in

comparison to the U.S. median cities ($182k in January of 2016). 13 However, Seattle residential

property values are comparable to other large U.S. cities such as New York City ($567K), Los

Angeles ($559K), and San Diego ($529K); values reflect median prices in January 2016.



13
     Median home prices are obtained from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ (accessed December 20, 2018).



                                                        21
           In our sample, the average sale prices for the treatment group ($471k in 2016 dollars) is

approximately 3.4% lower than the full sample. Properties within 0.2 miles of an SUDTC and

properties within 0.2 and 0.4 miles of an SUDTC are not identical, in terms of sales price or

housing characteristics, but are more similar compared to the full sample. Importantly, we

control for all characteristics listed in table 1 in our regressions.

5.2 Graphical evidence

           Figure 3 presents a graph of the logarithm of daily sales prices using optimal

Epanechnikov kernel smoothing for two-year periods before and after SUDTC entry, 14 for both

properties within 0.2 miles of an SUDTC, and between 0.2 and 0.4 miles of an SUDTC. A

necessary assumption for the SDD model to recover causal estimates is that the treatment and the

comparison groups would have trended similarly in terms of outcomes (residential property sales

prices in our context) had the treatment group not been treated (the entrance of an SUDTC in our

study); i.e., ‘parallel trends.’ In figure 3, prior to SUDTC entry, we observe that the treatment

and comparison groups exhibit generally similar trends, this pattern provides suggestive evidence

that the data can satisfy the parallel trends assumption. We return to parallel trends more

formally through estimation of an event-study model later in the manuscript. Examination of the

trends post-SUDTC entry reveals no evidence of substantial differences between the two groups,

which foreshadows our null findings for SUDTC effects on residential property values.

5.3 Non-SDD regression results

           Table 2 presents the results for a naïve empirical model that does not account for

endogenous SUDTC location choices. Column 1 presents selected parameter estimates from a

model estimated with housing characteristics and year fixed effects, column 2 presents selected



14
     In particular, we use local polynomial smoothing with a bandwidth of 35 days. Details available on request.

parameter estimates for a model estimated with housing characteristics and year-zip code fixed

effects, and column 3 additionally clusters standard errors at the zip code level. In all models

coefficient estimates are negative and significant, suggesting that SUDTCs are associated lower

residential property values. Coefficient estimates from table 2 imply that the entrance of an

SUDTC in a neighborhood is associated with a 3.4% to 4.6% reduction in property values. 15

5.4 SDD regression results

           Table 3 presents testing for endogenous location choices by SUDTCs and the main

regression results from our preferred SDD model. First, column 1 presents results from a test for

endogenous location choice by SUDTC. In this test observations are dropped if the sale occurred

within 0.4 miles of an SUDTC after the SUDTC becomes active (i.e., the only remaining

SUDTC observations are before the SUDTC enters). This model allows us to test whether

SUDTCs endogenously locate in areas with lower residential property values. Columns 2 and 3

present SDD models estimated using the full sample. Columns 4 and 5 present SDD estimates

generated in the limited sales sample, where all observations are dropped that are outside of a 0.4

miles radius of an SUDTC. Columns 2 and 4 present results without the exit parameters,

corresponding to Equation (2), and columns 3 and 5 present the results with the exit parameters

included, corresponding to Equation (3). A full set of control variable coefficient estimates for

the full sample model, including exit parameters, is reported in appendix table 1.

           There are two main findings in table 3. First, in column 1 the D0.4 parameter estimate is

negative and statistically significant, documenting that on average SUDTCs endogenously locate

in areas with lower residential property values. In particular, SUDTCs locate in areas with 2.2%

lower property values. Second, once this endogeneity in location choice is accounted for through



                                                                                                   �
15
     Semi-log point estimates are converted to percent changes using the following formula: (𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒 𝛽𝛽 − 1) × 100%.



                                                            23
the use of the SDD model, we find no statistically significant evidence that SUDTC entries and

exits affect residential property values. In both the full and limited sales sample models the

parameter estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero and very small in magnitude.

Similarly, exit parameter estimates are statistically indistinguishable from zero and small.

Finally, joint F-tests for the joint significance of the entry and exit parameter estimates (which

capture stigma effects) are not statistically different from zero.

         Our standard errors are sufficiently small that we can rule out all but relatively modest

decreases in residential property values following SUDTC entry. For instance, in the basic SDD

model in the full sample model reported in column 2, we can rule out decreases in residential

property values greater than 3.2% with 95% confidence. Similarly, in the basic SDD model in

the limited sales sample, reported in column 4, we can rule out decreases in residential property

values greater than 2.2% at this level of confidence. Results based on Equation (3), which

incorporates SUDTC entrances and exits, provide similar results: 3.8% and 2.7% respectively. 16

Using these estimates, we can generate 95% confidence intervals for the maximum dollar value

reduction in residential property values. Over our study period, the average property value in our

treatment group is $471K (see table 1). Thus, using a 3.8% decline, we can rule out any more

than a $18K in lost residential property values associated with SUDTC entry. Finally, we are

able to rule out all but modest increases in values following SUDTC exit as well.

5.5 Robustness checks

         We conducted a number of robustness checks to assess the stability of our findings.

Overall, our results are highly stable across these additional analyses. First, as noted above, to

mitigate bias from endogenous location choices of SUDTCs, we construct treatment and


16
 This specification is more data hungry than Equation (2) and thus our standard errors necessarily increase in size,
which implies that larger values are included in our 95% confidence intervals.



                                                         24
comparison groups using geographic proximity to SUDTCs. To this end, in our main analysis,

SUDTC distance bands for the treatment and comparison groups are defined as within 0.2 miles

and within 0.2 to 0.4 miles of an SUDTC. We re-estimate Equation (2) in which we both expand

and contract the distance based used to form the treatment and comparison groups. Results are

presented for regressions using 0.1/0.3 miles, 0.1/0.4 miles, 0.1/0.5 miles, 0.2/0.4 miles (our

baseline specification), 0.2/0.5 miles, 0.2/0.6 miles, 0.3/0.5 miles, and 0.3/0.6 miles distance

band specifications. Table 4a presents results for the full sample and table 4b presents results for

the limited sales sample. Treatment-entry and treatment-exit parameter estimates are statistically

indistinguishable from zero in all specifications. Joint F-tests assessing stigma effects are also

statistically indistinguishable from zero in every specification.

       Second, we investigate time dynamics in the effects of SUDTC entry/exit on residential

property values. As outlined by Wolfers (2006), in a study testing the effects of state unilateral

divorce laws, it is plausible that the effect of an SUDTC entry/exit may change over time. Put

differently, our primary specification, Equation (3), forces an abrupt change in property values at

SUDTC entrance/exit than remains constant thereafter. This pattern may depart from real world

SUDTC effects if the social disruption (e.g., crime, noise, traffic) or benefits (e.g., reduced SUD

prevalence, increased economic activity) vary over time. To evaluate potential dynamics in the

effect of SUDTCs on residential property values, we estimate an event-study model in the spirit

of Autor (2003). In particular, we decompose the SUDTC entrance variable into one-year

windows both before and after SUDTC entry. The omitted category is one year prior to SUDTC

entrance. We impose endpoint restrictions: we assume that effects are not observable more than

four years before or after SUDTC entrance (Kline 2012; McCrary 2007). We code all areas in

which an SUDTC does not enter as zero for all lead and lag indicators (Lovenheim 2009). In




                                                 25
addition to allowing for dynamic effects in the post-period, the event-study allows us to test a

conditional version of the parallel trends tests by examining coefficient estimates on the lead

variables. If lead variable coefficient estimates are small in magnitude and imprecise, that

pattern of results supports the hypothesis that our data satisfies a conditional version of the

parallel trends assumption.

         We report event-study results for the full sample and the limited sales sample. As can be

observed in figure 4, all event-study point estimates are small and statistically indistinguishable

from zero, and no pre- or post-trends are evident. Overall, the event-study analysis suggests: (i)

our data satisfy the parallel trends assumption and (ii) there are no dynamic SUDTC effects.

         Third, recall that a limitation of the SUDTC data provided by the NDDAATP directory is

that the data are only updated yearly (see Section 4.2). Thus, SUDTC entry and exits are only

observed on an annual basis, and we will miss some entries/exits in the one-year period between

surveys. This data feature may lead to some measurement error in our data; the bias from such

error is difficult to sign (Bound, Brown, and Mathiowetz 2001). 17 To explore the empirical

importance of this data limitation, we estimate ancillary models in which we exclude

observations in the between-directory period where entry and exits could be mis-classified.

Results generated in this ancillary analysis are presented in in appendix table 2. The results are

not appreciably different from our core specification (table 3).

         Fourth, we implement several robustness checks regarding SUDTC heterogeneity, and

both fixed-effect and clustering specifications. Specifically, we (i) estimate the effect of multiple

SUDTCs within a locality to assess whether there is a dose-response effect of SUDTC entrance;


17
  We attempted to locate exact opening and closing dates through SAMHSA (the agency that manages the
NDDAATP) and the Washington State Substance Abuse Agency (the agency tasked with overseeing licensed
SUDTCs in Seattle and that provides data to SAMHSA for management of NDDAATP). Collecting exact SUDTC
opening and closing dates is not feasible based on our investigations into this issue. Details available on request.

(ii) estimate the effect of SUDTCs that provide methadone treatment; 18 (iii) estimate models

using quarter-by-year fixed effects to better capture seasonality in housing sales prices (U.S.

Census Bureau 2018); (iv) estimate limited sales sample models with standard errors clustered at

the zip code level; and (v) estimate full-sample models using a wild cluster bootstrap approach to

estimate standard errors (Cameron & Miller, 2015). 19 Results generated in these alternate

specifications are presented in appendix tables 3 to 6. Findings are comparable to our main

results (table 3). Finally, we exclude all residential property value variables and re-estimate

Equations (2) and (3). We exclude the property-level controls as some of these could plausibly

be influenced by SUDTC entrances/exists if – for instance – these entrances/exits alter the

composition of residential properties listed for sale, thus leading to over-controlling bias in our

estimates (Angrist and Pischke 2008). Results, reported in appendix table 7, are not appreciably

different from our adjusted models (table 3).

6. Discussion

         SUDs are prevalent and harmful health conditions within the U.S. and other developed

countries. Treatment can effectively allow afflicted individuals to obtain abstinence, which

additionally can reduce the associated negative societal costs of SUDs. However, SUDTCs

require a physical space to occupy. There are anecdotal NIMBY concerns that these centers

increase crime, littering, noise, and nuisance behaviors, which stigmatizes these centers and

potentially reduces property values for residences in close proximity to the SUDTCs. On the




18
   We study centers that offer OUD treatment – specifically centers offering methadone – as the U.S. is in the midst
of an opioid epidemic and how best to address this epidemic is a pressing question facing local, state, and federal
governments. We note that buprenorphine is also indicated to treat OUD. However, this medication is generally
prescribed in general physicians’ outpatient offices and not specialty treatment facilities such as we study here.
19
   In our main specifications we cluster at the SUDTC area and zip code level respectively.



                                                         27
other hand, SUDTCs may increase property values by reducing SUD prevalence and associated

behaviors and increasing employment opportunities within the neighborhood.

           Given the scope of the SUD epidemic currently facing the U.S., the number of treatment

facilities is expanding. For instance in 2003 (the first year of our study) there were 15,124

licensed specialty SUDTC facilities in the U.S. and by 2016 (the last year of our study) this

number had risen to 18,087 (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration 2017,

2004), representing a 20% increase. 20 Thus, understanding the implications of SUDTC locations

on the values of residential properties, which reflect major financial investments for many

Americans, is of growing importance. Further, accurately understanding the effects of SUDTCs

on property values is necessary to assess the overall costs of SUDs to society. While much of

the literature that explores the costs of SUDs has focused on negative externalities such as crime

and/or direct treatment costs, we explore a potential indirect treatment cost: financial spillovers

to individuals who reside near an SUDTC.

           In this study we provide new evidence on the effect of SUDTCs on residential property

values using data from Seattle, Washington from 2003 to 2016, and an SDD estimator that

mitigates bias from endogenous SUDTC location choices. We find that SUDTCs endogenously

locate in areas with somewhat lower property values (2.2%). When we do not account for

endogenous location choice, we find that SUDTCs reduce residential property values by 3.4% to

4.6%. However, after accounting for such location choices through the use of an SDD model,

we find no statistically significant evidence that SUDTC entrance or exit influences residential

property values. Moreover, our point estimates for both entrances and exits are very small in

magnitude. Indeed, in our preferred SDD models we can rule out declines in property values

following SUDTC entrance larger than 2.2% to 3.8% with 95% confidence. Our SDD estimates

are robust to a wide range of specifications and sensitivity checks.

       We note that our findings change when we apply the SDD model to account for

endogenous location selection on the part of SUDTC owners and operators. In particular, we

find no statistically significant evidence that SUDTCs affect property values when we apply the

SDD estimator; coefficient estimates decline in magnitude and become statistically

indistinguishable from zero. This pattern of results suggests that perhaps the perceived negative

effects of SUDTCs on residential property values may be overstated. Previous economic

research estimating dis-amenity effects also documents that failure to account for endogenous

location choices can lead to estimates biased away from zero (Linden and Rockoff 2008). Our

results thus link to a growing literature suggesting that empirical studies account for endogenous

location choices when evaluating the effect of both amenities and dis-amenities on property

values (Congdon-Hohman 2013; Dealy, Horn, and Berrens 2017; Linden and Rockoff 2008).

       Local residents are often concerned that entrance of an SUDTC will impose costs on the

neighborhood and, in turn, reduce residential property values. However, our findings suggest

that the potential benefits of SUDTCs to the community may offset potential costs, leaving

property values unchanged. Notably, SUDTCs reduce the prevalence of SUDs within the local

area (Swensen 2015). Additionally, many studies document reductions in crime associated with

SUDs treatment, and these effects have a considerable economic impact (Cohen and Piquero

2009; Doran 2008; McCollister et al. 2017; McCollister, French, and Fang 2010). In terms of

SUDTCs, Bondurant et al., (2018) and Wen, Hockenberry, and Cummings (2017) show that that

SUDTCs reduce both violent and financially motivated crimes in local areas. The social costs

(e.g., legal system and healthcare costs) of one murder are very high: $11M (McCollister et al.




                                                29
2017). 21 Finally, our study suggests that cost-benefit analyses of social goods (such as SUDTCs

that reduce SUDs for individuals and associated harms to society) should incorporate the

potential financial costs to individuals who reside near the location of the social good.

         Our study has several limitations. First, we consider only SUDTCs licensed to deliver

SUD treatment that are known to SAMHSA and complete the N-SSATS. We suspect that the

number of SUDTCs that we miss is small given the importance of being listed on the

NDDAATP for attracting patients and that SUDTCs are legally required to be licensed prior to

delivering treatment to patients. Second, a critical step in application of the SDD model is

selection of a suitable treatment and comparison group combination. In particular, the

econometrician must locate a comparison group that can be used to estimate counterfactual

trends in residential property values for the treatment group but is untreated by the event. While

our results are robust to several alternative distance band specifications, we acknowledge that the

most appropriate treatment-comparison group combination is unknown. Third, due to data

limitations we are not able to determine the exact date at which SUDTCs enter and exit the

market. However, our findings appear to be robust to several sensitivity analyses related to these

limitations. Finally, we rely on a single city (Seattle). Moreover, Seattle experienced a large

housing boom over our study period, which may alter the effects of dis-amenities. We note that

our results are robust to numerous time and location fixed-effect specifications, which should

account for non-linear changes in residential property values over time. Future studies are

needed in more areas to fully understand the effect of SUDTCs on residential property values.

         In summary, our findings shed new light on an important and relatively unstudied

potential cost associated with SUDs, potential reductions in the value of housing values in close

proximity to SUDTCs. We show that previous empirical evidence and anecdotes likely

overstated the negative effects of SUDTCs on residential property values. While we did not

study this question in our paper, it is possible that stigma against SUDTCs and NIMBY local

efforts may have prevented these centers from optimally locating, which may impede treatment

effectiveness and, in turn, patient outcomes and exacerbate social costs associated with SUDs.
