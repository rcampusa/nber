                        Share Repurchases and Acquisitions:
                      An Analysis of Which Firms Participate




                                     ABSTRACT


     Firms can transmit cash to shareholders either by paying dividends or by

purchasing shares. The share purchases can be either the firm's own securities

or those of another firm. Recent evidence suggests that there has been a

dramatic increase in the use of these nondividend payments to shareholders.

This paper reviews the theories which have been offered regarding the

motivation of nondividend payments. These include taxation advantages,

adjustment towards optimal debt-equity ratios, anti-takeover strategies, free

cash flow (agency) considerations, signalling, and habit formation or learning.

From these theories, we derive and investigate econometrically potential

characteristics which predict participation in the above actions for roughly

2.000 firms in 1976 and 1984. We find the variables suggested by the various

hypotheses collectively have substantial power in predicting participation in

share repurchase and acquisitions. The free cash flow and habit forming

arguments prove most consistent with our findings. Tests for structural change

across time confirm an intercept shift consistent with dramatic increases in

these activities, and fail to reject that the characteristic determinants of

these actions are unchanged.

I.   Introduction

     In a recent paper (Shoven, 1986), it was documented that dividends were

surpassed by nondividend cash payments in the two most recent years for which

data are available, 1984 and 1985. This finding is contrary to the conventional

wisdom of dividends as the primary mechanism of transferring cash between the

firm and its shareholders. It challenges the "trapped-equity" cost of capital

models1 which equate the opportunity cost of retained earnings to the after tax

yield of the alternative considered, namely dividends. If dividends are the

only alternative to retaining earnings, the high taxation of dividends lowers

the shadow cost of retaining earnings, and hence lowers the cost of capital.

On the other hand, if cash can be and is paid out in nondividend form, with

less taxation, the profession needs to alter how it computes the cost of equity

capital.

     In this paper we review the theoretical rationale for nondividend cash

payments. These payments can take the form of either share repurchase programs

or cash mergers. The primary new material of this paper is an econometric

investigation into what types of firms engage in these two types of share

acquisition programs (repurchasing own shares or acquiring the shares of other

firms). We examine whether the probabilities of engaging in mergers and

acquisitions and share repurchases are determined by the same characteristics of

the firm and whether the type of firm involved in these activities has changed

relative to a decade ago, given that they are now so much more prominent.


II. Alternative Hypotheses Regarding Nondividend Cash Distributions

     A large number of hypotheses have been developed regarding the motivations

for a firm making nondividend cash payments. We discuss several in turn.




                                      1
A.   Tax Preference Relative to Dividends

     In the absence of informational asymmetries between stockholders and

management, and in the absence of taxes and transaction costs, dividends and

repurchasing shares in a company are equivalent. After the same amount of cash

disbursement in either form, the total value of the firm will be the same. It

will have the same debt-equity ratio, the same ownership claims, the same real

assets, the same opportunities, and therefore the same value. It is possible

to produce exactly the same consequences by either distributional form. After

share repurchase, each shareholder can sell sufficient shares to match the cash

flow he would have received in the dividend case. After dividend payment, the

dividend proceeds can be used to buy additional shares in the company and

therefore reproduce the percentage interest he would have had if he had

declined to sell in a share repurchase program.

     Taxes cause a major break in this equivalence, to the disadvantage of

dividends and, therefore, to the relative advantage of share repurchase for

taxable households or individuals.2 It is still true that the total equity

value of the firm should be the same after the payment of an equivalent amount

of cash in either dividend or share repurchase form. This equivalence rests on

the idea that the firm has the same assets, capital structure, and future

opportunities in either case, If the cash was paid out as a dividend, then it

is fully taxable. However, if it was paid out as a repurchase, the payment

results in a capital gain to shareholders of the amount of the purchase.3

However, most of this capital gain is accrued and not realized.

     To make the share repurchase strategy absolutely clear, consider the simple

example outlined in Table l. A company is originally financed by the issue of

100 shares at $10 each. The company uses the $1000 proceeds to purchase

productive capital and after a year it has realized a $100 profit. The

     Accrued capital gains will generate a future tax obligation if realized. A

     recent estimate of the effective tax rate on accrued capital gains is

     about five percent.




                                            3
competitive market value of the firm is now $1100 ($11 per share) as the

company now consists of a fully restored $1000 machine and $100 cash.

     Consider two strategies of returning the $100 earnings to the

shareholders. If the money is paid out as a dividend, then the personal tax

bill will be $28, if the marginal tax rate of the equity holders is 28 percent.

The net of tax receipts from the dividend are $72. The value of the company

would return to $1000 or $10 per share after the dividend payment. On the

other hand, if the firm used its $100 to buy 9.09 of its shares at a price of

$11, then the total realized gain by those who sell their shares to the firm is

$9.09, assuming that the sellers are among those who originally financed the

firm at a $10 per share price, and the tax on that $9.09 would be $2.55.

     Note that in this example the company's shares will remain at $11 after

the repurchase and that thus the remaining 90.91 shares each have an accrued

gain of one dollar. These accrued gains will generate some taxes for the

government, although the present value of those tax collections depends on

average holding periods, as well as the use of the escape of capital gains

taxes on assets which pass through estates.

     This example highlights the much lower personal taxes which result from

share repurchases relative to dividends, under the above mentioned taxation

assumptions. Even so, it still may exaggerate what would actually be paid with

share repurchase. In the real world, investors have bought their shares at

different times and at different prices, and those most likely to tender their

shares back to the company will be those with the lowest reservation price on

holding the shares.5 These would include shareholders who have actually

lost money on their investments. This indicates that the government may

actually get no immediate revenue from those who receive the corporate cash.

The example also illustrates that the advantage of share repurchase over




                                      4
dividends exists even when realized capital gains are taxed at the same rate

as dividends (as is the case both in the example and in the new tax law).

     The tax advantage of share repurchase relative to dividends may be a powerful

explanation of why share repurchases have grown. However, as it hinges on the

fact that capital gains are taxed on a realization basis and escape taxation

when passed through estates (rather than depending on characteristics of the

firm), it is not an argument which can be readily addressed with cross-section

econometrics. However, it does suggest that dividend yield on the common stock

and, perhaps, increases in the dividend rate may be predictors of participation

in share repurchase activities. The tax advantage implies that share

repurchase may be a substitute means of transmitting cash to shareholders, and

therefore firms with high dividend yields or which have increased dividends

might be less likely to repurchase shares.


B.   Transition Mechanism for Adjusting Debt-Equity Ratio

     In the absence of transactions costs and taxes at both the personal and

corporate level, and with fully informed investors, shareholders would be

indifferent regarding the price offered in a share repurchase plan. In a

fundamental way they are buying the shares from themselves, so the indifference

comes from their being both the buyer and the seller. However, the existence

of heterogeneity of shareholders creates a potential transfer between those who

sell and those who do not. This effect is diminished if all shareholders have

an equal right to participate, and if shares are purchased on a pro rata basis

in the event the offer is oversubscribed (as is required by SEC rule 13e-4).

     With no taxes, as Modigliani-Miller (1958) demonstrated, the value of the

firm is also invariant to its financial structure. However, in the presence of

both personal and corporate taxes, there appears to be a substantial tax

advantage of debt, in that interest is tax deductible from the corporation




                                      5
income tax, whereas dividends and other equity earnings are not. Miller

(1977) however argues that while the aggregate amount of debt in the economy

is determinant, the capital structure for any individual firm is irrelevant, as

return on debt and equity incorporate taxes (the weak form of the Modigliani-

Miller theorem). This result is empirically supported by Trzcinka (1982). In

contrast, Ross (1985), allowing for uncertainty, shows firms with an interior

optimal debt-equity ratio. The standard model of a firm's optimal debt-equity

ratio involves first order conditions trading off the tax advantages of debt

against the agency costs of debt, as well as its inflexibility in times of

crisis. That is, higher debt ratios increase the likelihood of incurring the

real costs associated with bankruptcy.

     An adequate model of optimal debt-equity ratios would, of necessity, be

very complex and would depend on variables that are unobservable in publicly

available information about the firm, including uncertainty and restrictions on

the creation of state-contingent claims. However, it is possible to predict

some changes in the environment facing the firm that might cause it to want to

adjust its leverage ratio. For instance, a change in the underlying riskiness

of the firm (perhaps due to the maturing of a market or the resolution of some

technological uncertainties) may allow the firm to operate with a higher

leverage ratio and enjoy more of the tax advantages of debt. This change in

risk, or many other factors, may cause higher equity values. When the stock

market valuations increase dramatically (as they certainly have in the past

four years), the leverage ratios of fins are automatically lowered. In many

cases, it will be optimal for the firm to at least partially offset this change

in financial ratios by issuing debt and absorbing equity. When the tax rate

applicable to bonds is decreased, the optimal aggregate debt level increases,

even in a Miller analysis. Both dividends and share repurchases absorb equity.

However, share repurchases may be a better mechanism for the transitional



                                         6
purpose of changing the debt-equity ratio than an increased dividend (suggested

by the work of Feldstein and Green (1983)) because of the penalty that the

market imposes on firms which subsequently cut their dividend.

     Taxes and transaction costs alter investors near neutrality regarding the

price offered in share repurchase programs. Higher prices mean that more of

the cash paid out will be taxed as a realized capital gain and less as a return

of capital. However, this effect is probably outweighed by the leverage

adjustment effect of higher equity prices just mentioned. Therefore, the

underlying theory suggests that higher share prices will encourage share

repurchases rather than discourage them (which is the common wisdom). As well,

there will be an economy wide increase in debt to equity expected given a

decline in taxation levels applicable to bonds.

     One problem with the explanation of share repurchases as a transition

instrument in adjusting debt-equity ratios is that it depends on the difference

between actual leverage and optimal leverage, a variable which can neither be

observed nor predicted. In the empirical analysis to follow, we include the

actual debt-equity ratio as an explanatory variable. The theory does not, how-

ever, predict even the sign of its influence on the share acquisition activities.


C.   Share Repurchases As an Anti-Takeover Strategy

     Another reason that one might expect to observe firms buying back their

own shares in preference to paying dividends is that doing so could be part of

an anti-takeover strategy (Simon (1986)). If a company pays cash out as a

dividend, then the cash is given to all shareholders in proportion to their

share holdings. However, if the cash is used to make a share repurchase tender

offer, only those who tender their shares (or a pro rata proportion of those

tendered) will receive cash from the firm. Due to heterogeneous inframarginal

rents to holding across shareholders, there exists an upward sloping supply



                                      7
curve representing the price at which shareholders are willing to sell. The

cash dividend does not change the distribution of reservation values, while the

share repurchase buys out those with the lowest reservation prices, leaving

behind those who would sell only when offered a premium above the tender offer

price. In addition, the position of the supply curve endogenizes the distribu-

tional choice and its affect on the potential of takeover. If a successful raider

must obtain a given fraction of the outstanding shares, it is shown that under

varied conditions repurchase increases the cost of takeover vis a vis

dividends. This explanation is consistent with the recent spate of repurchases

motivated solely as merger deterence. We therefore would predict an increase

in restructurings, especially repurchase, in response to the threat of takeover.


D.   Free Cash Flow and Share Repurchases

     Jensen (1986) analyzes the principal-agent problem that exists when an

organization generates substantial free cash flow. Managers have the incentive

to increase the resources under their control, and need to be motivated not to

grow beyond wealth maximization. Given this incentive, managers with such

substantial free cash flow may choose repurchase or dividends instead of

investments. This choice allows control over future cash flow which would be

lost if the resources were invested.

     Issuance of debt to buy back stock creates an incentive for managers to

overcome their inefficiencies. The fixed payment pattern of the debt permits

them to commit to transferring resources to their financial claimants. Jensen

focuses on the example of the oil industry in the late 1970s, with simultaneous

free cash flow and necessary industry shrinkage. He documents that such firms

were purchasing other companies, as well as restructuring, consistent with the

agency costs of free cash flow. The theory suggests a positive effect of cash

flow on the probability of repurchase and acquisition.



                                       8
     The free cash flow hypothesis also implies that firms with low levels of

investment, or poor internal investment opportunities, are more likely to

engage in share repurchase. A potentially useful but imperfect measure of

internal investment opportunities is the ratio of price to book value. This

ratio approximates Tobin's "q" ratio, in our attempt to capture the "q° theory

of investment first developed in Tobin (1969).

     An expectation of future cash flow is theorized to be signalled through

cash disbursed to shareholders in a tender offer. Vermaelen (1981) finds the

per share earnings of tendering firms are above pre-announcement time series

model predictions, which he interprets as evidence of the tender offer as an

announcement of favorable earnings prospects. Dann (1981) concludes as well

that the information signalled by repurchase may be improvements in cash flows.

Ofer and Thakor (1986) differentiate the repurchase signal from the signal

implied by dividend payments. This signalling of cash flow hypothesis reconfirms

the free cash flow expectation of repurchase motivated by high cash flow.


E.   Equivalence of Mergers and Acquisitions and Share Repurchase

     In the absence of informational problems, taxes, and transactions costs,

buying the shares in another company is nearly equivalent to buying back your

own. Rather than returning cash to the shareholders, the firm instead buys a

financial investment. If the market value of the acquired asset is equal to

what is paid for it,6 then in the absence of transaction costs the

acquisition is as good as cash to the holders of the stock in the acquiring

firm. If there are transaction costs, they would have to be taken into

account since some investors might now prefer cash, and some investors may want

to rebalance their portfolio after the acquisition.

     While it is certainly true that if we relax the above assumptions, share

repurchases and acquisition may serve different purposes, both convey similar



                                      9
tax advantages relative to dividends in transfering value to shareholders in a

manner which results in capital gains (both realized and accrued) rather than

ordinary income. However, the actions are not similar in that a merger or

acquisition does not absorb equity, while repurchase does not a priori increase

debt. These policies, therefore, are not perfect substitutes in attaining

optimal debt-equity ratios. This implies that previous appreciation in the

firm's stock price may positively predict acquisitions (if the acquisition is

done to increase leverage), and similarly. may encourage share repurchases

(if done to absorb equity).

     The equivalence of the two share acquistion policies requires strong sets

of assumptions. It is an interesting empirical issue, however. We separate

regressions of the phenomena, unwilling to cx ante accept the hypothesis that

the two actions are perfect substitutes. We desire to investigate whether the

hypothesis appears credible.


F.   Quality Management and Clientele Effects

     For many economists, the payment of dividends, appearing to be tax

disadvantaged, remains a puzzle despite the multitude of theories offered to

explain them.7 Share acquisition seems to offer too much tax saving not to be

preferred to dividends. But, the tax argument is only true for some classes of

investors. Nontaxable institutions are indifferent to the taxed-based arguments,

and such institutions are very large market participants. With transaction

costs, it can be argued that such organizations as pension funds and private

university endowments might find dividends the preferred form of return.

     The implications of this argument are the existence of clienteles, to

which firms may specialize. Those firms which pay returns as dividends may be

held disproportionately by tax-exempt organizations, while those who retain

earnings, repurchase shares, or engage in mergers will be predominantly held by




                                    10
taxable owners. While the necessary taxation information is not included in

our data source, we do know a firm's previous participation history. If the

clientele theory is valid, certain firms would be expected to have a propensity

to perform these actions year after year.

      There are other poorly understood aspects of corporate accounting and

financial behavior. One is the choice of inventory accounting techniques,

particularly in times of inflation. Firms can choose between FIFO and LIFO.

With inflation FIFO generally leads to larger reported and taxable profits than

LIFO. FIFO seems to be a non-optimizing choice, as if investors cannot "see

through" the accounts to ascertain real earnings. We can examine whether some

managements are more likely to take advantage of tax saving opportunities, if

they exist, by seeing whether the firms which use the tax efficient LIFO policy

are those who also use nondividend means of transferring value to their

shareholders.


III. Measurement Model and the Specific Hypotheses

      We are interested in modeling the binary choice of whether to do an action

of repurchase or acquisition, to study how various explanatory variables affect

the probability of participation in such action.

      This model is motivated by the definition of an unobserved random

variable, the value of the contemplated action, as a linear function of some

observed characteristics of the firm and an unknown disturbance,


(1)       value (action) — XE + £


such that the firm chooses the action if its value exceeds some critical

constant (which can be zero). This value is not directly observable, however.

Given this limitation, binary probit analyzes the explanatory variables of the

choice between the discreet alternatives of whether or not to do the action,




                                     11
representing the choice with a dummy variable. If the disturbance c is

normally distributed, the probability that the action will be performed is

given by the cumulative normal function of XE, and a maximum likelihood

estimator of the coefficients B is available which yields consistent and

asymptotically normal estimates. (See, for example, Amemiya (1985), Chapter 9.)


Data

       The data were collected from the 1984 Compustat Industrial, Over the Counter

(hereafter OTC), and Industrial Research files. They allowed 2399, 853, and 1289

original observations, respectively. 29 observations were immediately removed,

as they lacked all data and firm identification information.

       While we are interested in predicting participation in share repurchase

activities, we want to exclude those small repurchases motivated by the elimination

of odd lot holders. Therefore, we classify a firm as participating only if they

acquire at least one-half of one percent of their outstanding share equity value.

       Use of a computerized data source increased our sample, but it also limited

our data selection. While we would like to test the hypotheses of tax advantages

of repurchase, the data source lacks information on the distribution of basis

values and the percentage of holders who escape taxation through death. We

thus attempted instead to calculate a marginal tax rate of the firm, although

this proved impossible due to missing data in our source file.

       We have argued various relationships between the leverage ratio and cash

acquisition. We therefore created the variable DBEQXY, the previous year's debt-

equity ratio (of book values).    (Hence, XY — 75 for the 1976 regression, and XY —

83 for the 1984 regressions.) We have created DIVINC, the percentage increase

in dividends, to test the substitutability of dividends and acquisitions.

       While we would like to test whether repurchase is a response to the threat

of takeover, financial statement data does not include whether a threat of




                                       12
takeover, either overt or covert, exists. Therefore, for the large sample we

sacrificed such manually gathered information.

     To represent the free cash flow and signalling of cash flow hypotheses, we

created a cash flow ratio, CASHRAT, which is operating income before depreciation as

scaled by total assets.8 The cash flow hypothesis also implies the relevance of

levels of investment and the potential importance of a measure of internal invest-

ment opportunity. We therefore created INVRAT, a ratio of the increase in

investment to the value of total assets. We created PRICEEK, the ratio of

closing price to book value, as an indicator of internal investment

opportunities.

     If firms are using acquisition and repurchase to achieve an optimal debt-

equity ratio, price appreciation should encourage repurchase. We therefore

create PRICE, an average of the ratios of this year's to previous year's high,

low, and close stock prices.

     Clientele arguments suggest repurchase is done by firms with low dividend

yield. We include the previous year's ratio of dividends to share equity

value, DIVRATXY, to examine this hypothesis. To test the clientele theory, we

are also interested in previous participation history. We therefore include

dummies for previous years participation in repurchase and acquisition,

REPXYO1, ACQXYOI, as a statistic for such habit-formation.9

     The hypothesis that managers smart about taxes should use nondividend

payments is tested by the inclusion of a dummy, IVADUM, whether the firm used

LIFO or not.

     The remaining data sample of 4512 fins were purged of missing

data relevant for respective 1976 or 1984 regressions. This resulted in

corresponding samples of 2366 and 1820 fins. In Appendix One the data

and the resultant samples are analyzed in detail.




                                     13
Hypotheses

     If the hypotheses of the previous sections are correct, we have

expectations about directions and (in)significance of the coefficients.

     The increase in general equity levels due to the stock market growth is

hypothesized to result in finns desiring to increase their relative leverage by

absorbing equity. Such absorption can be accomplished through repurchase. In

addition, the optimal economy-wide level of debt is increased by the decline in

the marginal tax rate applicable to bonds. Acquisition of a firm with higher

leverage can assume increased debt in a controlled way. This may suggest a

negative relationship between the debt-equity ratio and these actions in 1984,

with insignificance in 1976.

     The free cash flow hypothesis implies a positive relationship between the

cash flow ratio and the probability of both repurchase and acquisition. That

repurchase is believed to signal future cash flow may strengthen the implied

relationship in the repurchase probit.

     The free cash flow hypothesis also suggests that these actions are the

result of low levels of investment or poor internal investment opportunities.

This would be consistent with negative effects of the investment ratio and our

q approximation for both regressions.

     If firms use acquisition and repurchase to obtain an optimal debt-equity

ratio, we would expect price appreciation consistent with the action, implying

a positive effect on the probability of the action of price.

     To test clientele and habit formation hypotheses would predict significant

positive coefficients as previous action participation dummies. One indication

of relative substitutability between actions is whether previous repurchase is

correlated with acquisition and vice versa. The clientele effect also predicts

a negative relationship between the dividend ratio and repurchase.




                                        14
      We expect a negative relationship between the percentage dividend change and

both actions if they are substitutes to dividends. We would also expect low divi-

dend yield firms to repurchase as an alternative to dividend payment. We there-

fore expect a negative relationship between the dividend ratio and repurchase.

      Our test for smart tax managers implies a positive relationship between

the use of LIFO and repurchase. Similarly, the tax advantage of acquisitions

relative to dividends would imply a positive relation between LIFO and

acquisitions.

      We are also interested in the "importance" of the explanatory variables,

specifically, in what magnitude they alter the probability of the event (a l

realization). As well, certain relationships across equations are suggested

above. We test between regressions to determine whether a specific action is

stable over time. A finding of functional change across periods would reject

the null hypothesis that the model has no structural change across time.

1975 acquisition and the 1975 repurchase dummies are significant (at the .01

level). The coefficient on our q approximation and the LIFO dummy are

significant and negative (at the .01 level), as is the coefficient on the

investment ratio (at the .10 level).


1984 Probits

     The results of estimating the parameters in the 1984 repurchase model are

reported in Table 4. The cash flow ratio and repurchase dummy are significant

(at the .01 level). Our estimate of q is significant and negative (at the .01

level). Our estimate of previous debt equity ratio and dividend ratios are neg-

ative and significant (at the .05 level). The results of estimating the par-

ameters in the 1984 acquisition model are reported in Table 5. The 1983 acqui-

sition dummy is significant (at the .01 level), as is 1983 repurchase (at

the .025 level) and price (at the .05 level). Our estimate of q is significant and

negative (at the .01 level), as is the 1983 debt-equity ratio (at the .05 level).


Importance of Variables

     We are interested in a notion, beyond significance, of the importance of

variables. Estimations of coefficients are not sufficiently informative as to

the increase in the probability of the event occuring given a unit increase in

the independent variable. Specifically, we look at how the probability of an

action changes given a one standard deviation movement in each independent

variable, to normalize their impact on the change in probability. Table 6 gives

the mean probability derivatives from each probit equation and the corresponding

standard deviation of each explanatory variable. We create a local

approximation of the change in probability of the event given a one standard

deviation change in an explanatory variable. We look specifically at those

variables found significant in the probit analysis.

     We find the dummy predicting habit formation most drastically affects the

probability of all of the outcomes. For instance, in the 1984 repurchase

equation, a one standard deviation move in the dummy variable for 1983

repurchase changes the probability of repurchase by .131. This is an enormous

change, particularly relative to the overall sample mean probability of 1984

repurchase of .2632. The derivative figure indicates that having repurchased

last year (the dummy variable equals unity) versus not having done so changes

the 1984 repurchase probability by .339 holding other factors constant.

     Our estimate of q is also important in all equations. A one standard

deviation increase in the price-to-book ratio in 1984 would have decreased the

probability of a firm participating in repurchase by 6.5 percentage points.

This suggests that firms with low internal investment opportunities seek to

spend their money elsewhere.

     Analysis of the importance of explanatory variables indicates that certain

factors are more important for particular actions or at particular times. The

cash flow and previous dividend ratio variables are important in both

repurchase equations, consistent with the free cash flow hypotheses. The debt

to equity and dividend ratios are also important in both repurchase equations.

Conversely, price appreciation is influential in changing the probability of

acquisitions in both 1976 and 1984. Both the price-to-book ratio and the habit

variables are consistently important, though more so in 1984.


Model Specification Predictions

     The percentage correct of the model prediction is the sum of correctly

predicted outcomes scaled by the total number of observations. The percentage

correct of the 1976 repurchase, 1976 acquisition, 1984 repurchase, and 1984

acquisition models are .849, .866, .783, and .813 respectively. These imply

that the model allows predictive capability. However, we desire further



                                     22
interpretation of the predictability. Thus, we explicitly compare our models

to a "naive" model. As the naive model we have chosen knowledge of the

aggregate ratios of actual one dummies to nonoccurences, and predict accordingly.

Complete aggregate information is itself a demanding standard of comparison.

     Table 7 reports matrices of the number of realizations for each model of

each of the 4 possible outcomes:

                                                              A
     1.   Correct prediction of an outcome occurence (i.e. Y —          1/? —     I,    where
A
Y is the predicted value of the dummy variable for the action, and Y is the

actual value).
                                                               A
     2.   Misidentifying a nonoccurence as an action (i.e. Y —          l/Y   a 0).

The probability of this outcome gives the size of the type two error.
                                                               A
     3.   Misidentifying an action as a nonoccurence (i.e. Y —          Oft   —   1).
The probability of this outcome is the size of the type one error.
                                                                    A
     4.   Correctly predict a nonoccurence of the event (i.e. Y — O/Y —                 0).

     Table B calculates the realization matrix for our naive model. We assume

knowledge of the aggregate ratio of realizations, i.e. we know total number of

observations, and their true division ratio between 0's and l's. If we predict

a one, we are correct by a percentage equal to the fraction of ones. Thus, the
                                    A
number of realizations such that Y —    lfY   — 1 is equal to the fraction of ones

predicted correctly times the number of ones, (i.e. F1 *           * N).       We similarly
                                                             F1
calculate the number of realizations in each cell of the matrix for total

number of observation N. We can therefore calculate the conditional

probabilities of the naive model.

     The conditional probabilities of the regression and naive models are given

in Table 9. Our model excels in improving the size of type I error, as well as

increasing the power of our predictions.

Structural Change

Across Time

     Initial observation of the results may suggest structural change across

time.1° Given repurchase, the inventory ratio is significant and negative in 1976

and insignificant (and of opposite sign) in 1984. While the previous dividend

ratio is significant and negative in 1976, it lacks such significance in 1984.

     Similarly, while the 1975 repurchase dummy is significant in the 1976 acqui-

sition model, it is not as significant in 1984. The LIFO dummy is significant and

negative in 1976, but insignificant in 1984. Conversely, the previous year's debt-

equity ratio is significant and negative in 1984, though insignificant in 1976.

     We can also expect some structural change across time given how the

relative importance of the parameters change over time. The investment ratio

alters the probability of repurchase far more in 1976 than in 1984. Our

approximation of q alters the probability of acquisition far more in 1984 than

1976. In both, habit formation is more important in 1984. In addition to the

possibility of changes in the Probit coefficients, the increased occurrence of

both repurchases and acquisitions suggests that an intercept shift may also

have occurred over time.

     We test for structural change within action across time with the likelihood

ratio test. The test is computed as


           11 —          -
                  2(L2       L1)

where L2 is the value of the likelihood function for the maximum of the

unconstrained model and L1 is the value with imposed constraints. This

statistic is assymptotically distributed as a chi-squared variable with degrees

of freedom equalling the difference in the number of constraints.




                                      26
      We are interested in testing for the homogeneity of the vector of slope,

allowing for the possibility of an intercept shift. We therefore create a

time-specific dummy so that the intercept may take on different values in the

two   subperiods.
       Thus, we compute likelihood ratio statistic (LR) in Table 10 for tests of

structural change across time. The statistic is compared to a chi-squared with

ten degrees of freedom (23.209 at P —   .01).   We fail to reject the null

hypothesis of no structural change of slope for both repurchase and acquisition

(as neither 13.96 nor 9.89 exceeds 23.209). Thus, despite the apparent

changes in individual coefficients, we cannot statistically reject a constant

structure of the determinants of participation.


V.    Conclusions

      The variables suggested by the various hypotheses regarding nondividend

cash payments collectively have substantial power in predicting participation

in share repurchase and acquisitions. For instance1 relative to a naive model

based on correct aggregate ratios, our probit estimators reduce the occurrence

of type two error (misidentifying a nonoccurrence of the event) by roughly a

factor of three.

      Among the hypotheses surveyed, perhaps the free cash flow theory is most

consistent with our findings, particularly the share repurchase ones. The cash

flow variable and the price-to-book ratio (our 'q" approximation) had the

correct sign, were statistically significant, and were quantitatively important

both in 1976 and 1984. The coefficient on the price-to-book ratio is

consistently negative, significant, and important in both the repurchase and

the acquisition probits. This suggests, consistent with Tobin's "q" theory and

Jensen's free cash flow hypothesis, that finns which sell at a discount

relative to book value are more likely to engage in share repurchase or

 acquisitions, presumably as an alternative to the uprofitable further

 investments in their primary activity. The investment ratio was marginally

significant and consistent with the free cash flow theory for repurchases in

1976, but its coefficient was insignificant in 1984.

     Consistently, the variable with the largest t statistic and the one which

most greatly affects the probability of an action is participation the

preceeding year. Thus, these activities seem to be "habit forming." This

trait is consistent with the clientele hypothesis which asserts that fins

specialize in how they transmit cash to their owners.

     The tests for structural change across time fail to reject the hypothesis

that the determinants of these actions are unchanged. This may be somewhat

surprising, given that their aggregate levels have increased so dramatically.

We do demonstrate that the intercept has time dependence. The failure to find

structural change in the determinants of participation suggests that the above

mentioned theories were consistently operative in both years examined.

     In further work, we plan to examine how these phenomena are affected by

the 1986 tax change just enacted. The major realignment of the tax environment

may dramatically affect these aspects of corporate financial, behavior.

The Data

     We began with 2399 Industrial, 853 OTC, and 1289 Research observations.

29 lacked all information including cusip. Thus, we manipulated from 4512

original observations, to the resultant 2366 and 1820 points for 1976 and 1984,

respectively.

     Table Al lists the Compustat definitions of our dependent variables. It

should be noted that included are both cash and stock-swap acquisitions.

Analysis of Mergers and Acquisitions data indicates the vast majority of 1984

acquisitions were cash deals, suggesting that the inclusion of stock-swaps

should not strongly affect our analysis for that year.

     The 1984 research file consists of companies deleted from other Compustat

files due to acquisition/merger, bankruptcy, liquidation, delisting, or

inconsistent reporting. Thus, many of these may have had observations for 1976

(if it were pre-delisting) though not for 1984. This is one explanation of the

disparity between the number of 1976 and 1984 data samples.

     We then created dummy variables for repurchasing and acquisitions, giving

missing values a 0. We did this as Compustat counts insignificant figures as

not available. Thus, as missing data are potentially in actuality

insignificant, we set them equal to 0 to maximize the information obtainable

from the dependent variables. (Note, however, that given that often a firm has

many, or all, points missing, many of these firms were subsequently "relost" by

missing another variable.) The repurchase dummy was assigned a one only if the

firm acquired more than one-half of one percent of its oustanding share equity

value. We also created the inventory dummy to be I if either the firm chose

solely LIFO, or else LIFO was the primary choice of two inventory valuation

methods, else 0.




                                     30
     TSP Probit executes only for complete observations, so firms with any of

the necessary variables missing were eliminated. We then eliminated any debt-

equity ratios which were either negative or exceeded 100, as we found ratios

outside these parameters implausible, and suggestive of erred data. This

therefore resulted in samples of 2366 and 1820.

1.    See, for example, Auerbach (1983).

2. Cordon and Bradford (1980) argue that the implications of tax rules for the

      preference of capital gains is not so unambiguously in favor of capital

      gains. The importance of the differentials between ordinary income and

      capital gains taxation in dividend policy is still an unsettled issue.

      See, in addition, Miller and Scholes (1982).

3. The repurchase is treated as capital gains if, according to Section 302 of

      the U.S. IRS code, •the redemption is "substantially disproportionate."        The

     Vermaelen (1981) sample has only 3 out of 105 tender offers subject to

     ordinary income taxes.

4. This example is found in Shoven (1986).

5. Recent studies have demonstrated how differing basis values given capital

     gains taxation result in such choices. The Balcer and Judd (1985) life

     cycle model shows the optimal decision rule to be the selling of those with

     the highest basis values first. Simon (1986) also demonstrates how

     heterogeneous basis values of shareholders results in selling by those with

     the lowest basis last.

6. There is no evidence that the rate of return on the common stock of the

     acquiring firm    is   abnormal, whereas there is an excess return enjoyed by

     the holders of the securities of the acquired firm (Dennis and Mcconnell

     (1986)).

7. See, for example, Black (1976).

8. At the suggestion of Jerry Green, we examined an alternative measure of

     cash flow. It approximated the free cash flow available after replacement

     investment scaled by total assets. In general, the qualitative results

     were unchanged.



                                          33
9. A problem with the one-year lagged participation variables is that some

   repurchase and share acquisition programs span more than one calendar year.

   To consider whether this overlap biased the lagged participation

   coefficient, we ran the Probits with a two year lagged repurchase dummy.

    Its significance and importance remained.

10. We chose 1976, instead of the decade preceeding 1984, 1974, given the

   Nathan and O'Keefe (1986) finding of a structural change event in 1974.

   We therefore want to separate out this finding from other structural change

    and chose two periods on the same side of their shift.

11. We do note, however, that the dummy variable coefficient is significant in

    both constrained probits (with t-statistics of 7.801 and 6.290,

    respectively). This suggests an intercept shift across time.
