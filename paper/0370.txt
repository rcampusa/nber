The Decline in Aggregate Share Values: Inflation and Taxation of the

         Returns from Equities and Owner—Occupied Housing

                           ABSTPACT



        With a neutral tax system an increase in observed and anticipated
inflation would not be expected to alter either real after—tax yields
on bonds and equities or the ratio of the market value of equities to
the replacement cost of corporate real capital. In the real world,
however, declines in real after—tax bond yields and the relative value
of shares have been observed. Feldstein (1976, 1978) hasattributed
both of these phenonema to the use of historic—cost depreciation,and   -



the taxation of nominal capital gains. Our analysis supports his conjecture
regarding the decline in real after—tax debt yields, but rejects his analysis
of the cause of the decline in share values.

        The decline in share values can be attributed to many factors, but
the most important is probably the favorable taxation of income from
owner—occupied housing (no taxation of either implicit rents nor real
capital gains). As a result housing has become more attractive with the
acceleration of inflation, and households have substituted housing for
equity shares. Other possible sources of the decline in share values are
reduced profitability of existing capital, owing to increased regulatory
costs and real energy prices, and a greater perceived risk in business
operations.

reduce equity values during inflationary periods, these same factors

cause real after—tax debt yields to fall in response to increases in

expected inflation. This tends to raise actual equity returns (share-

holders gain at the expense of debtors) and to lower required equity

yields, the combination of which increases in share prices. On net,

there is no reason to expect that share values should have been negatively

affected. In contrast, there is evidence that equities have declined in

attractiveness vis—a—vis bonds and that the pretax profitability of the

existing capital stock has fallen. Each of these phenomena has contributed

to the decline in share values.

        Owing to the relationships among debt and equity yields and the

market value of equities, a first step in deducing the impact of changes

in anticipated inflation on share values is to determine the impact of

inflation on debt and equity yields. This is the subject of Section I.

The impact of increases in expected inflation on share prices, when

historic cost depreciation is required and nominal capital gains are taxed,

is examined in Section II. The merits of alternative explanations of the

decline in share values are evaluated in Section III. A suary con-

cludes the paper.

            I The ImpactIofIflation on Debt andquity Yields

            Two      fundamental   relationships are involved in the determination

of debt and equity yields. The first is an investment—equilibrium

condition whereby the marginal product of capital equals an average of

the real costs of debt and equity financing. The second is a portfolio

balance condition in which the after—tax risk—adjusted returns to investors

on debt and equity are equated.                  These relationships are the subjects

of parts A and B of this section. The impact of changes in inflation is

deduced and illustrated graphically in parts C and D.



                      A.   Investment and the User Cost of Capital


            As is well known, the decision to invest depends on whether the

present value of the expected revenue from investment, net of direct

operating expenses and indirect taxes, exceeds the supply price of capital,

and on marginal investments the two will be equal. Assume that inflation

is expected to cause net revenues to rise at rate ir                 (profit margins are

constant) and that the productivity of the investment and thus real net

revenues are expected to decline at the output decay rate of                    per year.

In the absense of taxes one can then write:

The left side of equation (1.2) is the gross marginal product of capital

business capital at T                         and for differences between tax and economic

depreciation and if capital goods prices are expected to rise at the same

rate as revenues, then the analogue to equation (1.2) is:

at replacement cost, then                                    =   (l+_S)t.    Substituting this expression

          B. After—Tax Yeid and Portfolio Equilibrium


       It is assumed that dividend and interest income are taxed at rate

y and capital gains income at rate c (c<y). Specification of the return

on equities after personal taxes thus requires an assumption regarding

dividend policy. Before inflation accelerated in the second half of the

l960s, nonfinancial corporations paid out slightly less than half of their

true earnings after taxes (recorded earnings with the IVA and capital

consumption adjustments). In 1964 and 1965, for example, the payout ratio

was 43 percent. In the 1970s, the payout ratio, so measured, jumped sharply.

In 1976 and 1977, for example, the ratio was 64 percent.. A plausible

explanation for the higher payout is that firms view the real gains that

accrue to shareholders when inflation erodes the real indebtedness of the

firm as ttdistributable" earnings.. To subtract debt payments based on an

inflationary premium in interest rates in the calculation of earnings but

not to add the reduction in real indebtedness is inappropriate [von Furstenberg

and Malkiel (1977)]. When the reduction in real indebtedness, TrcPkK (where

K is the real capital stock and the actual and expected inflation rates

are equal), is added to true earnings to obtain distributable earnings, the

payout ratios in 1964—65 and 1976—77 become, respectively, 41 percent and

43 percent.3 A constant fraction y of earnings so—calculated is assumed



       3These calculations are based upon ci. = 0.25, rr    0.012 in 1964—65
and 0.065 in 1976—77, and the values of real assets reported in von Furstenberg
[1977, Table 1, column (2)]. Von Furstenberg's data also indicate that the
ratio of the market value of debt to the value of real assets has remained
close to 0.25 throughout the 1952—76 period.

to   be paid out.

          To see precisely what is involved, it is useful to rewrite equation

(1.3), after substitution from equation (1.5), as


                    1
          e =             [p       ct(l—T)i —    T(_*)    + car] + TT.   (1.3')


The first term is the expected real pretax return, inclusive of the real

gains at the expense of debtors, to shareholders, y of which is assumed to

be paid out as dividends and taxed at rate y. The remainder plus Tt               is

taxed at rate c. Thus, the expected after—tax return to shareholders is:


          ea =      (l—y)y(e.-ii) +   (1—c)   [(1.-y) (e—1T)   + Tr]

               =    (l—y')(e—ir)    + (l—c)Tr,                           (1.7)


where y' =         yy + c(1—'y) and equals y when all real earnings are fully
taxed (l). A neutral tax system would tax all real equity earnings

(e—11) at rate y and would not tax inflationary gains at all. Thus the

present system is biased in favor of equity returns when inflation is low

and against these returns when inflation is high.4

          The expected after—tax nominal return on equity equals the expected

after—tax return on bonds plus a risk premium:



          ea        (1—y)i + ,                                           (1.8)

where      > 0 is the risk premium.




        4For c = y/5 and y' = 0.4, the system is biased in favor of
equity returns as long as r < 2.4 (e—Tr) or about 12% when the real after—
tax yield is 5%. For a discussion of why the concurrent equivalent capital
gains tax rate would fall far short of the statutory rate, see Bailey (1969).

                  cL(1—T)(1—y') + (l—cL)(l—y)


When conditions (i)—(lv) hold, this expression reduces to unity and

the real after—tax equity yield, (1—y)(e—rr), would be invarient with

respect to ir.

        Of course, conditions (i)—(iv) do not hold in the real world.

Table 1 contains estimates of di/drr and de/dir for different values of y.

The other assumed parameter values are also listed in the table; the
                                                                                             ra
and ir values necessary for calculating A are approximate average values

for the 1964—77 period, not current values [see Hendershott and Ru (1980)].

As can be seen, the hypothesized parameters yield derivatives that are well

below those that would exist under a neutral tax system. To illustrate,

with a neutral system and y =         0.4,      di/dir =   1.67   and de/d'rr =    1.0.
The calculated values are dijdir = 1.28 and de/dir                  0.81 or roughly

20 percent less.7 These results support Feldstein's conjecture (1976, p. 816,


        7L /T 0.3 (sea Section III.B), then the calculated value of
di/dir would be 0.88 for y = 0.4 and 0.64 for y.= 0.0. Data from the ps,t

less than the increase in expected inflation.

cost depreciation are the cause of the decline in real after—tax debt yields

during the last decade and a half. The results are not, however, compatible

with the analysis of Feldstein, Green and Sheshinshi (FGS, l978).8



                    D. A Graphical Illustration


         The impact of an increase, in. expected inflation on nominal debt

and equity yields under both a neutral tax system [as defined by conditions

(i)—(iv)j and the present system is illustrated in Figure 1. The nega-

tively—sloped solid schedule is the. IE curve when the anticipated inflation

rate is initially zero      (Tr° =   0).   The positively—sloped solid schedule is

the corresponding FE curve. From the IE and FE equations, respectively,

the slopes of these schedules can be seen to be —(1—a)! a(l—T) and

(l—y')/.(l—y). With no expected inflation (and thus S=6*), the vertical

intercepts are p/a(l—T) and          —/(l—y), respectively. The intersection of

the curves gives the initial yields of i° and e0.

         In a neutral system, an increase in 'rr to ir' would raise the IE

schedule by iT'/a(l—T) and the FE schedule by yrrT/(l—y). The new dashed

schedules intersect at i' =i0 + iT"/(l—y) and e' = e0 +jr and the

real after—tax rates of return are unchanged. Firms can afford to pay these

With   A =0.8 and T = 0.4, the values for the derivative with y = 0.0, 0.2

increases, rather than decreases, with y. A major source of the difference
in analysis, including the surprising ab.sencc.of c from the expression for
di/diT, is that FGS do not employ a portfolio equilibrium relationship.

higher nominal returns on the same quantities of debt and equity, and wealth—

holders are willing to supply the same amount of debt and equity capital

as before.

         The existence of historic—cost depreciation in the face of inflation

erodes some after—tax real earnings of firms by raising the effective

corporate tax rate. Given p, firms cannot afford to pay i0 + Tr°/(l—y)

to debtors and e0 + .110   to   shareholders. Thus the IE curve rises by only

[n' —   T(_S*)]/c(1_T)   to the dotted schedule in Figure 1. The shift in

the PE curve under present tax law is more complex. The taxation of nominal

capital gains makes equities less attractive during an inflationary period,

requiring higher relative before—tax yields on equities and thus tending to

shift the dashed PE schedule rightward (to lower the vertical intercept). The

only partial (y) taxation of real gains, on the, other hand, makes

equities more attractive (with or without inflation), requiring higher

relative before—tax rates. The net result of an increase in inflation

is a slight bias against equities.9 Thus current methods of taxing equity

income at both the firm and personal levels act to mitigate the increase

in debt yields that would otherwise occur in response to an increase in

expected inflation.




        9When X = 1.0, the value of de/dir for y = T = 0.4 is 1.11 > 1.0,
indicating that the PE curve shifts rightward along the dashed IE schedule
(the value of di/dir is 1.56 < 1.67).

II.          Inflation, Corporate Taxation and the Market Value of Equities

             The after—tax expected rate of return on equity is the expected

rate of return on a unit of real capital divided by the fraction of

capital that is equity financed. For new capital, one solves equation

(1.3') for e—Tr and substitutes in equation (1.8):


      ea =          (1_y')[p_T($_S*)_ct(l_-r)i   + cti]   -1-   (l'-c)(l—ct)ir
                                                                                  (2.1)



By definition, the market value of equity that finances marginal new

investments is 1—ct times the value of the investment, and the value

of new shares nd debt equals the replacement cost of the new real

capital. The determination of the market value of existing equity requires

consideration of the average return on existing capital.

             The expected rate of return on existing shares, which must equal

the rate of return on new shares, can be expressed as the product of the

after—tax average return on a unit of real capital and the value of

real capital PkK, divided by the value of existing shares, Mv.

That       is,


       e             (l-y')[_T(_*)_a(l_T)I + ct] +                (l_c)(l_ct)kK
           a,
                                                                                  '   (2 2)


where !thats!t on the variables denote values pertaining to existing, rather

than new, real capital (old and new capital are assumed to be taxed

identically and financed with the same proportions of debt and equity).

Substituting (2.2) into (1.8) and solving for MV/PkK



                =   (1-y')[   -
                                                                                  (2 3)
                                      (l—y)i+
           To deduce the impact of increases in observed and expected

inflation on the value of equities relative to the replacement cost of

real capital, one takes the derivative with respect to        ii:




    thr
           =   (l_yT)_          l—T)-4+ all + (l—c)(l—ct)—
                                    (l—y)i +


Assuming that          was initially equal to 1—ct,   as it was in the middle

l960s, for an increase in inflation to reduce relative share values

(d/thr < 0) it must be that


    1),t           —
                       a(l—T)---    + < (l—y). — (1—c).                (2.4)



Consideration of the values of di/thr computed in Table 1, along with

the y and c associated with them, establishes that the right side

of (2.4) is negative. While somewhat more complicated to demonstrate,

the left side is also postiie.                    As a result, (2.4) does

not hold and thus an increase in inflation should raise relative share

values, not lower them.

           Before establishing that the left side of (2.4) is positive, it

should be noted that the left side would be negative in a model where

firms are fully equity-financed (ctO) because dSfdir < 0. It is the

pure—equity assumption of Feldstein's analysis (1978) that allows

him to reach the conclusion that inflation impairs equity values. When

debt—financing is acknowledged, it is clear that the combination of

increased inflation and the present taxation of corporate income will

not, ceteris paribus, be detrimental to share values.

The derivatives 1/i and d5*/thr are average "concurrent equivalents"

because their values depend on the time elasped from the change in     Tr



and it is the average changes in i and cS*, in present value terms,

that are relevant to the current value of shares. To illustrate, in 1977

only 14 percent of net interest—bearing debt of nonfinancial corporations

was short—term.1° Thus an increase in interest rates would apply

initially to less than a fifth of outstanding debt (in the short run

i/i < 0.2). Over time more debt would roll over at the higher interest

rate and eventually i/i would approach unity. In the calculations

reported in the next session, the average concurrent equivalent i/Bi

will assumed to be 0.4. This would make the last term on the left of (2.4')

equal to —0.3 for the maximum value of di/thr of 1.28 and T =   0.4.

           III. Other Causes of the Decline in Share Values


          The question still remains as to why share prices have fallen. Only

two possible sources exist within the framework developed: a decline in

the pretax net return on capital, p, and an increase in the risk premium

required to induce investors to hold equities, .      Significant   evidence

exists that each of these changes has occurred; whether the changes are

large enough to explain the observed decline in share values is another

matter.



                      A.   Some Empir-cai Evidence


          Malkiel (1979) is most closely identified with the position that

has increased. In support of his hypothesis, he computes a series on the

expected return on stocks and compares it with the return on riskiess

long—term treasury securities,. The expected return series is an imagina-

tive use of expected growth rates of earnings per share, obtained from the

Value Line Investment Survey, for each of the companies in the Dow Jones

Industrial average., According to Malkiel's calculations, the premium rose
                                  —18—




from under roughly 3½ percent in the 1964—65 period to 6 percent in the

1975—77 period.11 Independent equity returns calculated by Hendershott and

Hu (1980) show a roughly 3½ percentage point rise from 4 to 7½ in this

premium.

           There is also evidence that the pretax return on capital has fallen

in the 1970s. Feldstein and Summers (1977) compute cyclically—adjusted

pretax series [p/(l—T)] based on two different capital stock measures.

The declines in the pretax series between 1964—65 and 1975—76 are 3 and

2 percentage points. Moreover, the 1975—76 data were adjusted upward on

the basis of the potential GNP gap as measured in 1976. Two downward

revisions in potential GNP have been made since then [Council of Economic

Advisors (1979, pp. 72—76)]. As a result, the gap in 1975—76 is now cal-

culated to be only 70 percent of the gap employed in the Feldstein'-

Summer's adjustment. Using the lower gap reduces the adjusted values

of the series in 1975—76 by          one half to a full percentage point.

This would constitute 4 and 2½ percentage point declines in the two series

between 1964—65 and 1975—76.

           Some calculations are presented in Table 2 to indicate the impact of

changes in inflation, pretax profitability, and the risk premium on the

market value of equities. The assumed parameter values common to all

calculations are listed below the table. The values that vary [Tr,p/(1—T), and ],

the calculated ratio of share values to the replacement cost of real capital



        11Malkiel computes risk premia for both equities and bonds by sub-
tracting a risk—free treasury yield series. Unfortunately, the treasury
yield series employed was the infamous average yield on all treasury securities
with maturity over 10 years. Because this series contains primarily deep
discount and "flower" bonds, the quoted before—tax yield was consistently
between 3/4 and 1½ percentage points less than a new—issue equivalent yield
throughout the 1968—76 period [Cook and Hendershott (1978)].

Row (2) illustrates the positive ceteris paribus impact that an increase

in inflation should have on share prices. An increase in   TF   from zero to

7 percent should raise share prices by 10 percent relative to the replace-

ment cost of real capital)3 Row (3) shows that a 3½ percentage point

increase in the risk premium from 0.0446 to 0.0796, in conjunction with

the increase in inflation to 7 percent, lowers share values by 13 percent.

Row (4) indicates that a decline in the pretax return on capital from 0.11

to 0.075, again in conjunction with the rise in inflation, reduces share

values by 9 percent. When these changes are combined, row (5), the re-

duction in share values is 28 percent, or over two—thirds of the 40 percent

observed decline. Row (6) measures the impact of an increase in the risk

premium and a decline in pretax profitability in the absence of inflation,,

The 56 percentage point decline in share values reemphasizes the earlier

point that biases in the tax code against corporate income have not caused

the decline in equity values. Given the increase, in the risk premium and

decline in pretax profitabi1ity share: values would have fallen even more

if inflation had not accelerated.

then c1S*/d7Tcould exceed its long—run value. This appears to have been the
case in the United States [HerAdershott and Hu (1980)]. With the average con-
current equivalent value of d*/r set at —0 5 rather than —0 3,        in rows

         B. Causes of the increase In      and Decline in p


        Malkiel (1979) cites three reasons for the increase in the relative

risk premium required on equities: (1) the recessions of 1969—70 and

especially 1973—75, after eight years of Continuous prosperity, (2) the

greater variability in prices associated with a higher level of inflation,

and (3) escalating uncertain business regulation. One might question the

importance of (1), it depending on a questionable naivete of investors,

and possibly (2). While uncertain inflation obviously creates uncertainty

regarding the real after—tax return on equity investments, such returns

are at least partially hedged by the underlying real assets. The real

after—tax return on investments in long—term debt instruments, in contrast,

is not hedged at all [Gordon and Halpern (1976)]. While uncertainties

regarding business regulations have undoubtedly increased, it seems un-

likely that they could explain the remarkably large increase in .

        Another argument against Malkiel's explanation is the failure of

other market measures of corporate risk to increase dramatically. Malkiel

reports a spread between yields on BAA corporate bonds and long—term

treasury securities, and the spread rises sharply from 1 percentage points

or less in the first half of thel96Os to2:to3 perdaxtgepoints in the

1970—76 period (although it falls below 2 percent in 1977). However, this

increase is largely attributable to the inclusion of deep—discount bonds in

the issues underlying the average treasury yield series (see footnote 11).

When a new—issue—equivalent treasury yield series is substituted for the

deep—discount series, the yield spread exceeds 2 percent in only the

severe 1974—75 recession years and barely exceeds 1 percent in 1973 and

1977.
                                   —22—




      A better explanation for the increase in        is the impact of

increases in inflation on the attractiveness of investment in owner—

occupied housing [Hendershott and Hu (1979)]. During the past decade

and a half, leveraged homeowners have earned expost real rates of return

on the equity invested in their homes averaging 5 percentage points

greater than expected. Moreover, neither the implicit rents nor the real

capital gains on housing are taxed, while returns on financial assets are

and interest payments are deductible in computing the personal income tax

base. As a result of this tax treatment, the increase in expected inS—

flation has lowered substantially the user cost of capital for owner'-

occupied housing for those in higher tax brackets. The decline between

1964 and 1978 has been estimated to be 2½ percentage points for those in

the 30 percent marginal tax bracket and 4 percentage points for those in

the, 45 percent bracket.

      Because investment in owner—occupied housing is more faoedby

tax law during inflationary periods, it is not surprising that households

have substituted housing investment for purchases of equities. Rather than

channelling current income into equity mutual funds, this, income is bei:ng used to

make mortgage payments. In order to maintain a balance in portfolios

between "real" (shares and real estate) and debt investments, bond holdings

have been maintained. The result is the observed increase in the premium

required to hold shares vis—a—vis debt.

      Turning to the causes of the decline in the pretax profitability of

the existing capital stock, two seem relevant. First is the sharp increase

in regulatory costs. These include those generated by environmental
                                                                           14
standards, health and safety programs,, and affirmative action programs.

           See Crandell (1978, pp. 417—426) for estimates of some of these costs.
                                 —23—




Unless these costs can be fully passed onto consumers, i.e., labor

absorbs the full costs via reduced real wages, the return on existing

capital would decline. Second is the sharp rise in energy prices in the

1970s relative to that expected when the capital was put into place. This

has required expenditures to render production processes more energy

efficient and the resultant processes are probably still inferior

relative to those associated with new capital.,




C. Implications for Empirical Investigation of Investment Behavior




      Tobin's "q" theory makes the ratio of the market value of the firm

to the replacement cost of its real assets a central determinant of investment

behavior [Tobin and Brainard (1977)]. When q >        1.0,   net investment will

raise the value of shares; when q <     1.0,    investment will lower the value

of shares. The relevant q is a nonobservable anticipated marginal ratio:

the increase in the market value of the firm owing to investment in real

assets divided by the value of the additional real assets. However, if

marginal and average q's move together, the latter equalling              + a in
the symbolism of this paper, then the observed          + a      is an adequate proxy

for the marginal q and can successfully be employed in empirical work.

      As long as deviations of      + a from unity are largely caused by

the business cycle, q and        + a are likely to move together. During

recessions, when excess capacity exists and          + a < 1.0, new investment
is unlikely to be profitable (q <   1.0);      the reverse is true during expansions.

Of course, if this is the case, then capacity utilization rates would pro-

vide as accurate an explanation of investment behavior as would            + a
                                —24—




[von Furstenberg (1977)]. However when         + a   falls owing to a decline

in cyclically—adjusted p/(1 —          + a and q could diverge sub-

stantially. New capital will be more productive than old capital because

only the former will be energy and environment efficient. In this case,

capacity utilization rates would be preferred, empirically,to     + a. On

the other hand, when    + a falls owing to an increase in , then         + a

would be preferred empirically to capacity utilization rates.


                           IV. Summary

      With a neutral tax system an increase in observed and anticipated

inflation would not be expected to alter either real after—tax yields

on bonds and equities or the ratio of the market value of equities to

the replacement cost of corporate real capital. In the real world,

however, declines in real after—tax bond yields and the relative value

of shares have been observed. Feldstein (1976) (1978) has attributed

both of these phenomenon to the use of replacement—cost depreciation and

the taxation of nominal capital gains., Ou analysis supports his conjecture

regarding the decline in real after-tax debt yields, but rejects his analysis

of the cause of the decline in share values.

      The decline in share values can be attributed to many factors, but

the most important is probably the favorable taxation of income from

owner—occupied housing rather than the unfavorable taxation of corporate

income. Neither implicit rents nor real capital gains on housing are

taxed, and mortgage interest is deductible in computing the personal income

tax base. As a result housing has become more attractive with the accel-

eration of inflation, and househqlds have, substituted              equity

shares. Other possible sources of the decline in share values are reduced

profitability of existing capital, owing to increased regulatory costs

and real energy prices, and a greater perceived risk in business

operations.
