         THE EFFICIENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES



         Criteria for determining the efficient mix of branches,

hours, stock, and new acquisitions are developed and applied to

the branch operations of the New York Public Library. A method

based on travelling costs is used to value library use at each

branch. The relationship between library operations and library

use is estimated using a two—stage technique. The costs of library

operations are explored. Marginal benefit-cost ratios are presented.

The study finds that the New York Public Library operates too many

branches for too few hours of service.

              THE EFFICIENT LEVEL OF PUBLIC LIBRARY SERVICES


                              Malcolm Getz1



          In the era of fiscal austerity and Proposition 13 fever, the

 issue of determining the efficient level of local government services

 is particularly acute. Public libraries are more vulnerable to cutbacks

than other services because library closings do not represent the

irmiiediate threat to public health or safety which fire, police, and

sanitation cutbacks imply.

         In fact, public library budgets are subject to wide swings.

For example, the Buffalo-Erie County Public Library suffered a 27-percent

cutback in budget in 1977; 11 percent was restored in 1978.    Such

erratic budget changes tend to destroy the morale of library employees,

disrupt orderly management, and disturb public habits of library use.

Because library use and public sentiment toward libraries are not sub-

ject to such severe short-term swings, it would seem that budget

officers make changes with little evidence to guide them.   They may be

experimenting to discover the effect of different budget levels.

         Formal methods for evaluating the efficiency of different

levels of operation might lead to greater budget stability by making

specific requests for change more defensible. Of course, formal

methods involve aggregation, abstraction, and wrestling with difficult

problems of valuation; and they do not replace informed judgment.

However, a formal approach to budget evaluation can pinpoint the area

                                                                       4




in which judgment must be applied and thus help avoid the destructive

pattern of budget instability which characterizes many public libraries.

         Formal analysis can also provide insight into the efficient

mixture of library expenditures. Perhaps more benefits can be derived

per dollar of expenditure by changing the mixture. Rather than choosing

between spending mare and spending less, public library managers can use

formal budget evaluation to spend more wisely.

         In the discussion which follows, previous studies of library

services are reviewed to establish the state of the art in evaluating

libraries. The problem of determining the efficient number of branches

is then discussed, using evidence from the branches of the New York

Public Library. Efficient levels of hours and book stock are addressed,

again using (data from the New York Public Library. Finally, a possible

realloctioq of expenditure with fewer branches operating longer hours

is evaluated.


                  STUDYING EFFICIENCY IN LIBRARIES


         Efficiency is used here to mean deriving as much benefit as

possible from expenditures. Benefits are consumer valuations of

services, and expenditures include the full social costs of activities.

 In competitive private markets, prices carry information about social

costs and allow consumers to judge the level of service that makes

 them best off. Producers use revenues from sales as signals of how

much to produce. However, when goods are provided collectively, as

with public libraries, other means must be used to determine the

 efficient level of activity.
                                                                         5




         The decision rule for a pattern of expenditure that will make

consumers best off is simply stated: the additional benefit from one

dollar of expenditure should be just one dollar.   If the additional

benefit were greater than one dollar, then the total benefit, net of

costs, would increase with the additional expenditure, and the

additional expenditure would be justified. If the additional benefit

were less than one dollar, then reducing expenditures by one dollar

would reduce costs more than benefits; thus benefits, net of costs,

would be increased by cutting back. Of course, in order to operate

the enterprise at all, total benefits must exceed total costs. But

in most situations, the problem of choosing the most efficient level

of operation--the level that makes consuniers best off—-is the problem

of identifying the level of service where the extra benefit of

additional expenditure matches the cost.

         The linkage between library expenditures and consumer benefits

must be carefully defined and measured. First, how do expenditures

generate services (the cost function)? Second, how much use is

generated by the services (the production function)? Third, how do

consumers value the different kinds of use (the valuation problem)?

Other authors have considered the problem of evaluating library services.

Their efforts are reviewed briefly here as background for the investi-

gation to follow.

         Several economists have applied benefit—cost analysis to

library services. Newhouse and Alexander [13] focused on book selection

in the Beverly Hills, California public library. They assumed that use

of library materials represents some fraction of the value of ownership
                                                                         6




of the materials. Consequently, they suggested that the value of use

of library materials is directly related to the purchase price of the

materials (art books are more valuable than juvenile books, for example)

and that value is directly related to the amount of use. By assuminq

that the same proportion of users would be likely to buy each type

of book if the library copies are unayailable, Newhouse and Alexander

estimated a valuation for each category of book and compared the values

to the costs of the books. As a result of this analysis they recommended

that the Beverly Hills Library buy more expensive and fewer inexpensive

books.

         The Newhouse and Alexander study is valuable because it deals

directly with the problem of valuation, but the study has several

limitations. Because they were uncertain how many users would buy

books if the library copies were unavailable, the authors were unwillinq

to state the value of library use; they limited their conclusions to

defining the best mixture of book purchases, given the book budget.

Of course, the book budget is only one part of the design of a library.

Newhouse and Alexander did not deal with the geographic character of

public library services--namely, the number of branches--nor did they

consider the issue of hours of service.

         Hu, Booms, and Kaltrieder [10] used benefit—cost methods to

compare mail—order and bookmobile services in rural Pennsylvania. The

average cost of the bookmobile service was $0.62 per circulation, while

the average cost of the mail—order service was $0.69 per circulation.

The mail-order service was more expensive because of the cost of preparing

and mailing catalogs for selection. Estimated cost functions revealed
                                                                        1




that the operating cost per book circulated by the bookmobile service

was $0.48; the operating cost of the mail service was $0.60.

        The authors considered five different methods for establish-

ing the benefits of the rural library services. First, they

determined how much time was saved by users ordering books for

delivery instead of making trips to the library. Second, they

estimated the additional amount of money that users would have

spent buying books if library service were less convenient. Third,

the authors asked users what they would be willing to pay for the

service. And fourth, they determined at what price books might be

rented, if rentals were available. In addition, the authors

considered the value of the option to use the service by people

who do not use it, that is, the options demand for service. Because asking

what users would pay is an unreliable method and because no rental

services were in fact available in rural Pennsylvania, the analysts

surmned the time saved, the value of books not purchased, and the

value of the options demand for service to establish the benefit

for each service. They calculated the marginal benefit of rural

delivery at $.29 for the bookmobile and $.47 for mail delivery.

Thus, while mail delivery yields more benefits per dollar of expendi-

ture than the bookmobile service, the benefits of neither system

cover operating costs. The authors concluded that consumers in

rural Pennsylvania are better off with the tax saving of visiting

the library than with elaborate delivery systems. The Hu, Booms,

and Kaltrieder study is noteworthy because it employs surveys of

users and nonusers in developing estimates of benefits. Of course,
                                                                        8




the study of rural delivery is only tangentially relevant to the

design of an urban system.

        Other economists [7, 17] estimate cost functions of quasi-

production functions without trying to establish values for bene-

fits, but they do not claim to identify efficient levels of service.

In the best of these studies, Feldstein [6] estimated cost and

circulation functions in 371 cities using a 1968 Office of Education

survey of public libraries.   In estimating a use of relationship,

Feldstein recognized that the library activities, branches, hours,

and book stock might be shaped by library managers in light of

patterns of use. Thus, the simple correlation between use and

service level reflects both consumer behavior and managerial choice.

While Feldstein used an instrumental variable technique to try to

control for the simultaneity, it is not clear what variables were

used as instruments. The use of city library systems as units of

observation also caused some trouble because no distinction was

made between a system with a large central library and small branches

and one with a smaller central library and larger branches. Conse-

quently, Feldstein could not develop statistical results to validate

the claim that 'fewer large branches is preferred to more small

branches.   Feldstein found that library use is sensitive to the

level of service and that expenditures are shaped by local demographics

and local government revenue services.

        In an earlier study of library economics, Black [3] examined

expenditure and use in a dynamic context. He recognized that library
                                                                        9




use would change with changes in population level, income, and wages.

Assuming that the efficient level and mixture of services would be

determined in response to use in this demographic context, Black

emphasized the fact that efficient library service would change

with time. Baumo] and Marcus [1] considered the changing costs

of academic library services, but did not provide an analytic

framework; The fact that library costs are rising faster than

other costs is not in itself a clue to determining efficiency.

        Operations research analysts have studied libraries in

some detail. Although Hamburg, Clelland, Bommer, Ramist and

Whitfield [8] have surveyed a substantial amount of this literature,

they have contributed little to the problem of estimating the

valuation that consumers place on library activities. They note

that the average rate of return in the private sector is 12.5

percent. "By assuming that the average public library has behefits

that exceed costs by 12.5 percent, we estimate the dollar value

imputed to an exposure hour' [8, p. 33].

        Operations research analysis appears to offer a better

understanding of the production function than the more aggregate

methods generally used by economists. In the best example of

such work, Morse [2] analyzed the operation of the MIT library.

He used queuing theory to determine the optimum numberof multiple

copies and a markov process to predict book use. Morse also

considered the optimum length of loan period and the optimum number

of reserves. These techniques are readily applicable in many

library situations and deserve wide use. However, because Morse

studied an academic library and emphasized operation issues, his
                                                                       10




approach offers little guidance in making budgetary choices for

public library systems.

        Raffel and Shishko [15] also used operations research in

a study of the MIT library. The authors asked 283 students and

faculty members to allocate a budget over 20 service chanqes.

According to the responses, the authors distinguished two groups

of users. The first (mainly students) preferred outside use: more

duplicate copies for loan and longer loan periods. The other group

(generally users engaged in research) favored increased acquisition,

a messenger service with the Library of Congress, and department

libraries. Using answers to hypothetical questions by relatively

uninformed users may not be a reliable analytic technique. Never-

theless, the Raffel and Shishko study represents a creative effort

to investigate the valuation of services in the context of an

academic library, where the valuation problem is especially difficult.

        Librarians, of course, have also been interested in evaluatinq

library services. Lancaster's [11] comprehensive survey illustrates

the strengths and the weaknesses of studies by librarians. Their

main strengths are close attention to detail and sensitivity to

nuances of service quality. For example, a study conducted by

Crowley and Childers [4] assessed the quality of available reference

services by asking a set of topical questions during anonymous

telephone calls made at random times to public libraries in New

Jersey. The authors found that the libraries generally did a poor

job of responding to questions which required very current information

(recent Presidential cabinet appointments, for example). It is easy
                                                                       11




to see how such surveys might be used by libraries to monitor their

own telephone reference services and even to make judgments about

the effectiveness of different training methods and work assignments.

Another study by Seymour and Schofield [16] reported on the use of

card catalogs. "Failures" were classified as follows: (1) item

in catalog but not found; (2) item in library but not cataloged;

(3) item on order; (4) identified item not in collection; and (5)

unidentified citation. Clearly, an analysis of the first group of

failures might lead to revision of catalog headinqs(if inexpensive);

failures in the fourth category might give a clue to collections

development. These detailed performance studies reflect the librarian's

concern with the quality of individual library activities.

       Another attempt by librarians to develop performance mdi-

cators casts a broader net. DeProspo, Altman, and Beasley [5],

under the auspices of the Public Library Association, propose a more

comprehensive data-gathering effort using sampling techniques to

describe the user success rate in finding materials (the probability

of finding particular items from standard bibliographies in the

catalog and on the shelves). A study of the scope proposed by the

authors would include consideration of facilities use, reference,

outreach, circulation, materials available, users, and in-library

activity. The specific purpose of the proposed methods is to develop

a broad base of information useful to library management, and,

clearly, the use of sampling techniques represents a substantial

improvement over current practice.
                                                                          12




        The main deficiency of most evaluations by librarians is

the lack of concern with costs. Lancaster gives little information

about bench marks for the costs of different kinds of library activity,

nor does he suggest how costs might usefully be measured. Even the

comprehensive approach proposed by DeProspo, et al. is aimed at

improving performance measures and gives short shrift to costs.

Efficiency, however, cannot be defined without reference to costs.

        The lack of concern with costs leads librarians into several

traps. First, they like to talk about the number of people unserved

by libraries. Usually, this' seems to mean the residents of juris-

dictions which have not chosen to build public libraries. But

DeProspo, et al .   broaden the reference: "Iowa and Minnesota show the

percentage of population unserved by libraries, although it is not

clear if the figures relate to the lack of a library in a given area

or, more important, that a percentage of the population does, not avail

itself of library service" [5, p. 23J. The implication seems to be

that, whatever the cost and whatever consumers' preferences, more

should be spent on libraries until everyone uses them. Lancaster,

only slightly more conservatively, cites the view that libraries

should strive to satisfy 90 percent of the population's needs [11,

p. 166]. The notion that the benefits of library services must be

balanced against their costs is not reflected in the concept of an

unserved population. Moreoever, this concept rejects consumer

preference as a criterion for judging service levels.

        A second trap created by the lack of concern with costs is

the application of standards. The Public Library Association
                                                                         13




promulgated standards for public libraries in 1966 [14], specifying

space, book stock, staffing, training, and so on. The description

of a successful public library may be helpful. But the standards

seem   to suggest that comunities which do not choose to buy elaborate
library services are not acting responsibly. That some communities
have difficulty raising taxes and do not value library services

highly while others want to pay for high levels of service is

easily understandable when efficiency is recognized to account for

both benefits and costs and consumer preferences are used. as the

criteria for judging service. As costs, productivity, and tastes

change, the level and mixture of library services different conriunities

desire also change. The efficient set of public library activities

has changed since 1966 and will continue to change. Since standards

are fixed and unresponsive to change, they are not very helpful in

evaluating the efficiency of library services.

          Finally, a study of efficiency—-that is, how benefits relate

to costs——should focus on the cost of major library activities.

For example, perhaps the most fundamental cost consideration in an

urban public library system is how many branches of what size to

operate; the second most important issue is how many hours to operate;

the third is how many new books to add each year; and the fourth is

the size of the central library. These are the major decisions

that determine the size of a public library budget and to a sub-

stantial degree, the quality of service. Therefore, these items

shoul.d be the principal target of evaluation.   If the Lancaster

survey is any indication, librarians appear to prefer to evaluate
                                                                        14




catalog use, reference service, information retrieval, and book

collection. Lancaster's discussion of the evaluation of library

services hardly mentions the number of branches, hours of service,

or numbers of books, except to say that more is better.

        In the analysis described below, cross—sectional evidence

from the branch libraries of the New York Public Library is used

to determine the efficient number of branches, books, and hours of

service. Analysis of the efficient size of the central library

services reqUires a different methodology because the central facili-

ties in library systems are unique within each system. The present

exercise is limited to a cross—sectional study focUsing on neighbor-

hood branches. The New York Public Library has been chosen for

evaluation because its large number of branches facilitates a

statistical analysis.


                        HOW MANY BRANCHES?


        The first priority in judging the efficiency of an urban

library system is determining the efficient number of branches. The

evaluation paradigm is straightforward: the benefits and costs of

each branch are measured and compared. Each branch is considered in

turn as the marginal branch. The actual use of each branch is valued

from the consumer's point of view. Because the estimates of costs

and benefits are approximations, choices are made so as to give low

estimates of costs and high estimates of benefits within the range

of plausible values.
                                                                        15




        The New York Public Library, a private, nonprofit, research

library, operates branch libraries under contract from the City of

New York in three boroughs: Manhattan, the Bronx, and Staten Island

(Richmond County). Because the facilities of the research libraries

are generally used on premise, their services are not close substi-

tutes for the traditional public library services of the branches,

and •so they are ignored here. The branch libraries include a facility

for the handicapped that provides services throughout the City and

beyond. The service to handicapped persons is also not a close

substitute for the traditional library services, so it too is excluded

from the analysis.

       The branches are classified as centers, regional libraries,

and neighborhood libraries. The centers are the largest facilities;

there is one in each borough, plus one for the whole system. The

centers have an average book stock of over 120,000 volumes. The 13

regional libraries have an average stock of 33,000 volumes. There

are 59 neighborhood libraries in the system; each has a permanent

book stock, anaverage of 24,000 volumes, and staff. Two former

neighborhood libraries which are operated at a marginal level without

a permanent book stock or staff are not included in this analysis.

        In all, the branch libraries operate 76 regular, general-

purpose facilities with permanent book stocks and staff. They serve

an area of 122 square miles which in 1970 had a population of 3.3

million. Summary information for an average branch of each type

and totals for all 76 facilities are reported in Table 1. The three

types of branches seem to differ in terms other than the size of the

        aTotal Use is reference questions plus 1.183 times circulation. The

1.183 factor is to account for in-library use.           It is an average figure from

a survey of library users in a sample of 15 neighborhood branches in the New

York Public Library.

        bCost is based on the operating budget for each library. Reported

budget figures anticipated for 1976-77 are adjusted for part-time staff

shifts among branches as reported in library budget documents. In addition,

Comprehensive Employment and Training Act Employees are added in at $9,000

each. Operating costs are inflated by 20 percent to reflect the administra-

tive overhead costs of the system. Rent payments actually paid are excluded

from costs, but $5 per square foot are included for each facility reflecting

an approximation to the annual lease value of space. Actual rentals varied

from under $3 to over $9 per square foot for the small number of facilities

actually rented.
                                                                        18




book stock. The centers have larger staffs and operate more hours

than the regional libraries, and the regionals operate with larger

staffs and are open more hours than the neighborhood facilities.

They also differ in respect to the proportion of professional staff,

with the larger units having more professional staff than the smaller

ones. Note, however, that the regional branches are much more like

neighborhood branches than like centers.

           The patterns of use of the three types of branches also differ

The amount of use per volume in stock is much larger for the library

centers than for the regional libraries and somewhat larger for the

regional than for the neighborhood libraries, whether use is defined

simply as circulation or as the sum of reference questions and

weighted for in-library use circulation. Consequently, the cost per

use is lowest at the centers, and is somewhat lower at the neighbor-

hood than at the regional facilities. The greater intensity of use

probably reflects th fact that the larger facilities operate longer

hours, have larger and more varied collections, add more books to

their stocks, and have a more professional staff. On the other hand,

the neighborhood libraries circulate a larger share of juvenile

materials than the library centers. Surprisingly, however, juvenile

materials are about as important at regional libraries as at neighbor-

hood locations. The proximity of the neighborhood branches does not

seem to dominate the regional facilities for juvenile use. Note that

with 76 locations serving 122 square miles, the average branch serves

1.6 square miles. A circle with a radius of -71 miles subtends such

an area.

Cost of Branches

        The first step in defining efficiency is an analysis of costs.

The budgeted costs of the New York Public Library branch library

system for 1976-77 are used here. The operating costs for each facility

include staff costs with fringe benefits and supplies; the budget for

the acquisition of new materials inflated by 34 percent to account

for system processing costs; and plant security and maintenance costs.

The operating costs are modified in several ways to reflect actual

social costs. First, the staff work part-time in other branches. An

approximate net value for such reassignments is used to adjust the

budget figures. Also, Comprehensive Employment and Training Act

supported employees are added in at $9,000 each. Second, operating

costs for each facility do not include the administrative overhead

costs for borough and system offices: 20 percent is added to approxi-

mate such costs. Third, the budget includes rent expenditure for 15

facilities that are rented. In order to make the cost figures used

in this study reflect the full social opportunity cost of the system,

an annual lease value is assumed for each facility. Therefore a $5

per square foot lease charge is included in the total costs. For

this reason, the social cost figures used here exceed the budget for

the library system by about $4 million. The cost figures used here then

are an attempt to estimate the full social costs of each facility

including the local budget, federal support, and the value of facili-

ties owned by the Library.

       The costs of each facility can be related to the level of

operation. The operations are summarized in three variables: annual
                                                                        20




hours of service, the total stock of materials both book and non-book,

and the number of gross additions of stock during the year. The

possibility that high levels of use raise costs given hours

and books is ignored. The analysis reported in Table 2 indicates

the marginal cost of an additional hour of service annually is

approximately $2,317, that is $44.56 for a single hour.2 Maintaining

an additional item in stock for a year is estimated to cost $393•3

The acquisition of a new item has an estimated marginal cost of $7.31

including average processing costs.4 While over half of the variation

in costs across neighborhood branches is accounted for by the three

operations variables, it is a little disappointing that more of the

cost differences are not explained. This weakness may be due in

part to the fact that the budget and actual operations may not be for

exactly the same time period, and expenditures may be somewhat

different than budgets.


Benefits of Branches

       The second step in the evaluation of branch activities is

the evaluation of the use of the libraries. Library use is recorded

in more detail by the New York Public Library than by many libraries.

The circulation of books and other materials outside each branch is

recorded separately for adult and juvenile materials.   In addition

the Library makes an effort to count the reference questions asked

during several sample periods each year. Thus, the total number of

reference questions asked can be estimated. The only major category

of use that the Library does not routinely monitor is attendance;

thus, the in—library use of materials is not systematically known,

The Library has undertaken a sample survey of users of 21 faciiitie

in the system. Among users at 15 neighborhood branches, lLh;

percent indicate they planned to use materials in the library.

Defining total materials use as circulation times l.13                            puts 15.5
percent of materials use in the library and 84.6                         percent outside

the   library.         The in-library use for the sample libraries vaiied

 current users would either discontinue
                                           library use (perhaps buyino
 more books or doing less reading) or visit the next most convenient

 branch library. For the user who would visit another library, the

 value of having a library nearby is simply the differential in travel

 time and cost of visiting a more distant
                                             library over visiting one

 nearby. As a rough average, the additional travel time and cost will

 be about the sane as the cost of travel from the nearest library to

 the next nearest. For the user who would stop using the library if

 the nearest branch were to close, the value of library service must

 be less than the cost of visiting the
                                         next nearest library. At a
maximum, the value of the nearest library branch is the cost in tinie

and money of travelling to the next nearest facility. Whether library

use continues at another facility or ceases, the cost of travel to the

next nearest facility is an upper bound estimate of the value of its

services.

        The method of valuing library use by lookinq at the cost of

the next best alternative defines a value for an individual branch

considered by itself.   It does not reveal the value of the full librar

system. If a single branch closes, some users will be diverted to

other branches, and so the use of other facilities will change. In

addition, the next nearest branch for
                                         some facilities may change
when one facility is closed. Thus the proposed method for valuinn

the library services is appropriate for valuinc-i branches individually.

        The value of use of a particular branch is then assumed to be

the cost of travelling between that location and the next nearest
I!                                                                          24




     facility. Two uses are assumed to occur on each round trip. To

     calculate the travel time, straight—line distances are measured,

     and travel is assumed to take place at five miles per hour. Travel

     time is assumed to be valued at $4 per hour. This implies a

     valuation of each library use of $0.80 for each mile from a- particular

     branch to the next nearest branch.   In addition, $0.50 additional

     transit fare is assumed each way of the round trip to the next

     nearest branch. For regional branches, the distance to the library

     centers is used. For the three borough centers, the Mid—Manhattan

     Library Center is taken as the alternative. No effort is made to

     value the services of the MidManhattan Center.      -




             According to this method of valuation, branches with-greater
     use and those located at a greater distance from regional libraries

     provide more benefits than the branches that are used less and those

     located near to other branches.

             The valuation technique obviously does not give any clue as

     to the relative value of juvenile versus adult circulation, or of

     circulation versus reference versus in—library.use. In order to

     account for the possibility that different uses will be valued

     differently, a second benefit calculation is made. Adult circulation

     is treated as before, whereas juvenile circulation is assumed to be

     worth 50 percent more than adult in light of the greater difficulty

     juveniles may have in travelling to another library. Reference

     questions are valued at half an adult circulation rate because many

     questions can be answered by telephone. In-library use is treated

     like circulation just as before.
                                                                            25




          The estimated benefits and
                                        costs of the branches of the New
  York Public Library are reported in Table 3. Of the 59
                                                         nelghborhoo
  branches, 12 are estimated to have
                                        benefits greater than costs while
  47 have benefits less than costs. Of the 12 with positive
                                                            net
  benefits, 6 are in Staten Island, 5
                                        are in the Bronx, and only one is
  in Manhattan. Of the 47
                            neighborhood branches with negative net
  benefits, 26 have benefits that
                                    are $100,000 less than costs. Of
 these 26 branches, 22 are within one mile of the next nearest branch,

 including 7 that are within a half mile of the next nearest branch.

 Thus the close proximity of branches
                                         seems to be important in explaining
 the low level of benefits of
                                 many branches. A second factor, of
 course, is low levels of use.

         Among the 13 regional libraries, 5 show negative net benefits

 according to these estimates. Of these 5, the Francis X. Martin

 Regional Library and the Grand Concourse
                                            Regional Library show
 benefits less than costs of
                               more than $100,000. Martin and Grand
Concourse are about a mile apart and the Martin Regional is within

a mile of the Fordham Library Center.
                                          These facts may explain the
low level of benefits indicated
                                   for these regional branches.
        The Fordham and St. Georges
                                       Library Centers show benefits
substantially greater than costs. The
                                          valuation method does not
allow an estimate of the benefit of the MidManhattan Library,
                                                              the
largest library in the branch system. The Donnell Library Center

shows negative net benefits in
                                 part because it is within a mile of
the MidManhattan. The Donnell
                                 Library Center may have specialized
collections for Young Adults, however, and so the MidManhattan
                                                                  may

not be a close substitute. The valuation method is on a firmer

footing in evaluating the neighborhod and regional facilities.

        When use of juvenile materials is weighted 50 percent more

than the use of adult materials, and reference questions are weighted

at half the value of use of adult materials, the net benefit picture

changes little. Only the Throgs Neck Branch moves from negative net

benefits to positive net benefits. The number of branches with net

benefits less than minus $100,000 drops from 26 to 24.

        The estimates of benefits and costs presented here indicate

that the New York Public Library operates many more branches than is

dictated by efficiency criteria; that is, the consumers of library

services in the city would probably be better off with fewer branches

with the savings used either to lower taxes or increase other aspects

of library services. Because the number of branches has grown since

1960 -(and an additional branch is planned), one might conclude that

efficiency has not been the operational criterion in the design of

this library system. Library systems in other older cities may also

be over branched, for example, in Chicago, Philadelphia, and San

Francisco.

        The analysis presented here could be improved in several ways,

First, the estimates of use would be more accurate if attendance

information were available for each location, even if only for sample

periods. Second, the valuation of service might be improved with more

detailed information about user travel time and costs in making

library trips.

                  HOW   MANY HOURS AND BOOKS?


        In the above exercise the hours of operation, books in stock,

and books added during the year are not taken into consideration.

Because these characteristics of public library service are also very

important budget items, it is appropriate to try to determine whether

they are provided at efficient levels. Of the three steps in an

efficiency calculation, the main emphasis here will be on determining

how use varies with differences in service——namely, the production

function.


Explaining Patterns of Use

        Three characteristics of library service are related to use:

the size of the stock, the number of additions to it during the last

year, and the number of hours the facility is open. The size of the

stock of materials in the library indicates the variety of materials

available. Presumably, the larger the stock, the more likely that a

user will find material of particular interest. Inforniation from the

branch libraries of the New York Public Library allows disaggreqation

of stock into adult and juvenile categories and book and nonbook

(mostly recordings) categories. However, paperback stock volumes are

not recorded for each facility. Therefore, the book stock figures

understate stock by the amount of paperbacks on hand. Further dis-

aggregation might be useful (for example, fiction and nonfiction), but

only if use information were similarly disaggregated.

        The number of materials added during the most recent year

indicates the currency of the material. Recently published materials,
                                                                         30




(for   example, best sellers) are more in demand than older materials.

Also, the library with a high volume of additions can respond to

changes in users' tastes more quickly than the branch with a low

volume of new materials, and should therefore be characterized by

a higher rate of use. Additions are disaggregated in the same way

as stock. No information about the addition of paperback books by

branch is available.

         Finally, the more hours the facility is open, the more

accessible are the materials and the less planning a user must do

in order to arrive when the library is open. The number of hours

per week is calculated by dividing the total number of hours of

service for the year by 52.

         In addition to the above three service characteristics, one

might also consider the proportion of staff that is professional.

A predominantly professional staff may be better able to respond to

reference questions than a nonprofessional staff, and may also play

a role in improving the selection and presentation of materials.

Libraries also sponsor programs, such as story hours, films, book

talks, and the like. If these are viewed as promotional activity

for the library, more programs might generate more library use.

However, the proportion of professional staff and the number of

programs offered appear to be secondary to stock, additions, and

hours as indications of library use, and preliminary statistical

investigations confirm this supposition. Also, because only 59

neighborhood libraries are available for observation, the cross—branch
                                                                         31




statistical study has limited power to make fine distinctions in

many dimensions. Therefore, these two secondary characteristics

have not been taken into account in this analysis.

        Library use can be disaggregated in several ways. The

characteristics of service may influence different types of use

differently. The most comonly observed indicator of use is circula-

tion outside the library. Cross—system studies must control for

differences in circulation caused by differences in the length of

the loan period and in renewal policy; renewals typically are counted

as additional circulations. By using branches within one system,

such variation does not arise. Circulation statistics are dis-

aggregated into adult and juvenile, book and nonbook categories,

as is the stock information. The circulation figures, however, include

the circulation of paperback materials, since library records do not

distinguish between hard cover and paperback circulation. It is

unfortunate that paperbacks are excluded from the stock figures

but included in the circulation figures.

        Circulation is only one component of library use; another is

reference questions. The New York Public Library records the number

of reference questions asked at each branch by adults and by juveniles

during sample periods. Reference questions might be further disaggreqated

according to the skill and effort required to answer them. Such dis-

tinctions demand careful definitions and increase the cost of gathering

the information. It is unusual for a library to keep detailed records
                                                                           32




 of reference questions, and this •study benefits by the quality of

 information from the New York Public.

         The third major component of library use entails the use of

 materials and facilities in the library. For example, Newbouse and

 Alexander [13J found that a substantial number of visitors to the

 Beverly Hills Public Library did not use any library materials, but

 simply used the facility as a study hall. Thus, an important category

of library use is not reflected in data on circulation and reference

questions. The simplest approach to monitoring in—library use would

be to collect attendance information at each location.      Sample surveys
might provide more detailed data on rates of use of materials in the

library. Because the New York Public Library does not maintain branch

attendance records, we are unable to explore how service characteristics

affect in-library use.

        In all, 12 measures of use are related to service characteris-

tics: total circulation (book plus nonbook), book circulation, record

circulation, and reference questions are each examined for adults,

juveniles, and all users (adult plus juvenile). In terms of adult

users, the stock and additions of adult materials are used as service

characteristics; in regard to juvenile users, the stock and additions

of juvenile materials are used. In examining the use of books, the

stock and additions of books are used as service characteristics;

for records, the stock and additions of records are used.     Thus, each

use is related to the most relevant feature of the service.

        In addition to the service characteristics specific to each

branch, the location of each library relative to others may influence
                                                                          33




use.     Forty—one of the 59 neighborhood branches are located within

one mile of another library facility. About one-sixth of neighbor-

hood branch users indicated they live within 10 blocks of the library

they use in a survey at 15 neighborhood branches. Library users do not

seem to be clustered near the library. Therefore, it seems approriatc

here to take explicit account of the spatial relationship among

branches. Hours of service is used as the most important service

feature    of competing branches. For each branch, the number of hours
of    service at every other branch is divided by the square of the

distance    between branches and summed.    In the case of a branch loc&ted

near other libraries offering many hours of service, the library

interaction variable will be large. Where other libraries are distint

and offer few hours of service, the library interaction variable will

be small. A significant negative coefficient on the library interucti'jr.

variable will indicate that the proximity of a competing branch tends

to reduce library use at particular locations.

           Library use is also determined by the tastes of people wh

live in the vicinity of the library. Berelsor. for exan;ple,citcs

several studies indicating that library use tends to increase with

income and decline with age [2]. Feldstein emphasizes the findino

that use increases with education [6]. Because income and education

are closely related, it is difficult to distinguish the two effects:

however, income is used here. Age distribution is measured in tenIn!

of the percent of total population enrolled in school below the

col   lege level
           In   addition, access to libraries nay be influenced by thc:

be better in a high—density area. People choosing to live in high—

density areas may have different tastes than individuals living in

low—density areas, even controlling for income and age distribution.

The use figures are not deflated by population, so one would expect

greater use in higher density areas. Other neighborhood population

factors which may influence library use include ethnicity, sex,

occupation, and length of employment. However, these characteristics

are thought to be secondary to population density, income, and school

enrollment, and preliminary statistical investigation confirms their

secondary role. Because the neighborhood characteristic variables may

reflect a constellation of neighborhood attributes, it is cltfficult

to predict the signs of the coefficients of these variables; thus,

two-tailed tests are applied.

          Information about the three neighborhood attribute variablc•s

are available for 1970 by census tract. With over 700 tracts in the

three   boroughs, there is no obvious way to match tracts to libraries;

the New York Public Library has approached the problem by definin

catchment areas for each branch using census tracts. Several catch-

ment   areas are defined for planned branches or for branches that have
been scaled down to station status. Some catchment areas, comprised
of several tracts, are quite large, while others are small.           Moreover,

the   assignment of tracts to branches         ultimately involves some arbitrary

decisions. Obviously, the residents of one tract may use several

different branches, depending on their location in the tract and their

preferences. Consequently, the catchment area notion is ignored here.
               Instead, the tract attributes are each weighted by the square

    of the distance to each branch and sunmied over all tracts. Each

    borough   is treated separately in this manlier. By squaring diStc                   t,
    the attributes of nearby tracts are heavily weiQhted, while the value
    of attributes of distant tracts drops rapidly toward zero. Distaicti

    library users might yield a more precise parameter value. Et SLn

        Three groups of variables are used as instruments. Each

 reflects an influence on library decisions other than the desire

 to meet the demands of users. The first group is the cost of space.

The cost of buying or leasing space for a library differs substantially

within the city, and more branches can be efficiently provided in low-

cost areas than in high-cost areas. Because no index of the cost of

space for small areas in the city is readily available, land use

information is used. The percent of land in residential use, and

the percent of land in high—density areas with residential, industrial,

and commercial use are entered as instruments relating to the cost

of space [9]. The land use zone characteristics are weighted by the

reciprocal of the squared distance to each library and summed.

Nineteen—seventy census tract data on the value of housing units and

contract rents is also used.

        The second group of variables reflects the fact that library

managers may be responsive to political pressures. The percent of

votes for Mayor Beam in the 1973 election is used as an indicator of

the political power of an area. This is, of course, a less—than—

perfect measure of political power. The percent of registrants voting

was used in preliminary investigations, but it proved no better than

the Beam vote variable. Political power is a subtle, shifting

attribute, and ethnic ties are often more important than geography.

Although the mayor may be less important than other political figures,

it nevertheless seems appropriate to include some measure of political

activity, no matter how primitive. The Beam vote variable is recorded
                                                                        37




for a random sample of 987 electoral districts, weighted by the

reciprocal of the square of the distance to each library, and summed.

        The third group of factors influencing library decisions con-

sists of lagged values of the variables. Branches are costly to move

or expand, and book stock is likely to expand to fill the available

space. Moreover, additions to stock and hours of service may tend

to follow past patterns. Thus, inertia in the design of the library

system is substantial; the current pattern of branches, stocks, and

hours is not likely to be modified instantly to respond to each

variation in use. Therefore the hours, stock, and additions in 1960

are included as predetermined variables and used as instruments in

estimating use relationships. In the case of 11 neighborhood branches

which were not open in 1960, zeros are entered. (Two of these branches

were closed for renovation in 1960.)

        The estimated use relationships are reported in Tables 4 through

7: Table 4 covers total circulation (bock and nonbook), Table 5 covers

book circulation, Table 6 record circulation, and Table 7 reference

questions. Each relationship is estimated for the 59 neighborhood

libraries. The regional branches and centers are excluded because

they may offer a wider assortment of services not reflected in the

service attributes measured. (In fact, results with regional libraries

or with centers do differ somewhat from those for neighborhood branches

alone.) An ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate and a two-stage

least squares (TSLS) estimate are reported for each relationship.

One—tailed tests are applied to the four library attributes: positive

coefficients are expected for stock, additions, and hours, while a

negative coefficient is expected for library interaction. Two-tailed
tests are applied to the other coefficients.

        The most dramatic result is the relationship between use and

hours of service; the amount of use of a library is very significantly

associated with the number of hours of service. Currently, the

neighborhood branches average just under 20 hours per week of service,

down from 39 hours in 1960. The association between use and hours

holds for both adult and juvenile materials, for books and records,

and for reference questions.

        Moreover, the result for hours persists in the two-stage

estimates, where, for the most part, the influence of the other

service attributes does not remain statistically significant. If

the two—stage estimates are interpreted as the more correct estimates

of user response, with the influence of library decisions purged by

the first stage, then consumers seem much mo.re responsive to changes

in hours than to other attributes of service.

        Stocks and additions also have statistically significant coeffi-

cients. Additions seem to be more important in relation to book circu-

lation, while the quantity in stock is a more important variable in

record use. Thus, it seems that books become obsolete faster than

records. Perhaps best sellers are more important to public library

patrons than are the largest selling records. The number of additions

also appears to be important for reference questions, since currency

 of materials is associated with use.

        Stock and additions do not appear to be significantly associated

 with use in the two—stage estimates, except for record circulation.

 In terms of book circulation and adult reference questions, the stock
                                                                       43




of materials and additions to stock do not appear to be significant

factors in use decisions. This lack of significance may be due to

the weakness of the instruments in explaining library decisions; two—

stage estimates are not as reliable as ordinary least squares.

       The library interaction variable has a statistically signifi-

cant negative coefficient in the total circulation and book circulation

and in the juvenile reference question ordinary least squares estimates.

The statistical significance of these coefficients reinforces the

finding that the existence of nearby branches tends to reduce the use

of a neighborhood library.

       The three neighborhood characteristic variables yield some

surprising results. First, population density shows a statistically

significant negative relationship with book and record use by adults

and no significant positive coefficient. Thus, the notion that

library use will be greater in higher density areas because of easier

access does not seem to hold. Rather, the tastes of people livinq

in high— and low—density areas differ: those living in low—density

areas appear to have a stronger preference for library services than

those living in high—density areas, with income held constant.

        Income has the expected positive coefficient for adult book

use, but a surprising negative coefficient for juvenile book use.

Since juvenile books are relatively inexpensive, perhaps higher-income

households buy more juvenile books than low-income households and rely

on the library to obtain the more expensive adult books.

        The percent of population enrolled in school has an unexpected

negative coefficient for adUlt book use and no other significant
                                                                         44




coefficients. Because school enrollment is closely related to the

number of young persons living in an area, and because library use

is generally thought to decline with age, a positive sign would be

expected. The negative coefficient indicates that adult book use

is greater where there are fewer children.

        The overall statistical power of the relationships -is

significant in all cases except the two-stage results for juvenile

book use and for reference questions. The library service charac-

teristics are strongly associated with library use in expected ways.

The neighborhood characteristics also help explain library use, but in

somewhat surprising ways. The two-stage results, while generally weaker

than the ordinary least squares, emphasize the importance of hours of

service as a determinant of patterns of use.


Efficient Operations

         Using these careful estimates of relationships between library

service characteristics and use, it is now possible to determine service

efficiency in terms of hours, stock,and additions. The marginal costs

of each activity were reported in Table 2. The marginal benefits of an

additional unit of each activity are calculated in Table 8. The co-

efficients of the regressions in Table 4 and 7 are estimates of how

use will respond to an increment in a particular library activity,

other things equal. By weighting circulation by 1.183 to account

for in—library use and adding reference questions one arrives at an

estimate of the total increase in library use associated with one

more unit of activity. Marginal use figures are reported in column

(b) of Table 8. Thus an additional hour of     service   is associated

with 11,392 more uses of the library using the ordinary least squares

results, 14,475 using the two—stage results. Because the coefficients

are subject to statistical error, it is appropriate to report a 90

percent confidence interval for the associated difference in use. The

90 percent confidence intervals are reported in column (c).

         By dividing the marginal cost of an activity, say an additional

hour of service, by the expected increase in use resulting, one can

estimate the marginal cost of increasing library use in different ways,

as reported in columns (d) and Ce) of Table 8. The ordinary least

squares estimates indicate that an additional library use could be

generated for each $.19 spent in expanding hours. Spendinq $3.12 in

expanding the size of the book stock at a branch will be expected to

increase library use by 1. Spending an additional $.94 for new

materials would expand library use by one.

         An efficiently designed library system would expand each

activity as long as the marginal benefit of an extra unit of the

activity--for example, an extra hour of service--exceeds the cost of

providing the extra unit.   If the cost of an extra unit of the

activity exceeds the benefit derived, then consumers would he better

off with the savings in tax dollars or expenditure on a more productive

item, and that activity should be cut back. As an activity is expanded,

we expect that less benefit will be derived from each additional unit.

As an activity is reduced, we expect each additional unit of cutback

to have a larger impact on benefits. Thus, the estimates of marginal

benefits presented here reflect the marginal values of current levels

of library activities. The marginal benefits will differ at different

levels of activity.
                                                                          47




          The average benefit of a library use at the 59 neighborhood

 libraries presented in Table 3 is $1.32, although there is substantial

 variation among the branches. The marginal benefit of an additional

 unit of activity can be compared with the marginal cost of the activity

either by comparing the marginal cost per use of columns (d) and (e)

with the value of benefits, $1.32, or by multiplying the estimated

changes in use, columns (b) and (c) and comparing with marginal cost

of the activity, column (a).

         The marginal benefit of an additional hour of service each

week substantially exceeds the assumed niarginal cost.   Using either

the ordinary least squares or two—stage estimates, the point estimates

or the 90 percent confidence intervals, the marginal gains from additional

hours substantially exceed the marginal cost. The average of 20 hours

per week offered at the 59 neighborhood branches of the New York Public

Library is too low for efficiency. Expanded hours of service would

generate substantial increase in library use worth more to consumers

than the costs of the expanded service.

         The marginal benefits of maintaining more volumes in stock

is less than the marginal benefits derived. Thus, on average the

neighborhood branches of the New York Public Library seem to be too

large for efficiency. Because the biggest impact of stock on use

seems to be for recordings, it may be that nlaintainiriq a larger

stock of recordings is justified.

         The acquisition of new materials seems to have benefits that

exceed costs, at least for the point estimates. Thus, while the

evidence is not as clear as for hours, there does seem to be a case
                                                                           48




for acquiring more new materials. New materials seem to generate use

worth more than their cost.


                  FEWER BRANCHES OPERATING MORE HOURS


         Overall, then, there seems to be too many branches operating

too few hours, buying somewhat too few new materials, but maintaining

a stock of materials that may be somewhat too large. The evidence for

the number of branches and the number of hours of service is quite

clear, the evidence on stocks and new materials is less clear. Because

the current mix of library activities favors extra branches rather than

more hours of service, it is not possible to say whether the current

budget is at the right level or not. The important finding is that an

efficient library design would have fewer branches and operate more

hours per week.

         The influence of a hypothetical reallocation of budget to

fewer branches operating longer hours can be estimated using the

information developed above. The first step is closing branches.

For the sake of the exercise, suppose that the seven branches with

benefits at least $175,000 less than costs were closed. None of the

seven are next to each other.5 The closings would lead to an annual

cost savings of $1.9 million dollars including the rental value of the

space. With the branches closed, some of the library use would shift

to remaining branches. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume

that all the use shifts to nearby branches.     In addition, some of the

branches that are closed may have been nearest to some remaining

branches. The best alternative for these remaining branches will now
                                                                          49




 be a more distant branch. Consequently, the value of library services

 at the next nearest branches will be greater.

          The second step of this exercise is to assume that the cost

 saving from closing the seven branches is used to increase the hours

of service at the remaining 69 facilities in the system. At $2,317

per hour, the $1.9 million made available by closing the seven branches

will buy 11.9 hours each week for each remaining facility in the system.

If each hour added 14,475 uses as suggested by the two—stage point

estimates, the use of each branch would be expected to increase by

more than 172,000.

         The costs and benefits of each branch if 7 neighborhood

branches were closed and the funds reallocated to longer hours are

reported in Table 9. Of the remaining 53 neighborhood branches, only

4 have negative net benefits following the branch closinqs and expansion

of hours. The assumption that the hours would be expanded the same at

every facility is perhaps overly simple. Theassumpticn that each

additional hour will have the same impact in increasinq use as the

estimate of the first hour may be too strong. Nevertheless, the change

in the efficiency of the operation--in the quality of service given

the budget--is striking. Of course, the changes will make people in

areas where branches are closed travel farther to get library services,

and so they can be expected to oppose the shift. On the other hand,

perhaps a branch system with fewer branches should have locations

different than the current locations. The relocation of branches

is not examined here.

Note: Closing 7 facilities allows $1.9 million in expenditure to be dis-

tributed over the remaining 69 facilities, adding 11.9 hot rs of service at

each attracting 172,014 addition uses. The use of the closed branches are

reassigned to nearby branches, and the distances to the nearest branch

is changed with the closings.    (a) not applicable.

                        A POLICY PERSPECTIVE


         The above findings may be difficult to convert into policy.

The political process shapes library expenditure patterns, and

efficiency considerations may not dominate the political scene.

First, the political process recognizes the history of the institutfdh

and the possibility of seemingly irreversible changes. Second, equity

consideration may play some role. Third, federal policy may have some

impact on local choices. Fourth, the political process may be simply

imperfect.

         The current operation of the New York Public Library reflects

the severe budget cutbacks of the l7O'5. Instead of cutting back

both hours and branches in an effort to retain an efficient mix, the

Library has cut back hours severely while retaining almost all branches.

Cutting back hours has been politically easier than closing branches.

In January, 1976 the Library announced the planned closing of B branches

as a way of coping with budget cuts. The announcement of closings

created a substantial political reaction that prevented closings.

Neighborhood citizen groups coalesced around the preservation of

individual branches. While reductions in hours might be seen as temporary,

the closing of branches may have been seen as permanent. Rather than

accept the budget cuts as permanent, the political friends of the

Library may have viewed cutting hours as a way of preservino the option

of restoring former service levels.

         On the other hand, the Library had been expanding the Library

system into the 1970's. In 1960, 48 of the present 59 neighborhood
                                                                          53




 branches were operating and two others were closed for renovation.

 Thus, the number of neighborhood branches has
                                                 grown by more than 15

 percent over the last 20 years. Of the nine new neighborhood

 branches, six have opened since 1970. While the opening of new

 branches may have been an appropriate response to the changing

 location of library use, it may be that older branches should have

 been closed at the same time.

          In 1960 neighborhood branches were open an average of 39 hours

each week. Other urban library systems currently average in excess

of 40 hours per week at branch locations.    In 1970, however, the

neighborhood libraries in New York averaged 48 hours of service per

week, an above average number. The substantial growth in branch

library activity during the 1960's, even as library use began to

decline (it peaked in 1964), did not put the Library in a very good

position to deal with the budget cut; in the 1970's.

         Equity considerations may also play a role in shaping political

support for the Library. Public library services are sometimes dis-

cussed in terms of their value for poor people. At the turn of the

century and again during the Great Depression, the public library

provided recreation without charge and offered access to learning

for adults eager to better themselves. Evidence of the distributional

consequences of library activities is not overwhelming, however.

         If the net effect of the local
                                          government's library expendi-
tures is to improve the relative position of poor people, then the

beneficiaries of the services must have lower incomes on average than

people who bear the burden of the taxes used to pay for the services.
                                                                          54




 The question of the incidence of the taxes used to pay for the library

 is not simple. Currently, over a quarter of the employees of the

 branch libraries of the New York Public Library are paid with federal

 Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) funds. Presumably,

general revenue—sharing funds also have an impact. Federal revenue

sources are moderately progressive. The ihare of library revenues

accounted for by local tax sources may be less than 50 percent. The

most important local tax is the property tax. Recent literature on

the property tax indicates that it may be capitalized into land values

or borne by the owners of capital. Therefore, the property tax is

likely, except for administrative deviation, to be somewhat progressive.

Those individuals earning higher incomes piy relatively more in taxes

supporting local services than those earning lower incomes.

         The beneficiaries of the service also seem to be disproportionate-

ly higher income earners.     In particular, we find that adult use of the

library is greater in areas with higher—income residents, whereas the

use of juvenile materials seems greater in lower—income areas. Use as

reflected by reference questions appears to be unrelated to income.

Because the use of juvenile materials accounts for less than 30 percent

of total use, the aggregate effect seems to be that higher income

households use the library more than lower income households. This

finding is generally in conformance with those of other studies,

although the others do not differentiate between adult and juvenile

use. Because the income variable is a distance-weighted index of

census tract information, the coefficients cannot be used to calculate

income elasticities of use.
                                                                            55




           If both the sources of finance and the use of the library are

 dlsproportionateiy represented among higher-income groups, it Is pos-
 sible that local expenditure on
                                   public library services is distributionally
 neutral. However, since neither the distribution of those who finance

 libraries nor the distribution of those who benefit from library

 services is very carefully observed, no firm conclusion about distri-

 butional consequences can be made.

          Note, however, that just because the beneficiaries tend to

 have higher incomes or the services
                                       are distributionally neutral, this
 does not mean that the services should
                                          not be performed in the public
 sector. Even though not all citizens use the library, it may still

have characteristics that make it
                                    substantially public in character,

justifying its support by general taxes. That library users gain by

library expenditure relative to nonusers does not in itself prove an

inequity in the fiscal system. Nonusers
                                           may value the option of using
the library, and so the
                          apparent inequity may overstate the underlyinq
welfare effect. Moreover, the important equity result is the net effect

of the full fiscal system. Nonusers
                                       may gain disproportionately from
other government services. The important equity result is that for

the full fiscal system; there is no reason why each service matched

with its source of finance should be
                                       distributionally neutral or
progressive. Finally, the net benefit of services may be capitalized

into land values.

        Since in—library use has not been observed, we do not know

the distributional gains from such use. Is in—library use greater
                                                                        56




among lower—income groups? A better understanding of the distributional

consequences of library activity requires more information on in-library

use, particularly attendance data by branch.

         Suppose that we accept the view that library services are

distributionally advantageous. Suppose, too, that library services

are used effectively by poor people, especially children, and that

library use improves school performance and literacy levels, and is an

important vehicle for social advancement by low-income urban families.

(Note that each of these claims is unproven and indeed difficult to

prove; the important issue is the effectiveness of libraries relative

to other expenditures.) How would public library services best be

provided to low-income households? The very substantial response of

use of all kinds to the number of hours of service suggests that even

low-income households respond to the number of hours. The htgh density

of branches in low—income areas of the city, on the other hand, does

not appear to have generated very high levels of use. It seems likely

that the results of this study may also apply to library use by low-

income persons; that is, low—income library users, like the average

user, might be better served by longer hours in fewer larger branches.

Low—income families may also value their time at lower rates than high-

income families. Thus, it is not obvious why library services should

be characterized by more branches and fewer hours of service in

consideration of equity.

         The combination of more branches and fewer hours of service

may also be explained by the political environment that shapes the

library system. Perhaps public library service is quite local relative
                                                                               57




   to the size of the city. The
                                    benefits of service in a particular
   location may be concentrated
                                  in a small area, while the costs of
  providing the branch service are
                                      widely diffused. Neighborhood
  demands for services
                          may be made with little concern for
                                                                costs; in
  effect, there may be a frne rider
                                       among neighborhoo, with weak
  central control. This hypothesis
                                       represents a substantial simpli-
  fication of a complex historical
                                      process which deserves more careful
  study. The point is that distributional
                                              impact across neighborhoods
 may play some political role.

           Federal policy may have some impact on Library decisions.

 As already noted, over 25
                           percent of Library employees are federally
 financed CETA workers. President
                                   Carter has proposed new restrictions
 on CETA funds that would
                          prevent professional librarians
                                                          being employed
 with CETA funds. The central
                               fact is that a substantial part of
 Library operations are contingent
                                      on the availability of federal
 CETA funds. In the
                      present setting funding cuts lead to cuts in
 hours.


          Federal grants are also
                                     supporting the construction of a
new branch. While public works
                                   projects may be an appropriate
                                                                    response
to high levels of unemployment
                                  in the city, the further expansion of
library branches in a system
                               already overburdened with too many
branches is of questionable
                              value. The operating costs of the new
facility may force the further cutback
                                          in hours in other facilities.
Six new branches in the
                          Queens Borough Public Library, a separate

system, remain unopened for lack of operating funds.
                                                                        58




         Finally, one must question whether the political constraints

on the Library that have prevented a more rational response to budget

cuts are perfectable. Presumably library users who live near branches

that would be closed would be made worse off by the closing. At least

those who have flexible enough schedules to be able to use the facili-

ty when it happens to be open may be worse off. Are such the dominant

force in shaping the library services? Or is the tactic of preserving

locations at the cost of low levels of operation throughout the system

one that will yield more funds for libraries over some longer term?

Perhaps better information about Library operations will improve the

political outcome.


                          FURTHER RESEARCH


         This essay may set the stage for additional efforts to under-

stand efficiency in public libraries. The library use relationships

might be estimated with different functional forms. They might also be

explored overtime in an effort to discover why use began to fall perhaps

a decade before services were cut. The lack of annual demographic

information may hamper this inquiry. Finally, a study of individual

users might refine the estimated relationships presented here.

    1An earlier version
                          of this essay appeared as Working Paper #55
  of the Joint Center for Urban Studies of the Massachusetts Institute

 of Technology and Harvard University.
                                               Coments received at the
 Joint Center, at Yale, and at Vanderbilt have been helpful in making

 revisions.    I would like to thank Richard
                                                  Couper, John Cory, and
 Edwin Holmgren of the New York Public
                                              Library for their help with
 this study.

      recruit professional librarian has an annual salary of about

 $11,220 and works a 35 hour week.         Fringe benefits are about 30 percent

 of base salary. These figures imply a recruit librarian costs about

 $8 per hour. $44.56
                       per hour of library service suggests that the
 observed marginal costs of additional
                                             hours of public service are
 well above the extra cost of
                                 an additional librarian for a single hour.
  3The relationship between stock and cost can be explored
                                                                     by relating
costs to square feet and square feet to stock. The number of
                                                             square
feet in a facility are
                       regressed on the stock of materials:
  Square Feet =    6633.29 +      0.029 juvenile stock + 0.024 adult stock

                     (3.647) (0.187)                       (0.233)
                             +   2.200 record stock      R—squared=O.07 n=59

                                 (2.192)

Among the neighborhood branches, there seems to be little relationship

between the stock and space. For the whole system, the relationship

is stronger. The number of square feet in the facility are related

to maintenance and security costs:
                                                                        60




 Maintenance Cost =   5249.0   +   $1.29 square feet R—squared = 0.70

                        (4.554) (11.80)               n = 59

The marginal maintenance cost of $1.29 per square foot plus the

approximate annual lease value of $5 per square foot suggests an

annual space charge of $6.29 per square foot. Because the link

between stock and space seems so weak among neighborhood branches

it is not possible to relate the estimated space costs to the stock

cost.

  4The average cost for an adult hardback book including library

discounts was $7.09; for a juvenile hardback the average price was

$4.16. The average price for an adult paperback was $1.98 and for a

juvenile paperback $1.26. About 28 percent of library acquisitions

are paperback. Processing including ordering and cataloging adds an

average of 34 percent to the cost of the materials.    The processing

costs on paperbacks are much lower than for hardbacks. These figures

confirm the estimate of $7.31 for the average new addition to stock.

  5The seven marginal branches are: Mott Haven, West Farms, Woodstock.

and Francis X. Martin Regional in the Bronx, and 125th Street, Seward

Park, and George Bruce in Manhattan.
