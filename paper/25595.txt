                                         ABSTRACT

Science parks play a growing in knowledge-based economies by accommodating high-tech firms
and providing an environment that fosters location-dependent knowledge spillovers and promote
R&D investments by firms. Yet, not much is known about the economic conditions under which
such entities may form in equilibrium without government interventions. This paper develops a
spatial equilibrium model with a competitive final sector and a monopolistic competitive
intermediate sector, which allows us to determine necessary and sufficient conditions for a
science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome. We show that strong localized knowledge
spillovers, high startup costs, skilled labor abundance, or low commuting costs make intermediate
firms more likely to cluster and a science park more likely to form. We also show that the
productivity of the final sector is highest when intermediate firms cluster. As the decay penalty,
firms' startup and workers' commuting costs become lower, science parks will eventually be
fragmented.

1         Introduction
The concept of science park seems to have gained the favor of many analysts and policy-
makers (see, e.g., Katz and Bradley, 2013). Even though the idea of industrial district has
been around for a long time (Marshall, 1890, ch. X), it was not until the 1980s that the
related concept of science park has been developed (Castells and Hall, 1994; Saxenian, 1994).
As emphasized by Saxenian (1994, pp. 32-33 and 118-119), many …rms (such as those in the
Information and Communications Technology, or in short ICT, industry) clustering in the
Silicon Valley produce high-tech intermediate goods and make big R&D investments, which
are bene…cial to all …rms because ideas and knowledge can be transferred more quickly and
seamlessly through various channels.1
        There is a rich variety of science parks, which is well illustrated by the many histories of
parks. However, a science park is always associated with the development of a geographic
area which is primarily designed (i) to accommodate high-tech …rms, including particularly
interrelated intermediate …rms at various production stages, (ii) to provide an environment
that fosters location-dependent knowledge spillovers, and (iii) to encourage R&D invest-
ments by …rms, while researchers and high-skilled workers can be drawn from nearby uni-
versities/research institutes. A science park also o¤ers an urban environment to its workers,
including housing, retail, restaurants and other leisure facilities (Katz and Bradley, 2013).
Using urban economic theory, we may view a science park as a monocentric city whose cen-
ter is determined endogenously by the interaction between multiple stakeholders through the
above-mentioned channels. Thus, there are both demand and supply forces at work in the
formation of a science park.
        Despite the importance of science parks in the real world (see, e.g., Link and Scott,
2003, for documenting the historical growth of U.S. science parks), it is fair to say that
this concept has attracted little attention in economic theory (Link and Scott, 2007). This is
where we hope to contribute by providing a full-‡edged general equilibrium model that allows
us to determine under which conditions a science park emerges as a decentralized equilibrium
outcome. It is our hope that our setting will contribute to a better understanding of the
formation of science parks and will allow for a more precise quanti…cation of their economic
consequences and a better evaluation of relevant policies.
        To achieve our goal, we develop a model that captures the following basic features: (i) a

(2010), as well as critical reviews by Audretsch and Feldman (2004) and Carlino and Kerr (2015).

composite consumption good is produced by using production-line designers and an endoge-
nous range of inputs provided by intermediate …rms; (ii) workers are hired to produce inter-
mediate goods or to conduct R&D in the intermediate sector; (iii) the productivity of inter-
mediate …rms may be enhanced by R&D investments and inter-…rm spillovers, the intensity
of which depends on how intermediate …rms are distributed across space; and (iv) workers
and intermediate …rms are spatially mobile. Firms’R&D investments and the existence of
knowledge spillovers determine the agglomeration force. On the other hand, the clustering
of …rms increases the average commuting distance of workers which, in turn, gives rise to
higher wages and land rent in the residential area surrounding the cluster. Such high wages
and land rents act as a dispersion force. The equilibrium distribution of …rms and workers is
determined as the balance between these two opposite forces.
    The main tenet of this paper is that the emergence and e¢ ciency of a science park is
intimately related to the spatial structure of the area that hosts it. More speci…cally, we view
a science park as a spatial cluster formed by …rms which interact to determine endogenously
the intensity of knowledge spillovers. Such a city structure accommodates the largest num-
ber of researchers and the highest level of R&D. Recall that the clustering of …rms is also
associated with other agglomeration economies, such as a large pool of high-skilled and spe-
cialized workers and the provision of knowledge-intensive business services and sophisticated
infrastructures, which enhances …rms’productivity.2 To understand better how these various
forces interact to give rise to a science park, we consider the other extreme of the spectrum,
i.e., a city where activities are dispersed across locations and the level of R&D is low. In
this paper, we determine the conditions under which a city with or without a science park is
formed.
       Our main results may be summarized as follows. We begin by identifying necessary and
su¢ cient conditions for a science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome. These con-
ditions show that the e¢ ciency of both the intermediate and …nal sectors varies with the
spatial distribution of …rms and workers. This in turn will allow us to uncover the reasons
explaining why science parks may or may not be formed. In particular, we identify three key
rationales for …rms to have incentives for clustering in a science park: (i) location-dependent
knowledge decays, (ii) costly startup, and (iii) skilled labor abundance. These are all typical
features of new high-tech industries that make a science park, which accommodates more
intermediate …rms and fosters research activities, more likely to emerge. This may explain

(2015).


                                                    2
why …rms bearing high innovation costs are often clustered in science parks such as the Sili-
con Valley, the Hsinchu Science-Based Industrial Park in Taiwan or the Cambridge Science
Park in the U.K. (Saxenian, 1994; Chen, 2008; Helmers, 2019). A science park is also more
likely to emerge when spillovers are strongly localized. Thus, unlike what some analysts and
development agencies believe, simple cluster policies are not su¢ cient for a science park or a
local innovative system to develop (see Duranton et al., 2010, for a critical appraisal of such
policies).
  Even though our model is static, it captures an important dynamic feature which is worth
emphasizing. Indeed, knowledge spillovers being crucial in the formation of science parks,
our results suggest that knowledge-based economies are likely to be those in which these
parks emerge. However, knowledge spillovers are both local and global in scope. Beyond
a certain threshold the role of distance becomes secondary, as the most innovative …rms
are increasingly combining their local knowledge potential with a high level of international
connectivity associated with the development of new communication devices. In this case,
we may expect cities with a more dispersed pattern of innovation to emerge. When such
developments are not strong enough, science parks would remain to be centralized.
   Related literature. A handful of related models have been developed in urban eco-
nomics. Their common aim is to explain the emergence of business centers within cities.
They include O’Hara (1977), Ogawa and Fujita (1980), Fujita and Ogawa (1982), Berliant et
al. (2002), and Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002). However, these models focus on gravity-
like reduced forms in which knowledge spillovers and/or spatial externalities are mechan-
ically presumed. They ignore …rms’ R&D policies and the supply of intermediate inputs
and knowledge-intensive business services, which a¤ect the overall productivity of …rms. Al-
though spatial externalities have attracted a lot of attention in urban economics (see Carlino
and Kerr, 2015, for a survey), we are not aware of a microeconomic model developed to
investigate how spatial externalities emerge from intentional …rms’R&D and location deci-
sions. Our paper may thus be viewed as an attempt to penetrate the black box of spatial
externalities in a setting that take …rms’behavior as the driving force.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The model is presented in Section 2,
while Section 3 describes the optimizing conditions of the di¤erent groups of agents. Our
equilibrium concept is de…ned in Section 4. The necessary and su¢ cient conditions for a
science park to emerge are derived and its properties are characterized in Section 5. Section 6
concludes.



                                              3
2     The model
We consider a small open economy, which consists of (i) a featureless one-dimensional space
Z, (ii) two sectors, one producing the …nal good and the other producing intermediate inputs,
and (iii) three production factors, i.e., land, capital and labor. The economy is populated by
a continuum H of workers. Land is owned by absentee landlords. Without loss of generality,
the land density and the opportunity cost of land are normalized to one.
    Workers are used to enhance the e¢ ciency of the intermediate sector by performing the
following three tasks: (i) to undertake …rm-speci…c R&D, (ii) to design the production line
in the …nal sector, and (iii) to produce intermediate goods. A unit mass of …rms produce the
…nal good, which is homogeneous and sold to the larger economy at a given price; this good
is chosen as the numéraire. Intermediate …rms and workers are mobile and consume a …xed
amount of land normalized to one. The …nal and intermediate goods are shipped within
the city at no costs, thus implying that the prices of intermediate goods are independent
of where intermediate and …nal producers are located. Dealing with shipping costs is fairly
straightforward and does not add much to our results. Since our focus is on the intermediate
sector, it is convenient to assume that the …nal producers are located and do not consume
land.
   Apart from land, workers consume only the …nal good. Each worker is endowed with one
unit of labor that she supplies inelastically. Commuting costs are crucial for the city shape.
Commuting between the residence y 2 Z and workplace z 2 Z requires t jy        zj units of the
numéraire., where t > 0 measures the unit commuting cost..


2.1    The spatial structure of the economy
In this paper, we focus on the following two con…gurations.

(i) The agglomerated con…guration (denoted j = A) features a science park where all …rms
     are clustered, which is ‡anked by two residential areas.

(ii) The dispersed con…guration (denoted j = D) features workers and intermediate …rms
      that cohabit at each location. Firms and workers are uniformly distributed across the
      city. We refer to such a con…guration as a ‡at city.

    Since each worker and each …rm consumes one unit of land, the total demand for land is
equal to N + H where N is the exogenously given mass of intermediate …rms. Therefore, the

                                              4
city is given by the interval
                                           N +H N +H
                                   Z=          ;     ;
                                             2    2
which implies that the city size varies with the mass of intermediate …rms. As will be seen,
the spatial extent of a high-tech city depends on the way the intermediate sector is spatially
organized.
   (i) In the agglomerated con…guration, there are N intermediate producers who are uni-
formly distributed within the science park whose spatial extend is given by

                                      ZAF = [ N=2; N=2] ;

with density hFA = 1. Workers are uniformly distributed over the residential area

                                      N +H       N   N N +H
                           ZAW =           ;       [   ;
                                        2        2   2   2

with density hW
              A = 1.
   (ii) In the dispersed con…guration, there are ND intermediate …rms while both the …rm
and worker densities are uniform across the city. Since the total demand for land is N + H,
the worker density is equal to hW                                        F
                                D = H=(N + H), while the …rm density is hD = N=(N + H).




2.2    The intermediate sector
The intermediate sector supplies a range of di¤erentiated inputs produced under monop-
olistic competition and constant returns, using both labor and land. The productivity of
intermediate …rms is also a¤ected by a spatial externality according to details that will be
made clear below. Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between …rms and intermediate
goods, we can use i 2 [0; N ] to describe an intermediate good and its producer.
   Consider a …rm located at z 2 Z and producing good i 2 [0; N ] by using one unit of land,
K(i; z) units of capital, and L(i; z) units of labor. Under the con…guration j, …rm i produces
the quantity xj (i; z) of good i at location z according to a Cobb-Douglas technology:

                            x(i; z) = Aj (i; z)K(i; z) L(i; z) l1                         (1)

with   2 (0; 1     ) and l = 1.
   Two remarks are in order. First, ignoring Aj (i; z), the production function displays con-
stant returns with respect to all private inputs, labor, capital and land. Second, the total


                                                5
factor productivity (TFP) of an intermediate …rm, Aj , is given by a Cobb-Douglas aggrega-
tor of the …rm’s R&D employment R(i; z) and a spatial externality RSj (z) that combines a
Romer-Lucas external e¤ect weighted by a spatial decay function:

                                    Aj (i; z) = [R(i; z)] [RSj (z)]1 ;                               (2)

where R is the mass of workers involved in R&D activities, while             2 (0; 1). Our de…nition of
the TFP captures Romer’s idea that externalities enter the system through an aggregator of
individual …rms’decisions, while …rm i’s TFP is also in‡uenced by this …rm’s R&D policy.
   One of the distinctive features of our setting is that a …rm’s TFP is endogenized through
the following three channels: (i) the number of researchers hired to conduct R&D in each …rm,
(ii) the total number of researchers working the economy, and (iii) the spatial distribution of
…rms/researchers. This modeling strategy is consistent with the idea that spillovers increase
the level and productivity of R&D investments (Aghion and Jaravel, 2015; Helmers, 2019). It
is also in line with Chyi et al. (2012) who …nd that knowledge spillovers are especially strong
across intermediate …rms located in science parks. That said, it is worth stressing that what
distinguishes a science park from a conventional city center is the presence of the endogenous
R&D shifter R R1 in (2). In this context, the e¢ ciency of an intermediate …rm depends on
its level of R&D activities, as well as on the total mass of researchers whose productivity rises
with their number (this was highlighted by Romer, 1986, and Lucas, 1988). While the urban
economics literature highlights the existence of various types of agglomeration economies, the
impact of the spatial structure on the endogenous R&D shifter R R1 is often overlooked
although its importance is stressed by empirical evidence (e.g., Siegel et al., 2003).
       In (2), the spatial externality is generated by both the size of the researcher pool in
the intermediate sector (R) and the spatial distribution of intermediate …rms (Sj ). More
speci…cally, the inter…m spillover e¤ect is de…ned by the following expression (Berliant et al.,
2002):3
                                                               2
                                    Sj (z)     Smax     (z   j)    " 2j ;                            (3)
where Smax > 0 is assumed to be su¢ ciently high for the function Sj to be positive over the
whole city, while " > 0 measures the distance-decay e¤ect generated by the dispersion of
…rms. Under the con…guration j,           j   denotes the mean of the distribution of …rms over ZjF :
                                                    Z
                                                j =     zhFj dz;
                                                      ZjF

   3
       Ogawa and Fujita (1980) work with spillovers linear in distance, while Fujita and Ogawa (1982) and
Lucas and Rossi-Hansberg (2002) follow a similar approach but use an exponential distance-decay function.


                                                       6
while   j   is the absolute dispersion given by
                                             Z
                                           2
                                      j =        z             j   hFj dz:
                                          Nj ZjF

   The speci…cation (3) satis…es the following desirable properties: (i) Sj is consistent with
the idea that the intensity of spillovers varies with the …rm’s location and the whole distrib-
ution of …rms, (ii) Sj is allowed to decrease at an increasing rate with the overall dispersion
of intermediate …rms, and (iii) the more concentrated …rms are, the more e¤ective knowledge
spillovers will be.
    Since we will focus on symmetric …rm distributions, we set                     j   = 0 for j = A; D. In the
case of an agglomerated con…guration (j = A), we have
                                          Z
                                        4 b         N
                                   A =       zdz = :                                                        (4)
                                        N 0         2
Under a dispersed con…guration (j = D), it is readily veri…ed that the absolute dispersion is
given by
                                         Z   H+N
                                     4        2      N        H +N
                               D   =                    zdz =      :                                        (5)
                                     N   0         H +N         2
   The expressions (4)-(5) imply that the intensity of the spillover e¤ect changes with the
spatial organization of the intermediate sector in a nontrivial way. Indeed, the mass of
intermediate …rms a¤ects the value of the dispersion index, which in turn a¤ects …rms’
behavior.
   With these, we are able to write out the expression Sj for each con…guration for any given

   While Sj (z) is decreasing in knowledge decay " for j = A; D, the e¤ect of Nj on Sj (z)
depends on the con…guration j. In the case of an agglomerated con…guration, SA (z) is
independent of the mass H of workers. However, in the case of a dispersed con…guration, a
higher H lowers SD (z) for all locations because the intensity of the knowledge decay e¤ect
rises with the city size.
    Finally, to operate an intermediate …rm must incur a startup cost which is proportional
to the average capital invested in the local economy, i.e., F f K=N where f > 0 measures

                                                       7
the magnitude of the startup cost and K the total amount of capital invested in the area
when the rate of return is .
   In sum, the e¢ ciency of the intermediate and …nal sectors is herein endogenized through
the R&D activities undertaken by intermediate …rms and the size of the researcher pool, which
both vary with the spatial con…guration adopted by …rms and workers.
   Because workers bear commuting costs, the equilibrium wage rate wj (z) is location-
speci…c. The immobility of land implies that the land rent rj (z) is also location-speci…c.
By contrast, the capital rental is determined in the larger economy and constant across
all locations. Taking wages and land rents as given, …rm i chooses its location, output price,
capital input, and the numbers of workers allocated to its production and R&D activities to
maximize pro…ts:

           j (i; z)   = pj (i; z)xj (i; z)         K(i; z)       wj (z) [R(i; z) + L(i; z)]       rj (z)   F:   (6)


2.3      The …nal sector
The …nal sector consists of a unit mass of identical and perfectly competitive producers.
Firms belong to absentee shareholders. Under a quasi-concave technology, they produce
a homogeneous composite good consumed by workers or traded in the larger economy in
exchange of other consumption goods, using intermediate goods. Following Becker and Mur-
phy (1992), we acknowledge that combining new and specialized inputs limits the division of
labor within the …nal sector. More speci…cally, we assume that (i) …nal producers must hire
designers whose job is to coordinate the use of a large number N of intermediate goods in the
production process and (ii) the number of designers rises with the number of intermediates.
In this model, this is done by assuming that the …nal sector also employs

                                                      M=          jN                                            (7)

workers, where        j   > 0 is the production-line designer requirement needed to use one addi-
tional intermediate input under the con…guration j. Since coordination costs typically rise
with the dispersion of intermediate …rms, we …nd it natural to assume that A < D .
   For any given N , the production function of a …nal producer is as follows (Peng et al.,
2006):
                                Z     N              Z   N                    Z   N           2
                                                                   2
                          Y =              [x(i)] di
                                          x(i)di              x(i)di ;                    (8)
                                  0   2 0              2 0
   The parameters in this expression are such that > 0, > 0 and              < where the
inequality must hold for the production function to be concave. To illustrate the role of N ,

                                                             8
suppose that the …nal sector uses a total mass of N x of intermediate goods. If the use of
intermediate inputs is uniform over [0; q] and zero on (q; N ], then the density on [0; q] is
N x=q. Expression (8) evaluated for this consumption pattern is

                               Y (q) = N x              N 2 x2       N 2 x2 ;                 (9)
                                                   2q            2

which is strictly increasing in q since   > 0. Hence, regardless of the values of x and N , (9) is
maximized at q = N where input variety is maximal. We may thus conclude that the output
of the …nal sector is higher when production involves a higher number of intermediate inputs.
In (8),    expresses the intensity of production for the intermediate goods. Our production
function exhibits enough ‡exibility to account for fairly contrasted patterns of intermediate
goods since, for a given value of , these goods are substitutes (resp., complements) when >
0 (resp.,    < < 0). Note that the input variety e¤ect is stronger when the intermediate
inputs are complements, rather than substitutes, because the third term in the right hand
side (9) is now positive. The production function (8) has additional features that are suitable
to this study: (i) it allows for variable markups incurred by intermediate producers and (ii) it
yields analytically solvable input demands and intermediate goods prices.
   Taking both the wage rates and the prices of intermediate goods as given, the …nal sector
…rms located at z = 0 maximize pro…ts given by
                                   Z N
                           j = Y        pj (i)x(i)di             wj (0) j N;
                                          0

subject to (8). Note that wj (0) j N has the nature of an endogenous …xed cost, which depends
on the mass of intermediate goods.


2.4       Workers
Each worker chooses her residential site y and workplace z. Since workers’utility is increasing
in the …nal good consumption, maximizing consumption amounts to maximizing her net
income given by
                            max Ij (y; z) = wj (z)         tjy   zj      rj (y):             (10)
                             y;z



   At the residential equilibrium, workers reach the same utility level, whence earn the same
net income I0 :
                                              I(y; z) = I0 ;                                 (11)

                                                    9
where I0 is endogenous. This condition implies that a worker has no incentive to change
either her residential or working places.
    Labor is allocated to the following three activities:
    (i) the mass M of workers involved in designing the supply chain of the …nal sector,
    (ii) the mass R of workers involved in R&D activities, and
                       RN
    (iii) the mass L    0
                          L(i)di of workers producing the intermediate goods.
    Labor market clearing implies the following condition:

                                        H = M + R + L:                                     (12)



3     The programs of …rms and workers
In this section, we solve the equilibrium conditions for the …nal and intermediate producers,
as well as for workers.


3.1    The …nal sector
Since shipping inputs to the …nal sector is costless, the price of an input is the same through-
out within the city. Therefore, the optimization conditions for the …nal sector …rms may be
written as follows:
                                dY
                                     = p(i);
                               dx(i)
                                 dY
                                     = wj (0)        j   + p(N )x(N );                     (13)
                                 dN
while di¤erentiating (8) implies
                                                     Z       N
                           dY
                                =        x(i)                    x(k)dk;                   (14)
                          dx(i)                          0
                                                             Z       N
                            dY
                                =            x(N )                       x(k)dk x(N );     (15)
                            dN           2                       0

where we do not label variables by the con…guration j whenever it does not cause confusion.
Thus, the …nal sector’s inverse demand for the intermediate good i is independent of …rm i’s
location:                                                    Z       N
                               p(i) =        x(i)                        x(k)dk:           (16)
                                                                 0



                                                10
   The above expressions can be combined to yield the following two expressions:

                               p(i)   p(N ) =        [x(i)       x(N )]
                                                 s
                                                     2wj (0)     j
                                      x(N ) =                        ;                              (17)

where x(N ) is obtained by plugging (13) into (15) and using (16). Thus, the …nal sector’s
demand for the intermediate good i becomes:
                                 s
                                   2wj (0) j         1
                          x(i) =                         [p(i)       p(N )] :


3.2    The intermediate sector
We now turn to the optimization program of intermediate …rms. An intermediate …rm i
at location z determines the mass of research and production workers, output price and
location conditional upon the …nal producers’inverse demands (16) and input prices. Since
an intermediate …rm has a single location, there is no need to label intermediate goods by
their production sites.
   It follows from (16) that
                                                                                Z   N
          d [p(i)x(i; z)]                     d
                          = p(i) + x(i; z)                       x(i; z)                x(k; z)dk
             dx(i; z)                      dx(i; z)                             0
                          = p(i) ( + ) x(i; z):

   Using the …rst-order condition (14) and the production function (8), we obtain:
                                               Z N
                       dY
                              =      x(i; z)       x(k; z)dk = p(i; z):
                     dx(i; z)                   0

   We may then derive the pro…t-maximizing conditions with respect to R(i; z), K(i; z),
L(i; z), and z:
                  x(i; z)
                          [p(i)   ( + ) x(i; z)] = wj (z);                                          (18)
                  R(i; z)
                  x(i; z)
                          [p(i)   ( + ) x(i; z)] =         ;                                        (19)
                 K(i; z)
                  x(i; z)
                          [p(i)   ( + ) x(i; z)] = wj (z);                                          (20)
                  L(i; z)
                 zx(i; z)                                 dwj (z)                       drj (z)
       2 (1    )          [p(i)   ( + ) x(i; z)] =                [R(i; z) + L(i; z)] +         : (21)
                  Sj (z)                                    dz                            dz

                                                11
     The …rst three expressions are standard. The last one means that, by moving away from
the mean location, a …rm incurs a decrease in the bene…t generated by spillovers, which is
exactly compensated by a decrease in wage and land rent. This condition is the counterpart
of the Alonso-Muth equation obtained in the monocentric city model of urban economics
(Fujita, 1989).
     We can combine these various conditions to obtain the following conditions:
                  R(i; z)
                          =           ;                                                           (22)
                  L(i; z)
                  K(i; z)             wj (z)
                          =                    ;                                                  (23)
                  L(i; z)
                  drj (z)             L(i; z)                      wj (z)z        dwj (z)
                          =                        2 (1        )           +( + )         :       (24)
                    dz                                             Sj (z)           dz
    The …rst condition means that the research-labor ratio is equal to the ratio of their output
elasticities, while the second states that the capital-labor ratio is inversely proportional to
their price ratio. The third condition implies that the land rent gradient depends negatively
on the wage gradient (dwj =dz). If the wage gradient is positive and steeper, then the land
rent gradient must be negative and steeper to dampen …rms’cost. Furthermore, the land rent
gradient is ‡atter when the spillover Sj is stronger because the bene…t for …rms to cluster is
higher. Since the left-hand side of (20) is U-shaped, only the upward-sloping segment satis…es
the second-order condition for pro…t maximization and describes the supply schedule of the
intermediate good i.
    Using (18)-(20), the maximum pro…t earned by …rm i located at z is given by

                       j (i; z)   =       wj (z)L(i; z) + ( + ) [x(i; z)]2        rj (z)          (25)

where
                                             1         (1 + f = )           :
    It follows from (25) that a higher gives rise to a higher markup to intermediates. Note
also that the intermediates …nd it pro…t-maximizing to undertake R&D activities if and only
if    > 0. This inequality shows that              cannot be too large for …rms to invest in R&D, i.e.,
…rms must enjoy a su¢ ciently strong externality in R&D.
    Since …rms are symmetric and mobile, they earn identical equilibrium pro…ts j . There-
fore, using (25), the maximum bid that …rm i can o¤er to set up at z, denoted by rjF (z), is
derived from the zero-pro…t condition              j   = 0:

                          rjF (z) =         wj (z)L(i; z) + ( + ) [x(i; z)]2 :                    (26)

                                                          12
    Observe that an intermediate …rm’s bid rent is negatively a¤ected by the level of startup
cost f . Therefore, f does not pin down the equilibrium mass of …rms but their bid rent at
each location.


3.3    Workers
It is convenient to de…ne a mapping Jj from Z to Z associating a (potential) job site Jj (y) = z
with a (potential) residential location y. This mapping Jj describes the commuting pattern
of workers. More speci…cally, a worker residing at y works at the location Jj (y) = z that
maximizes her net income:

                 wj [Jj (y)]   tjy   Jj (y)j = max [wj (z)      tjy    zj] ;     y 2 Z:           (27)
                                               z2Z

    Solving workers’program is straightforward. More speci…cally, the maximum bid a worker
can o¤er to reside at location y is given by

            rjW (y) = max fwj [Jj (y)]   tjy   Jj (y)j     I(y; Jj (y)) j I(y; Jj (y)) = I0 g :   (28)
                       z

    Combining (10) and (11) with (28), we obtain

                                rjW (y) = wj (z)     tjy   Jj (y)j    I0 ;                        (29)

which is linear and downward slopping.



4     The spatial equilibrium
We describe the concept of spatial equilibrium in two stages. In Stage 1, we determine the
mass of intermediate …rms or, equivalently, the boundaries of the city. In Stage 2, given
N , we pin down the equilibrium con…guration j. Solving backward, we …rst determine the
equilibrium con…guration for given N . We then turn to Stage 1, solving for the equilibrium
mass of intermediate …rms.

De…nition 1. A spatial equilibrium is de…ned by the quantity vector fKj ; Lj ; Rj ; xj ; Yj ; Nj g,
price vector fpj ; wj (z); rj (z)g, and population densities fhFj (z); hW
                                                                        j (z)g for z 2 Z, together
with the sets of …rm and worker locations ZjF and ZjW such that the following conditions are
satis…ed:


                                                   13
(i) pro…ts are zero in the …nal and intermediate sectors;

(ii) the sets of intermediate …rm and worker locations are such that ZjF = z 2 Z j hFj (z) > 0
      and ZjW = z 2 Z j hW   j (z) > 0 under the commuting function Jj (y);


(iii) land and labor markets clear;

(iv) market clearing for intermediate goods pins down the mass of intermediate …rms;
                          R
(v) population constraint: Z W hW
                                j (z)dz = H.
                             j




The Walras Law implies that the …nal good market clears.


4.1    Stage 2. The market outcome under a given mass of interme-
       diates
We …rst characterize the equilibrium when the mass of intermediate goods is given and equal
to N . To produce clear-cut comparative results, we focus on symmetric …rm distributions
around the city center. For every z 2 ZjF and j = A; D, (7), (12) and (22) imply that the
equilibrium number of production workers and researchers is the same at every location z
and given by the expressions:

                                                    H
                                   Lj (N )                     j    ;                     (30)
                                             +      N

and
                                              H
                           Rj (N )                   j     =       Lj (N ):               (31)
                                         +    N
   In other words, for a given con…guration, intermediate …rms have the same number of
researchers regardless of their location z. Furthermore, the higher the elasticity of a …rm’s
TFP with respect to its own R&D investment, the higher the number of researchers employed
by this …rms. To put it di¤erently, as the spatial externality matters less ( "), each …rm
invests more in R&D, which makes the R&D shifter N Rj stronger.
   The above expressions also show that a given con…guration is associated with a particular
allocation of workers between the intermediate and …nal sectors, as well as between research
and production activities within the intermediate sector. Clearly, we have:

               LA (N ) > LD (N )       RA (N ) > RD (N )           MA (N ) < MD (N ):

                                               14
Thus, for any given mass of intermediate …rms, there are more production workers and more
researchers, hence fewer designers, in a city with a science park than in a city without a
science park.
    Since Lj and Rj are independent of z, the city is geographically symmetric and centered
at z = 0. Consequently, we can restrict ourselves to the right half of Z. However, note that
(23) implies that Kj (z) is proportional to wj (z) and, therefore, location-speci…c. In other
words, …rms’output and capital di¤er across locations. In particular, plugging (2) and (23)
into (1) yields the equilibrium output of an intermediate …rm at z:

                                     wj (z)           +                   1
                          xj (z) =            (Lj )       Rj Rj Sj (z)        ;                  (32)

which varies with z through the wage rate and the spillover e¤ect.
   For the intermediate producers to be able to undertake R&D activities, it is required that

                                     1    (1 + f = )              > 0:

   This constraint becomes more binding when f increases, but less binding when                   in-
creases. Furthermore,      cannot be too large, that is, …rms enjoy a su¢ ciently strong exter-
nality [RSj (z)]1 , for otherwise they do not undertake R&D. This result is in the spirit of
Romer’s (1990) growth model.
  Substituting the above expressions in the bid-rent function (26), which solves the zero-
pro…t condition, leads to the following expression:

                                                                                         2
                                                 wj (z)           +                  1
            rjF (z)   =   wj (z)Lj + ( + )                   Lj       Rj Rj Sj (z)           :   (33)

   This shows that the bid rent of an intermediate …rm at z depends upon the wage it pays
at this location, while stronger spillovers at z allow this …rm to bid higher. It follows from
(30) and (31) that a higher number of intermediate goods leads …rms to produce more and
to pay more for a location because of the magni…cation e¤ect of spillovers generated by the
R&D shifter.
   The equilibrium land rent rj (z) is the upper envelope of the two bid rent functions rjF (z)
and rjW (z). In other words, whenever a …rm or a worker locates at z, its bid rent must be




                                               15
equal to the equilibrium land rent:

                                       rj (z) = max rjF (z); rjW (z); 1
                                                8
                                                < rF (z)      if hFj (z) > 0
                                                   j
                                       rj (z) =                                                      (34)
                                                : rW (z)      if hW (z) > 0
                                                        j               j

                     rj ( (Nj + H)=2) = rj ((Nj + H)=2) = 1;

where the bid rents rjW (z) and rjF (z) are given by (29) and (33), respectively. Moreover,
when a location is populated with …rms and workers, we must have rjF (z) = rjW (z) = rj (z).


4.2    Stage 1. The equilibrium mass of intermediate …rms
We now focus on the determination of the equilibrium number of intermediate …rms, and
hence the equilibrium boundaries of the city. Setting z = 0 in (32) and using (17), (30) and
(31), the equilibrium value of N under the con…guration j is pinned down by the intermediate
goods market clearing condition:
                           1+ +              1=2
               H     jN                  2         ( + )1+     +
                                                                        1
                   1=2
                                   =                                            [wj (0)]1=2   :      (35)
                   j N
                       + +                                         (Smax )1

   Thus, the equilibrium wage prevailing at the city center (wj (0)) and the equilibrium city
size (H +Nj ) are interdependent. In order to obtain an analytical solution for the equilibrium
rent and wage schedules, we consider the special case where                 = 1=2. It is worth noting here
that Acemoglu and Guerrieri (2008) found that the capital intensity of a high-tech industry
such as ICT is about 0:53 in the U.S. over 1948-2005. Moreover, we have solved the model
numerically for di¤erent values of           6= 1=2, con…rming the robustness of our …ndings (see
Appendix D).
   Under    = 1=2, which will be assumed to hold throughout the paper, (35) simpli…es to:
                                   3=2+              1=2
                      H       jN                            ( + )3=2+          1
                          1=2 1=2+ +
                                             =2                                      :               (36)
                          j N
                                                                        (Smax )1

   The right-hand side of this expression is now a positive constant independent of the
con…guration j. Since the left-hand side of this expression is strictly decreasing in N and
has the horizontal axis as an asymptote when N ! 1, the above equation has a single
solution denoted Nj > 0 for j = A; D. Observe that, regardless of the con…guration j, Nj
is independent of the value of f , hence of the …xed cost F . This is to be contrasted with

                                                   16
most economic geography models where the mass of …rms is pinned down by the level of
…xed cost. Furthermore, when capital is more expensive ( "), then Nj decreases in both
con…gurations. Similarly, when the input variety e¤ect gets stronger (                                #), the mass of
intermediates decreases. By contrast, when the spillover e¤ect is stronger (Smax ") and the
mass of workers higher (H "), the mass of intermediate …rms rises.
   Since   A   <   D,   the mass of intermediate …rms is higher in a city with a science park than
in a city without it (NA > ND ). Observe that

                               (H       N )3=2+      +
                                                               (H           N )3=2+
                                                           =        1=2
                                                                                       :
                                     ( N )1=2+ +                          N 1=2+   +


   It follows from (36) that        j Nj   increases with      j.   As a result,       A   <   D,   (7) and (12) imply
that the science park hosts more researchers and production workers than the ‡at city. By
implication, the …nal sector is more productive when a science park is formed because more
intermediate inputs are available while fewer designers are required. In other words, the …nal
sector bene…ts from a …ner division of labor when a science park exists. This may explain
why it is rewarding for a city to host a science park, as suggested by the empirical evidence
provided by Delgado et al. (2012). Furthermore, combining (31) and (36) shows that each
…rm hires fewer researchers. In sum, even though each …rm employs fewer researchers in a
science park, this one involves a larger number of researchers. Since it accommodates more
intermediate …rms, the size of the city that hosts a science park is larger than that of a city
without a science park. Note also from (36) that an increase in total labor (H) raises the
number of intermediate …rms and of researchers.
   Summarizing yields the following proposition.

Proposition 1 (Agglomeration and size). A city with a science park hosts more researchers
and production workers, but fewer designers, than a ‡at city. Furthermore, the intermediate
sector involves more …rms while the …nal sector is more productive with a science park than
without it. Last, a larger pool of high-skilled workers leads to a bigger science park.


4.3    Bid rent and wage schedules
It remains to determine …rms’ bid rent and wage schedules. By setting                                = 1=2, the right
hand side of (33) becomes linear in wj (z), so that

                                              wj (z)
                                                      =          ;                                               (37)
                                              rjF (z)   gj (z)Lj

                                                      17
where                                                n                                                o2
                                                 +                                                1
                      gj (z)           +              (Lj ) (Rj ) Rj N Sj (z)                                                 (38)
                                                 2
strictly decreases with z through Sj . This expression shows that the parameters                                        and     of
the …nal sector’s production function a¤ect the wage-bid rent ratio. In particular, when the
input variety e¤ect in the …nal sector is stronger (a lower ), workers are relatively better
paid.
   Observe that (37) can be rewritten as gj (z) =                          rjF (z)=[wj (z)Lj ], so that gj (z) is pro-
portional to the land rent-wage ratio at location z. Since gj (z) is the main driver of the
equilibrium land rent and wage schedules, we …nd it useful to determine how it varies with
its parameters. The expressions (30), (31) and (38) imply
                                             (                                                                 )2
                                                                                 1+
                             +                                     H                                   1
                gj (z) =   +                                                j             [N Sj (z)]                :
                             2                        +            N

   As shown in Appendix A, the land rent-wage ratio decreases with the number of interme-
diate …rms (N ), the distance-decay e¤ect ("), the requirements for design ( ), and the startup
cost (f ) because   decreases with f , whereas it increases with the size of the high-tech labor
pool (H) when the equilibrium con…guration is agglomerated.
    Di¤erentiating (37) with respect to z and plugging the resulting expression into (21)
yields a …rst-order ordinary di¤erential equation in rjF with respect to z. Under = 1=2,
this di¤erential equation can be integrated explicitly to determine the intermediate …rms’bid
rent schedule (see (A.4) in Appendix A):
                                n                                                         o     1

                     rjF (z)   = c0j (zj0 ) [Sj (z)]1             gj (z)Lj =                               :                  (39)

The constant of integration is given by
                                                                       + +gj (zj0 )
                                                        rjF (zj0 )
                                c0j (zj0 )   =               1                            +
                                                                                              ;
                                                 Sj (zj0 )           gj (zj0 )Lj =

where the initial condition rjF (zj0 ) depends on the choice of the reference location zj0 , i.e.,

                 = (N + H)=2.
   Plugging (39) into (37) yields the equilibrium wage schedule:

It is readily veri…ed that wj (z)=rjF (z) reduces to (37). It then follows from (23) that

                                                          wj (z)
                                         Kj (z) =    Lj            :

Hence, unlike its labor input, a …rm’s capital input varies with its location through the wage
it pays to workers.
    The strict concavity of the …rms’ bid rent rjF (z) vastly simpli…es the analysis of the
spatial equilibrium (see Figure 1). We show in Appendix A that this function is decreasing
and strictly concave in z when the following su¢ cient condition holds:

    Condition R.

                                              rjF (0)
                                  1+       >          ln rjF (0):
                                             wj (0)Lj
    It follows from (6) that a higher …xed cost F , which shifts the bid rent schedule rjF (z)
downward, makes Condition R more likely to hold. We assume that this condition holds
throughout the remainder of the paper.



5     The spatial structure of R&D activities
In this section, we identify necessary and su¢ cient conditions under which the equilibrium
outcome involves an agglomerated or a dispersed con…guration.


5.1    The science park
In the case of an agglomerated con…guration (j = A), all intermediate …rms cluster within
a science park spread over [ NA =2; NA =2], whereas workers reside in the outskirts of the
central park and commute to the workplace. We assume without loss of generality that the
commuting function JA (y) is given by

                                 NA
                  z = JA (y) =      (y     NA =2);         y 2 [NA =2; (H + NA )=2]         (41)
                                 H
so that workers living at y = NA =2 work at z = 0, while those at y = (H + NA ) =2 work
at z = NA =2. In other words, a worker living in the residential area [NA =2; (H + NA )=2] is




                                                    19
assigned to a unique location belonging to [0; NA =2] with y and JA (y) varying in the same
direction. To support this commuting pattern, (27) requires:

                      wj [JA (y)] = wj (0)      ty;           y 2 [0; (H + NA )=2]:

   The reference location is given by zA0 = NA =2 and the constant of integration by
                                                                 + +gA (NA =2)
                                            f1 + t (H=2)g
                        c0A (NA =2) =                                                      :
                                        [SA (NA =2)]1     [gA (NA =2)LA = ]            +


                      F            W
   Moreover, we have rA (NA =2) = rA (NA =2) = 1 + tH=2 and
                           (                                                       )      1
                                                                              +        + +gA (0)
                 F                         + +gA (N=2)      gA (0)
                rA (0) =     (1 + tH=2)                              )                             :
                                                          gA (NA =2)

   To ensure the existence of a science park, the following two conditions are necessary and
su¢ cient:

(i) …rms’bid rent is steeper than workers’at z = NA =2;

(ii) …rms outbid workers at z = 0.

   When …rms’ bid rent schedule is decreasing and strictly concave in z, condition (i) is
necessary and su¢ cient to guarantee that workers outbid …rms outside the science park,
while condition (ii) means that …rms outbid workers within the park. It remains to check
what conditions (i) and (ii) become for a science park to emerge as an equilibrium outcome.
   First, equalizing the derivatives of …rms’bid rent and workers’bid rent at z = N=2, we
obtain the following equation in t:

           n     h                           i                        o
                      +
  (1    ) N 1 + 2 gj (N=2)      ln (1 + tH=2) [gj (N=2)              ]            t
                                                                          =                            j = A; D: (42)
                  [ +      + gj (N=2)] Sj (N=2)                               1 + tH=2
Since the left hand side of this expression is decreasing in t whereas its left hand side is
increasing and equal to 0 at t = 0, (42) has a unique solution in t, which is denoted Tj1 . It is
then readily veri…ed that condition (i) is equivalent to t < TA1 .
   Let us now come to condition (ii). Equalizing …rms’ bid rent and workers’ bid rent at
z = 0 yields the expression:
                                 1                    +                           + +gj (0)
                      Sj (0)              gj (0)                1 + t H+N
                                                                       2
                                                          =                   + +gj (N=2)
                                                                                               :                 (43)
                     Sj (N=2)           gj (N=2)              (1 + tH=2)

                                                   20
Since the left hand side of (43) is independent of t and larger than 1, while the right hand
side is increasing and equal to 1 at t = 0, (43) has a unique solution in t; it is denoted Tj2 .
Condition (ii) thus amounts to t < TA2 . As a result, we have the following proposition.

Proposition 2 (Existence of a science park). There exists a science park if and only if
t   min fTA1 ; TA2 g.

    Figure 1 plots the land rent under an agglomerated con…guration. Given the strict con-
cavity of …rms’bid rent and the linearity of workers’bid rent, the former may intersect the
latter at most twice. When …rms’bid rent is su¢ ciently steep and the slope of the workers’
bid rent (i.e., t) is su¢ ciently ‡at, there is a unique intersection point. In this case, …rms
outbid workers in the inner area, whereas workers outbid …rms in the outer areas. Hence,
the equilibrium con…guration features a science park.

                                  Insert Figure 1 about here

    When       is su¢ ciently small, it is readily veri…ed that TA1 and TA2 are decreasing in
gA (NA =2). In this case, it is shown in Appendix B that both TA1 and TA2 increase with "
and f: Furthermore, the impact of H and       A   on TA2 may be unambiguously determined (see
Appendix B). Since numerical analysis undertaken for reasonable parametrization suggests
that TA2 < TA1 (see Appendix D), we are able to derive additional comparative static results
(see Appendix B).
    To sum up, we have:

Proposition 3 (Characterization of a science park). If        is su¢ ciently small, then a more
localized spillover e¤ect ( " ") or a higher startup cost ( f ") makes a science park more likely
to emerge. Furthermore, when TA2       TA1 holds, a lower labor requirement for design (    A   #)
increases the likelihood of a science park, while a bigger labor pool ( H ") has a similar impact
when H is large enough.

    The magnitude of the distance-decay e¤ect on the clustering of high-tech …rm is dampened
when the requirement for designers is lower or when more high-tech workers are available.
Thus, when A rises, design productivity reduces, which lowers the advantage of knowledge
spillovers and, therefore, decreases the incentives for intermediate …rms to cluster. This also
leads to a smaller number of researchers and lower volume of R&D, hence a smaller science
park. In addition, a more localized spatial externality fosters the clustering of intermediate
…rms because …rms bene…t from increased spillovers by being located together. With a greater

                                               21
mass of skilled labor, the positive scale e¤ect implies stronger spillovers, thus raising …rms’
incentive to cluster.
   We stress that more e¤ective designers and an increased availability of high-tech workers,
which make a science park more likely to emerge, are entirely channelized through employ-
ment of researchers and designers, as well as by the total size of the researcher pool in the
science park. Moreover, these two e¤ects are reinforced by the magnitude of the spillover
e¤ect, which takes on its highest values when …rms cluster in a single science park. These
results may serve to explain why the extent of the proximity e¤ect may vary by location or
by industry (see the survey by Carlino and Kerr, 2015, Section 4.3). Last, since a higher …xed
cost requires larger operating pro…ts to balance it, this can be achieved when …rms cluster
to take advantage of stronger spillovers.
   One might expect a higher cost of capital ( ) to have a negative impact on the occur-
rence of a science park because it reduces the marginal productivity of R&D. However, this
argument disregards that a higher     also implies more expenditure on capital, thus reducing
intermediates’pro…ts. This in turn incentivizes intermediate …rms to cluster in a science park.
Consequently, the …nal e¤ect is a priori undetermined. Nevertheless, simulations suggest that
the latter e¤ect overcomes the former one, so that a science park is more likely to emerge
when    is higher, but it has a smaller size.
   Inspecting the pro…t-maximizing conditions (18)-(20) shows that using complementary
rather than substitutable inputs, i.e., shifting from positive to negative values, a¤ects all
the equilibrium values of output, inputs and prices. Therefore, predicting its impact is next to
impossible. However, it follows from (38) that this downward shift in      has the same impact
as an increase in . Our numerical analysis (see Appendix D) suggests that a science park is
more likely to pump up when intermediate goods are complements.


5.2    The dispersion of R&D activities
A ‡at city involves the uniform dispersion of workers and intermediate …rms, hence the
                                                                       F
uniform distribution of R&D activities. In this case, it must be that rD ((H + ND ) =2) = 1
                                                    0
while J(y) = y. Therefore, it is natural to select zD = (H + ND ) =2, which implies the
following initial condition:
                                                           1
          c0D ((H + ND ) =2) =                       1                               +
                                                                                         :
                                 [SD ((H + ND )=2)]      [gD ((H + ND ) =2) LD = ]

   To ensure the existence of a ‡at city, the following two conditions must be met:

                                                22
(i) …rms and workers have identical bid rents;

(ii) a worker’s residence and workplace are the same.

These are equivalent to conditions that bid rents and wage schedules are (weakly) ‡atter
than the commuting cost schedule across all locations.
   Using the argument developed in section 5.2 shows that condition (i) is equivalent to
t > TD1 where
                                n                                       o
                                         2( + )
                  (1  ) (H + N ) 1 + gD ((H+N  )=2)
                                                    [gD ((H + N ) =2) ]
            TD1 =                                                         > 0:
                        [ + + gD ((H + N ) =2)] SD ((H + N ) =2)
   Moreover, equalizing the derivatives of …rms’ bid rent and workers’ bid rent at z =
(H + N )=2 yields the equation:
                                                                     H+N
                 2 (1     ) zj0 wj (zj0 ) 1     2 1 + ln 1 + t         2
                                                                                zj0       [gj (zj0 )    ]
          t=                                                                                                ;   (44)
                                                  +   + gj (zj0 )   Sj (zj0 )
                                                                  0
which has a unique solution in t given by Tj3 . Using (44) where zD = (H + N )=2, we obtain
the threshold:

                                  (1        ) (N + H)[gD ((N + H)=2)     ]
                        TD3 =                                               < 0;
                                [ +        + gD ((N + H)=2)] SD ((N + H)=2)
which implies that condition (ii) never binds. Consequently, the following result holds.

Proposition 4 (Existence of a ‡at city). A ‡at city arises if and only if t                            TD1 .

   We show in Appendix C that an increase in the distance-decay e¤ect (" "), a stronger
labor requirement for design (         D      "), or a higher startup cost (f "), all raises TD1 when
is not too large. Thus, for a given value of commuting cost, any of these changes reduces
the likelihood for a ‡at city. The size of the labor pool has the same impact when H is big
enough. Hence, we have:

Proposition 5 (Characterization of a ‡at city). If                       and          are su¢ ciently small, then a
more localized spillover e¤ect ( " ") or a higher startup cost ( f ") or a lower labor requirement
for design (   D   #) makes a ‡at city less likely to emerge. Furthermore, a bigger labor pool
( H ") has a similar impact when H is large enough.

   Finally, it is readily veri…ed that the right hand side of (42) is a decreasing function of gj .
Since gA > gB , we have TA1 < TD1 . Therefore, the two con…gurations studied in this paper do

                                                        23
not coexist. Moreover, there is a range of commuting cost values such that the city has several
smaller science parks separated by residential areas. Indeed, in modern high-tech industries,
startup costs are typically high, while advanced or tacit knowledge depends crucially on face-
to-face contacts. As a consequence, science parks are the most likely outcome. Nevertheless,
commuting costs rise fast as a result of higher time costs. Eventually, the equilibrium outcome
should change and involve the decentralization of the R&D activities. This fragmentation of
science parks may serve to explain the evolution of the Silicon Valley, which began with Palo
Alto Industrial Park in 1951, expanded to Mountain View, then to Sunnyvale, Santa Clara
and, …nally, San Jose (Saxenian 1994, pp. 29-30).



6     Concluding remarks
We have identi…ed necessary and su¢ cient conditions for the emergence of a city endowed
with a science park and characterized the ‡at city without science parks. The former occurs
when knowledge spillover decay are severe and starting up is costly, which are typical features
of new high-tech industries. These results suggest that science parks are more likely to form
in advanced knowledge-based economies, allowing …nal …rms to enjoy higher productivity
gains.
    Notwithstanding the social desirability of science parks, it is worth stressing that the
most common instruments used by governments or universities to promote science parks is to
reduce …rms’startup costs (lower f ) by subsidizing capital investments. Our analysis suggests
that implementing such policies need not achieve their goals because they do not incite …rms
to move to large and productive science parks. By contrast, subsidizing land incentivizes
…rms to cluster in large science parks. Indeed, since rj (z) = max rjF (z) + r; rjW (z) , the
subsidy r generates a discontinuity in …rms’bid rents at the border between industrial and
residential areas, thus enabling …rms to outbid other land-users and to occupy more land
within the inner area of the high-tech city.
    A …nal remark is in order. Our model is isomorphic to a setting in which the intermediate
sector is replaced by a …nal sector that produces a di¤erentiated good sold to consumers
endowed with linear-quadratic preferences (8), as in Ottaviano et al. (2002). Proposition
2 thus states a necessary and su¢ cient condition for the …nal producers to form a central
high-tech district.

                   wj (z)Lj
Substituting the third equation into the second one, we obtain:
                                                                                        2 (1     )z
                     gj (z)d ln(rjF (z)) + ( + )d ln(wj (z)) =                                      dz;             (A.1)
                                                                                           Sj (z)
while the third equation becomes (37).
   Since dSj (z) = 2zdz, integrating (A.1) yields:

                   gj (z) ln(rjF (z)) + ( + ln(wj (z)) = ln c0j + (1                            ) ln(Sj (z));

where c0j is the constant of integration. Rewriting the above expression gives
                                                      "                 # g 1(z)
                                         F
                                                 c0j Sj (z)1                j

                                        rj (z) =                                    :                               (A.2)
                                                  wj (z) +

   Choosing a reference location zj0 and using (37), we can determine c0j :
                                                                     + +gj (zj0 )
                                                       rjF (zj0 )
                                 c0j (zj0 )   =                                         +
                                                                                            ;
                                                  [Sj (z)]1        gj (z)Lj =
which can be substituted into (A.2) to get the intermediate …rms’bid rent (39). We can then
use (37) to obtain the wage schedule (40).
    (ii) Di¤erentiating gj (z), it is readily veri…ed that
                               dgj (z)             4 (1     )z
                                       =                       [gj (z)              ] < 0:
                                 dz                   Sj (z)
   Di¤erentiating (39) with respect to z yields:
      drjF (z)          rjF (z)            2(1     )z    +                                            dgj (z)
               =                                      +                         ln(rjF (z))                     :   (A.3)
        dz             + + gj (z)            Sj (z)     gj (z)                                          dz

                                                              25
Since gj (z) is decreasing, (A.3) is negative if

                          max ln rjF (z) = ln rjF (0)              ( + ) =gj (0):
                              z

Using (37), this inequality is equivalent to condition R.
   Further di¤erentiating (A.3) and using the derivative of gj (z), we get:

        d2 rjF (z)              1      drjF (z) dgj (z)        rjF (z)
                   =

                                                  2
                                     1         2z           +                          dgj (z)

                                                         +            ln rjF (z)
                                   Sj (z) Sj (z)           gj (z)                        dz
                         "                                             !#                  )
                              +      dgj (z)           1      drjF (z)           dgj (z)
                       +                        + F                                          ;
                           gj (z)2      dz          rj (z)       dz                dz

which is negative under condition R.
        (iii) It remains to characterize the rent-wage ratio schedule gj (z). For ; "; f , it is
trivial that
                   dgj (z)         dgj (z)   dgj (z) dSj (z)                    dgj (z)
                           <0              =                 <0                         < 0:
                    d j              d"      dSj (z)   d"                        df
Moreover, we have
                                                               1+
                          dgj (z)    d          H
                                  /                       j         [N Sj (z)]1
                           dN       dN          N
                                                         H
                                       /    ( + )          + (1         )   j    < 0:
                                                         N

   Furthermore, for j = A and zA0 = N=2, it follows from SA (z) that dSA (0)=dH = 0, so
that
                            dgA (0)         dgA (b)
                                    >0               > 0:
                              dH              dH
                     0
When j = D, we have zD = (H + N )=2. It then is straightforward to show that
                 "                   #
                             1+

               =          D       SD   (1 + )    S            (1     ) (1 + ")            D         ;

which is negative when H is su¢ ciently high. Q.E.D.

B. Proof of Proposition 3
    (i) Let us …rst study how TA1 varies with the main parameters. Di¤erentiating the LHS
of (42) with respect to gA leads to, aside from a positive multiplier,

       ln (1 + tH=2)             ( + ) [gA (NA =2)                      ]
                                                                             +                                                             (B.1)
       + + gA (NA =2)                 gj (NA =2)                                 [ +          + gA (NA =2)] gA (NA =2)

which is negative when       is small enough. The e¤ects via gA derived in Appendix A together
with the direct e¤ects in (B.1) yield the desired comparative static results about TA1 .
    (ii) We now turn to the impact of parameter changes on TA2 .
(a) Consider …rst the LHS of (43). Note that SA is decreasing in " while
                                                           N 2

is increasing in " and N .
    Recall from Appendix A that gA (z) is decreasing in                                  A ; "; f;   and N , but increasing in H,
which allows us to characterize the ratio:

    (iii) Combining the analyses in (i) and (ii) above, we can conclude that an increase in

impact of H on TA2 is positive when H is high enough. This yields the desired comparative
static results. Q.E.D.


C. Proof of Proposition 5
Since TA1 and TD1 di¤er only by the reference location zA0 = N=2 and zD
                                                                      0

the comparative static derived in Appendix B holds true but for H. Di¤erentiating TD1 with

                                                  ,   we have

   Using Appendix A shows that dTD1 =dH > 0 when is su¢ ciently small and H su¢ ciently

D. Numerical analysis
We begin by describing the parametrization of our model. Using Acemoglu and Guerri-
eri (2008) who found that capital intensity of a high-tech industry such as ICT is about 0:53
in the U.S. over 1948-2005, we set in the benchmark           = 0:5. Since land share is generally
set as 0:06 (Caselli and Coleman, 2001), we obtain = 1 0:5 0:06 = 0:44. Also standard
is to set the capital cost to be = 0:1 (Hsieh and Klenow, 2009) and the R&D intensity of
high-tech industry to be     = 0:03, which is higher than the overall R&D share in the US
(0:026).
    By normalizing the …nal good scaling parameter = 10, we choose Smax = 20 and = 1
to regulate proper intermediate good demand slope so that the choke price is su¢ ciently high
to avoid degenerate equilibria. We then set            = 0:5 to capture mild substitution between
intermediate good varieties. We normalize H = 2, so the mass of skill workers over the right
half of the city is 1. We also choose " = 1, which yields a comfortable range for positive
knowledge spillovers. In this case, Condition R holds. We set f = 0:001, hence f = = 0:01,
and the design requirement parameter        A   = 0:5, under which    > 0 and all …rms’pro…ts are
positive. For convenience, we choose    D   = 1:2       A.
    We now summarize the key results based on the numerical benchmark model. First of
all, the mass of intermediate …rms under each con…guration is NA = 2:42 and ND = 2:22,
thus NA > ND . Second, for t        0:053 = TA2 , the equilibrium involves a science park; for
t   0:49 = TD1 , the city is ‡at. Third, the thresholds satisfy: TA2 < TA1 and TA2 < TD1 . Fourth,
the comparative static results stated in Propositions 3 and 5 all hold true. Finally, when
  = 0:5 (intermediate goods are complements), TA2 becomes bigger and hence a science
park is more likely to emerge in equilibrium.
    We have perturbed the following parameters f ; ; ; ; ; Smax ; "; f;        D = Ag   one by one
up and down by 20% around their benchmark values (with necessary adjustments to ensure
  > 0 and that Condition R holds). Our main …ndings summarized in the previous paragraph
are robust to such changes.
