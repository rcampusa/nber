 Divergent Expectations as a Cause of Disagreement in Bargaining:
          Evidence From a Comparison of Arbitration Schemes


                                   ABSTRACT

        One prominent explanation for disagreement in bargaining is that the

  parties have divergent and relatively optimistic expectations regarding the

  ultimate outcome if they fail to agree. The fact that settlement rates are

 much higher where final—offer arbitration is the dispute settlement procedure

  than where conventional arbitration is the dispute settlement procedure is

 used as the basis of a test of the role of divergent expectations in causing

 disagreement in negotiations. Calculations of identical—expectations contract

 zones using existing estimates of models of arbitrator behavior yield larger

 identical—expectations contract zones in conventional arbitration than in

 final—offer arbitration. This evidence clearly suggests that divergent

 expectations alone are not an adequate explanation of disagreement in labor—

 management negotiations. A number of alternative explanations for

 disagreement are suggested and evaluated.

        One of the enduring puzzles in the analysis of bargaining is why there

 is ever disagreement in cases where agreement appears to be in the interests

 of both parties. For example, in labor-management negotiations, disagreement

 imposes costs (of arbitration or of a strike) on both parties without

 increasing the resources available to be split by the two parties. Failures

 of negotiation lead to costly strikes, decreased harmony in the workplace, and

 threats to the survival of the organization and the jobs of organizational

 members. The labor—management relationship is just one case in which

 inefficiencies appear inherent in the negotiation process. Other important

 inefficiencies occur in international negotiations over trade and political

 issues, merger negotiations, and family disputes (Raiffa, 1982; Pruitt and

 Rubin, 1985; Lewicki, Sheppard, and Bazernan, 1986).

       One prominent explanation for disagreement in bargaining is that the

parties have divergent and relatively optimistic expectations regarding the

ultimate outcome if they fail to agree (Hicks, 1963; Farber and Katz, 1979;

Bazerman and Neale, 1982). In the case where a third party will render a

decision if the parties fail to agree, both parties expect to receive a

relatively favorable decision from the third party. In final—offer

arbitration, where the arbitrator must accept one offer or the other (and not

compromise) ,   it   is obvious that 50% of the final offers submitted (1 of 2)

will be accepted. Neale and Bazerman (1983) found strong evidence of

relatively optimistic expectations when they asked subjects in a bargaining

experiment the probability that their final offer would be accepted. The

average probability estimate was fully 68%. Such relative optimism can

prevent sufficient concessions in the negotiation process as both parties

inappropriately expect a favorable disagreement outcome.

      There is substantial evidence supporting the claim that divergent
                                          2



 expectations re common, and that they can be a cause of disagreement in

 bargaining. However, the magnitude of the effect of divergent expectations on

 the likelihood of disagreement is in question. In this study, we examine two

 alternative forms of arbitration: conventional and final—offer. It is well

 known that negotiated settlement rates are much higher under final—offer

 arbitration than under conventional arbitration (e.g., Feuille, 1975,: Kochan

 and Baderschneider, 1978; Notz and Starke, 1978; Grigsby and Bigoness, 1982;

 Neale and Bazerman, 1983). We develop the argument that the hypothesis that

 divert expçations are the prinary_cpse of diqreemeitimplies that

 contract zones compited assuming (perhaps counterfactual) identical

 pectations will be 1arg under the form of arbitration that leads to the

jg tement rate. We then examine empirical evidence on settlement

rates under the different forms of arbitration and compare them to the

predicted identical—expectations contract zones in order to explore whether or

not the data are consistent with the divergent expectations prediction.

Finally, we explore other explanations of disagreement in order to account for

the many important negotiation failures that occur in various settings.

       Arbitration procedures are used in most U.S. labor contracts to settle

disputes that arise in the course of administration of labor agreements. This
                                   1
is termed grievance arbitration.       In order to avoid strikes by public sector

employees, by 1981 twenty states had specified that arbitration is to be used

to determine the actual terms of labor contracts among public sector employees

where the parties cannot agree (Freeman, 1986)    .   This   is termed interest

arbitration, and it is the focus of the analysis here.

      Two types of arbitration are in wide use to settle interest disputes in



    1. In 1980, approximately 97 percent of collective bargaining agreements
in the private sector covering 1000 or more workers included grievance
procedures with arbitration. (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 1981).
                                       3



 the public sector. Conventional arbitration (CA), where the arbitrator is

 free to make any award he or she sees fit, was the first to be used. After

 some experience with this form of arbitration in the public sector, it was

 argued that the arbitrator will have an incentive to split the difference

 between the last offers of the parties resulting in a "chilling" of bargaining

 as each party maintains extreme positions in order to receive a favorable

 arbitration award in the event the parties fail to reach a negotiated

 settlement. Final—offer arbitration (FOA), where the arbitrator is

 constrained to make an award that is equal to one or the other of the parties'

 last offers, is argued not to chill bargaining because the arbitrator is

explicitly prohibited from splitting the difference. In 1981 ten states had

laws specifying CA and ten states had laws specifying FOA to settle interest

disputes with some or all public employees (Freeman, 1986).

      While the empirical evidence seems clear that settlement rates are, in

fact, higher under FOA, the rationale outlined above is not adequate.

Implicitly, this rationale relies on the assumption that contract zones (the

range of settlements that both parties would prefer to disagreement) are

larger or more likely to exist under FOA. However, this assumption is not

necessarily accurate. First, it is an empirical matter as to whether or not

contract zones are larger or more likely to exist in FOA (Farber 1980b) , and

there is no direct evidence on this issue. Second, without a theory of

disagreement it is not clear that larger contract zones, do in fact lead to

more settlements. In the next section a theory of disagreement as being the

result of relatively optimistic expectations regarding the disagreement

outcome is briefly outlined. This model has the clear implication that larger

identical—expectations contract zones lead to more agreement. Accepting the

empirical evidence that there is higher likelihood of settlement in FOA than

in CA, a natural test of the theories, based on a comparison of the relative
                                      4



sizes of the contract zones in the two types of arbitration, is proposed.

      Section III contains a brief description of the model of the parties'

decisions regarding their optimal offers given their expectations regarding

arbitrator behavior. These models are then used to describe how the implied

contract zones are derived under the two types of arbitration.

      Given that the contract zone in arbitration depends fundamentally on the

behavior of the arbitrator, section IV contains a description of arbitrator

behavior in CA based on the model developed and estimated by Farber and

Bazerman (1986). Similarly, section V contains a description of arbitrator

behavior in FOA based on the same underlying model. Empirical estimates of

the parameters of the model of arbitrator behavior serve as an important

component of the calculation of contract zone sizes.

      In section VI the particular pieces of the model required to compute

contract zone sizes, the preferences of the parties over the range of possible

outcomes and their prior distribution on the behavior of the arbitrator, are

specified. The computation of the contract zones based on these components is

also described.

      In section VII the actual computations of contract zones are presented

for a range of risk preferences of the parties, uncertainty regarding the

arbitrator's behavior, and arbitrator sensitivity to the offers in CA. The

clear finding is that contract zones are substantially larger in CA than in

FOA. This finding is not consistent with the divergent expectations model of

disagreement.

      Section VIII contains a discussion of four alternative explanations of

disagreement in view of the limitations of the divergent expectations

explanation found in the analysis. Each of these theories is evaluated and

discussed with regard to their implications for the empirical evidence

presented in this paper.

 II. Divergent Expectations, the Contract Zone, and Disagreement

       A dispute settlement procedure will provide an incentive for the parties

 to reach a negotiated agreement to the extent that the procedure imposes costs

 on the parties in the event they fail to agree. Farber and Katz (1979) argue

 that arbitration imposes costs on the parties largely due to the combination

 of risk aversion by the parties and their uncertainty regarding the behavior

 of the arbitrator. To the extent that the parties are risk averse, they will

 be willing to concede in negotiation from the expected arbitration award in

 order to avoid the risk of an unfavorable award. Assuming that the parties

 have identical expectations about the uncertain arbitration award, the result

 is a contract zone of settlements that both parties prefer to disagreement.

 In what follows this is called the identical—expectations contract zone to

distinguish it from the contract zone, per Se, which is the range of

settlements (if any) that both parties prefer to disagreement in practice,

where expectations regarding the arbitration award may differ.

      The simplest theory of disagreement in this context is based on the

possibility that the parties have different prior distributions on the

arbitration award. If the parties are relatively optimistic regarding the

likely arbitration award (e.g., the union expects a higher wage award than the

employer expects) then the union will be willing to concede downward from a

higher wage than the employer is will to concede upward from. As noted in the

introduction, there is empirical evidence in the behavioral science literature

on negotiation suggesting that negotiators, and decision makers in general,

are overconfident and overoptimistic in their uncertain judgments (Neale and

Bazerman, l983, Bazerman and Neale, 1982) .   Thus, while relative optimism is
not consistent with a simple equilibrium economic model, it may well be true

that negotiators systematically misperceive their environment in ways that
                                                          6



could lead to disagreement.

      Unless the costs imposed by uncertainty are sufficient to offset these

divergent expectations completely, there will not be a contract zone and there

will be no agreement. The identical—expectations contract zone, because itis

an indicator of the costs imposed by the unc inyregarding the arbitration

award, is a direct measure of how robust the actual contract zone is to

differences in expectations. Assuming that systematic differences in

expectations are independent of the type of arbitration scheme, this divergent

expectations model has the clear implication that larger identical—

expectations contract zones will lead to a higher likelihood of agreement in

actual cases where expectations may well differ.

      In order to see this more clearly, consider a very simple model where a

union and employer are bargaining over some value Y where the union's utility

is positively related to Y and the employer's utility is negatively related to

Y. For example, Y might represent the wage. Let the cost of disagreement to

the union and employer respectively be represented by Cu and C respectively.

Let the union's and management's expectations regarding the arbitration award

be 'au and 'am respectively. Where the union and employer are risk—neutral

(V(Y) = Y and V(Y) = —Y), the union will be willing to accept any

settlement, Yflu, such that

      (2.1) Y nu      Y         — C
                          au             u

and the management will be willing to accept any settlement such that

      (2.2) Ynm       Y         +    C
                          am             in


The contract zone is defined by

      (2.3) CZ = Y
                      nm
                               - Y
                                     flu
                                              = (Y
                                                  am
                                                     -   yau ) + (Cu +C m).
Where expectations are identical, Y =Y
                                                     am au and the identical—expectations
contract zone reduces to the sum of the costs of disagreements,

      (2.4)   CZ0 =   C
                          u
                               + C
                                    in
                                                         7

  Thus, the con ua t zorA n general is
           (2.5)    CZ = CZ
                              0
                                  + (Y
                                      am
                                           —
                                               Y    ),
                                               au
 and a contract zone is more likely to exist for a given degree of difference

 in expectations where CZ0, the contract zone in the case of identical

 expectations, is larger.

          From the discussion in this section, the divergent expectations theory

 of disagreement can be examined based on a comparison of identical-

 expectations contract zones under CA versus FOA. Assume first that the

 evidence that FOA leads to less disagreement than CA is accurate. Next,

 compute the contract zones implied by CA and FOA. If it is found that

 contract zones are larger in FOA than in CA, then the divergent expectations

 theory has additional support. However, evidence that contract zones are

 larger in CA would not be consistent with the divergent expectations model,

 and alternatives would need to be considered. It must be noted that we are

not testing whether or not divergent expectations exist or whether divergent

can be a cause of disagreement. Both of these questions have been answered

affirmatively by theoretical and empirical analysis in the existing

literature. Rather, this paper examines the sufficiency of the divergent

expectations theory in accounting for disagreement in labor—management

negotiations.



III. Negotiator Behavior

         A key feature of arbitrator behavior from the standpoint of the

negotiators is that they are likely to be uncertain about the arbitration

award,           in a particular case. More formally, the arbitration award can be

expressed as

         (3.1)     Ys =   h.1 (Y ,y ,y
                                e u in
where Y represents the arbitrator's notion of an appropriate award
                                         8



 independent of the otfers, Y is the union's offer, ad Y is the managements

offer. The function h.() represents the arbitration process by which          and

the offers are combined to determine the award, and i =   c,f   indexes the type

of arbitration scheme (conventional and final—offer respectively).2 The

likely source of the uncertainty is that the parties do not know

      Each party, given its prior expectations and an assumption about its

opponents prior expectations, can compute the Nash equilibrium offers

associated with the type of arbitration that is in use. Where expectations

are identical, it is natural that each party derives the Nash equilibrium

assuming it's opponent's expectations are the same as its own. Where

expectations, in fact, differ each party may still proceed as if their

opponent has the same expectations it does. However, at some point it will

become apparent that the opponent actually holds different expectations. More

realistically, the difference in expectations may be common knowledge (an

"honest" difference of opinion?) so that each party computes the Nash

equilibrium offers with its own expectations about e but incorporating the

fact that their opponent is proceeding with their own expectations. The basic

conclusions of the analysis are not sensitive to which of these assumptions

are used, and the analysis proceeds assuming that the parties have identical

expectations about

      From the Nash equilibrium offers each party can compute its equilibrium

expected utility from arbitration. Economic rationality requires that the

party not accept any negotiated settlement that yields it a utility level

lower than the expected utility from arbitration. More formally, let the

union's utility function be defined as




    2. Clearly, the h(.) function will be different in the two forms of
arbitration, and the succeeding two sections of the paper focus on the form of
                                             9

       Assume that the parties' identical prior distribution regarding           is

 characterized by the density function g(e) where e is a parameter vector.3 On

 this basis, the union's expected utility from arbitration is

       (3.4) E[U] =       E[U(h.(Y,Y,Y)))
 where the expectation is taken over             Similarly, the employer's expected

                          E[U(hi(Y,Y,Y))].
Note that the form of these general expressions are independent of whether CA

or FOA is in use. The form of the expectation and the role of the prior

distribution function (g(e)) depend crucially on the type of arbitration, but

in both cases the expected utilities are functions of both offers and the

parameters of the prior distribution on e4 Differentiating these expected

utilities with respect to Y and Y respectively and setting the results equal

to zero yields two equations in two unknowns (the offers) that can be solved

parties will prefer to arbitration are those that satisfy

and the range from Y —Y
                                cm cu defines the contract zone. As long as Ycm                   is

larger than              there will exist mutually agreeable settlements and the

simplest theories of bargaining imply that there will be a negotiated

settlement.

        It can be shown that a sufficient condition for there to be a positive

contract zone for the model outlined here is that neither party be risk

seeking. This is independent of whether CA or FOA is used. Thus, it seems as

if the parties always ought to reach negotiated agreements under both types of

arbitration. Of course, this is not the case, and the model must be

incomplete in a fundamental way. One obvious problem with the model is that

the assumption was made that both parties had the sane prior distribution

(g(e)) regarding the arbitrator's notion of an appropriate award 'e If the

parties have different expectations about Y (i.e., different e's) then their

optimal offers and certainty equivalents will differ from the ideal derived

above. More to the point, if the parties have relatively optimistic

expectations about e (for example, the mean of the union's prior distribution

on Y is higher than the employer's) then Y                         will be higher relative to Y

and the contract zone will be smaller than that derived above.5 If



    5. This conclusion also follows under the alternative assumptions that the
Nash equilibrium is derived 1) with each party assuming that its opponent has
the same expectations its does even when this is inappropriate or 2) with each
party understanding that its opponent has different expectations about the
arbitrator. See the discussion of this issue earlier in this section.

  'xpectatios are sufficiently optimistic, the contract zone may even be

 negative. In this case there will be no mutually acceptable negotiated

 settlements, and the parties will resort to arbitration.

       For the purposes of the discussion here assume that the extent of

 mismatch or relative optimism regarding 'e is independent of the type of

 arbitration scheme. In this context it is possible to restate the claim that

 FOA encourages more negotiated settlements than CA in the terms of the our

 model. The claim is that foragiven amount of relative      optimism re4nY
 (a given difference between e and em) there is more likely to be a contract

 zone in FOA than in CA. It is a reasonable that movements in the means of the

 prior distributions have an effect in the same direction on the certainly

 equivalents. In other words, an increase in the union's prior expectation

 (holding the employer's fixed) yields an increase in the union's certainty

 equivalent settlement. The result is a decrease in the size of the contract

zone. On this basis, the claim for FOA can be restated as declaring that the

identical—expectations contract zone induced by FOA will be larger than the

identical—expectations contract zone induced by CA. Intuitively, if the

identical—expectation contract zone in FOA is larger it will take a greater

degree of relative optimism in expectations to offset it completely. We turn

now to descriptions of arbitrator behavior in the two types of arbitration

required to calculate the relative size of the contract zones.



IV. Arbitrator Behavior in Conventional Arbitration

      Farber (1981) argues that the pure split—the—difference model of

arbitrator behavior in CA, where the arbitration award is simply an average of

the last offers, is not reasonable because it provides the parties with the

incentive to make their offers infinitely extreme. This is certainly not

consistent with observed behavior, and casual conversation with arbitrators
                                        12


suggests that this .s because "unreasonable" offers are discounted or

disregarded by arbitrators. Clearly, there must exist a standard against

which to judge offers if some offers are to be thought unreasonable. Thus, a

richer framework for understanding arbitrator behavior in CA is required. A

reasonable framework is that the arbitrator examines the facts (exclusive of

the offers> in a particular case and makes a judgment based solely on these

facts regarding an equitable award. The actual award is then formulated as a

weighted average of this equitable award and the average of the last offers of

parties where the weights depend on the "quality" of the offers (Farber, 1981;

Bazerman and Farber, 1985). More formally, the arbitration award S> is

      (4.1) y =
              s
                  ye +     (1—)Y
where e is the arbitrator's idea of an appropriate award based strictly on

the facts, Y represents the mean of the parties' last offers, and       is the

weight on the appropriate award relative to the last offers. This is the

framework underlying much of the recent empirical analyses of arbitrator

behavior. Some empirical studies (Bloom, 1986) have proceeded under the

assumption that   is fixed while others (Bazerman and Farber, 1985; Farber and

Bazerman, 1986) have argued that      is a function of the quality of the offers.

Specifically, they argue that      is an increasing function of the difference

between the last offers.

      If it is assumed that the weight on the offers (1—v) is fixed then the

problem of unboundedness of the last offers remains. Imagine that the first

party is interested in maximizing      and the second party is interested in

minimizing Y. Clearly, the first party can increase Y5 without limit by

increasing its offer which increases Y, and the second party can decrease

without limit by decreasing its offer which decreases Y.

     Farber (1981) considers the case where '    is   sensitive to the quality of

the offers and where the parties are uncertain about 'e       In this situation,

 each side i f;e t. ]ect         1t off: so as to maximize its expected

 utility from an arbitration award. The Nash equilibrium pair of offers is

 derived, and it is demonstrated that the last offers are bounded.

 Interestingly, it is also shown that what appears to be splitting—the—

 difference behavior by the arbitrators (arbitration awards that can be

 described as weighted averages of the offers) nay well be the parties choosing

 offers that "surround" the expectation of the arbitrator's appropriate award.

 To the extent that this is the correct model of arbitrator behavior, the

 degree of chilling of bargaining in CA depends on the marginal effect of

 changes in the offers on the arbitration award, and it can only be resolved

 empirically.

       The key studies that provide estimates of   are Bazerman (1985),

Bazerman and Farber (1985), Bloom (1986), and Farber and Bazerman (1986).

Bazermari and Farber use data derived from decisions of professional

arbitrators in twenty—five rather tersely described hypothetical cases that

were constructed so that the offers were orthogonal to the facts. They find

both that the primary weight is on the facts of each case even where the

offers are of relatively high quality (close together) and that the weight on

the offers declines as the offers move further apart. Bloom uses data derived

from the decisions of professional arbitrators in hypothetical cases that were

patterned very closely after actual cases involving public sector employees in

New Jersey. The arbitrators were presented with a complete record of facts of

these cases while the offers were modified in each case when presented to

different arbitrators in order to provide a range of offers corresponding to a

given set of facts. There was no attempt to make the offers orthogonal to the

facts. Bloom finds that the primary weight is on the offers so that, while

the facts can have a substantial effect on the arbitration award indirectly

through their effect on the offers, splitting—the—difference is quite a good

description     o arbitrator behavior in CA.

        What accounts for the seeming difference between the findings of these

studies? In our opinion it is largely a matter of interpretation. The

apparent difference occurs because of the orthogonality of the facts and

offers in Bazerman and Farber's study as opposed to the correlation of the

facts and the offers in Bloom's study. What Bloom defines as the effect of

the offers is, as he recognizes, some combination of the pure effect of the

offers and the effect of that part of the offers that simply reflects the

facts of the case.

        In order to see this more clearly, consider the model of arbitrator

behavior described above with fixed .             Bloom essentially regresses the

arbitration award on the average offer and a set of variable summarizing the

facts. This regression model is

        (4.2) Ys    =0 0 +eY
                           le +OY+E
                                2

where 0i and 02 are the weights on the facts                 and the offers (Y)
                                                    6
respectively,     and E is a random component.          However, the average offer can be

thought of as a linear combination of the facts and a random component so that

        (4.3) y=0 +Y le
                      +i.i
where      and      are parameters and i is a random component. Substitution of

equation (4.3) into equation (4.2) yields the "reduced form"

        (4.4)    Y=   Ee0+e20]
                                 +
                                     [e1+e2.1]Y
                                                    +
                                                        tE+eMJ
It is clear from this expression that the overall effect of the facts on the
arbitration award is [e1+e21 rather than simply ei. Bloom's conclusion that

splitting—the—difference     is a    good description of     the   behavior of   arbitrators

in   CA is based on the lack of significance of the estimate of              when equation




      6. This equation is the empirical analogue of equation (4.1) with fixed .
                                      15



 (42) is estimated. However, it neglects the indirect effect of Y through

 the offers on the award.7

       Bloom's findings are properly interpreted as implying that the facts

 alone are not sufficient to explain arbitrator behavior in CA (82>0), but it

 is impossible to determine exactly how important the offers are without an

 estimate of how the facts affect the offers          Of course, in actual cases
                                               (.).
 the offers are not often at odds with facts. Farber's (1981) model suggests

 that the offers largely reflect the facts of a particular case so that the

 observed offers will not be orthogonal to the observed facts. Bazerxnan and

Farber's experiment of generating arbitration awards where the offers are

orthogonal to the facts (si=0) provides a clearer measure of the relative

importance of the offers and the facts in influencing arbitration awards.



V. Arbitrator Behavior in Final—Offer Arbitration

      The behavior of the arbitrator is much clearer in FOA than in CA due to

the restricted nature of the arbitrators behavior in the final—offer case.

There is no debate regarding whether or the extent to which the arbitrator use

the offers in making an award. The rules of FOA require use of the offers.

Similarly, there is consensus that the arbitrator uses the facts in selecting

that "winning" final offer. After all, what else could the arbitrator use to

make a reasoned choice?8 This section is relatively brief, reflecting the

general agreement regarding arbitrator behavior under FOA rather than any lack

of understanding or interest in FOA relative to CA.




    7. No evidence on the magnitude of    is presented, but it is clearly
positive from Bloom's description of the way in which the scenarios were
developed.
    8. As vii]. be discussed in the last section of this paper, this
transparency of arbitrator behavior may be part of the explanation for fewer
disagreements under FOA.
                                     16


      Farber (1980a) argues that where the arbitrator is constrained to select

one or the other of the last offers as the arbitration award he/she will

select the offer that is closest to the arbitrator's notion of an appropriate

award (Y)• In this case, the probability of choosing the firm's offer is

Pr(Y<Y), and each party selects the offer that maximizes its expected

utility. The tradeoff for the union is that a higher offer is worth more if

it is selected but it has a lower probability of being selected. The firm

faces an analogous tradeoff. Farber (1980a) derives the Nash equilibrium pair

of offers in the FOA case. Given the tradeoff inherent in the final—offer

process, the offers are bounded and there is no obvious chilling effect. This

combined with the aforementioned ambiguity regarding arbitrator behavior in CA

is the basis of the conventional wisdom that the availability of FOA is more

likely to result in a negotiated settlement than CA.9

        Ashenfelter and Bloom (1984) and Farber and Bazerman (1986) present

evidence that is consistent with this model. Ashenfelter and Bloom, using

data on actual police and fire arbitrations in New Jersey, find that the

probability of selecting the employer's offer is directly related to the

average final offer. In addition, they find that the determinants of

implicit in FOA awards are not significantly different from the determinants

of e implicit in the CA awards. Farber and Bazerman, using data generated

from the same set of hypothetical cases decided by professional arbitrators

described in the previous section, reach similar conclusions. In addition,

they have data on both conventional and final—offer awards in the same cases

that are used to strengthen the conclusion that there is common underlying




    9. As long as the weight on the offers relative to the facts is a function
of the quality of the offers, the offers are also bounded in CA. One of the
themes of this study is that it is not obvious, a priori, which type of
arbitration ought to lead to less disagreement.

  notion of an appropriate award that governs arbitrator behavior in both CA arid

  FOA.




  VI. The   Specification   of the Nodel

          To the extent possible the calculations of the identical—expectations

 contract zones are based on empirical estimates of the relevant behavioral

 functions. Central to the analysis is the behavior of the arbitrators, and we

 rely on estimates of the models of arbitrator behavior in CA and FOA derived

 by Farber and Bazernan (1986). This is a particularly convenient choice

 because the hypothetical cases that their arbitrators decide can be integrated

 into a general model of negotiator behavior very conveniently. In the model

 of CA, the key parameters represent the sensitivity of the arbitration award

 to changes in the offers. Recall from equation (4.1) that the arbitration

 award is a weighted average of the arbitrator's notion of an appropriate award

         and the average of the offers (Y). The key idea is that the weight

depends on the quality of the offers so that the weight the arbitrator puts on

   is inversely related to the quality of the offers.      The function used by
Farber and Bazerman is

         (6.1)     =    +

where Y and Y are the offers of the union and
                                              management respectively. The
parameter        is positive reflecting the notion that the weight on the offers

(1—i) is relatively low where the parties are far from agreement.

         Bazerman and Farber derive surprisingly large estimates for   at the

observed differences in offers which suggests that the arbitrator puts most of

the weight on the facts exclusive of the offers. A summary of Bazerman and

Farber's estimates is
                                             18


       (6.2)     =   .'4i   +    153yurn
                                      —Y ]

                     (.0504) (.603)

where the numbers in parenthesis are asymptotic standard errors. The range of

difference between the offers in the hypothetical cases was from approximately

.01 (1 percentage point in the wage increase) to .12 (12 percentage points in

the wage increase). Clearly, the smallest predicted value of            is .74

(se=.05) so that even where the parties are              close to agreement three

quarters of the weight is on the facts. At the largest sample values of Y—

     the predicted value of          is approximately .93 (se=.03). Thus, the

marginal effect of a change in the offers on the weights is relatively small.

      Given the much smaller value for            implicit in the recent study by Bloom

(1986), the identical—expectations contract zones will also be computed using

lover values for           for comparison. While Bloom's work does not address the

issue of the sensitivity of the weights to the quality of the offers,

identical—expectations contract zones will also be computed using a variety of

values of      in order to investigate the how sensitive the identical—

expectations contract zone is to this parameter.

       The other parameter of interest from the Farber and Bazermam estimation

is the variance of ''e to the extent that this is a plausible estimate of the

parties' uncertainty regarding Y. They specify the function determining

as

       (6.3)   '1e =   X    +
where X is a vector of observable characteristics of each case,            is a vector

of parameters, and E        is   a random component. Assuming that    and X are known

exante, the relevant variance is the variance of E.            Farber and Bazerman's

estimate of this variance is .000449 (se=.0000228))0



    10. Farber and Bazerman also estimate the variance of an additive error
implicit in equation (4.1) determining the actual award. This variance is
                                          19


        In FOA, the arbitrator is assumed to se.ect the offer that is closest to

 'e Clearly, the weighting function ()         is   not relevant. However, the

 variance of ''e is central, and the estimate of the variance of E           derived by
 Farber and Bazerman for FOA is .000344 (se=.0000243). This is very close to

 the variance of E   in   the CA case although the hypothesis that the variances

 are equal can be rejected at conventional levels of significance11             We proceed
 using a common value of .0004 for the variance of e although identical—

 expectations contract zones are also calculated for a range of other values

 for comparison purposes.

       Bazerman (1985) finds that arbitrators differ substantially in the

 weights they place on the various factors that determine e In other words,

   differs across arbitrators. The parties are likely to be uncertain about

 what arbitrator they will get, yielding a prior distribution on .              In   this

 case, assuming independence of      and ,             =   X{VAR()]x'   +   VAR(E) which
                                             VAR(Ye)
 is certainly larger than VAR(E). Given that the uncertainty regarding the

identity of the arbitrator is revealed before the arbitration award, the

uncertainty about ?e is reduced at this stage. In some cases the parties

might bargain to this stage in order to see if they get a "good" arbitrator,

and once this uncertainty is resolved they would settle. This could explain

why settlements occur between the point in the process when the arbitrator is

appointed and when the arbitration hearing takes place.12 Given the

difficulty of incorporating this feature of the process into the computations



much smaller: .0000114 (se=.00000395). We ignore this source of randomness
here here.
    11. The differences in variances is 1.05x10—4 while the standard error of
the difference is .384x10—4. Note that the conventional and final—offer
decisions were analyzed jointly so that there is a covariance between the
estimated variances that was taken into account in computing the variance of
the difference. See Farber and Bazerman (1986).
    12. Bloom and Cavanagh (1986) present an interesting analysis of the
arbitration selection mechanism that has implications for this discussion.
                                             20



and the fact that uncertainty regarding the identity of the arbitrator is

often revealed before the last offers are finalized, this source of

uncertainty does not play a direct role in our calculations.

        The central aspect of both union and employer preferences that is

relevant for the determination of the identical—expectations contract zone is

attitude toward risk. While there is an extensive empirical literature on

union utility functions, there is little evidence that bears directly on the

degree of risk aversion.'3 Similarly, most of the literature on firm behavior

assumes risk neutrality, but this is not evidence on attitude toward risk.

        The analysis proceeds by assuming that the parties have constant

absolute risk aversion utility functions defined over wages that are

symmetrical in form. The union's utility function is

        (6.4) U(Y) =        1 -
                                  exp[—6(Y—Y1)]
where &
          u
              is   the union's coefficient of absolute risk aversion and Y1

represents a minimum value of Y that serves as a benchmark to the union.

Similarly, the employer's utility function is

        (6.5) U(Y) =        1 -
                                  exp{—&(Yh-Y)]
where         is the employer's coefficient of absolute risk aversion and

represents a maximum value of Y that serves as a benchmark to the employer.

The union's utility is increasing in Y while the employer's utility is

decreasing in Y. Without an empirical guide to appropriate values for         and




     13. Farber (1978), Dertouzos and Pencavel (1980), Carruth and Oswald
(1983) , Pencavel (1984) , Brown and Ashenfelter (1986) , and MaCurdy and
Pencavel (1986) all present studies of union behavior based on utility
maximization. Only Farber (1978) presents an explicit estimate of the union's
risk aversion. However, his estimate is based on the tradeoff between wages
and employment in determining wages, and this is not really the sort of risk
considered here. Farber (1986) presents a survey of this literature. See
Tversky and Kahrieman (1974) and Bazerman (1986) for more general behavioral
discussions of decision making under uncertainty.

 values of s and      ranging from 5 to ioo.14

       It is assumed that the parties' prior distribution on ''e is normal with

 mean .1 (think of this as an average 10 percent wage increase) and variance

 .0004. The particular value selected for the mean is not crucial, and the

 qualitative nature of the findings will not be affected by a different choice

 of mean. The crucial assumption regarding the mean is that both parties's

 beliefs about V are identical. On the the basis of this assumption and the

 definition of Y in equation (4.1), the actual CA award is also distributed

 normally (conditional on the offers) with mean

       (6.6) E(Y) =   E(Y)   + (1—)Y)

and variance

       (6.7) Var(Y) =   2Var(Y).
Given that
               0+' (Y —Y ), it
                    lum          is clear that both the mean and variance of the

distribution of actual awards are functions of the offers.

      The expected utility of the union in CA is

      (6.8) E(U) =               f(Y) dY,
                      J' U(Y)
where f(Y) is the appropriate normal density function.     Similarly, the

employer's expected utility in CA is

      (6.9) E(U) =      U(Y)     f(Y) dY.
Both of these expected utilities are functions of the offers because   Y is
fundamentally affected by the offers both directly and through the '   function.
The direct effect of an increase in the union's offer or a decrease in the

employer's offer on the arbitration award is offset by a reduction in the

weight placed on the offers. This is the tradeoff faced by the parties in



    14. Given an average value of Y of .1, this range of absolute risk
aversions translates into a range o relative risk aversions of .5 to 10.

selecting th€ir    offers.   It each party can manipulate its last offer so as to

maximize its own expected utility, a natural equilibrium concept is the Nash

Equilibrium. This is the pair of offers that has the property that neither

party can increase its expected utility by changing its offer.

        Given the Nash equilibrium offers, it is straightforward to derive the

certainty equivalent outcomes that determine the limits of the identical—

expectations contract zone as described in section III. If at least one party

is risk averse (>O or £>0) and neither party is risk seeking (0 and

         it is true that this identical—expectations contract zone will be of

positive length.

        In FOA, the arbitrator is constrained to select one or the other of the

parties' final offers. In this case the arbitrator is assumed to select the

offer that is closest to Y. Given the assumption of a normal distribution

for Y described above, the probability of choosing the employer's offer is

        (6.10) m =   Pr(Y(Y)   = F(Y)

where F(•) represents the normal cumulative distribution function of ''e with

appropriate mean and variance. The union's expected utility from arbitration

in this case is

        (6.11) E(IJ ) = P U (Y ) + [1—P ]U U(Y U
                   u     mu in         m

while   the employer's expected utility from arbitration is

        (6.12) E(U ) = P U (Y ) + [1—P ]U (Y u).
                  in    mm m          in in

Note that an increase in the union's offer increases its payoff if its offer

is selected, but it reduces the probability that its offer is, in fact,

selected. Similarly, a decrease in the management's offer increases its

payoff if its offer is selected, but it reduces the probability that its offer

is, in fact, selected. This is the fundamental tradeoff the parties face in

selecting their optimal offers in FOA. The Nash equilibrium pair of offers,

are derived as above. These offers are used to compute the levels of expected

  utilities that define tne certainty equivalent outcoes, Y    and Y , that are

  the limits of the identical—expectations contract zone. Once again, as long

 as at least one party is risk averse and neither party is risk seeking, it

 will be true that y <y

 expectations contract zone.

       Denote the size of the identical—expectations contract zone under CA and

 FOA by CZ and CZf respectively. The analysis consists of computing values of

 CZ and CZf using the assumed specification of union and employer preferences

 described above combined with the specification of arbitrator behavior based

 on Farber and Bazerman's (1986) explicitly estimated model of arbitrator

 behavior. These identical—expectations contract zones are computed for a

 range of values of union and employer risk aversions, levels of uncertainty

 about e' and parameters of the arbitrator's weighting function ()     in   CA.



VII. Estimates of Identical—Expectations Contract Zone Size

      Table 1 contains estimates of identical—expectations contract zone size

in CA and FOA for a range of levels of risk aversions and variance of Y .
                                                                       e
                                                                                  All
of these values are computed at the point estimates of     and   presented in

the last section and derived from Farber and Bazerman (1986). The results are

quite striking. Except at the lowest levels of risk aversion, where CZ and

CZf are virtually indistinguishable, the identical—expectations contract zones

in CA are uniformly larger than the identical—expectations contract zones in

FOA. As expected, the identical—expectations contract zones increase in size

with the variance of 'te' but the finding of larger identical-expectations

contract zones in CA persists. In addition, the differences are not small.

For example, the identical—expectations contract zone is fully two and one

half times larger in CA for the intermediate case where & =& =50 and

  percentage points of wage increase in FOA.

        It is possible that the finding that the identical—expectations contract

 zone is larger in CA than in FOA is quite sensitive to the particular values

 selected for        and .   In   order to investigate this more fully, table 2

 contains estimates of identical—expectations contract zone size in CA and FOA

 for a range of values of         and     All   of these values are computed assuming

 that Var(Y)=.0004, and the estimates of the identical—expectations contract

 the choice of '.

       The second column of table 2 contains estimates of the identical—

 expectations contract zone in CA for the actual point estimates derived by

 Farber and Bazerman (1986) ('o=.741, 'i153). The third column contains the

 estimates for a model meant to reflect Bloom's (1986) conclusion that

this case,      is unchanged while       is reduced to 0.25 so that the weight on

contract zones are not at all affected by a shift in          holding the other

that the divergent expectations model of disagreement is not what is driving

the higher rate of disagreement in CA relative to FOIL



VIII. Alternative Explanations for Disagreement

      The evidence presented in this paper clearly suggests that the divergent

expectations argument does not fully explain the disagreements that occur in




    15. For the equilibrium value of   to be independent of    it must be the
case that where    is lower the equilibrium offers must be further apart in
order to compensae (increase the value of ). This is confirmed in table 4.
However, the uncertainty regarding the arbitration award comes solely from Y
so that the contract zone is unchanged as long as ' is unchanged.             e
    16. Of course, the findings may not be robust to changes in the functional

the labor—managenent negotiations. In fact, the ide'tical—expectations

contract zones are in direct contrast to the predictions of the divergent

expectations argument. Other explanations of disagreement are necessary. We

propose four alternatives based on an analysis of economic, structural, and

cognitive features of the negotiation process. For each explanation, we

evaluate the degree to which the predictions of that explanation are

consistent with our evidence.

      One class of models that has been suggested recently as an equilibrium

explanation for disagreements in bargaining is based on the idea that there is

asymmetric information held by party 1 that party 2 attempts to learn about by

making offers that party 1 is free to accept or reject (.e.g. Fudenberg and

Tirole, 1981; Sobel and Takahashi, 1983; and Tracy, 1986) .   The most common

form of the argument (very simplified here) is that firms have private

information about their profitability that they cannot credibly transmit to

the union. In a two period model, the union formulates a first—period demand

that the firm will accept if it is high profit (resulting in agreement) and

reject if it is low profit (resulting in disagreement). This strategy is

optimal from the union's point of view since it would like a high wage if

possible. The firm can only make credible the fact that it is low profit by

incurring the cost of disagreement. Hence, there will be disagreement some of

the time. This theory has the clear implication (Tracy, 1986) that there will

be less disagreement where the total costs of disagreement are higher.

      Given that identical—expectations contract zone size is an indicator of

total costs of disagreement, this simple theory predicts that there would be

less disagreement where the identical—expectations contract zone is smaller.

This is not consistent with the basic evidence that identical—expectations

contract zones are larger and there is more disagreement in CA than in FOA.

This suggests that learning in at least such simple models of asymmetric
                                      27


 i:formation s not a sufficient explanation of disagreement.

       Another recent alternative classs of models of disagreement has been

 developed by Crawford (1982) and is based on Schelling's (1956) model of

 commitment. The basic idea is that it may be advantageous in bargaining for

 the parties to commit to a position that would be very costly to disavow.

 Crawford (1982) develops a model where the potential for commitment by both

 parties can lead to disagreement as long as there is an element of

 irreversibility in the commitment and there is uncertainty about the strength

of the parties' commitments. A sketch of the model is that commitment is

reversible only at some uncertain cost and neither party knows this cost ex

ante. In the first stage of bargaining in this model the parties determine

whether they will attempt commitment. In the second stage, the cost of

backing down is revealed to each party but not to the other party. At this

point each party determines if they should back down, not knowing for certain

whether the other party will back down.

      Three classes of outcomes are possible. If both parties commit, there

is disagreement. If only one party commits, that party gets a favorable

settlement. Finally, if neither party commits, there is some solution concept

that leads to agreement. The key is that there is a nonzero probability that

both parties commit successfully, resulting in disagreement. Anything that

increases the payoff to commitment will increase the probability of successful

commitment and, hence, the probability of disagreement. Where the contract

zone is large, a successful commitment may or may not have a larger payoff.

Crawford argues that there is no clear prediction of the model regarding the

extent to which the size of the contract zone affects the likelihood of

commitment. However, he concludes that the conditions on the model required

to predict unambiguously that larger contract zones lead to less commitment

(and hence less disagreement) are not likely to be satisfied.
                                         28


      W±t-i   regard   to the evidence, this commitment theory has no implicationt

for the relationship between contract zone size and the likelihood of

agreement. Indeed, it is difficult to think of what evidence could be used to

test this theory. Thus, while the commitment theory does not contradict the

evidence, this is simply because of a lack of a clear prediction. The theory

does not predict the strong pattern of evidence.

      The third alternative explanation of disagreement concerns the

structural feature of the arbitration process that arbitrators often receive

information from the parties in hearings regarding the course of negotiations.

In this context, it will be difficult for the parties to "retrench" from

concessions made in bargaining in order to present the optimal offers to the

arbitrators. For example, if the union's optinal offer for the arbitrator is

a 10 percent wage increase but it's certainty equivalent is 6 percent (the

least it will accept in bargaining), the union may be reluctant to concede

much below ten percent if it is uncertain about reaching agreement for fear an

offer to settle of, say, 8 percent will be used against it in the hearing with

the arbitrator.17 It is reasonable to argue that where the equilibrium offers

to be presented to the arbitrator are farther apart, the parties will be more

reluctant to concede in bargaining. In addition, where the parties are far

apart, perhaps because of a reluctance to concede, they are likely to be less

certain that a negotiated settlement is possible. Where the optimal offers

are closer together, the parties will more likely be able to concede to a




    17. In the civil—court system, which is perfectly analogous to labor
arbitration (out—of-court settlement = negotiated settlement, trial outcome =
arbitration award), offers to settle out of court are not admissible as
evidence in a trial. This is precisely to avoid a reluctance to concede in
attempts to reach a negotiated settlement. Wheeler (1977) suggests that
arbitration procedures be modified to more closely reflect the civil—court
system by having the record of the negotiations not admissible. He calls his
procedure closed—offer arbitration.

  point where agreement looks more certain, encouraging further concession and

  eventual agreement.

        With regard to the evidence presented above, the higher settlement rates

 in FOA are consistent with this argument if the optimal offers in FOA are

 closer together than the optimal offers in CA. Table 3 contains calculations

 of the differences in the final offers for the values of union and employer

 risk aversion and the level of uncertainty regarding '1e used in the previous

 section. In every case, the offers are much farther apart in CA than in FOA

 (in the intermediate case (& =& =50, Var=.0004) by a factor of 5). Table 4

 contains estimates of the difference in the offers for various values of the

 parameters of the CA weighting function. Except for the case (column 5) where

 the weight is extremely sensitive to the difference in the offers (=5.0), it

 is true that the offers are much further apart in CA than FOA. In the middle

 risk aversion case (8=5=50) approximating Bloom's estimates of the weighting

 function ('=.25. i=1.53), the difference in offers in CA is fully 18 times

larger than the difference in the offers in FOA (.453 versus .0251).

Intuitively, where the marginal effect of a change in the offers on '    is   small
 (column 3), the equilibrium offers in CA will be far apart. Where the

marginal effect is large, the equilibrium offers will be close together

(column 4).

      The evidence is clearly consistent with the hypothesis that the higher

settlement rate in FOA is due to the convergence of the optimal offers in FOA

combined with the structural features of the arbitration process that make it

difficult to retrench to the optimal offers once concessions beyond that point

have been made.

      The final potential explanation of disagreement is based on the notion

that the effect of the offers on the arbitration award is much more salient to

the parties in FOA than in CA. That this is possible is obvious from the

structur€s of the two procedures. In FOA there is no escaping consideration

of the direct effect that a party's offer will have on the arbitration award.

In CA, the parties could well ignore the effects that their offers have on the

awards and maintain extreme positions. In essence, this argument has as its

base that the parties do not calculate the optimal offers the way that was

outlined above in CA. In FOA they may do something closer to what was

outlined for that procedure because FOA is structured in a way that highlights

the relevant tradeoffs. In the context of negotiation, there is evidence from

the laboratory (Bazerman and Carroll, 1987) that negotiators are generally not

very good at working out the structure of the game they are playing or

considering the perspective of opponents and third parties. At the same time

there is laboratory evidence (Bazerxnan and Neale, 1982; Neale and Bazerman,

1983) that FOA encourages more concessionary behavior than CA precisely

because its structure encourages each party to take the perspective of the

other party, a trait that they show leads to more agreement.



      Overall, the evidence presented in this study (higher settlement rates

in FOA relative to CA, larger identical—expectations contract zones in CA, and

more disperse offers in CA) casts some doubt that a divergence of expectations

regarding the disagreement outcome is the primary cause of failure to reach a

negotiated settlement. The evidence also is not consistent with the view that

labor disputes are due to optimal learning by one party in a situation where

there is private information held by one party that can be extracted through a

labor dispute. The model of disagreement as the result of commitment

strategies considered here has no clear implications for our evidence so that



    18. It is also obvious from the presentations in sections IV and V of
arbitrator behavior in CA and FOA respectively. The discussion of CA is long
and involved while the discussion of FOA is relatively concise.

it cannot be evaluated here. A pair of alternatives that are consistent with

the evidence are presented including 1) a reluctance to concede where the

optimal offers for the arbitrator are far apart in fear that concessions could

"come back to haunt them" in arbitration and 2) a lack of salience of the role

of the offers leading to a failure to take the opponents perspective in CA.
