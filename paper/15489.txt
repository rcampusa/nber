                                              ABSTRACT

Due to improving information technology, the growing complexity of research problems, and policies
designed to foster interdisciplinary research, the practice of science in the United States has undergone
significant structural change. Using a sample of 110 top U.S. universities observed during the late
20th century we find that knowledge flows, both in total and in their major components, are a significant
and positive determinant of research output. Outside knowledge-flows from other universities have
increased at a faster rate than inside flows from the same university. Over time, the importance of
outside flows for research output has risen, and it has done so at a faster rate than the importance of
inside flows has decreased. Thus the overall contribution of knowledge-flows has increased and has
shifted towards outside flows.

Turning to knowledge-flows by field, we find that interdisciplinary knowledge-flows have increased
only slightly relative to same field flows, despite policy initiatives that favor interdisciplinary research.
Moreover, the importance of interdisciplinary flows for research output, while positive and statistically
highly significant, has stayed about the same, even as same field flows have become more important,
probably because of growth in cyber infrastructure. Although a final verdict is yet to be reached, one
interpretation is that interdisciplinary research is still in its early stages. While interdisciplinary flows
have begun to increase, the resulting discoveries, and their influence on subsequent research, may
still lie in the future.

   I.      Introduction
   What role does information technology play in the choice between local research, distant

research, and research within a field versus between fields? Can science policy bring scientists

together from different fields to produce significant hybrid research? And do these synthetic

discoveries exert a rising influence on subsequent research? In this paper we explore these

questions using a panel of 110 top U.S. universities.

   Any such study must come to grips, either informally or formally, with the self-interests of

researchers. Scientists search for knowledge that is useful for their own work. That in turn

contributes to the pleasure of discovery, to promotion and wage growth, and to the chance of

prestigious awards. Taking these goals as given, search is conditioned by characteristics of

knowledge that affect its costs and returns. These characteristics include distinctions between

the same and other universities and fields. Put differently, search is shaped by inside, outside,

and interdisciplinary dimensions of knowledge. The resulting knowledge-flows depend on the

costs and returns from search. For example, interdisciplinary flows will be meager if it is more

costly to acquire knowledge from other fields. Conversely, the flows will increase if policy

creates research centers which encourage joint research by scientists from different fields.

   To explore these questions we use a panel of fields, universities, and years, observed during

1981-1999. The data account for most academic research in the U.S., and in combination with a

similar panel for firms, they account for most scientific research in the U.S. Using a definition of

knowledge-flows equal to citation-weighted Research and Development (R&D) stocks, we

obtain the following findings. First, the share in all knowledge-flows of outside knowledge from

other universities increases by 30%. Hence outside flows rise relative to inside flows from the

same university. The share of interdisciplinary flows also increases, but the increase is slight,
about 10% across fields. The interdisciplinary share rises faster, by 70%, in engineering and

mathematics. But the share declines or remains flat in astronomy, computer science, economics

and business, medicine, and physics.

    Given the rising use of interdisciplinary research in engineering, we undertake a detailed

study of citation flows for engineering subfields. We observe a drop in the citation share from

the same subfield, a flat share for other engineering, and a rising share for science outside

engineering. We undertake a similar study for mathematics and statistics. Pure and applied

mathematics increasingly cites physics, while statistics increasingly cites biology and medicine.

Since engineering and mathematics are the focal point of U.S. policies favoring interdisciplinary

research, it appears that the policies may have had some effect on these disciplines.

    Much of the paper explores the role of knowledge-flows on research “output” as measured by

papers or citations received. We find that knowledge-flows uniformly increase papers and

citations1. This applies to all major knowledge-flows, including those from the same university

or field and from other universities or fields. Outside knowledge-flows from other universities

are more important than inside knowledge-flows from the same university. Moreover, the

importance of outside flows has increased at a faster rate than the importance of inside flows has

decreased, so that over time knowledge-flows contribute more to research output. Also,

knowledge-flows from the same field are more important than knowledge-flows from other

fields, though both contribute significantly to scientific discovery. The importance of flows from

the same field again increases, with most of this coming from other universities. Turning to

interdisciplinary flows, we find that knowledge-flows from other fields and the same university

are as important as flows from other fields and other universities. Thus interdisciplinary flows


1
   Importance is measured by the output elasticity with respect to each knowledge-flow. In turn the output elasticity
is the percent change in research output per one percent change in a flow.

                                                              2
are more localized than same field flows. We also consider knowledge-flows from “hot”

interdisciplinary fields, whose share is increasing, separately from “cold” fields, whose share is

flat or decreasing. We find that the importance of “hot” fields in production does not rise

relative to “cold”, nor are “hot” fields consistently more important than “cold” fields.

Interdisciplinary research, while promising, does not assume a larger role in the production of

new scientific ideas during this period. Since interdisciplinary flows result from changes in

policy and search costs as well as production, their share in knowledge-flows could increase

slightly, even though their importance in production remains about the same.

   This analysis has several implications. Since knowledge from the same university declines in

importance relative to knowledge from other universities, the private incentives of investigators,

as conditioned by policy and growth of cyber infrastructure, favor a more outward university

system, and that in turn has contributed to productivity. And since interdisciplinary knowledge-

flows increase slowly relative to all flows and even decrease in some fields, then despite

encouragement from science policy, researchers are voting with their minds against looking

outside their discipline for knowledge thought to be instrumental to their success. Even so, in

coming years interdisciplinary research may grow in importance. The rising share of

interdisciplinary flows in engineering and mathematics could be an early sign of this change.

   The rest of the paper is arranged as follows. Section II is a literature review and a review of

recent policies towards interdisciplinary research. Section III presents the analytical framework.

Data and variable construction take up Section IV, while Section V provides a descriptive

overview of the key variables. Section VI consists of regression analysis of the production of

scientific papers in universities, with emphasis on interdisciplinary research. Section VII

undertakes a brief comparative analysis for firms. Section VIII is a summary and conclusion.

    II.      Review of the Literature
             A. Conceptual Studies
          The size of teams and the extent of collaboration have risen steadily over the 20th century

(Zuckerman and Merton, 1973; De Sola Price, 1986; Hicks and Katz, 1996), with clear

implications for citation patterns. Co-location of team workers is less common because of

growing cyber infrastructure, and likewise the composition of teams has become more

international in scope (Adams, Black, Clemmons and Stephan, 2005). Rosenblat and Mobius

(2004) suggest that cyber infrastructure promotes substitution of collaboration within disciplines

for collaboration between disciplines.

          Interdisciplinary research in particular depends on collaboration to reduce the cost of

combining disciplines. Thus Katz and Martin (1997) point out that collaboration is logically

connected to specialization within conventional disciplines as well as research teams cutting

across disciplines and institutions. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences (Committee on

Science, Engineering, and Public Policy, 2004) considers interdisciplinary teams. The report

asserts, though it does not prove, that notable advances in science depend on this kind of

research. However, it admits that interdisciplinary research imposes high learning costs on team

workers, and that it reduces publication rates and the chance of winning tenure. Interdisciplinary

teams also impose higher internal communication costs (Jeffries, 2003).

          Holton, Chang and Jurkowitz (1996) underscore these considerations in their remarkable

case study of high temperature superconductivity. Preconditions at IBM Zurich consisting of

high-quality, long term research in many disciplines helped make this discovery possible2. But

the quality and range of the co-discoverers, Muller and Bednorz, as well as the esthetic sense of


2
 For other discoveries that entail a degree of interdisciplinary research, see Nelson (1962) for the transistor and
Hounshell and Smith (1988) for nylon and the artificial fibers.

                                                                4
Muller developed over several decades—these too were essential. So while interdisciplinary

research may figure into great discoveries, its costs exceed those of traditional research.

       Corley, Boardman, and Bozeman (2006) find that large science projects spanning

multiple institutions and disciplines require a high level of development of knowledge and

organizational structure to provide rules for the collaboration. Adams, Chiang, and Jensen

(2001), and Boardman and Corley (2008) emphasize the role of university research centers for

outside research collaboration. Boardman and Corley (2008) find that the centers increase

collaboration, but that the structure of the centers matters for the composition of collaboration.

For example industry-linked centers encourage joint work with industry that substitutes for joint

work with academia. These papers are a sample of research on collaboration.

            B. Policy Initiatives of the U.S. National Science Foundation
                 and the U.S. National Institutes of Health
   Recent U.S. policies favor collaborative and interdisciplinary research. The National Science

Foundation (NSF), which supports research in universities, promotes this research through its

NSF-Wide Investments, of which the NSF Centers are a leading example:

       Centers exploit opportunities in science, engineering, and technology in which the complexity of the research

       problem or the resources needed to solve the problem require the advantages of scope, scale, duration,

       equipment, facilities, and students. Centers are the principal means by which NSF fosters interdisciplinary

       research. –National Science Foundation (2009b), “NSF Centers and Funding”

The programs (founding dates) are: Engineering Research Centers (1985), Science and

Technology Centers (1987), Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (1994),

Centers for Analysis and Synthesis (1995), Centers for Chemical Innovation (1998),

Nanoscale Science and Engineering Centers (2001), and Science of Learning Centers




                                                                  5
(2003). Weighted by funding shares, the average year of founding is 19923. The centers

involve high-risk, long-term, but high payoff research. Recognizing this, NSF provides

seed money for 8-10 years and one stated purpose of the centers is to educate graduate

students for the next generation.

       Besides the centers NSF maintains the National Nanotechnology Initiative, whose

purpose is to understand and control matter at the atomic, molecular, and supra-molecular

levels, and which, as an NSF-wide investment has an interdisciplinary component. New

NSF-wide investments are Cyber-Enabled Discovery and Innovation, and Science and

Engineering beyond Moore’s Law. While U.S. policies towards interdisciplinary

research have existed since the 1980s they have clearly gained momentum over time.

       Besides engineering programs NSF maintains a program in mathematical biology,

under Mathematical Sciences, that is designed to mesh with collaborating biology

programs. And the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which also supports universities,

operates Bioinformatics Resource Centers (NIH, 2009). These employ multi-disciplinary

teams of microbiologists, specialists in bioinformatics, and computer scientists. From

this discussion one would expect interdisciplinary citations to increase fastest in

engineering and mathematics and statistics. Section V finds that this is the case.

       III. Knowledge Production Function for Science
       The production of knowledge reflects a series of prior decisions. Among these are choices of

whether to carry out search within a discipline or between disciplines, and with which

disciplines. It is a question of which approach maximizes the life cycle utility of the scientist.

On the one hand, interdisciplinary research requires a more extensive division of labor and

coordination costs (Becker and Murphy, 1992). It imposes delays in carrying out research and it
3
    In 2007 total funding for the centers was 232.5 million dollars.

                                                                  6
entails an increased risk that combinations of diverse ideas will fail. On the other hand, it may

offer a better chance of research breakthroughs. Policies that subsidize interdisciplinary research

tilt scientists’ decisions in its favor. The state preference model (Hirshleifer and Riley, 1992)

seems capable of imbedding decisions on choice of productive method that reflect these

considerations. While space limitations preclude such modeling here, the choice of research

methods clearly depends on comparative costs and returns as well as policy.

       In Section VI we estimate a knowledge production function for science using a panel of

fields, universities, and years. To create a bridge to the empirical work, in this section we briefly

explore the details of this function, which relates new discoveries to physical assets and to

knowledge used in research. Production takes place in a university-field, defined as field i and

university j at time t . Assume a Cobb-Douglas production function for scientific discoveries:

                                                                             η
                    nijt = A exp( Z D′ δ ) R(ηijR) t −1 ∏w=1 ( S (wij ) t −1 )
                                                             W                   w
(1)                                                                                  exp(uijt )

The “output” of discoveries nijt is on the left: it is measured by papers or citations received. On

the right is A , output not elsewhere accounted for, and Z D′ , a vector of field, university, and time

fixed effects multiplied by coefficient vector δ 4. We include field fixed effects to absorb

differences in research output among disciplines. We use fixed effects for universities to absorb

permanent differences in institutional productivity. The university effects are fixed since the

universities that we study account for most academic R&D in the U.S. and are fixed in repeated

samples (Hsiao, 2003, Ch. 4). We include year fixed effects to capture secular changes in

research output not elsewhere accounted for. The inclusion of the different fixed effects is

standard practice in panel data econometrics for the reasons given. The stock of lagged R&D

R( ij ) t −1 captures tangible assets in a field and university: computers and laboratory equipment,

4
    Fixed effects are dummy variables equal to 1 if something is true and 0 otherwise.

                                                                                 7
faculty release time, and student assistants, which accumulate in the course of past projects. In

contrast S (wij ) t −1 is a vector of lagged intangible knowledge-flows to a university-field from the

same and other universities; from the same and other fields; and from the same and other

universities and fields. The stock of R&D R( ij ) t −1 and the knowledge-flows S (wij ) t −1 are knowledge

inputs that are used to produce research output.

        The output elasticitiesη R and η w are percentage changes in output per one percent change

in the knowledge inputs. They indicate importance in production. Sometimes we letη w vary

with time to account for factor-biased technical change. In (1) uijt is the error term

(2)              uijt = vi + v j + vt + eijt

The vi , v j , vt terms are permanent variance-components for field, university, and time that are

absorbed by the fixed effects Z D′ so that uijt = Z D′ δ + eijt . In (2) eijt is the “innovation” in the error.

If this is uncorrelated over time, then inclusive of Z D′ eijt should be uncorrelated with the

knowledge inputs. Estimates of the regression coefficients should be unbiased, or identified.

        Taking logarithms of (1) and substituting (2) and uijt = Z D′ δ + eijt into the result we reach:


                 ln(nijt ) = β + Z D′ δ + ηR ln(R(ij ) t −1 ) + ∑w=1 ηw ln(S(wij ) t −1 ) + eijt
                                                                   W
(3)

Here β is the logarithm of A shown in (1). We estimate (3) in Section VI for universities and in

Section VII for firms.

      IV. Database
            A. Data Sources
        The underlying university data consist of 2.4 million unique scientific papers, published

during 1981-1999, that have at least one author from the top 110 U.S. universities. These


                                                                   8
universities account for more than 80 percent of academic R&D in the U.S.5.

        Papers consist of articles, reviews, notes, and proceedings. The data source is Thomson-

Reuters Scientific6. Papers are assigned to one of 88 fields according to the field classification

of the journal where they appear (see Adams and Clemmons, 2008 for a description). To link the

papers data to R&D expenditures in the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) CASPAR database

(NSF, 2009a) we assign each of the 88 fields to one of 12 NSF fields: agriculture, astronomy,

biology, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, economics and business, engineering,

mathematics and statistics, medicine, physics, and psychology.

        The Thomson-Reuters data record publication year, journal field, author names, and

address information that includes academic unit titles, as well as city, state and country.

Academic unit titles are assigned to universities by means of institutional directories developed

by Thomson-Reuters in the course of its construction of the Science and Social Science Citation

Indexes. The academic units are a compendium of administrative divisions of a university,

nearly all of which are departments or professional schools. Titles appear in addresses that are

separate from author names so that names cannot be assigned to universities. For this reason we

use academic units and not names to assign papers to universities. Consider a paper in medicine

that lists five addresses with five academic unit titles. Three are divisions of the Harvard

Medical School and Harvard University. The fourth is part of Yale and the fifth belongs to Johns

Hopkins. Given this assignment of academic units to universities, 3/5 of the paper is assigned to

Harvard, 1/5 to Yale, and 1/5 to Johns Hopkins. Let us now discuss the assignment of citations


5
  National Science Board (2002), Appendix Table 5-4, shows that in 1999 the top 100 U.S. universities account for
$22.10 billion of R&D out of $27.49 billion of R&D for all U.S. universities. This equals 80.4 percent. National
Science Board (2008), Appendix Table 5-11 indicates that in 2006 the top 100 account for $38.09 billion out of
$47.76 billion for all U.S. universities. This equals 79.8 percent. Since the sample consists of the top 110 and not
the top 100, its share in R&D expenditures exceeds 80 percent.
6
  The journal set consists of approximately 5500 journals that were active in 1999 as well as 1600 inactive (renamed
or discontinued) journals cited by active journals.

                                                              9
received. In the empirical work we use citations from the year of publication through the next

four years. We take out institutional self-citations. Then, to assign citations received by an

institution, we multiply the remaining citations received by the fraction of academic units that

belong to each university. In the example, suppose that Harvard receives 29 citations from other

universities, Yale receives 31; and Johns Hopkins 30. In this example we assign 3/5×29=17.4

fractional citations to Harvard, 1/5×31=6.2 to Yale, and 1/5×30=6 to Johns Hopkins.

       To construct the dependent variables we aggregate fractional papers and citations to the

level of fields, universities, and years. This yields observable measures of “outputs” of new

scientific discoveries in a university-field. We use lagged, deflated R&D expenditures in a

university-field to construct stocks of R&D over the previous eight years. For 1985 papers and

citations, say, we construct R&D stocks based on R&D expenditures from 1978 to 1984. The

NSF CASPAR database of universities (NSF, 2009a) provides the university R&D data. R&D

consists of all research funding, both external and internal. About 75 percent of university R&D

consists of basic research, 22 percent consists of applied research, and four percent consists of

development (National Science Board, 2008, Chapter 5).

       To create the knowledge-flows, we construct citations made by a field, university and

year to any field, university, and year and the number of papers that could have been cited.

Since the sample consists of the top 110 U.S. universities, citations occur among this set of

schools. The ratio of citations to papers potentially cited is a citation rate. We multiply this rate

by the stock of R&D in the cited field, university and year, where the R&D stock proxies for

stocks of knowledge produced. Then we sum the citation rates times cited R&D stocks for each

citing field, university, and year. This yields the knowledge-flows used in this paper.




                                                     10
        In building the panel we consider only highly ranked departments, plus a remainder that

aggregates the rest, so that we retain all the data. Our reason for constructing the remainder is to

avoid empty cells where fields are small or non-existent7. To capture quality of research

program we rely on rankings of doctoral programs. National Research Council’s 1993 Survey of

Doctoral Programs (NRC, 1995) is the source of these rankings. We include a larger number of

ranked departments in larger fields since more of the programs are ranked. In fact we include

the top 25 universities in astronomy, the top 50 in agriculture, chemistry, computer science,

economics and business, earth sciences, mathematics and statistics, physics, and psychology; and

the top 75 in biology, medicine, and engineering. Summing across fields and noting that 48

formal schools of agriculture exist, the panel consists of 648 university-fields in a given year.

Adding the 12 remainders, one for each discipline, we arrive at 660 university-fields.

        Although the data begin in 1981, backward references to scientific literature require at

least one lag, costing 1981, and a further lag of one year for the knowledge inputs costs 1982.

Thus the panel begins in 1983. It contains papers and citations received, lagged R&D stocks, and

lagged knowledge-flows for 660 university-fields in 12 sciences during 1983-1999. This implies

11,220 observations before exclusions due to missing values.

             B. Specification of the Variables
        Knowledge-flows are sums of cited R&D stocks multiplied by citation rates that

represent sampling rates8. We justify this by noting that the R&D stocks are correlated with

unobservable stocks of knowledge, so the product of the stocks and the citation rates yields a

measure of the proportion of knowledge that leaks out to a citing university-field9.



7
  The remainder equals an average university-field in individual ranked departments. This reflects the positive skew
of academic R&D. For more on this see Adams and Griliches (1998).

  For papers relating search to technological change see Nelson (1982) and Kortum (1997).

                                                             11
To express this in algebra note that the citation rate equals c ijtFkτ / nFkτ . The numerator c ijtFkτ equals

citations made by citing field i in university j in year t to cited field F in university k in prior

year τ ( τ < t ). It represents search effort10. Citations are divided by nFkτ , the count of scientific

papers in the cited field, university, and year. The resulting citation rate measures the intensity

with which researchers draw on knowledge stocks elsewhere. For a group of citing papers nijt the

citation rate c ijtFkτ / nFkτ is preferable to the citation probability c ijtFkτ / nijt nFkτ . For a single paper,

the citation probability captures the proportion of knowledge flowing from cited to citing groups

(Adams, Clemmons, and Stephan, forthcoming 2006). But if nijt papers cite nFkτ papers, then the

probability c ijtFkτ / nijt nFkτ times nijt equals the citation rate c ijtFkτ / nFkτ . This measures the

proportion of knowledge in the cited group that reaches a group of citing papers.

         Citations made to the same citing university are inside citations; those made to other

universities are outside citations. Citations made within a science are same field citations, while

citations outside a science are interdisciplinary in nature.

         The flow of inside knowledge from the same university is

                  SijtSame University = ∑F =1   ∑τ
                                                 t −1
                                                          (cijtFjτ / nFjτ )R Fjτ
                                         M
(4)                                                  =1

It is the sum over all fields, previous years, and the same university, of citation rates multiplied

by R&D stocks. In (4) the stock of university and field R&D is

                  RFjτ = ∑z=1 r( Fj) τ −z (1 − d ) z

   Since citations are distinguished by citing and cited field, university and year they are six dimensional. In our
notation subscripts stand for the three citing dimensions, while superscripts stand for cited dimensions. The order of
sub- (super-) scripts is always: field, university, and year.

                                                                       12
This is the sum of R&D expenditures rkFτ − z in a university-field over the previous eight years, in

millions of ’92 dollars, and assuming a depreciation rate d = 0.15 . R&D flows are drawn from

NSF’s CASPAR database (NSF, 2009a). To reduce simultaneity bias we lag (5) in production

function (3). We enter (5) as a separate variable to account for past resources of a university-

field not captured by knowledge-flows, so that we use R&D stock of a university-field in two

distinct ways: first as an indicator of tangible resources in (5), and second as a stock of

knowledge produced by those resources in (4). This double-duty reflects the dual nature of past

research activity in a university-field.

           The flow of outside knowledge from other universities is

It is the sum over all fields, other universities, and previous years.

            The same field knowledge-flow is

                       SijtSame Field = ∑k =1       ∑τ
                                                        t −1

In (7) the sum is taken over the same field, all universities, and previous years.

           The knowledge-flow from other fields, or the interdisciplinary flow, is

It is the sum over other fields, all universities, and previous years. Besides (4), (6)-(8) we

consider mixtures: SijtSame Field , Same University , SijtOther Fields, Same University , SijtSame Field , Other Universities , and

SijtOther Fields, Other Universities . All these variables are citation-weighted R&D stocks but let us call them

knowledge-flows. Sometimes the flows equal zero, so to take logarithms we add 0.001 to each

of the flows.




                                                                                        13
           For descriptive purposes we consider a scale-free measure of interdisciplinary research.

From (7) and (8) this is the interdisciplinary share in knowledge flows in field i at time t :

                                                SitOther Fields

                                          Sit
Likewise, using (4) and (6), we consider the share of outside knowledge-flows:

                                                     SitOther Universities

                                           SitSame University + SitOther Universities
With all of our preparations complete, we are ready for the empirical work.

      V.      Description of the Knowledge-Flows
              A. Field Size Distribution
           Figure 1 and 2 display average knowledge-flows to each of the citing fields. Figure 1

covers “large” R&D fields: engineering, chemistry, agriculture, physics, earth science, medicine,

and biology. Figure 2 covers “small” fields: mathematics and statistics, economics and business,

computer science, astronomy, and psychology. The smallest “large” field, engineering, has a

knowledge flow more than twice that of the largest “small” field, psychology. Flows to biology

and medicine exceed all the others. These differences follow the distribution of academic R&D

by field, since most citations occur within a field, and since, according to (7) and (8), the flows

are sums of cited R&D stocks weighted by citation rates11.

              B. Sources of Interdisciplinary Knowledge-Flows
           Table 1 examines sources of interdisciplinary knowledge-flows by citing field. The table

lists the three most cited fields for years 1983, 1991, and 1999. Biology and medicine become




11
  National Science Board (2008), Appendix Table 5-4 contains the following data from 1999 on the percentage
distribution of R&D expenditures by field: agriculture, 7.4%; astronomy, 1.4%; biology, 18.3%; chemistry, 3.3%;
computer science, 3.1%; earth and environmental sciences, 6.1%; economics and business, 1.0%; engineering,
15.6%; mathematics and statistics, 1.1%; medicine, 29.1%; physics, 4.2%, psychology, 1.7%, and all other, 7.7%.

                                                                          14
more important over time while engineering and physics become less important. This pattern

corresponds to the growing share of the life sciences in university R&D.

           C. Changes in Interdisciplinary Shares over Time
       Figures 3a to 3l depict time series of the interdisciplinary share by field. The share rises

in agriculture, biology, chemistry, earth sciences, engineering, mathematics, and psychology. It

increases most in engineering, where it rises by 77 percent of its 1983 value; and in mathematics

and statistics, where it rises by 70 percent. As Section II.B has shown, these fields are the

primary objectives of policies that seek to increase interdisciplinary research. But the share

declines in astronomy, computer science, and physics. Over the entire period there is no change

in economics and business or in medicine.

       Figure 4 depicts time series of the average interdisciplinary share. It increases by 10

percent, from 0.22 to 0.24. In Figure 5 the outside share increases by 32 percent, from 0.62 to

0.82. The interdisciplinary share increases slightly, but the rise in the outside share is large.

           D. The Engineering Subfields
   The interdisciplinary share grows fastest in engineering (Figure 3h). To identify the sources

of this change we study the relationship between the engineering subfields and the rest of

engineering and science outside engineering—the remaining 11 fields in Figure 3. At this level

we cannot construct citation-weighted R&D, but we can construct citations. We use citation

shares for the same subfield, other engineering, and science to show relative importance. The

share is: CiteShare t = Citations t / ∑ i Citations
                     j             j                  i
                                                      t   where i, j stand for same subfield, other

engineering, and science, and t stands for year. Table 2 shows long differences in citation shares

over the period 1983 to 1999. In 11 of 13 cases the citation share of the same subfield decreases

and in eight the decrease exceeds 0.1. In nine cases the share of science increases and in six it


                                                          15
increases by more than 0.1. Changes in other engineering are positive but small. Clearly

citations move towards science and away from engineering.

       Science citation shares rise sharply in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Automation; Civil

Engineering; Chemical Engineering; Environmental Engineering & Energy; Biomedical

Engineering; and Materials Science. Accordingly, Figure 6 examines knowledge-flows from

science outside engineering for these subfields12. The figures are area graphs that break out the

top five sciences and treat all others as a residual. Citations to computer science and biology rise

noticeably in Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Automation. In Civil Engineering flows from

biology and the earth sciences increase most. In Chemical Engineering biology, physics and

chemistry are the source of the increased role for science. The share of biology increases in

Environmental Engineering & Energy, while the share of medicine increases in Biomedical

Engineering. Citations to physics and biology increase markedly in Materials Science.

                E. Mathematics and Statistics
       Figure 3i shows that the interdisciplinary share rises sharply in mathematics. For this reason

Figures 7a and 7b take a closer look at the interdisciplinary share of citations for pure and

applied mathematics and statistics. Figure 7 is comparable to Figure 6.

       The increase in the interdisciplinary share is slight in these fields compared with engineering.

In pure and applied mathematics (Figure 7a) most of this comes from physics, and other fields

stay the same. In statistics most of the increase derives from biology and medicine (Figure 7b).

The growing life science link is with statistics and not pure and applied mathematics.

       We have seen that the interdisciplinary share increases in engineering, mathematics and a

few other fields. But idea-flows may increase because of policy push rather than demand pull. It



12
     Figure 6 excludes citations to engineering since its purpose is to examine citations to science.

                                                                 16
is critical to distinguish the productive importance of a field from its share in knowledge-flows,

as the following regression analysis points out.

   VI. Regression Analysis of Universities
       We turn now to estimates of knowledge production function (3) using the evidence on

U.S. universities described in Sections IV and V. Table 3 contains descriptive statistics.

Arithmetic means and standard deviations appear above, while values in logarithms appear in

parentheses below. About 200 papers are written per year. During their first five years, the

papers earn 440 citations from other U.S. universities.

       Following (4)-(8), the mean knowledge-flow (of citation-weighted R&D) is 677 million

dollars. Three-fourths of this (519 million) occurs within a field, while one-fifth (144 million)

occurs within a university. As one might expect, same field and other universities dominate the

knowledge-flows. The average R&D stock of a university-field is 82 million dollars.

       Table 4 reports regressions that divide knowledge-flows into flows from the same and

other universities. Equations 4.1-4.3 use the logarithm of papers as the dependent variable while

4.4-4.6 use the logarithm of citations received. All equations include fixed effects for field,

university, and year that absorb persistent errors that are correlated with the knowledge- flows

and the R&D stock. Knowledge inputs are lagged to avoid correlation with the transitory error

eijt . Standard errors are robust and adjusted for clustering by university. Equations 4.1 (4.4)

include logarithms of the R&D stock of a university-field and the total knowledge-flow. The

output elasticity of R&D stock is 0.17 (0.17), while the output elasticity of the total knowledge

flow is 0.40 (0.48), so that knowledge-flows are more important. Equations 4.2 and 4.5 break up

the knowledge-flows into inside flows from the same university and outside flows from other




                                                     17
universities13. The inside elasticities in 4.2 (4.5) are 0.07 (0.08), while the outside elasticities are

0.29 (0.35): outside flows are more important. Equations 4.3 and 4.6 explore whether inside or

outside knowledge-flows have become more or less important over time. To address this we

construct an indicator variable I ( year in the 1990 s) . I (•) equals one if a year is in the 1990s

and zero otherwise. We interact I (•) with the inside and outside knowledge-flows to see

whether the importance of a knowledge-flow changes in the 1990s, a period of rapid change in

information technology and in science policy. The specification is

                  ln(nijt ) = β + Z D′ δ + η R ln( R j , t −1 ) + ∑ w =1 η w ln(S(wij ) t −1 ) +
                                                                      W

(11)
                              ∑          φw I ( year in the 1990s ) • ln(S(wij ) t −1 ) + eijt
                                  W
                                  w =1


Coefficients of the interactions φ w will be positive (negative) if a given knowledge-flow has a

rising (falling) effect14. Notice that the interactions are in addition to time effects in Z D′ : they

represent the changing importance of knowledge-flows associated with technology and policy in

the 1990s, while time effects capture trends in papers that are not caught by the other variables.

         The results appear in equation 4.3 (4.6). The main elasticityη w of knowledge-flows from

the same university equals 0.08 (0.09). The interaction elasticity for the 1990s is -0.05 (-0.08).

All effects differ significantly from zero. Note that inside knowledge-flows become less

important over time. The main elasticity of knowledge-flows from other universities in 4.3(4.6)

is 0.26 (0.32) and the interaction elasticity for the 1990s is 0.13 (0.21). Thus outside knowledge-

flows become more important. Also, growth in the outside elasticity exceeds decline in the

inside elasticity so the importance of knowledge-flows increases. Another way to put this is that


13
   Separation of the variables introduces additional errors in the variables, indicated by the decline in the sum of the
separate elasticities in 4.3 and 4.6 below the combined elasticities in 4.2 and 4.5, by a slight drop in R-squared, and
by a slight increase in the root mean squared error. A useful reference on this point is Hausman (2001).
14
   Since the Cobb-Douglas does not capture factor-biased technological change, we have augmented the function by
including interactions of the elasticities with time.

                                                                     18
knowledge-flows make a larger contribution to research output during the 1990s15. This growing

contribution is significant at the one percent level in 4.3 and 4.616. It almost surely reflects

advances in information technology and infrastructure (Adams et al., 2005).

            Table 5 divides knowledge-flows into flows from the same field and other fields. 5.1-5.3

report findings for papers while 5.4-5.6 report findings for citations received. As before the

logarithm of R&D stock of the university-field is included to control for tangible resources. 5.1

and 5.4 include two knowledge-flows, from the same and other fields. 5.2 and 5.5 include four

flows: from the same and other fields and universities. Following equation (11), 5.3 and 5.6 add

interactions of logarithms of knowledge-flows from the same and other fields with a dummy for

the 1990s.

            In equation 5.1 (5.3), the elasticity of same field knowledge-flows is 0.30 (0.37) while the

elasticity of flows from other fields is 0.08 (0.07). The same field elasticity is four times larger

than the elasticity of other fields, though both are significant.

            In equation 5.2 (5.5) we see that the same field/same university elasticity is 0.04 (0.04)

while the same field/other university elasticity is 0.21 (0.27). Most of the productive impact of

knowledge from the same field comes from outside a university.

            This is not true of interdisciplinary knowledge-flows. In 5.2 (5.5) the other field/same

university elasticity is 0.04 (0.03), while the other field/other university elasticity is 0.04 (0.04).

Importance of interdisciplinary flows is distributed equally across same and other universities.

This suggests that scientists from different fields must spend substantial time together and this

would explain the comparative localization of interdisciplinary flows.

15
  The statement that knowledge-flows make an increasing contribution to scientific discoveries is not the same as
saying that productivity increases. In fact growth of university output slows down in the 1990s, despite the growing
contribution of knowledge-flows (Adams, forthcoming 2010).
16
     Using (11), the F-statistic for the null hypothesis of the restriction   φInside + φOutside = 0 is F (1,109) = 96.4 in 4.3.
For 4.6 the F-statistic is F (1,109) = 159.5. In both cases the test decisively rejects the null.

                                                                    19
           Following (11) equations 5.3 and 5.6 examine changes over time. In 5.3 (5.6) we see that

the main elasticity of knowledge-flows in the same field is 0.28 (0.35), while the elasticity of the

interaction of this elasticity with the 1990s is 0.07 (0.11). All estimates differ significantly from

zero and the same field elasticity increases with time. In 5.3 (5.6), the main elasticity of

knowledge-flows from other fields is 0.09 (0.08). But the interaction elasticity is 0.01 (0.01)

and insignificant. While positive and significant, the interdisciplinary elasticity stays the same

over time. Therefore, the importance of same field knowledge-flows increases relative to that of

interdisciplinary flows.

           Growth in the same field elasticity combined with an insignificant increase in the

interdisciplinary elasticity implies, just as in Table 4, that knowledge-flows are more important

in the 1990s. The sum of the interaction elasticities differs significantly from zero in 5.3 and

5.617.

           Since engineering and mathematics are a focal point of policies favoring interdisciplinary

research, we analyze research output of the two fields using an equation like 5.3. The logarithm

of papers is the dependent variable:

            Log ( Papers ) = 0.098 * * • Log ( Knowledge − Flow, Same Field )
                             (0.032)
                            + 0.103 * * • I (Year in the 90 s ) • Log ( Knowledge − Flow, Same Field )
                                (0.032)
(12)                          + 0.017 * • Log ( Knowledge − Flow, Other Fields )
                                (0.008)
                              - 0.034 * • I (Year in the 90 s ) • Log ( Knowledge − Flow, Other Fields )
                               (0.015)
                              + other terms                                     R 2 = 0.92 , N = 1,955



17
     Using (11) the F-statistic for the null hypothesis of the restriction   φSame Field + φOther Field = 0 is F (1,109) = 98.5
in 5.3. For 5.6 the F-statistic is F (1,109) = 129.7. Again the tests decisively reject the null.

                                                                   20
The elasticity of knowledge-flows in the same field doubles over time. In contrast, the

interdisciplinary elasticity declines. The productive importance of knowledge-flows in the same

field increases by a larger proportion in the very disciplines where interdisciplinary research is a

policy goal. This suggests that policies promoting interdisciplinary research, described in

Section II.B and reflected in growth of interdisciplinarity in Section V, Figure 3-h and 3-i, are

being overridden, perhaps by changes in information technology (see Section VIII below).

           Returning to the broader sample, we explore the changing importance of outside fields

using an alternative specification. We are interested in whether growth in the share of

knowledge-flows from other fields individually indicates growing importance in the production

of scientific papers. Put differently, are “hot” fields more productive in fields that cite them and

does this advantage grow over time? The answer turns out to be, not consistently.

           To identify “hot” fields, recall from Table 1 that shares of some outside fields increase in

knowledge-flows to particular sciences. A case in point is the rising share of biology in

knowledge-flows to agriculture18. Other examples include the rising importance of medicine in

biology, and of computer science, engineering, and medicine in mathematics. To define “hot”

fields we count all external fields, relative to each citing field, whose shares in knowledge-flows

increase by at least one percent from 1983 to 1999. All other fields are designated “cold” fields.

But if no outside field increases its share then there are no “hot” fields and knowledge flows

from “hot” fields equal zero.

           Table 6 shows “hot” fields for each citing field. Biology, medicine, computer science

and engineering dominate among “hot” fields. Also notice that astronomy, computer science,

earth sciences, medicine, and physics have no “hot” fields assigned to them. The reason is that



18
     This probably reflects the growing usefulness of genetic engineering in plant breeding (Ruttan 2001, Chapter 10).

                                                                21
the share of external fields in knowledge-flows declines over time for these disciplines. Using

the information in Table 6, consider the following specification:

                ln(nijt ) = β + Z D′ δ + η R ln(R j , t −1 ) + ηSame ln(S(Same    Field
                                                                          ij ) t −1     )+
(13)
                   η"Hot" ln(S("ijHot  " Other Fields
                                   ) t −1             ) + η"Cold " ln(S("ijCold  " Other Fields
                                                                            ) t −1              ) + eijt

A crucial test is whether the hypothesis η"Hot" = η"Cold" is accepted. If it is then “hot” fields are not

more productive than “cold” fields. This would cast doubt on the idea that “hot” fields underpin

growth in interdisciplinary research.

        For some citing disciplines there are no “hot” fields and the logarithm is that of zero

(augmented by 0.001). We therefore modify (13) by adding an interaction of the logarithm of

knowledge-flows from “hot” fields with an indicator I (" Hot " Fields = 0 ) . This equals one if true

and zero otherwise. Although less common, we introduce a similar indicator for the absence of

knowledge flows from “cold” fields: I (" Cold " Fields = 0) . The revised specification is,

                ln(nijt ) = β + Z D′ δ + η R ln( R j , t −1 ) + η Same ln(S (Same    Field
                                                                             ij ) t −1     ) + η"Hot " ln(S ("ijHot  " Other Fields
                                                                                                                 ) t −1             )+
(14)               θ"Hot " I (" Hot" Fields = 0) • ln(S("ijHot  " Other Fields
                                                            ) t −1             ) + η"Cold " ln(S("ijCold  " Other Fields
                                                                                                     ) t −1              )+
                   θ"Cold " I ("Cold " Fields = 0) • ln(S("ijCold  " Other Fields
                                                              ) t −1              ) + eijt

The “zero interaction” terms θi absorb the effect of the absence of knowledge-flows from other

fields, which biases the main elasticities ηi towards zero.

        Finally, it is useful to test for changes over time in the comparative importance of same

field as well as “hot” and “cold” other fields, by interacting logarithms of the knowledge-flows

with an indicator variable for the 1990s. This specification extends that of (14):

                ln(nijt ) = β + Z D′ δ + η R ln( R j , t −1 ) + η Same ln(S(Same    Field
                                                                            ij ) t −1     ) + η"Hot " ln(S("ijHot  " Other Fields
                                                                                                               ) t −1             )+
                   θ"Hot " I (" Hot" Fields = 0) × ln(S("ijHot  " Other Fields
                                                            ) t −1             ) + η"Cold " ln(S("ijCold  " Other Fields
                                                                                                     ) t −1              )+
(15)
                   θ"Cold " I ("Cold " Fields = 0) × ln(S("ijCold  " Other Fields
                                                              ) t −1              )+

                  ∑    w∈"Same","Hot ","Cold "
                                                 φw I ( year in the 1990s) • ln(S(wij )t −1 ) + eijt

                                                                          22
The summation in the last line consists of interactions of knowledge-flows with the 1990s

indicator. We shall use (13)-(15) together to study same, “hot”, and “cold” fields.

   Table 7 shows the results. As in previous tables the dependent variable in 7.1-7.3 is the

logarithm of papers while in 7.4-7.6 it is the logarithm of citations received. All equations

include R&D stock and same field flows, but since results for these variables are the same, we

concentrate on “hot” and “cold” field elasticities. For papers the elasticity of “hot” fields is less

than that for “cold” fields, and this difference is sometimes significant. But for citations the

elasticity of “hot” fields exceeds that of “cold”. And yet the “hot” field elasticity is not

consistently greater than that for “cold” fields.

   Following (13), 7.1 (7.4) introduce logarithms of these variables without interactions.

Following (14), 7.2 (7.5) introduce zero interactions. As expected the sign of the zero interaction

terms is negative and significant. Accounting for zero knowledge flows increases the main

elasticities of “hot” fields and “cold” fields in 7.2 but it does not change their relative size. In 7.3

(7.6) we use specification (15), which allows for a full set of interactions between the

knowledge-flows and the indicators for zero knowledge-flows and the 1990s. The elasticities of

“hot” and “cold” increase or decrease slightly but at the same rate. “Hot” fields are not becoming

more important over time relative to “cold” fields. Moreover, knowledge-flows from the same

field are becoming more important than either one. The hypothesis of an increasing role for

interdisciplinary research in the production of scientific research is rejected.

   VII. Regression Analysis of Firms
   So far we have considered the top 110 U.S. universities, emphasizing inside, outside, and

interdisciplinary knowledge-flows, and their role in the production of scientific papers. While

our main interest is in academic science, a comparison with firms is nevertheless useful. Table 8



                                                      23
repeats the analysis using a panel of firms, fields, and years19. The firms are the 200 largest U.S.-

based performers of R&D and citations take place among these firms. The dependent variable is

the logarithm of the firm’s fractional papers20. Table 8 for firms combines the main features of

Tables 5 and 7, which deal with interdisciplinary research in universities.

     Equations 8.1 and 8.2 are counterparts to 5.1 and 5.3. In 8.1 the output elasticity of same

field knowledge-flows is 0.24, while the elasticity for other fields is 0.09. These estimates are

similar to the elasticities that equation 5.1 reported for universities, which are 0.30 and 0.08. As

with 5.3 for universities, in 8.2 for firms we add interactions of the knowledge-flows with an

indicator for the 1990s. The elasticity of knowledge-flows from the same field increases

significantly over time, from 0.21 in the 1980s to 0.26 in the 1990s. This is similar to the

increase from 0.28 to 0.34 observed in 5.3 for universities.

     The rest of Table 8 concerns knowledge-flows from “hot” and “cold” external fields.

Equations 8.3-8.5 are analogous to the university equations 7.1-7.3. All equations include

logarithms of the firm’s basic research stock and of same field knowledge-flows, with similar

results to 8.1 and 8.221. Equation 8.3 includes logarithms of “hot” and “cold” fields, whose

elasticities are 0.04 and 0.09. The estimates are significant at the one percent level, but the

elasticity for “hot” fields is significantly less than that for “cold” fields. It is useful to include a

zero interaction between the logarithm of knowledge-flows from other fields and an indicator for

zero knowledge-flows. When this is done, in 8.4, the zero interactions are again negative and

significant, and main elasticities increase. The elasticity for “hot” fields (0.136) remains less than

20
   Since citations received by firm papers exhibit a substantial number of zeroes, they require the use of Tobit
analysis. While there is nothing difficult about undertaking such an analysis or in comparing expected marginal
effects in Tobit analysis to regression coefficients, such an analysis lies outside the scope of the present paper.
21
   As Adams and Clemmons (2008) show, total R&D stocks of firms are weighted by the share of basic research in
their primary industry to arrive at an estimate of the basic research stock for the firms.

                                                             24
that for “cold” fields (0.190) but the difference is not significant. Equation 8.5 adds interactions

between logarithms of knowledge-flows for the same, “hot”, and “cold” fields with the 1990s

dummy. The same field elasticity increases significantly, from 0.19 in the 1980s to 0.24 in the

1990s. The “hot” and “cold” field elasticities decline but the decline is not statistically

significant. The university and firm estimates agree in that elasticities of “hot” and “cold” fields

change rather little whereas the same field elasticity increases. The results for firms are similar

to those for universities, perhaps because underlying incentives are similar across sectors.

       VIII. Summary, Discussion, and Conclusion
       This paper finds that outside knowledge-flows from other institutions, and the importance of

outside knowledge for research output measured by scientific papers and citations received, have

risen relative to inside knowledge-flows from the same university (Table 4). Results on

knowledge-flows from the same field and other fields are more complex than this and more

tentative. Same field and interdisciplinary flows contribute positively and significantly to

scientific papers. The main facts to be reconciled are that interdisciplinary knowledge-flows in

universities increase slightly as a share of all knowledge-flows (Figure 4), but the importance of

interdisciplinary knowledge in the production of new ideas does not increase, even as the same

field elasticity increases (Table 5).22

       When we break up knowledge-flows from other fields into “hot” (shares in knowledge-flows

rising) and “cold” (shares flat or declining) in Table 7 the importance of “hot” fields in

production also does not increase relative to “cold” fields. Besides this, “hot” fields are not




22
     Importance in production is again measured by the elasticity of research output with respect to knowledge-flows.

                                                               25
consistently more important than “cold” fields23. These results hold for firms as well as

universities (Table 8).

     The most important changes in the structure of production of scientific discoveries are as

follows. During the 1990s the structure of production shifts towards outside knowledge-flows

from other universities (Table 4) while at the same time it begins to favor same field knowledge-

flows (Table 5). In both cases knowledge-flows make a larger contribution in the 1990s. At this

point we offer a few observations.

     Adams et al. (2005) find that outside collaboration increases because of construction of the

Internet and its connection to networks in Europe and Asia in the late 1980s (Mowery and

Simcoe, 2002). In the 1980s the Internet became a policy initiative of the NSF and the same is

true of cyber infrastructure today (National Science Foundation, 2009b). Not merely

collaboration but also citation would shift outside a university as a result of this infrastructure.

More subtly, distant researchers in the same discipline become collaborators. They can replace

researchers in the same university but other disciplines (Rosenblat and Mobius, 2004).

     It follows that growth of information technology could have brought about a decrease in the

importance of interdisciplinary research. To produce the increase in Figure 4, however slight,

would require at least one countervailing factor. From Section II.B, one candidate for such a

factor is the founding of university research centers starting in the 1980s, whose purpose is to

encourage interdisciplinary research (Adams, Chiang and Starkey, 2001). Since the 1980s many

other centers have been founded, including in nanotechnology. Many encourage industry

involvement and because industrial research tends to cut across fields, this too would encourage

interdisciplinary research (Boardman and Corley, 2008). Important as well are large government


23
  Thirdly, the correlation by field between growth in the share of outside fields in knowledge-flows and the
importance of other fields in production of new ideas is probably low based on Figures 3a-3l and Table 6.

                                                             26
programs, such as the Human Genome Project, which marshal vast resources with one purpose

being that of encouraging scientists in different fields to combine their talents.

    All of this tells a story of simultaneous pursuit of different goals with sometimes unforeseen

consequences. By supporting information technology NSF intended to connect, and did connect,

more researchers in joint research. By establishing university centers NSF meant to engage more

researchers in interdisciplinary research. This is because, given the growing complexity of

scientific questions, NSF strongly holds the view that interdisciplinary research leads to more

breakthroughs (National Science Foundation, 2009b). The unforeseen consequence was that

cyber infrastructure would promote research within the same field rather than interdisciplinary

research even though the goal of the centers was to promote interdisciplinary research (Rosenblat

and Mobius, 2004).

        None of the findings in this paper should be seen as “closing the book” on

interdisciplinary research—far from it. We must not rush to judgment and argue that deliberate

subsidization of interdisciplinary research is mistaken but instead wait and maintain a patient

agnosticism until the results of the policy can be observed. While a final verdict is yet to be

rendered, one interpretation of the findings is that interdisciplinary research is still in its early

stages. Although interdisciplinary knowledge-flows have increased a little, this is partly because

of recent policies designed to support them. What we may not be seeing so far are the effects of

discoveries from this research that would increase the importance of interdisciplinary research in

the next generation of discoveries. Those events could still lie in the future. This would be true

if gestation lags on interdisciplinary work are long and variable, precisely because the work is

path-breaking. One must learn to live with ambiguities relating to new policies like those that

we study in this paper, just as with the study of new phenomena in general.

             Notes: Top cited fields are the top three “outside” fields with the largest share in
             knowledge-flows to a given science. Knowledge-flows are captured by citation-weighted
             R&D stocks. See equations (4), (6)-(8) of the text for definitions of the knowledge-flows
             and see (9) for definitions of shares of other fields in these flows.

   Notes: Data are a three-dimensional panel of fields, universities of science and years.
   The number of observations is N=11,220 before exclusions due to missing values.
   Arithmetic means and standard deviations appear above while logarithmic means and
   standard deviations appear below in parentheses. Knowledge-flows are citation-weighted
   R&D stocks. See equations (4), (6)-(8) of the text for definitions of the flows. a Papers
   are fractional counts of articles written in a university, field and year, where fractions are
   adjusted for shared publication with other universities. b Citations received are all
   citations received from other universities during the first five years of a paper including
   the publication year, and are fractionalized in the same way as papers. c Same field
   knowledge-flows occur when citing and cited fields are the same, while other field flows
   occur when the two fields differ. d Same university knowledge-flows occur when citing
   and cited universities are the same, while other university flows occur when the two
   universities differ. e R&D stock is the sum of depreciated flows of R&D over the
   previous eight years, expressed in l992 dollars and assuming a rate of depreciation of 15
   percent.

 Notes: “Hot” fields are other fields whose share in knowledge-flows increases by at least
 one percent between 1983 and 1999. Citing fields with no “hot” fields are those where
 the share of knowledge-flows from other fields declines.

              Notes: Data are a panel of firms, fields, and years. All equations include fixed effects for
              firm, field, and year. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by firm. Method is OLS.
              Knowledge-flows are sums of citation-weighted R&D stocks as defined in (4), (6)-(8) of
              the text, but adapted to data on firms. **Coefficient is significantly different from zero at
              the one percent level of significance. a The coefficients of “hot” and “cold” fields are
              significantly different at the one percent level. b The coefficients of “hot” and “cold”
              fields are not significantly different at the five percent level. c The coefficients of “hot”
              and “cold” fields are significantly different at the five percent level. d Coefficients of the
              “hot” and “cold” interactions with the 1990s are not significantly different at the five
              percent level.
