        Six years of the international debt crisis have generated many

proposals for its resolution.       Some proposals involve pure financial

                                                                       on
range from market-based debt reduction schemes to unilateral moratoria

debt.     Prominent among them is a call for voluntary debt forgiveness.

Proponents argue that forgiveness not only serves the interest of debtor

countries, but that it also would benefit the banks.      High debt levels, it

is claimed, bring about low incentives to adjust to the debt overhang.

Low incentives to adjust lead in turn to a low capacity to service debt.

If creditors were to voluntarily reduce the debt's face value they would

promote adjustment.     The resulting greater capacity to service debt would

more than compensate them for any initial losses (see Sachs (1988) for the

original argument).



        Two types of adjustment bear on the issue of debt relief:

macroeconomic policies in general and the debtor country's investment

level in particular.     Better polities and more investment raise future

                                                               In order to
income,    thereby increasing the capacity to service debt.
                                                      to employ an

                                             But no accepted model is available
explicit model of government behavior.

for this purpose. For this reason I focus instead on market outcomes and

inveatment-driven adjustments. My study is designed to explore in        a

systematic way the scope for voluntary debt reduction.
        Among the many dimensions of the problem at hand I concentrate on

three: the degree of international capital mobility,      attitudes toward

risk,    and the degree of cooperation among creditors.    These features prove

to be important. I show, for example, that in the absence of

international capital mobility and in the presence of high risk aversion

in the debtor country the banks cannot gain from a voluntary write-down of

dabt.     This result is independent of the degree of cooperation among them.

In other cases forgiveness may or may not serve the interest of creditors.

When it is in the collective interest of creditors to provide debt

reduction, however, the prospects for forgiveness may hinge on the degree

of cooperation among them.



        The paper is structured as follows.   In the next section   I   describe

the debtor's repayment behavior as a function of its economic performance.

Full repayment takes place as long as revenue raised by a tax on random

output suffices to cover debt service without the tax rate exceeding a

feasible maximal level.     In other cases the tax rate ceiling determines

repayment, which equals tax revenue.     In Section III I derive a formula

for the valuation of these repayments on international financial markets,

and use it to determine the value of debt on secondary markets as well as

the secondary market price and discount.      This information is used in

Section IV to evaluate the effect on prices of a facility that purchases

debt on secondary markets in order to forgive     it.   It is shown that the

resulting price increases can be substantial even when investment does not

change.
                                     -3-


     I explore the relationship between debt and investment in Section V.

This relationship is shown to depend on the degree of capital mobility and

attitudes toward risk.    In the absence of international capital flows and

high risk aversion in the debtor country a larger debt is associated with

more investment.    In all other cases larger debts imply lower investment,

and there may exist multiple equilibria that differ in investment levels.

With multiple equilibria small changes in debt may bring about sharp

investment responses, because the economy may jump from one equilibrium to

another.



     Section VI deals with welfare implications of debt reduction. I show

that debtors gain from debt reduction.     Creditors lose whenever debt

reduction depresses investment.     But creditors may lose or gain when

relief stimulates investment.     Gains by creditors are particularly likely

if multiple equilibria exist and the debtor country is trapped in a low

investment equilibrium. In this case debt reduction may force a switch to

a Pareto-superior high investment equilibrium.     This analysis identifies

circumstances in which cooperating creditors would provide voluntary debt

relief.




     In Section VII I consider the scope for debt reduction in the absence

of cooperation. For this purpose I formulate a non-cooperative game in        -




voluntary   debt reductions.    In the presence of a single investment

equilibrium and where scope exists for collective debt relief,

non-cooperative actions yield voluntary debt reductions if the inital debt
                                           -4-


is sufficiently large.        In the presence of multiple investment equilibria

the solution set of the non-cooperative game may contain an
                                                            equilibrium
with debt reduction together with an equilibrium without debt reduction.

Sone policy implications of these results are discussed in the closing

section.



                              II.    Repayment Structure



      For the purpose of this study I employ a variant of the model

developed in Helpman (1988).           The entire future is collapsed into a single

period.       The Debtor country's output in that period is a random variable

given by       GE(I), where   1     denotes a random productivity shock, I is the

current period's investment level, and           E()    is an increasing concave

function representing the country's activity level in production.              In this

section the investment level is predetermined. States of nature are iden-

tified with productivity shock levels; i.e.,           1   obtains the value    9   in

state    9.




      The governnent has an external debt         I)   and its debt service payments

are   RID,    where   R   is one plus the interest rate.     All these variables

are predetermined from the point of view of the current discussion. The

government services debt from tax revenue. It can tax output at any

desirable rate up to a ceiling          tl.   A debt problem prevails in the sense

that there exist states in which the highest possible tax revenue is

insufficient to cover debt service payments. Namely,            Prob[tlE(I)<RD]>O.
Therefore there exists a critical state, defined by
                   â€”
                       RD/tE(I),                                            (1)




such that debt is fully repaid in States        99(D,I)    but cannot be fully

repaid in States   9<e(D,I).



     The government uses an income tax at the state-contingent rate

r(9;D,I)   in order to raise revenue for debt service payments. It

defaults on its payments only when they exceed its taxing capacity, but it

pays in such states its maximum tax revenue.         In other states it raises

the precise revenue needed for debt service payments.        This specification

is the same as in Helpman (1988, Section IX).         Therefore,



                          t           for        9     9 (DI),
                                                        C
            r(8;D,I) â€”                                                          (2)
                          RD/E(I)     for        9     8(D,I).



Creditors receive state-contingentpayments r(9;D,I)8E(I), which are

given by


                          t8E(I)    for     8    9(D,I),
            T(O;D,I) â€”                                                          (3)
                          RD        for     9    9(D,I).



This completes the description of payments in the single future period.

The resulting repayment profile is depicted in Figure 1.           As long as

investment is constant the same repayment profile arises when the
                                       -6-


government applies a state independent tax rate t        and redistributes

revenue in excess of debt service payments to the public in a lump-sum

fashion.   The- tax system, however, affects   investment incentives;   a given

debt level brings about different investment levels under different tax

structures (see Helpman (1988, Section IX)).      This point is further

discussed in Section VIII.



                              III.   Debt Valuation1



     In this section I discuss the valuation of debt on secondary markets.

I assume that these markets are part of the international financial system

and that debt repayments (3) are too small to affect state-contingent

marginal valuations in this system.      For simpliciy let the marginal

valuations be the same in all states, and let      R-1   be the real interest

on safe loans.   Then every uncertain future stream of payments is valued

at its discounted expected value.      In particular, the stream of payments

by the debtor to its creditors has a market value of




            V(D,I)   â€”   Rlr
                          Jo

where   0(0)   is the probability distribution function over states.      Using

(3) this can be- expressed as

This   function is increasing in both arguments,                      concave in debt, concave in

investment,     V(O,I)â€”O,       and VD(OI)_l              as depicted in Figure 2.



       The price of a unit of debt in the secondary market is




              p(D,I) â€”   V(D,T)/D.                                                              (6)




Using (5) it can also be expressed as



       p(D,I) â€”   ll(D,T)   +   [1   -
                                         fl(D,I)}   E[   tOE/RD   I
                                                                         <
                                                                             9c0)tflt           (7)




where                                     is the probability that             98(D,I) and E[]
         ll(DI)lG[9(D,T)]
is the expected value of the repayment share                      tOE/RD conditional on the

productivity shock being smaller than                    9(DI).         Hence, the equilibrium

price--equal to the mean repayment share--is a weighted average of one

(full repsyment) and the mean repsyment                   shsre in the low productivity

states in which debt is only partially repaid.



        The price of a unit of debt on the secondary market is represented in

                                                                                                for
Figure 2 by the slope of a ray through the origin (see (6)).                            Thus,


example,    the slope of ray             0A1   represents the price when debt is                D1.

The smaller the debt the higher its price smd the smaller its discount

(the discount equals one minus the price).                    The price approaches one and
                                     -8-


the discount approaches zero as debt approaches zero.       Higher debt levels

lead to lower prices on the secondary market because the larger the debt

the smaller the set of states in which debt is fully repaid and the lower

repayment per-unit debt in states with partial repayment (the latter

results from the fact that total payments in these states do not change

with the level of debt; see Figure    1).   In terms of (7) higher debt levels

reduce the probability of full repayment as well as the conditional

expected repayment share in states of partial repayment.



                    IV.   Price Effects of Debt Reduction



     There exist several programs of debt forgiveness (see, for example,

Clime (1987)).   Some of them, such as Kenen's (1983), propose to establish

an international facility that will buy debt on secondary markets and

forgive it (see Corden (l988a) for a review).     As pointed out by Dooley

(1988), existing market discounts cannot be used to assess the cost of

debt forgiveness, because the anticipation of forgiveness raises market

prices.   My model suggests that indeed the lower the outstanding debt the

higher its price on the secondary market.     Rational expectaions imply that

in equilibrium the purchase price equals the post-purchase price on the

secondary market.   For suppose it is higher.    Then every remaining holder

of debt wants to sell for a somewhat lower price.     And if it is lower, an

owner of a unit of debt prefers to sell it after the reduction of debt.

For these reasons (6) or (7) can be used to calculate the purchase price

for an international facility that intends to forgive debt.      In this
                                            -9-


calculation D        denotes the remaining debt.



        Suppose,   for example, that an international              facility buys and for-

gives          of debt (it may buy more, but the following analysis depends

only on the amount forgiven).          Then our analysis suggests that p(D-,I)

describes the unit value of remaining debt.              When the productivity shock

is uniformly distributed on the interval               [0,1]       (7) yields (assuming that

the critical values          O()   before and after the purchase are strictly

between zero and one)



        p(D-,I) â€”    1   -
                             9(D-,I)   â€” 1   -
                                                 O(D,I)(l      -
                                                                   ).                     (8)


Hence, if       9(D,I)â€”.8 (the probability of full repayment is initially 20
percent)   ,    debt is valued at      60   cents to the dollar.           And if the

facility wants to buy 20 percent of the debt with an intention to forgive

it (i.e., t/Dâ€”.2), the price of debt goes up to                    68   cents   to the dollar.

Thus, 20 percent forgiveness increases             prices by close to 14 percent.



        This calculation suggests that a great deal of the corporation's

resources will go to the creditors,              despite the facility's intention to

help the debtor.         This is in line with Dooley's argument.                If, for

example,       debt is $100 billion and the facility buys back 20 percent, it

spends $13.6 billion. The remaining claims of the creditors are worth

$54.4 billion.       Therefore, in order to reduce the value of claims by $5.6

billion the facility has to spend $13.6 billion. More generally, since
                                             - 10    -




p(0,I)â€”l     (i.e.   ,   total   debt forgiveness raises the price to its face

value),    the price goes up to as close as desired to 1 for sufficiently

large debt forgiveness levels.              Hence,       if initially debt is traded at a

high discount,       say at 20 cents to the dollar (as some of Peru's debt was

traded),   a sufficiently high degree of debt forgiveness by an

international facility that buys debt on the secondary market will bring

about huge capital gains to the creditors with relatively little debt

relief to the debtor.            All this assumes constant investment.         As I show

below, however, the response of investment to debt reduction has important

effects on secondary market values.



                                       V.   Investment



     I deal in this section with the effects of debt on investment.                     This

analysis is of interest in its own right, but it also provides an

essential ingredient in the following evaluation of the case for voluntary

debt reduction. At this stage it is sufficient to observe that (5)

implies that debt reduction does not help the creditors if it depresses

investment or raises it only slightly (because the value of debt increases

in both debt and investment). For this reason voluntary debt reduction

requires a sufficiently strong investment stimulus.                   Naturally, in a
broader contex of adjustment there exist additional channels of influence.

In this study, however, I deal only with investment.
                                      -   11   -




     In   order to deal with these toncernes we need to fill in additional

details   of the model.     Assume that the debtor country's firms trade shares

in a competitive stock market in the manner suggested by Diamond (1967).

                                                                     denotes the
Using the terminology of Helpman and Razin (1978),          E(I)

number of real equities.       Given a real equity price     q     the net value of


firma is    qE(I)-I.   Firms choose investment to maximize their net value,

which implies the first order condition qE'(I)â€”l.           Hence,    the supply


price of real equities is



             q(I) a    l/E'(I).                                                (9)




Higher investment levels lead to higher supply prices of real equities,               as

depicted in Figure     3.   If we were to draw the supply price as a function

of the stock of real equities rather than the investment level, it would

                                                     since the stock of real
represent a regular supply curve.         However,

equities increases with investment I refer to the plott of             q(I)   in the

firgure as a supply curve.



     In order to determine the level of investment we also need a demand

curve.     The nature of this curve dependa on institutions, the distribution

of the productivity shock, preferences, as well as additional features.

In particular, it depends on the degree of international capital mobility

allowed by the debtor country.       I will deal with two extreme cases; free


capital mobility and a binding quantative restriction on capital flows.

1.   Free capital           mobility



     In the presence of free capital mobility the price of every ssset is

determined by its value on the international capital markets as the

diacounted expected present value of its future return.                           Thus,   if

r(9;D,I) represents an asset's state contingent return, the market prices

the asset according to




              q(DI)                        p(9;D,I)dG(O).                                       (10)




This representation underlines the dependence of the asset price on debt

and investment,           which are the subject of this study.                 Naturally, there
exist many assets whose return structure does not depend on debt or

investment;    their price does not dependend on these variables either.                           The

return on a unit of real equity equals the after tax value of                             8.   The-

Formula (11) applies to every state contingent tax structure. For the

particular structure given in                 (2)   we can combine (2), (10), and (11) to

obtain

where       denotes   the mean of    9.       This price declines in debt and

increases in investmenc.        It declines in debt because the larger the debt

level the higher the tax rates in states with full repayment and the lower

the after tax return on equity.           Higher debt also reduces the set of

states in which there is full repayment,                 but this has a second order

effect.    The demand price increases in investment because the larger the

investment level the larger the tax base and the lower the tax rates in

states of full repayment.        Hence, for positive debt levels the demand

price rises with investment,        as depicted in Figure 3 (changes in the set

of states with full repayment have again second order effects).                     The

demand price function also satisfies

                                                   â€”   a_li,

Therefore, in the absence of debt the demand curve is horizontal at a

level that equals the discounted mean of the productivity shock, and

whenever the condition on                     is satisfied the demand price approaches
                                 ect
this value asymptotically as the investment level goes to infinity.



        Figure 3 describes a situation with a unique equilibrium, determined

by the intersection of the demand and supply curves at point                   1.   These

curves were generated from explicit functions and a debt level Dâ€”O.25.2

Figure 4 deacribes curves that were generated from the same functions with

a debt level          D=O.50.   They intersect twice and the demand curve is below

the supply curve at low investment levels.                        Consequently,       there are three

equilibria;     at points       1, 2,    and a third one with zero investment.                    The

third equilibrium is supported by every equity price in the range                                 [q,]

The first and third equilibrium are stable under the usual adjustment

process while the second is not.                 Inspection of Figures 3 and 4 and the

fact that the demand curve shifts up when debt declines imply:



Proposition 1:           In the presence of free capital mobility debt reduction

stimulates investment at stable equilibria with positive investment.



First, observe that there exists a unique equilibrium for sufficiently low

debt levels as long as the supply price at zero investment is below the

expected present value of               1,    and that       positive    investment    prevails     in

this   equilibrium.        Therefore,        whenever there exists an equilibrium with

zero investment small debt reductions may not eliminate it but

sufficiently large debt reductions will.                       Second,    in the presence of

multiple equilibria the economy can be trapped in a low investment

equilibrium, which hurts the creditors and the debtor (see the following

section). Nevertheless, no competitive forces ensure a switch to a better

equilibrium. When a single financial investor calculates the benefits of

an additional      unit   of equity       holding        he takes as given the tax    structure
and therefore the expected net return on equity.                      If he expects lower tax

rates he is willing to pay a higher price for equity.                     Higher equity

prices lead to higher investment.                   Higher investment, in turn, reduces tax

rates in states of full repayment, thereby justifying the expected high

return on equity.         This mechanism is responsible              for the multiplicity of


equilibria.




      Figure 5 describes the relationship between debt and equilibrium

investment in the example given in footnote 2 (it is also easy to see the

following results by direct inspection of Figures 3 and 4).                       For debt

levels below              or above            there exists s unique quilibrium,          which
                   DL                 Du
features positive investment in the former interval and zero investment in

the latter.       For debt levels in the interval {DL?DTJJ                 however, there

exist two equilibria;         one with positive investment and one with none.

This feature can bring about sharp investment responses to small changes

in debt.        In order to appreciate the importance of this point consider the

following experiments. First, suppose debt is close to                            but below it
                                                                             Du
and the economy is at the positive investment equilibrium.                        A   small in-

crease in debt that brings the debt level above DL                        shifts the economy

to the single no investment equilibrium.                      Hence, a small debt increase

brings abount a decline of investment from above                      I   to zero.     Next,

suppose debt is close to                   but above it and the economy is trapped at
                                     DL




3Multiple equilibria appear also in other models of debt; see, for
example, Eaton (198]) and Calvo (1988).

the no investment equilibrium. Now       a small debt reduction that brings the

debt level below         shifts the economy to the single positive investment
                    DL
equilibrium. Hence, a small debt reduction raises investment from zero to

e level that exceeds




Prooosition 2:      In the presence of free capital mobility a debt increase

may bring abour a   discontinuous drop       in investment and a debt reduction

may bring about a discontinuous rise in investment.



As in many other models with multiple equilibria it is hard to predict

which equilibrium the economy will choose.         It is, however,   clear that for

debt levels in the interval [DLDU]            the economy settles on the positive

investment equilibrium when portfolio holders expect low future tax rates

and on the no investment equilibrium when portfolio holders expect high

future tax rates.    Hence, expectations of future tax rates determine the

quilibrium outcome, and both low and high tsx rate expectation are self

fulfilling.




2.   No capital mobility



     Next consider the case with no international capital mobility in the

debtor country (the following results apply also to cases of binding

quantative restrictions on capital movements).         In this case investment

equals saving and we need to specify saving behavior in order to analize

investment levels.      I employ a simple two             period   model.4   The second

period was described in the previous sections.                 In the first period

residents of the debtor country consume c0                  and aquire       e   real equities.

Firms invest    1.    Let   y    be output in this period.              Then the

and declining in       e       as long as     u(-)           is strictly concave.   The latcer

applies whenever residents of the debtor country are risk averse.                         The

separate functional forms for first and second period utility are designed

to separate considerations of second period risk aversion from

intertemporal substitution.



       Equations (15) and (16) apply to every distribution of returns on

real equity and can be combined to yield a demand price for equities.                           In

our case (2) and (11) can be used to derive the rate of return function.

They imply that in states of full repayment the rate of return is

declining in debt and increasing in investment,                      and the rate of return is

constant in states of partial repayment. Hence, if the Arrow-Pratt

measure of relative risk aversion p(c)-u''(c)c/u'(c)                         is larger than one

the product u'[n(O;D,I)lq(G;D,I) increases                         in debt and declines in

investment.     If the measure of relative risk aversion is smaller than one

this product declines in debt and increases in investment.                          Therefore we

have
                                       - 19   -




gjg:      If the relative degree of risk aversion is larger than one

               increases in debt and declines in investment,             and if the
s(c0,e;D,I)

relative degree of risk aversion is smaller than one                s(c0,e;O,I)

declines in debt and increases        in investment.



The intiution behind this result can be explains as follows. An increase

in debt reduces the return to equity in every state with full repayment.

This generates two effects; an income and a rate of return effect.                 The

income effect stems from the fact that given equity holdings future income

falls in some states but does not rise in others.                Consequently,   the value

of assets that transfer income from the present to the future increases,

including the value of equity.         On the other hand, a decline in the rate

of return on equity reduces its value as an asset.                Therefore the net

effect on     s()   depends on whether the income effect dominates the rate

of return effect or vise versa.         The income effect dominates under high

risk aversion (i.e.   ,   p(c)>l)     while the rate of return effect dominates

under low risk aversion.6



       Next observe that in the absence of capital mobolity debtor country

residents hold all domestic equity;           i.e.,    eâ€”E(I).     Together with (13)

this condition implies                  Namely,   first period consumption equals
                            c0â€”y-I.

output minus investment.      Subsituting these results into (15) yields the

derived demand price function




6A diagramatic exposition of the income effect is available in Helpman
(1988).  See also Corden (l988b).

              (DI)      s[y-I,E(I);D,I].



Investment affects the demand price through three channels: first period

consumption, the stock of real equities, and the rate of return on equity.

Higher investment reduces the demand price via the first two channels and

reduces it via the third channel if and only if the degree of relative

risk aversion is larger than one (see Lena).        The last condition also

ensures that the demand price increases in debt.      Hence, the demand curve

slopes downward when risk aversion is high, as in Figure 6, and debt

reduction shifts the demand curve downwards, thereby depressing

investment.




Proposition 3:      If there is no international   capital mobility and the

degree of relative risk aversion is larger than one, then

(a)   A   unique level of investment is associated with every debt level;

(b)   Debt reduction depresses investment.



      When the degree of relative riak aversion is smaller than one the

affect of investment on first period consumption and the stock of real

equities may cause the demand curve to slope downward.       In this case,

however, debt reduction shifts it upwards (see the Lemma),       thereby

stimulating investment.     It is also clear that even if- -as   a   consequence

of low risk aversion--the demand curve slopes upwards, debt reduction

stimulates investment at every stable equilibrium point (i.e., points at
                                         - 21   -




which      the demand curve is flatter than the supply curve),   because it

hringa about an upward shift of the demand curve.



Proposition      4:     If there is no international capital mobility and the

degree of relative risk aversion is smaller than one debt reduction

increases      investment at every stable equilibrium with positive investment.



Propositions 1-4 summerize the effect of debt reduction on investment;           it

can be positive or negative, depending on the degree of capital mobility

and attitudes toward risk.7



           More insight can be gained by identifying links among these results.

Free capital mobility leads to a linear evaluation of equities.

Therefore, in the presence of restrictions on capital mobility one expects

low risk aversion to generate results that are closer to the case of

                                                         which indeed happens.

demand price    via   the rate   of return      effect, just as in the case of free

capital mobility. The price is also proportional to the mean return,

except that the factor of proportionality depends on investment.             The

latter dependence disappears altogether when the elasticity of

substitution between present and future consumption goes to infinity.

Under these circumstances the effects of debt forgiveness on investment

are the same as under free capital mobility.             For this reason we have:



Proposition    5:     If there is no international capital mobility,      the degree

of relative risk aversion is smaller than one, and the elasticity of

intertemporal substitution is sufficiently high, the relationship between

debt and investment is the ssme as in the case of free capital mobility.



I should like to emphasized that the similarity in results            that is pointed

out in this proposition applies not only to the response of investment to

debt but also to the possibility of multiple equilibria.



                                     VI.       Welfare



       The typical analysis of the affect of debt on investment does not

draw a clear distinctiom between equilibrium and welfare maximizing

investment levels (see, for exsmple, Sachs (1988)).8             This difference is,

however, important.       For example, models with optimal investment preclude

the possibility of multiple equilibria of the type described in the

previous      section.    I assuxne        that investment is governed by market forces.

The following analysis is concerned with the welfare implications of debt

reduction for the debtor and the creditors,                      taking into account investment

responses.       I emphasize the role of the degree of capital mobility and

attitudes toward risk.



     As far as the debtor is concerned,                     its welfare is measured   by    the

depends on the price of equity, net wealth, and directly on debt and

investment which determine the rate of return on equity via the tax rates.

The first term on the right hand side represents the assets terms of trade

effect.       If there are restrictions on capital mobility and                   eâ€”E(I)       it is

zero.     In the presence of free capital mobility I make the reasonable

assumption that domestic residents hold only part of their equity; i.e.,

the critical state, however, have second order effects (because the rate
of return function is continuous despite the fact that its derivatives are
not) and are therefore disregarded in this formula.

E(I)>e.   In this case debt reduction raises investment and the price of

equity at stable equilibria (unless the economy jumps to a different

equilibrium) and the debtor gains on account of better asset terms of

trade (see Proposition   l).    The second term is always zero, because

firms maximize net value (see (9)).       The third term describes the direct

effect of debt and investment on welfare through the rate of return, or

equivalently,   through the tax rates.        Debt reduction raises investment at

a stable equilibrium when capital moves freely.          In this case tax rates

decline in states of full repayment both as a result of lower debt service

payments and higher investment.     Consequently,      the rate of return rises   in

these state and the debtor gains.



     In the absence of capital mobility only changes in the rate of return

affect the debtor's welfare, and I have shown in the previous section that

under these circumstances debt reduction increases investment at stable

equilibria if and only if the degree of relative risk aversion is smaller

than one (see Propositions 3 and 4).          Hence, when the degree of relative

risk aversion falls short of one debt reduction increases the rate of

return on equity in states of full repayment, both through the direct

effect of lower debt and the indirect investment effect on tax rates.

Consequently, the country gains.        In the absence of capital mobility and a

larger than one degree of relative risk aversion debt forgiveness reduces

investment. In this case the rate of return rises as a result of the

additional assets. My results do not change as long as the price of these
assets is not influenced by either debt or investment.

direct effect    of lower debt and falls as a result of the indirect

investment effect on tax rates.      The former effect dominates, however, and

rates of return increase in states of full repayment.11 This establishes



Proposition 6:    The debtor gains from debt reduction when the economy is

at a stable equilibium and does not jump to another equilibrium.



Note that in the absence of cspital mobility the response of investment to

debt reduction hurts the debtor whenever the degree of relative risk

                                                                                  We

have established, however, that this negative feedback does not suffice to

make the debtor worse off.



     Next I considered the welfare ranking of multiple equilibia. As

before,    in the absence of capital mobility eâ€”E(I)             and in the presence of

capital mobility     esE(I).   Under these conditions we have the following

result:

forgiveness depresses investment. On the other hand,

Lower investment impliee a lower value of q(.) and a higher value of

full repayment have to be higher for the demand price for equity to equal
the supply price (see Lemma); namely,

Proposition   7:   Given the degree of tapital mobility and the level of debt

the debtor prefers an equilibrium with higher investment.




Â£QQf:   First consider the case of no capital mobility.                    (Naturally,     in

this case multiplicity of equilibria can arise only when the degree of

relative risk aversion is smaller than one and there is sufficient

intertermporal substitution in consumption (see Proposition 5).)                     Figure 7

presents two equilibrium points, I and 2.                The curve    TT   describes the

tradoff between first period net resources                  y-I   and real equity E(I).

In the absence of capital mobility first period consumption and equity

holdings have to be on this curve.          An equilibrium is characterized by the

tangency of an indifferencs curve to            TT, where the indifference curve is

defined by combinations of                  that maintain a constant level of
                              (c0,e)

U(c0,e;D,I)   (defined in (14)) and         I     is the investment level at the

tangency point.    Pointa 1 and 2 satisfy this requirement. Since these

indifference curves have the usual shape, they have to intersect.                    In the

figure they intersect at point   3.        Now,       since higher investment implies

lower tax rates,                                            for all               and in
                    U(c0,e;D,12)>U(c0,e;D,11)                         (c0,e),

particular for the pair at point      3.     This establishes
                                                                       1J2>1J1.




     In the presence of capital mobility the production point is on                      TT

but the consumption point can be anywhere on the implied budget line.                       The

production point is determined by the tangency of a line with slope

q(DI)    (defined in (12)) to    TT,       where        I    is the investment level at

this point.   The resulting line is the budget line on which consumption is
                                           - 27    -




chosen.     Point 1 in Figure 8 describes a production equilibrium. The

corresponding consumption point is 1', at which an indifference curve for

                                                                      Since        is to

equilibrium with higher investment.               Then the budget line that is tangent

to   TT    at 2 (not drawn) intersects the indifference curve.           It implies

that with preferences                             it is now possible to reach a higher
                      TJ(c0,e;D,11)

welfare level.         Since                                   it is certainly
                               tJ(c0,e;D,12)>U(c0,e;D,11),

possible to reach a higher welfare level with iJ(c0,e;D,12).              Hence,    the


equilibrium with higher investment is preferable.



        I have shown that the debtor prefers equilibria with higher invest-

ment.     But so do the creditors.         Their welfare is measured by the market

value of debt         V(D,I) (see (5)).     Since this function increases in

investment,




Proposition     8:     Given the level of debt creditors prefer an equilibrium

with higher investment.



Creditors prefer equilibria with higher investment,             because the higher the

investment level the larger the set of states with full repayment and the

larger repayment per unit debt in states of partial repayment. Since the

debtor also prefers equilibria with higher investment,             no conflict arises

between the debtor and the creditors in the ordering of these equilibria.

Nevertheless,        when the economy settles on a low investment equilibrium
                                              -   28   -




they    cannot switch to a better one without explicit coordination.



        Now consider the incentive of creditors to write down debt.               In this

seccion they are treated as a single entity; the incentives of individual

creditors are discussed in the following section.                  First, observe that a

debt write-down has a direct adverse effect on the creditors'                 welfare,

because       V(D,I)    increases   in   D.       Therefore creditors benefit from debt

relief only when it stimulates investment to a sufficiently large degree

so as to outweight the negative direct effect.                  Consequently, voluntary

debt reduction will not be observed when it depresses investment.                  In view

of Proposition 3 this implies



Proposition 9:         If there is no international          capital mobility and the

degree of relative risk aversion is larger than one, creditors do not

benefit from debt reduction.



        In other cases creditors may or may not benefit from debt reduction.

Take,    for example, the case in which a unique equilibrium exists for every

debt level.      Let     1(D)   be investment as a function of debt, assumed to be

differentiable. Then from (5) we obtain



                                                   0 (D,I)
                  â€” 1    -   G(6 [D,I(D)]) +
 V[D,I(D)]                                        Jc         O(tE'[I(D)]/R)dG(9)I'(D)




For     Dâ€”O   this expression is equal to one, implying that the market value

of debt rises with its face value for small debt levels even when one
                                         - 29   -




takes account of      changes in investment.        It is also clear that for

sufficiently large values of debt l-G(y)              is close to zero.    Therefore,

if     I'(I)<O    the right hand side may be negative for large debc levels,

which would imply a market value that declines with debt.             Figure 9

depicts two simulated market value curves from the same functional forms,

each panel repcesenting a different value of a parameter a                in the

function E(I)J2         In the upper panel market value rises with debt for all

debt lelels.       In the lower panel market value rises for low debt levels

and declines thereafter.         In the first case creditors have no incentive to

reduce debt.       In the second case creditors benefit from debt reduction

when             (see also Sachs    (1988), Krugman (1988), and Froot (1988)).

response to an increase in its face value when there exist multiple

equilibria,      as I explained in what follows.       Therefore,



Proposition 10:       If there is free capital mobility or there is no capital

mobility but the relative degree of risk aversion is smaller than one,

there may exist sufficiently large debt levels at which the creditors

benefit from debt reduction.



Observe that a negative effect of higher debt on investment does not

guarantee voluntary debt reduction. The point is that even under these

circumstances the market value of debt may be rising with        its face value,

and even when it does not always rise with the debt's face value voluntary

debt reduction requires the inital debt to be sufficiently large.



     Particularly interesting features of the debt relief problem arise

when there are multiple equilibria. Consider the situation described in

Figure    5,   where two equilibria exist for every debt level in the range

               This may arise in the presence of unrestricted capital mobility,

or in the absence of capital mobility but a smaller than one degree of

relative risk aversion and a high elasticity of intertemporal substitution

(see Proposition 5).        Suppose that debt slightly exceeds   DL    and the

economy is trapped in the low investment equilibrium.         Then both parties

prefer to switch to the high investment equilibrium (see Propositions 7

and 8).        The problem is, however, that there do not    Lst market forces

that authomatically bring about a switch.         On the other hand,   the

creditors can orchestrate a switch by a small amount of debt forgiveness,

because once debt is below             the economy moves to the high investment
                                  DL
equilibrium. Given I          a small amount of debt forgiveness reduces V(D,I)

by a small amount.        On the other hand, a discrete increase in investment

brings about a discrete increase in V(D,I).          Therefore in this case debt

relief benefits the creditors as well as the debtor (although the

creditors prefer a switch to the high investment equilibrium without debt

reduction).        In this situation debt reduction can perform the important

function of a trigger that shifts the economy to a better equilibrium.
                                        -    31   -




     Figure   10 describes the market value of debt as a function of its

face velue for the exsmple presented in footnote 2.             In the range

         in which there are two equilibria,             the upper curve plots values

for the high investment equilibrium while the lower horizontal line plots

vslues for the low investment equilibrium. In this example the low

investment equilibrium has always zero investment.             For this reason the

market value of debt does not change with its face value in the low

investment equilibrium.      Clearly,       in the zero investment equilibrium

creditors lose nothing by collectively reducing debt to             DL   and they

stand to gain a lot by a slight further reduction. Hence,



Proposition 11:    In the presence of multiple equilibria debt reduction

benefits the creditors whenever the economy would otherwise be in the zero

investment equilibrium.



The fact that the creditors have a collective incentive to provide debt

relief does not imply that individual creditors have the same incentive.

This is known as the free rider problem.              The following section discusses

possible outcomes,   taking into account the incentives facing individual

creditors.



                      VII.    Equilibrium Debt Reduction



     We have seen that there exist circumstances in which the market value

of debt V[D,I(D)J     rises with its face value; other circumstances in
                                    - 32   -




which it rises for low face values    and declines for high face values;    and

that it can in fact drop discontinuousely. Whenever market value rises

with face value creditors lose from debt reduction, unless there is more

than one investment equilibrium and debt reduction switches the economy

froa a low to a high investment equilibrium. In the latter case--as well

as in the case in which the face value of debt falls     into a range in which

market value declines with face value- -creditors are interested to provide

debt relief.    This, however, is a collective interest.   A   frequent

argument states that even when debt reduction serves the collective

incarest of creditors, a single creditor stands to gain more by not

participating in a relief program. Because once debt is forgiven by

others,   he fully enjoys higher repayments per unit debt without diluting

the face value of his holdings.     I show that in the single equilibrium

case this argument has no justification; a single creditor can benefit

from a voluntary reduction of his claims.      It may, however, apply in the

presence of multiple equilibria.



     In order to examine this issue I formulate the relief decision as a

noncooperative game among creditors. For simplicity I only discuss

symmetric games and their corresponding symmetric equilibria (i.e. ,games

in which every creditor owns the same face value of debt).      First,

consider the case in which a single investment equilibrium exists for

every level of debt (i.e.,   1(D)   is a function), and the lower panel of

Figure 9 describes the market value of debt curve.     Equation (6) gives the

price of a unit of debt.   Taking account of the response of investment to
                                                 -       33   -




changes in debt, the price can also be expressed as



               P(D)     p{D,I(D)].                                                                 (19)




This function declines in          0.




      The game is formulated as follows.                          A   single creditor owns   D/n

units of debt, where          n   denotes the number of creditors. He can choose

to reduce his holding to          dD/n.              He wishes to maximize the market value

of   d.     Therefore, if the other creditors' holdings after their

forgiveness decision is denoted by                        D,      he solves the following problem:



              max [P(D        + d)d   I
                                          s.t.       d        D/n].                                (20)
               d


This game resembles a Cournot oligopoly in which firms maximize revenue

and sales are limited by a capacity ceiling.                            Assuming that the marginal

revenue curve         MR(D)P(D)+P'(D)D               slopes downward,         the symmetric solution

satisfies:



A.    For    MR(D)      0;     d â€” D/n      and no debt reduction takes place;

B.    For    MR(D) <     0;    d is implicitly defined by                   m(nd) â€” 0   and voluntary

      debt reduction takes place;

                                           (see    Helpman and Krugman (1988, Chap.

4))13            11 describes this solution.         Curve m(D)     is located
          Figure

between the demand and the marginal revenue curves; it coincides with the

marginal revenue curve when      n=l     and with the demand curve when there are

infinitely many creditors.       A   single monopoly creditor provides voluntary

debt reduction whenever debt exceeds D0,            where         in Figure 11

corresponds to        in Figure      914   Hence, a single creditor provides

relief that maximizes the market value of debt, just like a monopolist who

choees output to maximize total revenue in the absence of costa.                 Seceral

noncooperating creditors provide debt reduction to           Dn    whenever      D>D.

Their joint forgiveness is not as large as the single creditor's,                but they

do forgive nevertheless.     For every finite number of creditors the

noncooperative solution implies debt reduction for sufficiently high debt

levela.    These results are aummerized in the following proposition:



Fxpppsition 12:    If there exists free capital mobility or there is no

capital mobility but the degree of relative risk aversion is smaller than

one, and a single inveatment level corresponds to every debt level,                then:




13The individual creditor's marginal revenue is P(D Ã· d) + P'(D + d)d.
His objective function is maximized when this is equal to zero. When this
is achieved at dD/n,    this is also the solution to (20). If, however,
this is achieved at d>0/n, his ceiling constraint is binding and he
chooses d=D/n. In a symmetrical equilibrium we examine marginal revenue
P(nd) + P'(nd)d, which is given by m(nd).

(a)   For every finite number of creditors there exists a minimal debt

level at which creditors provide voluntary debt reduction.

(b)   The minimal debt level increases with the number of creditors,               and

the post-relief face value of debt exceeds the market value maximizing

level (unless nâ€”l).



      Multiple equilibria introduce new possibilities. In order to clarify

them, consider the example developed in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 10.                The

demand curve   P(D)        has two separate portions, as depicted in Figure 12;

the upper portion corresponds to equilibria with positive investment while

the lower correaponds to equilibria with zero investment.              The lower

portion is defined by           PDâ€”V0     implying a marginal revenue of zero.

Therefore, as long as creditors perceive changes along this curve (namely,

they believe that their contribution to debt reduction will not bring

about a shift to the positive investment equilibrium),              they have no

incentive to reduce debt.             In these circumstances   there exists a


noncooperative equilibrium with debt forgiveness only when every creditor

is willing to provide the marginal debt reduction that reduces the debt's

face value just below                 A direct calculation shows that

        On the other hand, the satisfaction of (21) does not exclude an

 Proposition    13:     If there exist multiple investment equilibria for a given

 debt level then an equilibrium with debt reduction may coexist with an

 equilibrium without debt reduction.



Ihis result shows that debt reduction is not guaranteed even when it is an

equilibrium phenomenon, because it may coexist with an equilibrium in

which there is no debt reduction. Which one emerges depends on

expectations.         If creditors believe that others will forgive debt, they

also chose to forgive and debt reduction obtains.               If, on the other hand,

creditors believe that others will not forgive, they also chose not to

forgive and no debt reduction takes place.               This happens only when the

economy is trapped in a low investment equilibrium. It represents a clear

instance in which cooperation has a high return.



                                 VIII.   Conclusions



     My results show that the desirability and likelihood of voluntary

debt reduction depend on circumstances. Creditors benefit from a

write-down of debt in some circumstances and lose in others.              Theory helps
to identify important features of those circumstances. But once those

features are known, there is no substitute for a careful examination of

their applicability to toncrete countries.               In particular, estimates of

the function V{D,I(D)]         are needed in order to form a judgement on

whether debt reduction helps the banks.               This function can, in principle,

be recovered from data on secondary market prices.              Unfortunately, these

debtor    and creditors desire to switch to a high investment equilibrium.

Nevertheless, market forcea may not bring about a switch.            In this csse

voluntary debc reduction can play a useful role in inducing the desired

switch.     However,   debt redcution fails to fulfill this role if

expectations are pessimistic. In this case the debtor country government

can improvement on the free market outcome.



      Suppose, for example, that lump-sum taxes are available in the debtor

country in the first period.      Then the government can use them in order to

raise revenue end subsidize investment.            An investment subsidy shifts down

the   q(-)     curve (see Figure 4) and thereby raises investnent at every

stable equilibrium. In addition,      sufficiently high subsidies eliminate
the zero investment equilibrium,     thereby benefitcing the debtor and the
banks.     But lump-sum taxes are seldom available.        Therefore an optimal

policy from the debtor's point of view needs to take into account the

dead-weight loss associated with the use of distortionary taxes.           This

dead-weight loss tilts the cost-benefit analysis against investment

subsidies.



      I   have described several examples of policy applications. There are

many other policies that can be considered,          such as alternative forms of

taxation,    changes in public spending,       and control of international capital

flows.    The desirability of debt reduction depends on these policies.
