                                         ABSTRACT

Evidence from the American Time Use Survey 2003-12 suggests the existence of small but
statistically significant racial/ethnic differences in time spent not working at the workplace.
Minorities, especially men, spend a greater fraction of their workdays not working than do white
non-Hispanics. These differences are robust to the inclusion of large numbers of demographic,
industry, occupation, time and geographic controls. They do not vary by union status, public-
private sector attachment, pay method or age; nor do they arise from the effects of equal-
employment enforcement or geographic differences in racial/ethnic representation. The findings
imply that measures of the adjusted wage disadvantages of minority employees are overstated by
about 10 percent.

   I.      Hours on the Job and Hours Working

   Commonly used statistics on labor productivity and real wages are normally computed by

dividing measures such as earnings by hours reported as having been worked. Estimates of

(adjusted) wage differentials (discrimination) across racial-ethnic-gender groups require

adjusting weekly earnings for differences in hours worked among these groups. In the United

States the commonly used measures of hours are either reported weekly hours in the monthly

household-based Current Population Survey (CPS), weekly, monthly or annual hours in other

household surveys, or weekly hours reported by employers in the monthly Current Employment

Statistics (CES).

   The use of any of these measures may produce biased estimates of the outcomes of interest,

including time series of changes in labor productivity (examined by Burda et al, 2013 and 2016),

measures of growth in living standards per hour of work, and demographic wage differentials in

the cross section. If, for example, reported hours exceed actual hours worked by less among

minority and/or female workers than among others, estimates of adjusted hourly wage/earnings

differentials will understate the extent of discriminatory differences in earnings.

   Until recently accounting for this potential difficulty was not possible—no nationally

representative data set provided information on what people do during the hours that they report

working. The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) (see Hamermesh et al, 2005) provides diary

information on over 400 possible activities engaged in by large samples of (former CPS)

respondents, including detailed information on a wide variety of different activities undertaken in

the workplace. We use these data from 2003-12 to examine differences among demographic

groups in the amount of time that they spend at the workplace but not working (Hofferth et al,

2015).



                                                  1
   II.     ATUS Measures of Time Use on the Job

   As part of its daily diaries, the ATUS includes information on where during each of most of

the activities that were undertaken the respondent was located, with one possibility being “at the

workplace.” Work and work-related activities (including socializing, and eating and exercising

as a part of the job) constitute the primary activity for most time at the workplace, and we

assume it represents productive time; but respondents also indicate being at the workplace during

other primary activities such as eating at work, “socializing, relaxing and leisure,” “sports and

exercise” and “security procedures”. These categories also include employer-sanctioned breaks

or self-initiated “down time” in work schedules. We combine all time spent in primary activities

at work other than work or work-related activities and divide by reported (in the diary) total time

at the workplace to create η, the fraction of time while at the workplace that the person is not

working. This measure excludes time when the person might be working for pay but is not at the

workplace. One might regard some of these non-work activities as productive, as are many off-

the-job activities (e.g., exercise, sleep and many others); but we accept respondents’ notions of

what constitutes their regular work, as reflected in their diaries, and treat the residual time at

work as non-work.

   The first decade of ATUS diaries, 2003-12, included over 135,000 respondents. Because we

require diaries from workdays, and because the ATUS oversamples weekend days, far fewer

diaries are usable for our purpose. Moreover, since our estimates can form the basis for adjusting

wage differentials, worker productivity, and other outcomes, we focus only on employees (thus

excluding the self-employed). These exclusions leave us with 35,548 workers who provided

daily diaries for days on which they were at their place of employment. We divide the sample by

gender, then divide workers in each gender into five mutually exclusive and exhaustive



                                                2
racial/ethnic groups: Non-Hispanic white; African-American; Non-black Hispanic; Asian-

American, and Other. We classify any Non-black respondent listing his/her ethnicity as Hispanic

in the third category.

    In Table 1 we present estimates of η, the fraction of the workday not working, by gender and

racial/ethnic group, constructed as means using BLS ATUS final weights. There are substantial

differences in the η within each gender across the racial ethnic groups, with Non-Hispanic whites

reporting less non-work time per hour at work than other groups. Of course, these differences do

not account for demographic or other differences across the groups, and we explore those in the

next section.

    A notable feature in these statistics is that η is nearly identical between Non-Hispanic white

men and women. For workers of each gender about 6.5 percent of time at the workplace is spent

not working—about a half hour in a full work day. 1 Among minority groups there is no obvious

general pattern of differences between male and female workers—African-American, Non-black

Hispanic and Other men spend greater fractions of their time in non-work activities than their

female counterparts, while Asian-American male workers spend less.

    One might be concerned that the samples are unrepresentative in various ways, perhaps due

to the exclusion restrictions that we have used in creating this sub-sample. This concern should

be allayed, at least for male workers, by comparisons within columns of the fourth and fifth rows

in the upper half of Table 1. The weighted fractions of male workers in each of the five

racial/ethnic groups are very near those reported in the American Community Survey (ACS)

averaged over 2003-2012 (Ruggles et al, 2015). The differences between female workers’

representation in our ATUS sub-sample and the ACS are proportionately larger than the


1
 Remember that time eating during work hours is usually not at the workplace, which accounts for what might seem
like a small fraction of worktime spent not working on the job.

                                                       3
differences among men; but they are fairly small absolutely among the three largest racial/ethnic

groups.

   III.    Accounting for Other Demographic, Industry and Occupational Influences

   The raw differences shown in the top rows of each half of Table 1 are interesting but not

conclusive, because they could stem from differences in the amount of time spent at the

workplace or in the number of hours usually worked; from racial/ethnic differences in labor

supply due to family circumstances; from demand-side differences arising from differential

occupation/industry attachment by race/ethnicity; and perhaps even from differences in location,

or in the day of the week or month of the year for which the time diary is completed. In what

follows, we estimate OLS regressions for η to account for the roles played by these factors,

adding increasingly large numbers of vectors of covariates. We use Non-Hispanic whites within

each gender as the comparison group and examine how the addition of these covariates alters our

conclusions about racial/ethnic relative differences in non-work time at work.

   The first rows in the top and bottom parts of Table 2 present the differences in η between

workers in each of the four racial/ethnic minorities and that of Non-Hispanic whites, simply

reproducing the differences implicit in Table 1, plus adding their standard errors. They are thus

estimates of α1 in the equation:

   (1) ηist = α0 + α1Xist + εist ,

where i is an individual, s a state, t a month, X is the vector of indicators of race/ethnicity, the α

are parameters to be estimated, and ε is the disturbance term. What is most intriguing in these

raw differences is that all four are positive—all the minorities that are identifiable in the CPS,

including those that may be viewed as not being disadvantaged, spend greater fractions of their

time at work not working when compared to non-Hispanic whites. They are largest, and



                                                  4
statistically greater than zero, for the two largest minority groups, African-Americans and Non-

black Hispanics. In the second rows of each half of the table we simply add pairs of quadratics in

the length of the respondent’s usual workweek, as recalled, and the time spent at the workplace

on the diary day, as recorded in the diary. These controls hardly alter the racial/ethnic differences

in η, suggesting if anything that the raw differences are understatements.

   Because race and ethnicity are correlated with such demographic differences as marital

status, age and number of children, geography and others, the differentials in the second rows of

Table 2 may merely be reflecting familial and other incentives that alter the amount of non-work

on-the-job. To account for this possibility, the third rows include as covariates: Marital and

metropolitan status; a quadratic in potential experience; vectors of five indicators of the ages of

the children in the household, and four indicators of the respondent’s educational attainment.

   Except for Asian-Americans, the inclusion of these covariates does reduce the estimated

differential in reported non-work time between minority groups and majority workers. The

differences remain statistically significant for the two largest groups, however, and they become

statistically significant among Asian-American workers. The greater propensity for on-the-job

non-work noted in Table 1 is not due to differences in demographic characteristics between

minority and majority workers.

   The estimates thus far do not account for the possibility that the structure of labor demand by

race/ethnicity differs across industries and occupations; nor do they acknowledge, even with

workdays of the same length, that the extent of non-work may differ by day of week or time of

year; nor do they recognize that other characteristics may differ geographically. To account for

these possibilities we re-estimate the equations adding vectors of indicators of the month of the




                                                 5
year and day of the week on which the diary was kept; of geographic area (state); and of what are

essentially two-digit classifications of occupation and industry.

    The results of adding these additional controls are shown in the fourth rows of Table 2.

Among men all of the estimated racial/ethnic differences in non-work decline, but for Non-

Hispanic black, Non-black Hispanic, and Asian-American men the significantly positive results

of the previous estimates persist; and the reductions of the differentials for the two largest

minority groups are quite small. Among female workers the reductions in the estimated effects

are large, but here too they remain statistically significant and positive for workers in the two

largest minority groups.

    We can go further by replacing the vectors of two-digit occupation and industry indicators by

much longer vectors, accounting for over 500 occupations and over 250 industries. The results of

making these substitutions are presented in the bottom rows of the two parts of Table 2. Among

men including these much finer controls does reduce the estimated minority-majority

differentials in η; but those differentials that had been significantly positive remain so. Among

women workers including these additional covariates also reduces the estimated racial/ethnic

differentials, but the changes are small compared to the estimates based on including the broader

industry/occupation indicators.2

    Do the differentials arise from a greater willingness of minorities to report non-work time on

the job or from cultural differences about what constitutes actual work? First, that all minorities

report more non-work would, if it stemmed from cultural differences, imply similar attitudes



2
 If we re-estimate these final equations dropping time spent eating at the workplace, the racial-ethnic differentials
for male workers are proportionately even larger, while those for female workers are approximately the same. If we
include both the quadratic in time at the workplace from the time diaries and total time reported in the diaries as
working, the adjusted demographic differences are essentially unchanged. While all of the estimates reported in the
tables and discussed in the text use the proportions of time at work spent not working, using the raw amounts of
non-work time instead yields slightly larger and more statistically significant racial/ethnic differentials.

                                                         6
across the minority groups, which seems hard to credit. Second, if cultural differences between

minority groups and the majority workers are causing reporting differences, one would expect

that they would be greater among immigrant minority workers, who have had less time to

assimilate to the majority culture. Interactions of immigrant status with the race/ethnic indicators

are, however, far from statistically significant when added to the specifications in the bottom

rows of Table 2. Third, the findings do not stem from minorities’ greater willingness to report

different activities, including non-work on the job. Non-Hispanic whites report 19.78

(s.e.=0.032) different activities per day on average, while the average numbers of different

activities reported by minorities are: African-Americans, 18.77 (s.e.=0.078), Non-black

Hispanics, 18.05 (s.e.=0.071), Asian-Americans 18.90 (s.e.=0.134), Others, 19.63 (s.e.=0.188).

Minorities report fewer different activities per day than otherwise identical majority workers.

   The best evidence that these results do not merely arise from differing willingness to report

non-work due to racial differences in the social desirability of work comes from analyses of the

General Social Surveys. They have included two questions that allow examining such

differences: 1) For all respondents, “If you were to get enough money to live as comfortably as

you would like for the rest of your life, would you continue to work or would you stop

working?” and 2) For workers, agreement with the statement, “My main satisfaction in life

comes from work.” Estimating a probit (ordered probit) on the responses to Question 1 (2) and

excluding racial groups other than whites and African-Americans, the latter are insignificantly

more likely to say they would stop work; but they are nearly significantly more likely to agree or

agree strongly with the statement about the importance of satisfaction with work. (See Appendix

Table A1 for results.) There is clearly no racial difference in how people view the desirability of




                                                 7
work, suggesting (but not proving) that differences in willingness to report non-work at work are

unimportant.

   A number of institutional differences among the sample observations might account for or at

least minimize the findings implied in the bottom rows of the panels in Table 2. Trade unions

may provide more services to minority workers, perhaps for political reasons (at least to African-

American workers, who are more heavily unionized than other groups), perhaps arising from

preferences of union members and leaders to protect minority workers. To examine this

possibility we added an indicator of union status and its interactions with the four racial/ethnic

indicators. Among men (women) the F-statistic on the significance of these interactions yielded

p = 0.82 (p = 0.41), suggesting that these racial/ethnic differences in non-work arise in both

union and non-union environments.

   Hourly workers may be monitored more closely, and this might account for racial/ethnic

differentials in non-work. We added an indicator of hourly pay status and its interactions with the

racial/ethnic indicators to the expanded equations shown in the bottom rows of Table 2. Among

women the F-statistic on the interactions yielded p = 0.30, but among men the vector of

interactions was statistically significant (p = 0.04). Its significance was, however, due entirely to

the significance of the interaction with the indicator for Asian-Americans. In a similar set of

expanded specifications distinguishing between the roughly one-sixth of workers in the public

sector and others there was again no significant difference in the racial/ethnic non-work

differentials by sector, with the F-statistic on the interaction terms for men (women) yielding p =

0.88 (p = 0.12).

   Finally, the influence of age on non-work time may differ between majority and minority

workers. To examine this, we created an indicator, age ≤ 40, which divided the samples



                                                 8
essentially in halves. Including this indicator and its interactions in the expanded equations

shown in Table 2, we found no difference in the racial/ethnic non-work differentials by age:

Among men (women) the significance of the F-statistics describing the four interaction terms

was p = 0.33 (p = 0.36). All four re-specifications described in these paragraphs support the

robustness of the results presented in the bottom rows of each panel of Table 2 across various

cuts of the data.

    While the descriptive statistics in Table 1 allow comparisons by racial/ethnic group of gender

differences in non-work, they do not account for differences that might arise from any male-

female differences in the large sets of controls that we added to generate most of the estimates in

Table 2. To obtain an adjusted gender difference in on-the-job non-work we estimate the

equation in the last rows of Table 2 for all 35,548 workers in the sample. All these other things

equal, male workers spend an additional fraction of 0.001 (s.e.= 0.002) of the workday not

working compared to female workers. The conclusion of little gender difference conveyed by the

raw differences in Table 1 is supported even after accounting for large numbers of possible

covariates. While there are significant racial/ethnic differentials in non-work on the job, there is

essentially no difference between otherwise identical male and female employees.

    Aggregating the adjusted effects among men, the best estimate is that on average minority

male workers (based on a sample-weighted average of the parameter estimates in the bottom row

of the top half of Table 2) spend an additional 1.10 percent of each workday not working on-the-

job compared to their majority counterparts. Over a 250-day full-time work year this amounts to

an additional 22 hours per year of not working while at work. Taking all four female minority

groups together, these best estimates suggest that the average minority female worker spends




                                                 9
0.64 percent less of each additional hour at work actually working compared to her majority

counterparts, i.e., 14 hours of a full-time work year.3

      IV.     The Economic Significance of Racial-Ethnic Differences in Non-Work and Their
              Cause(s)

    A. The Economic Magnitude of the Differences in Non-Work

     While statistically significant and robustly so, these racial/ethnic differences are not large. To

what extent do these results alter our conclusions about the extent of racial/ethnic differences in

outcomes, in particular in hourly earnings—the best measure of the price of labor of different

races/ethnicities? How do they compare to the impacts of various shocks to other outcomes of

interest generated in the literatures in labor and demographic economics?

      On the first issue, a recent study (Anant et al, 2013) estimated adjusted black-white wage

differentials at around 14 percent, Hispanic- non-Hispanic white adjusted wage differentials at

around 15 percent, Asian-American wage differences at around 13 percent, and white-Other

differences at around 14 percent. D’Haultfoeuille et al (2014) find median estimates of the

black-white wage gap using samples from the NLSY79 and NLSY97 of around 12 percent. Thus

using our estimates for men, and adjusting reported hours worked for racial/ethnic differences in

on-the-job non-work, the measured extent of discrimination against African-Americans would be

reduced by more than 1 percentage point (about a 10 percent reduction), and among African-

American women by over one-half percentage point. In comparison, these are no smaller than

the adjustments/explanations that have been produced in studies that have examined the impacts

of unusual determinants of demographic differences in wages (e.g., Gielen et al, 2016).
3
 One might argue that the differences that we have identified arise because of racial/ethnic differences in time use
away from the job. Minorities might spend more time commuting, might sleep less or might engage in more
household production. These measures may well be endogenous with non-work time at work; nonetheless, to
examine their relation to the racial/ethnic differences we have focused on, we include each separately in the
expanded equations shown in the bottom of each panel of Table 2, then include them jointly. Including each
separately actually raises slightly the estimated excess of minority over majority non-work time. Taking them
together, their inclusion raises the excess among men (women) by about 10 (15) percent.

                                                        10
   It is more difficult to compare the magnitudes of the impacts of the adjusted racial/ethnic

differences in on-the-job non-work to the impacts of shocks in other areas where there is no

monetary outcome to consider. Thus the best comparisons use differences measured in standard-

deviation units. Among men (women) the adjusted weighted average estimated differences in

non-work between minority and majority workers are 0.10 (0.06) of a standard deviation. These

are much greater than some produced in the demographic literature (e.g., Banerjee et al, 2010)

and comparable to the larger effects on educational outcomes (test scores) of variations in

teacher quality found in the education literature (e.g., Rivkin et al, 2005).

 B. Sorting Out Possible Causes

   Merely demonstrating the existence of significant differences in on-the-job non-work

between minority and majority workers does not establish their origins. In what follows, we first

examine several mechanisms by which incentives might generate the differentials that we have

identified: 1) Perhaps differential access to anti-discrimination protection leads minority workers

to alter their non-work in the workplace; 2) Perhaps having more similar workers in the

workplace and in the community alters the extent of non-work; 3) Yet a third possibility is that,

perceiving that discrimination reduces their chances for promotion, minority employees reduce

their effort at work

   Before examining these alternatives we should note that, although we have held constant for

remarkably detailed industry and occupation characteristics, even within those narrow cells

minorities may be assigned to tasks that are inherently more strenuous and require more “down

time.” Clearly, with these data we cannot investigate this explanation. Still another alternative is

that the extra non-work time experienced by minority employees enables them to be more

productive than majority employees during the (lesser) amount of time per hour on the job that



                                                  11
they are actually working (consistent with some older, loosely related indirect evidence--

(Hellerstein et al, 1999).

   Greater protection by more stringent enforcement of equal-employment legislation might

reduce the firing risk perceived by minority workers if caught not working at work. One would

thus expect that interactions of the strength of enforcement of EEO legislation in the labor

market where a worker resides with the indicators X in (1) would yield positive estimates, since

additional EEO charges would suggest that minority workers have more protection should they

engage in more non-work activities on the job. To examine this possibility we collected

information on EEOC filings by state for the available years (2009-12) (EEOC, 2015); for the

earlier years, 2003-08, we impute the average for 2009-12 in the state of the worker’s residence.

In the extension of (1) we include EEOC charges per year per thousand employees in the state

and year as a main effect and in interactions with the vector X. The mean of the EEO measure is

0.75 (s.d.=0.39), and it ranges between 0.01 and 2.08.

   We present the results of including this term and the interactions for men and for women in

the upper two rows of the top and bottom halves of Table 3. Each equation also includes the

nearly 1000 covariates that were included in the estimates shown in the bottom rows of Table 2.

The standard errors are clustered on the EEOC charges variable.

   Other things equal, workers of all races/ethnicities (especially men) do spend greater

fractions of the workday not working in states in which more EEOC charges are filed. Among

men three of the four interaction terms are not, however, significantly different from zero; but

because the interaction is statistically significant among Non-black Hispanics, an F-test of the

joint significance of the vector of four interactions rejects the hypothesis that they are zero. Three

of the four are, however, negative, contrary to our expectations that greater EEO enforcement



                                                 12
would raise incentives for non-work by minority workers. Among women the interactions are

also negative (again with the exception of the Other minority category), but none is statistically

significant individually, and the F-statistic testing the significance of the vector of interactions is

tiny. Taking all these results together, a reasonable conclusion is that the extent of EEOC

enforcement in an area does not appear to alter the on-the-job non-work behavior of minority

compared to majority workers.

    The second possible explanation based on incentives is that the representation of a minority

group in an area might alter workers’ incentives for non-work and employers’ interest in

monitoring workers. If minority workers in an area are more numerous, they may feel protected

from firing or may feel peer pressure to work less on the job (Mathewson, 1931). On the other

hand, employers’ greater willingness to monitor minority workers where they are more visible is

consistent with the taste theory of discrimination (Becker, 1957) and would lead to less non-

work by minorities. To examine these ideas we include the percentages of employees in each

minority group (based on total ACS employment in the state and year) and their interactions with

the worker’s racial/ethnic indicator in expanded versions of the final equations in Table 2. The

means of the four racial/ethnic average fractions of male workers are: African-American, 0.096

(s.d.=0.065); Non-black Hispanic, 0.145 (s.d.=0.121); Asian-American, 0.044 (s.d.=0.040); and

Other groups, 0.021 (0.016).4

    The estimates of the interactions in these expanded equations are shown in the third row in

each of the two panels in Table 3, with the significance of the F-statistic testing the four

interaction terms also shown. Only one of the interaction terms is statistically significantly

nonzero (again, among Non-black Hispanic men); and the interactions as groups are far from

statistically significantly nonzero. Moreover, even across the wide variation in the percentage

representations of minorities in different labor markets there is little impact on the amount of

non-work at work by minorities in the labor market. Perhaps the two opposite effects noted

above offset each other, or perhaps they just do not matter. Regardless, these tests make clear

that on net the importance of a racial/ethnic group in a labor market does not affect its members’

non-work time on the job.

   A third possibility is that minorities spend more time not working on the job since

discriminatory promotion practices lower the returns to effort – especially regarding promotion

and long-term career prospects – and thus the long-term penalties for non-work. If this

explanation were correct, we would expect that self-employed minority workers would not differ

in their non-work on the job from majority self-employed workers. To examine this possibility

we re-estimated the equations at the bottom of the two panels of Table 2 over self-employed

workers, collapsing the indicators of minority status into one because of the relative paucity of

minority self-employed workers in the samples (only 504 minority men, 204 minority women).

   We saw that the aggregate of minority male (female) employees spends 1.10 (0.64) percent

of the work-day more in non-work on the job than does the aggregate of majority male

employees. Among self-employed males (females), minority workers spend 1.2 (1.2) percent of

the work-day more in non-work than do majority self-employed workers. Because of the

relatively small samples of self-employed minority workers, the estimated relative differences

between majority and minority employed and self-employed workers are not statistically non-

zero. The point, estimates, however, suggest that there is no difference in the relative amounts of

non-work, implying that discrimination in promotion opportunities for minority employees is not

generating our results.



                                                14
    Perhaps minority employees exert less effort per hour on the job because their lives are more

stressful and the reduced effort at work compensates for their extra stress. We can examine this

possibility using two data sets. First, in 2003 the PSID included a question asking one respondent

per household, “How often do you feel rushed or pressed for time? Almost always; often;

sometimes; rarely; never.” (See Hamermesh and Lee, 2007). Other things equal, African-

American men are less likely to say that they are almost always or often stressed for time than

are other men, but the difference between them and whites is not quite statistically significant.

African-American women are significantly less likely to feel stressed for time than otherwise

identical women.

    Second, in several years the ATUS asked respondents to indicate how stressed they were

while performing a particular activity at three randomly chosen times of the diary day, with

responses ranging from 0 indicating no stress to 6 indicating the respondent felt very stressed

during that activity. We estimate activity-level ordered probits over this measure. The estimates

suggest that, other things equal, African-Americans are significantly less likely to state that they

were stressed during randomly selected activities. The differences for Non-black Hispanics and

Asian-Americans are small and negative, with t-statistics below one, while that for Others is

positive and nearly significant statistically. These results from the PSID and the ATUS counter

the notion that lesser on-the-job effort by minorities is a response to general feelings of stress.5

    Finally, yet an additional explanation is that these demographic differences arise from

differences in preferences of workers in different racial/ethnic groups. Obviously we cannot test

this notion on the available data. It is, however, consistent with cultural differences in which

These ATUS results and the PSID estimates discussed in the preceding paragraph are presented in Appendix Table
A2.

                                                     15
minorities are generally less stressed than similarity members of the majority group, a cultural

difference that leads them to be more relaxed about effort on the job.

   V.      Conclusions

   We have demonstrated that minorities in the United States—African-Americans, Non-black

Hispanics, Asian-Americans and others—on average spend larger fractions of their time at work

engaged in non-work activities than do majority workers. These differences are robust to the

inclusion of large numbers of demographic variables, measures of work time and even extremely

detailed indicators of industry and occupational attachment. They are, moreover, not tiny—they

are large enough to suggest some modifications of our notions of the magnitudes of racial/ethnic

differences in pay per hour of effort, leading perhaps to reductions of 10 percent in the estimated

earnings/effort disadvantage of African-American and Hispanic men.

   We rejected a large range of explanations for the differences in effort based on incentives at

work facing minorities. Similarly, they are not explained by differences in the amounts and kinds

of activities undertaken outside the workplace. Rather, they are consistent with cultural

differences that lead minorities to be more relaxed about life, including life in the workplace,

than are non-minority workers, and to be more willing to mix non-work with work.

   The ATUS is the only nationally representative data set of which we are aware that provides

information on what large samples of workers are engaged in while at work. This uniqueness is

unfortunate—the questions that might be answered with more such data go well beyond pointing

out demographic differences in effort at work (although these differences are important for such

labor-market outcomes as worker productivity and wage differentials). Expanded information on

time use at work would enable much deeper study of the temporal dynamics of worker
