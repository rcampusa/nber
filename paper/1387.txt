            Determinants of Neonatal Mortality Rates in the U.S.:
                            A Reduced Form Model

                                  ABSTRACT

   The aim of this paper is to contribute to an understanding of the
determinants of differences in   race—specific   neonatal mortality rates among
large   counties of the U.S. in 1977. After estimating cross—sectional

regressions, we apply their coefficients to national trends in the exoge-

nous variables to "explain" the rapid decline in neonatal mortality since

1964. The regressions and the extrapolations point to the Importance of

abortion availability, neonatal intensive care availability, females

schooling levels, and to a lesser extent Medicaid, BCHS projects, and WIC

in trends in black neonatal mortality between 1964 and 1977. They also

underscore the importance of schooling, neonatal intensive care, abortion,

Medicaid, WIC, and to a lesser extent poverty and organized family planning

clinics in trends in white neonatal mortality in those years. A par-

ticularly striking finding is that the increase in abortion availability is

the single most important factor In the reduction in the black neonatal

mortality rate. Not only does the growth In abortion dominate other

program measures, but it also dominates trends in schooling, poverty,

female employment, and physician availability. The actual reduction due

to abortion amounts to 1.2 deaths per thousand live births or 10 percent

of the observed decline.

                              A   REDUCED FORM MODEL


                         Hope Corman and   Michael Grossrnan*




       During the period from 1955 through    1982, the behavior of the U.S.
infant mortality     rate has been characterized by a decade of relative stabi—

lity    followed by almost two decades of rapid decline. The rate declined by

only   0.6 percent   per year compounded annually between 1955 and 1964. By

contrast,    infant mortality declined 4.5 percent per year (compounded

annually) between 1964 and 1982.1

       The trend in the infant mortality rate since 1964 has been dominated by

the trend in the neonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants within the

first 27 days of life) for two reasons. First, the neonatal mortality

rate, 8.9 deaths per thousand live births in 1979, is twice as large as the

postneonatal mortality rate (deaths of infants between the ages of 28 and

364 days per thousand live births), which equaled to 4.2 in 1979. Second,

the neonatal mortality rate has fallen at a faster pace than the post—

neonatal mortality rate since 1964 (4.6 percent per year versus 3.9 percent

per   year). The result of these two factors is that the decline in the
neonatal    mortality rate accounted for 77 percent of the reduction fri the

infant mortality rate during the past two decades. It follows that any

attempt to explain the recent behavior of infant mortality must focus on

neonatal mortality.

      The period beginning in 1964 witnessed the introduction of Medicaid,

maternal and infant care (M and I) projects, community health centers
                                   —2—

(CHCs, formerly called neighborhood health centers), Federally subsidized

family planning services for low—income women, the Special Supplemental

Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC program), the legaliza-

tion of abortion, the widespread adoption of oral and intrauterine contra-

ceptive techniques, and dramatic advances in perinatal2 and neonatal

science. Although other researchers have related these developments to

accelerations in the downward trends in infant and especially neonatal mor-

tality rates (for example, Eisner et al. 1978; Kleinman et al. 1978; Lee et

al. 1980; David and Siegal 1983), there have been few attempts to study

this issue in a multivariate context. Moreover, there has been only one

previous effort to quantify the relative contributions of at least some of

these factors (Grossman and Jacobowitz 1981). Therefore, the aim of this

paper is to contribute to an understanding of the determinants of neonatal

mortality rates in the U.S. with an emphasis on the factors just mentioned.

Estimates of their effects control for such basic correlates of neonatal

mortality as poverty, schooling levels, and the availability of obstetricians!

gynecologists.

    The aim is implemented by conducting cross—sectional regression analy—

ses of differences in race—specific neonatal mortality rates among counties

of the U.S. in 1977. This procedure capitalizes on variations in the

public program at issue and in units that deliver sophisticated perinatal

and neonatal care services among counties at a moment in time. After esti-

mating the regressions, we apply their coefficients to national trends in

the exogenous variables to "explain" the downward trend in neonatal mor-

tality.

                          I. Analytical Framework

    Economic models of the family developed by Becker and Lewis (1973) and

Willis (1973) provide a fruitful theoretical framework to generate multi—

variate health outcome functions and to assess the roles of a variety of

factors in these functions. Ben—Porath and Welch (1976), Williams (1976),

Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981), Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983a,

1983b), and Lewit (1983) have utilized the economic model of the family to

study theoretically and empirically the determinants of birth outcomes.

Following these authors, we assume that the parents' utility function

depends on their own consumption, the number of births, and the survival

probability. Both the number of births and the survival probability are

endogenous variables. In particular, the survival probability production

function depends upon such endogenous inputs as the quantity and quality of

medical care, nutrition, and the own time of the mother. In addition, the

production function is affected by the reproductive efficiency of the

mother and by other aspects of her efficiency in household production.

Given the considerable body of evidence that education raises market and

nonmarket productivity, one would expect more educated mothers to be more

efficient producers of surviving infants.

   Maximization of the parents' utility function subject to production and

resource constraints generates a demand function for survival in which the

survival probability is related to input prices, efficiency, income,

tastes, and the fixed costs of a birth. Fixed costs are costs that are

independent of the survival probability. For example, Willis (1973) shows

that birth control costs are negatively correlated with the fixed costs of

a birth. A reduction in the cost of fertility control raises the fixed
                                   —4—

cost of a birth, reduces the optimal number of births, and raises the opti-

mal survival probability. The interaction between the survival demand and

production functions determines demand functions for medical care and other

endogenous inputs. These derived demand functions depend on the same set

of variables as the demand function for the probability of survival.

    The above model calls attention to the important determinants of the

survival probability and its complement, the neonatal mortality rate.   In


general this set of determinants is similar to that used in multivariate

studies of neonatal mortality with different points of departure (for

example, Fuchs 1974; Williams 1974; Brooks 1978, Gortmaker 1979; Hadley

1982; Harris 1982). Moreover, the model provides a ready structure within

which to interpret the impacts of the factors at issue in our research.3

Thus, for example, Medicaid, M and I projects, and community health centers

lower the direct and indirect costs4 of obtaining medical care, which

should increase the likelihood of a favorable birth outcome and lower

neonatal mortality. Similar comments apply to the impacts of increases in

the availability of physicians who deliver prenatal and perinatal care ser-

vices and to the number of hospitals with perinatal and neonatal intensive

care units, which provide constant and continuous care to critically ill

newborn infants. An expansion in the percentage of eligible pregnant women

served by the WIC program raises the availability of appropriate nutrition,

 an important nonmedical input in the production of healthy infants.

 Subsidization of family planning services and the diffusion and availabi-

 lity of abortion services reduce the costs of fertility control. Within

 the context of an economic model of the family, these developments raise

 the "optimal" survival probability and lower the "optimal" number of
                                          —5—

births. In addition, they will lower the observed infant mortality rate if

less healthy fetuses are less likely to be conceived or more likely to be

aborted.

   The preceding ideas are formalized in the following six equation model:

                   1 — d =           b)                                 (1)

                             f3(p,   z, y)                              (3)

                       m =                                              (4)

                       a =                                              (5)

                             f6(p,

Equations (1) and (2) are production functions, while equations (3)—(6) are

input demand functions. In equation (1) the probability that an infant

survives the first month of life (1—d, where d is the probability of death)

is shown as a function of a vector of perinatal and neonatal care inputs

(n) and birth weight (b).5 Note that there is an overwhelming amount of

evidence that low birth weight (less than or equal to 2,500 grams or 5.5

pounds) is the most important and most proximate endogenous risk factor in

neonatal health outcomes (for example, Harris 1982; Lewit 1983). In

equation (2) birth weight is a function of a vector of prenatal medical and

nonmedical inputs (rn),6 the use of abortion services (a), the use of

contraceptive services (c), and exogenous risk and productive efficiency

factors such as mother's education (z). In equations (3)—(6), the inputs

are related to a vector of price and availability measures (p), socioecono-

mic characteristics which reflect command over resources and tastes (y),

and productive efficiency and risk factors (z).

These are reduced form equations because only exogenous variables appear on

their right—hand sides. They may be termed demand functions for survival

and birth weight. Together with the input demand functions, they consti-

tute the reduced form of the model.7 Although equations (1)—(8) have

meaningful interpretations at the family level, our empirical analysis

focuses on county—level data for the year 1977. Therefore, from now on we

interpret d as the observed neonatal mortality rate and b as the percentage

of low—birth weight births.

    We focus on the estimation of the reduced form neonatal mortality rate

equation (7) because its coefficients are well suited for understanding the

impacts of changes in policy variables and for extrapolating cross—

sectional regression results to national trends in exogenous variables to

"explain' the decline in neonatal mortality.8 Since the reduced form mor-

tality function contains only exogenous variables, it can be fitted by

ordinary least squares.9

     Our model calls attention to the difference between the availability

 and the use of services such as family planning, abortion, prenatal care,

 perinatal care, and neonatal care, all of which determine birth outcomes.

 An increase in the availability of an input lowers its price and causes the

 quantity demanded of that input to rise but has an ambiguous effect on the
                                   —7—

demand for some other input. For example, an increase in the availability

of abortion services may reduce the use of family planning services if

these methods of fertility control are substitutes. Thus, an increase in

the availability of one service can affect neonatal mortality both directly

and indirectly, through its effect on the use of other services. By

focusing on availability rather than use, we can capture both direct and

indirect effects of changes in the availability of medical services on

neonatal mortality.


                       II. Empirical Specification

A. Data and Measurement of Neonatal Mortality

    The basic data set used here is the Area Resource File (ARF), a county—

based data service, prepared by Applied Management Sciences, Inc., for the

Bureau of Health Professions, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

It incorporates information from different sources for the 3,077 counties

of the United States. Neonatal deaths by race for the years 1969 through

1978 are obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)

Mortality Tape. Births by race for those years are obtained from the NCHS

Natality Tape. Health Manpower comes from the American Medical

Association. Socioeconomic characteristics are taken from the Census of

Population. We have added measures pertaining to the policies and programs

discussed previously from sources indicated in the Appendix to this paper

(available upon request).

    For reasons mentioned in the introductory section, the empirical analy-

sts focuses on the neonatal mortality rate as opposed to the postneonatal

mortality rate or the total infant death rate. Also, this strategy is
                                   —8—

adopted because most neonatal deaths are caused by congenital anomalies,

prematurity, and complications of delivery. These conditions are more sen-

sitive to improved prenatal, perinatal, and neonatal care than are the

infectious diseases and accidents that contribute to postneonatal mor-

tality. Neonatal mortality may be particularly sensitive to abortion and

organized family planning access, since women at risk of conditions causing

neontal mortality can be identified during pregnancy and encouraged to use

appropriate birth control methods in the future.

    Separate regressions are fitted for white neonatal mortality and for

black neonatal mortality. Black neonatal mortality rates are rruch higher

than white rates. For example, in 1977 the black rate was almost twice as

large as the white rate. In a non—race—specific regression, one would

enter the percentage of black births to control for race differences. But

this variable would be highly correlated with the percentage of low—income

women, schooling, and other independent variables. By fitting race—

specific regressions, multicollinearity is reduced and the coefficients of

the independent variables are allowed to vary between races. Linear

regressions are estimated for reasons indicated in section 11.8.

    Counties are our units of observation rather than Standard Metropolitan

Statistical Areas (SMSAs) because counties are more homogeneous with

respect to key variables such as income, schooling, medical resources, and

others. Some counties are so small, however, that people may receive medi—

cal care outside the county.   Also, small counties, with few births,

experience large fluctuations in birth rates simply due to random move—

nients. The problems with county data are reduced by including only coun—

ties with a population of at least 50,000 persons in 1970. A county must
                                   —9—

also have at least 5,000 blacks for inclusion in the black regressions.

There are 677 counties in the white regressions and 357 counties in the

black regressions.'0 The counties used in the white regressions accounted

for approximately 80 percent of the white population of the U.S. in 1970,

and the counties used in the black regressions accounted for a similiar

percentage of the black population of the U.S. in that year. In addition

to selecting large counties, we attenuate random elements by employing a

three—year average of the race—specific neonatal mortality rate for the

period 1976—1978 as the dependent variable and by estimating weighted

regressions, where the set of weights is the square root of the race—

specific total number of births in the period 1976—1978.

    Neonatal mortality for a three—year period centered on 1977 is studied

to address the question: Do the effects that Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981)

observed in 1971, particularly the large negative abortion effect, differ

when data for 1977 are examined? Our approach also differs from theirs

because we focus on a reduced form neonatal mortality rate equation, and we

include many more determinants of neonatal mortality. For example, we are

now able to measure the contribution of the rapid advances in perinatal and

neonatal science since 1965.11 These developments were accompanied by an

approximately fourteen—fold increase in the number of hospitals with neona-

tal (defined to include perinatal) intensive care units between 1964 and

1977 (Sheridan 1983). Note that although the state—of—the—art in neonato—

logy is fixed in the cross section, the availability of these state—of—the—

art services varies considerably from one geographic area to another due to

regional differences in hospital construction subsidies (by states and the

Federal government), Medicaid reimbursement, Federal funding of neonatal
                                    — 10 —



intensive   care centers (under Title V of the Social Security Act), state

certificate—of—need laws and regionalization of neonatal intensive care

programs.

    In fact, all variables in the cross section vary considerably even

though technology and the legal environment are fixed. Our abortion

variable, for example, had a coefficient of variation of 77 percent, even

though abortion had been legalized in all states by 1973.


B. Measurement of Independent Variables

    Wherever possible, race—specific variables are employed in the regres-

sions. Such variables are denoted with an asterisk. Except for the

Medicaid, WIC, and neonatal intensive care measures, all variables are

county—specific. Table 1 contains definitions and acronyms of the depen-

dent and independent variables in the regressions, and Table 2 contains

their means and standard deviations. Most of the independent variables

pertain to one or more years in the 1975—1978 period. Several measures

pertain to 1970, 1979, 1980, or 1981.     In these cases the assumption is

made that the 1975—1978 measure is highly correlated with the one actually

used. A detailed description of the variables and their sources appears in

the Appendix (available upon request), which also contains a discussion of

preliminary regression results obtained with several additional independent

variables that are not shown in Section III.

    The percentage of women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than 200

percent of the poverty level in 1980 (POV*) is a negative correlate of com-

mand over resources and is expected to have a positive regression coef-

ficient. As explained in Section I, the percentage of women aged 15 to 49

who had at least a high school education in 1970 (HSP*) is a proxy for

reproductive efficiency and other aspects of efficiency in household pro-

duction. The schooling variable also may serve as a proxy for the parents'

preferences for healthy offspring. Whether schooling represents effi-

ciency, tastes, or both, the neonatal mortality rate should be negatively

related to it.'2 Employed women have a higher opportunity cost of time

than other women, but they also may have higher income. Therefore, the net

effect of an increase in the percentage of women aged 15 to 49 who were

employed in 1970 (EMP*) on the neonatal mortality rate is indeterminant.'3

The number of non—federal obstetricians/gynecologists in patient care in

1975 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 in 1975 (OBG) and the percentage of

such physicians who are board certified (POBG) are general indexes of the

availability of medical care to pregnant women and of the availability of

high—quality care.

    The key public program measures at issue in this paper pertain to

Medicaid, organized family planning clinics, maternal and infant care pro-

jects, community health centers, WIC, abortion availability, and neonatal

care availability. All of the measures are expected to have negative

regression coefficients. The eligibility of low—income women who are

pregnant for the first time for Medicaid coverage of their prenatal care

services is reflected by three dichotomous variables (MPN, MPU, and MPA).

MPN equals one for counties in states that covered first—time pregnancies

only if no husband was present in the period 1976—1978. MPU equals one for

counties in states that provided coverage if no husband was present or if

the husband was present but unemployed and not receiving unemployment

insurance. MPA equals one for counties in states that provided coverage to
                                     — 15 —



all   financially eligible women, regardless of the presence or employment

status of the husband. The omitted category pertains to counties in states

that covered no first—time pregnancies because their aid to families with

dependent children (AFDC) programs did not recognize "unborn children."

The likelihood that the newborn care received by the infant of a low—income

woman will be financed by Medicaid is indicated by a dichotomous variable

(MNEW) that equals one if a county is in a state in which Medicaid paid for

newborn care under the mother's Medicaid number or did not pay for care

under the mother's number but allowed pregnant women to register their

unborn children with Medicaid in 1981.

      There are no data on differences in the availability of Medicaid

coverage of prenatal care for second— and higher—order births or on dif-

ferences in the general availability of physicians to Medicaid—eligible

women among states or counties. Therefore, the state—specific average

annual Medicaid payment per adult recipient in AFDC families in fiscal 1976

(MBEN) is included as a regressor. Although this variable partly reflects

the use of care, it also reflects price and availability. This is because

physicians in states with relatively low reimbursement schedules under

Medicaid are less likely to treat Medicaid patients (Sloan, Mitchell, and

Cromwell 1978).

      Organized family planning availability is given by the number of orga-

nized family planning clinics in 1975 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 with

family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level in 1975 (FPCLINP).

The denominator pertains to poor women because the clinics primarily ser-

vice poor women and because the relevant public program is aimed at the

poor.
                                    — 16 —



    Dryfoos (1976) reports that almost all clients of family planning cli-
nics use oral or intrauterine contraceptive techniques (the pill or the

IUD). Consequently, the family planning variable indicates the price and

availability of these techniques to low—income women. There are no direct

measures of the availability of family planning services delivered by pri-

vate physicians to poor or nonpoor women. Therefore, the obstetrician!

gynecologist variable reflects the availability of private family planning

services as well as prenatal and perinatal care services. There is no

information concerning differences in contraceptive knowledge among coun-

ties.   It is likely, however, that more educated women will have better

birth control information. Thus, the schooling variable may partly reflect

this factor.

    The extent of the maternal and infant care program and the community

health center program is given by the sum of M and I projects and CHCs in

1976 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than 200 per-

cent of the poverty level in 1975 (BCHSP). The number of poor women serves

as the denominator of this variable for the same reason that it serves as

the denominator of the family planning measure. M and I projects and CI-ICs

are aggregated in the numerator because both provide prenatal care services

to low—income women.14 The acronym of this variable pertains to the Bureau

of Community Health Services (BCHS, renamed the Bureau of Health Care

Delivery and Assistance in 1982), which is the agency within the U.S.

Department of Health and Human Services that has overall administrative

responsibility for both M and I projects and CI-ICs. The variable is

referred to as BCHS project availability from now on.

    The count of CHCs is limited to centers that were delivering services
                                   — 17 —



as of 1976 because the number of CHCs expanded rapidly between 1976 and

1978. Given Goldman and Grossman's (1982) evidence the CHCs affect infant

mortality with a lag, the potential impacts of the new centers are not

likely to be observed in our data. Note that the number of M and I pro-

jects was very stable between 1971 and 1978 (Grossman and Jacobowitz 1981).

    The availability of nutritional supplements to low—income women under

the WIC program is given by the state—specific percentage of eligible

pregnant women served by WIC in 1980 (WIC). Abortion availability is

measured as a three—year average of the number of abortion providers cen-

tered on 1976 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 in 1975 (ABPROV). Provider

data for the years 1975, 1976, and 1977 are utilized because Grossman and

Jacobowitz's (1981) estimates suggest that abortions performed in the first

half of a given year affect the neonatality mortality rate during the

second half of the year. Providers include public hospitals, private

hospitals, nonhospital clinics, and office—based physicians. A provider

must have performed at least one abortion in a given year to be included in

the count in that year.

    For part of our sample period (August 1977 through December 1978),

Federal funding of abortions under Medicaid was banned by the Hyde

Amendment except in cases where the woman's life was in danger. During

that period, 28 states refused to pay for "medically necessary" abortions.

The other 22 states continued to finance most abortions for Medicaid—

eligible women. We do not take account of this curtailment in the availa-

bility of abortion to low—income women in our regression analysis because

it could have impacted the neonatal mortality rate in 1978 alone. More

importantly, Cates (1981) reports that an estimated 94 percent of pregnant
                                   — 18 —


low—income women "at risk" obtained a legal abortion between August 1977

and February 1980, 65 percent with state funds and 29 percent with other

sources of funding.'5 This suggests that abortion use by low—income women

Is very unresponsive to the money price of an abortion.   It does not imply

that abortion use is insensitive to such indirect costs as the time and

money spent traveling to an abortion facility, the time spent waiting at

the facility, and the time spent in obtaining information about alternative

facilities. These indirect costs are likely to be very sensitive to the

abortion availability measure used in the regression.

    Neonatal intensive care availability is measured by the sum of the

state—specific number of hospitals with Level II, Level III, or Levels II

and III neonatal intensive care units in 1979 per thousand women aged 15 to

44 1n the state In 1975 (NEOH). Hospitals that provide neonatal intensive

care are generally divided into three levels based on the Intens ity of care

each is equipped to deliver. Level I hospitals provide minimal or normal

newborn care; Level II hospitals provide Intermediate care; and Level III

hospitals provide the most intensive care (Budetti et al. 1981). Specific

definitions of these three levels of neonatal care are contained in the

recommendations of the Committee on Perinatal Health (1977), which were

developed as guidelines for the regional development of perinatal health

services.

    In the estimation of the availability of neonatal intensive care, the

state is used as the relevant market area rather than the county. This is

because many states have developed formal or informal regional referral

networks for ill neonates. Under regionalization, it is possible for a

newborn to be transferred out of his county of birth, suggesting that the
                                  — 19 —


market area for this care is larger than the county. This is in contrast

to organized family planning, BCHS project, and abortion availability where

regional networks do not exist. Moreover, the decision to obtain neonatal

intensive care Is made jointly by the physician and the mother, whereas the

mother or the potential mother plays a much more important role in the

decision to obtain the other services at issue. To the extent that the

appropriate market area is larger than the country but smaller than the

state, the neonatal intensive care variable contains measurement error. If

the error is not correlated with the true value of the variable, the esti-

mate of the availability effect is biased toward zero.

    Level I hospitals are excluded from the count of neocare hospitals

since they do not provide the specialized state—of—the—art services in

neonatology, referred to earlier. The count does not distinguish between

Level II and Level III hospitals because of definitional problems in the

available data.

    The final variable in the regressions is a three—year average of race—

specific neonatal mortality rate centered on 1970 (NMR7O*). This variable

is included to control for potential reverse causality relationships that

may bias the coefficients of the program measures. For example, public

programs such as BCHS projects and organized family planning clinics were

targeted at regions with poor health indicators. For these programs, the

availability of the program is positively related to the pre—program neona-

tal mortality rate. If the current and lagged mortality rates are positi-

vely related, then estimates of the impacts of these programs will be

biased toward zero unless the initial level of mortality is included in the

regression. For other public programs, availability is negatively related
                                      — 20 —


 to   the pre—prograni neonatal mortality rate, causing the program coefficient

 to be overstated unless the lagged rate is included. For example, States

 that reformed their abortion laws by 1970 and enacted generous Medicaid

programs tended to be liberal states with relatively large welfare programs

and probably lower than average infant mortality rates. Thus, the depen-

dence of program levels on the lagged mortality rate will cause a downward

bias in the absolute value of a given program coefficient when the sign of

the reverse causality relationship is positive and an upward bias in the

absolute value of the coefficient when the sign of the reverse causality

relationship is negative.

      Ideally, we would like to include the lagged mortality rate for the

period just prior to program inception. Since the current analysis inclu-

des so many programs, all beginning in different periods, this is clearly

impossible. For programs established earlier, the 1970 lagged mortality

rate does not allow for the full program effect to be captured in the

measured coefficient since the program will have already reduced mortality

by 1970. That is, given serial correlation in both neonatal mortality

rates and in program measures, this problem will tend to bias toward zero

the coefficients of these program measures and possibly of other program

measures'6 when the 1970 lagged mortality rate is included. We call this

the serial correlation bias. Due to the existence of both reverse causa-

lity bias and serial correlation bias, regressions are presented with and

without the lagged neonatal mortality rate in Section iii.7

      A number of programs that we study are aimed at the poor.   It follows

that the impacts on neonatal mortality of such programs are larger the

larger is the fraction of poor women. To be specific, let d. be the
                                                              — 21 —

In these equations x. is a public program availability measure that

affects the mortality rate of poor babies alone and y. is the fraction of

poor women in childbearing ages. Equation (11) contains the assumption

that the mortality rate of nonpoor babies does not vary among counties, but

this can be modified with little loss in generality. In equation (12) a

program measure such as family planning availability is allowed to affect

the function of births to poor women. Presumably, a1 and 2 are

and this effect rises in absolute value as y. rises:



      (32d./ax.ay.) =                                                      (15)

      Equation (13) gives a multiple regression of d. on y., x.,

         and x.. With more than one public program measure, the

regression has an extremely complicated functional form. Specifically, it

includes the fraction of poor women, the level of each program measure, the

square of that measure, its product with each of the other measures, and

its product with the fraction of poor women. Such an equation is not trac-

table from the standpoint of estimation due to the large set of regressors

and severe problems of multicollinearity. Therefore, two truncated versions

of equation (13) are fitted in Section Ill. The first includes y. and

x     and is referred to as Model 1. The second includes y. and x .y. and is
 p3                                                              3   p33
referred to as Model 2.19 In the estimation of Model 2, the Medicaid,

family planning, BCFIS project, and WIC variables are interacted with the

race—specific fraction of women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than

200 percent of the poverty level in 1980 (.01 P0V*). The other variables

are not interacted with the fraction of poor women because they reflect

determinants of neonatal mortality that are relevant to the nonpoor as well

as to the poor. The means and standard deviations of the eight interaction

variables (FPCLINPXPOV*, ECHSPXPOV*, WICXP0V*, MPAXPOV*, MPUXPOV*, MPNXPOV*,

MNEWXPOV*, and MBENXPOV*) are shown in the bottom part of Table 2. Linear

regressions   are estimated because a linear specification facilitates the

aggregation of the two income—specific mortality functions [equations (1!)

and (12)1 into a single equation for the entire population.



                           III. Empirical Results

    Ordinary least squares regressions of white neonatal mortality rates in

Model 1 (the non—interactive model) are contained in Panel A of Table 3,

and ordinary least regressions of black neonatal mortality rates in Model 1

are contained in Panel B of Table 3. The first regression in each panel

(3—Al or 3—B!) excludes the lagged neonatal mortality rate, while the

second regression (3—A2 or 3—82) includes it. The corresponding Model 2

regressions (the interactive regressions) are shown in Panels A and B of

Table 4.

    Based on the unadjusted coefficients of multiple determination (R2s),

there is no clearcut evidence that one model is superior to the other. For

both races, Model 2 outperforms Model 1 when the lagged neonatal mortality

rate is a regressor. For whites, the reverse holds when the lagged neona-

tal mortality rate is omitted, while for blacks, the R2s are identical in

that specification. In all cases the differences between the R2s are

small. Given the high degree of multicollinearity among regressors, these

results are not surprising. Since Model 2 performs at least as well as

Model 1 three times out of four and conceptually is somewhat more

appropriate, the results in Table 4 are emphasized in the discussion of the

signs and statistical significance of the coefficients below. Both models

are, however, employed in the extrapolations. In general statements made

with   regard to signs and significance levels in the context of Model 2 also

are valid in the context of Model 1. In light of the amount of multicolli—

nearity just mentioned, this finding strengthens confidence in the reliabi-

lity of the estimated effects.

   The basic determinants of neonatal mortality in the regressions are

female schooling, female poverty levels, the percentage of women employed,

and the availability of obstetricians/gynecologists. For whites, the

schooling and poverty regression coefficients have the 'correct signs" and

are statistically significant. For blacks, the poverty effect is prac-

tically zero, but the schooling effect is negative and is significant when

the lagged neonatal mortality rate is excluded.20 For both races, the per-

centage of women employed is not a statistically significant contributor to

birth outcomes. The most anomalous finding in Table 4 or Table 3 is that

the coefficient of the obstetrician/gynecologist availability measure (OBG)

always is positive, statistically significant, and has a very large t—

ratio. The sensitivity of the other parameter estimates to the omission of

OBG and the related variable that gives the percentage of board—certified

obstetricians/gynecologists (POBG)2' is considered in regressions (3—A3),

(3—A4), (3—B3), (3—B4), (4—A3), (4—A4), (4—B3), and (4—B4). On the whole

the results are not sensitive to this exclusion.     While we have no expla-

nation of the perverse sign of the obstetrician/gynecologist

coefficient,22 we are convinced that the remaining coefficients are

meaningful estimates rather than statistical artifacts.

       The six factors or public programs that have been stressed as potential

contributors to the acceleration in the downward trend in neonatal mor-

tality since 1964 are neonatal intensive care availability, abortion
                                   —27—

availability, organized family planning availability, BCHS project availa-

bility, WIC availability, and Medicaid. The regressions contain one

variable pertaining to each of the five availability programs and five

variables pertaining to the Medicaid financing program. Based on

regressions (4—Al) and (4—A2), fourteen of the twenty program coefficients

have the anticipated negative signs in the white regressions, including

eight of the ten availability coefficients and six of the ten Medicaid

coefficients. Based on regressions (4—Bi) and (4—B2), fifteen of the

twenty program coefficients have the anticipated negative signs in the

black regressions, including nine of the ten availability coefficients and

six of the ten Medicaid coefficients. BCHS project availability has the

"wrong sign" in the two white regressions, and WIC availability has the

wrong sign in the black regression that controls for the lagged neonatal

mortality rate. Two of the three variables pertaining to Medicaid

financing of first—time pregnancies (MPUXPOV* and MPNXPOV*) have positive

coefficients for whites and for blacks when the lagged rate is held

constant. Moreover, Medicaid payments per adult recipient in AFDC families

(MBENXPOV*) are positively related to neonatal mortality rates in the two

black equations. Given the high degree of intercorrelation among the

variables in the regression and the imprecise measures used, the prepon-

derance of negative effects is an important and impressive finding.

   In terms of statistical significance, the hypothesis that no member of

the set of program measures has a non—zero effect on neonatal mortality

always is rejected at the 1 percent level. With respect to the five speci-

fic availability variables, for whites neonatal intensive care, abortion,

family planning, and WIC are significant at the 5 percent level in the
                                    — 28 —


interactive   specification that omits the lagged neonatal mortality rate

(4—Al).23 In the black regression that omits the lagged neonatal mortality

rate (4—Bl), abortion and BCHS project availability are significant at the

5 percent level, and neonatal intensive care is significant at the 6 per-

cent level. Note that neonatal intensive care is significant at the 5 per-

cent level in the corresponding non—interactive specification (3—Bi).

    Many fewer of the five Medicaid financing variables are significant

than the five availability variables. In particular, for both races there

are no significant Medicaid effects either taken together or taken separa-

tely at conventional levels when the lagged neonatal mortality rate is a

regressor. When the lagged rate is omitted from the white regressions, the

set of Medicaid variables is significant at the 5 percent level for whites

but not for blacks. These results do not necessarily imply that Medicaid

is a less important determinant of birth outcomes than the other programs.

Rather, the results simply may reflect the imprecise Medicaid indexes and

the relatively large number of correlated regressors that must be used to

represent this program.

    It is notable that all the program coefficients except for the white

and black abortion coefficients fall in absolute value when the lagged

neonatal mortality rate is held constant. Since organized family planning

clinics and BCHS projects are aimed at the poor counties, presumably with

high mortality rates, one can conclude that serial correlation in neonatal

mortality and in the program measures dominates reverse causality from low

initial health levels to the availability of medical and family planning

services for low—income persons in specific areas. Medicaid and WIC also

are aimed at the poor, but some caution must be exercised in viewing their
                                    — 29 —


coefficients   in regressions (4—Al) or (4—Bi) as unbiased estimates because

liberal states with relatively favorable initial health levels may have

enacted generous programs. In that case the coefficients from regressions

that do not control for the lagged rate are upper bound estimates and those

from regressions that do control for the lagged rate are lower bound esti-

mates (because of the serial correlation phenomenon). With respect to

neonatal intensive care availability, the coefficients obtained with the

lagged rate omitted are upper bound estimates if areas with low initial

levels of neonatal mortality encouraged the development of neonatal inten-

sive care units through the political process and lower bound estimates if

these units were placed in areas with high initial levels of neonatal mor-

tality. The calculated abortion parameters are insensitive to the treat-

ment of the lagged neonatal mortality rate.

    It also is notable that the black abortion and neonatal intensive care

effects are two to four times larger than the corresponding white effects

depending on specification. These results are important because abortion

reform and advances in neonatology ——   unlike   WIC, Medicaid, BCRS projects

and organized family planning clinics ——     clearly   were not targeted at the

poor. Yet the former two developments appear to have had their largest

impact on blacks, the group in the population with the lowest income and

the largest neonatal mortality rate.

    At several points in the discussion of the results, we have referred to

problems that arise due to high correlations among regressors. To examine

the sensitivity of the findings to multicollinearity, the first two

regressions in Panel A and B of Tables 3 and 4 were reestimated after

deleting all variables whose coefficients have the "wrong signs" or whose
                                     — 30 —


coefficients   have the "right signs" but t—ratios less than one in absolute

value.24 The resulting Model 1 (non—Interactive) regressions are presented

in Table 5, and the Model 2 (interactive) regressions are presented in

Table 6. Since regressors were deleted on a race—specific basis, the inde-

pendent variables in the black equations are not the same as in the white

equations.

    In many instances the magnitudes of the coefficients in Tables 5 and 6

differ from the magnitudes of the corresponding coefficients in Tables 3

and 4. This result is not surprising. What is somewhat surprising is that

the signs and statistical significance of the various variables are very

similar in the limited and full models. This finding strengthens the con-

fidence in the conclusions reached earlier while underscoring that point

estimates must be regarded with some caution. Note, however, that the

black abortion effect still exceeds the white effect by a factor in excess

of 4. Moreover, the black neonatal care effect exceeds the white effect by

a factor that ranges between 1.4 and 2. Note also that Tables 5 and 6

suggest that Medicaid financing of newborn care is important in black birth

outcomes, while Medicaid financing of prenatal care for first—time pregnan-

cies is important in white birth outcomes. This is a tentative finding

because it emerges only when the set of Medicaid regressors is truncated.

But it is consistent with results that indicate that white neonatal mor-

tality rates are more sensitive to the receipt of early prenatal care than

black rates (Corman and Grossman in progress).

   To examine the relative contributions of schooling, poverty, female

employment, the availability of obstetricians/gynecologists, and the

program measures to the recent U.S. neonatal mortality experience, we apply

1977.25 The extrapolations start In 1964 because that year marked the

beginning of the acceleration in the downward trend in neonatal mortality.

Extrapolations end in 1977 because the regressions pertain to that year.

The results of estimating the implied changes in white and black neonatal

mortality rates due to selected factors are shown in Tables 7 and 8,

respectively.

    In the period at issue the white neonatal mortality rate declined by

7.5 deaths per thousand live births, from 16.2 to 8.7. The black neonatal

mortality rate declined by 11.5 deaths per thousand live births, from 27.6

to 16.1. The statistical analysis "explains" approximately 29 percent of

the white decline on average, with a range between 21 percent and 40 per-

cent (see the last row of Table 7). The statistical analysis explains 32

percent of the black decline on average, with a range between 16 percent

and 45 percent (see the last row in Table 8).

    For blacks, the increase in abortion availability is the single most

important factor in the reduction in the neonatal mortality rate. Not only

does the growth in abortion dominate the other program measures, but it

also dominates trends in schooling, poverty, female employment, and physi-

cian availability. The actual reduction due to abortion amounts to 1.2

deaths per thousand live births on average (see the next to the last column

in Table 8) or 10 percent of the observed decline. Moreover, the estimated

contribution   of abortion is almost twice as great as the next largest fac-

tor and is very stable across the eight alternative regression specifica-

tions. Its coefficient of variation of roughly 15 percent is smaller than

those of the other nine factors (see the last column of Table 8).

    The rise in neonatal intensive care availability is the second—most

important factor in the decrease in black neonatal mortality, and the rise

in female schooling is the third—most important factor. Both effects

amount to declines of .7 deaths per thousand live births, but the coef-

ficient of variation of the neonatal intensive care contribution (22

percent) is much smaller than that of schooling (73 percent). The Medicaid

contribution (.5 deaths per thousand live births) ranks fourth on average

but has a very large coefficient of variation (91 percent). The BCHS pro-

ject effect, which equals a decline of .3 deaths per thousand live births,

is smaller than the Medicaid effect but much more stable across alternative

specifications (coefficient of variation = 28 percent). The reduction in

black neonatal mortality due to WIC also equals .3 deaths per thousand live

births, but the coefficient of variation is nearly 200 percent. The

contributions of the remaining four factors are all less than .1 deaths per

thousand live births in absolute value.26

    The results of the white extrapolations are less dramatic than those of

the blacks and less clearcut. The increase in white female schooling makes

the largest contribution to the decline in white neonatal mortality (.5

deaths per thousand live births). The schooling factor is followed in

importance by WIC, Medicaid, and neonatal intensive care availability (.4

deaths per thousand live births each). The rise in abortion availability

ranks as the fifth—leading contributor (.3 deaths per thousand live
                                     — 37 —



births);   the reduction in poverty ranks sixth (.2 deaths per thousand live

births); and the expansion in organized family planning availability ranks

seventh (.1 deaths per thousand live births). Note that the range of black

effects is much larger than the range of white effects both in absolute and

in relative terms. For blacks, the ratio of the largest effect to the

sixth largest effect equals 4, while for whites it equals 2.5. Note also

that the correlation between the black and white contributions is positive

but not substantial. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is .53, and

the product—moment correlation coefficient also is .53. Note finally that

the abortion and neonatal intensive care contributions may loom larger in

white birth outcomes than the rankings suggest. This is because the esti-

mated effects of these two factors are very stable across alternative spe-

cifications. Their coefficients of variation (26 percent for neonatal

intensive care and 31 percent for abortion) are smaller than those per-

taining to schooling, WIC, and Medicaid.

    To summarize, the extrapolations point to the importance of abortion

availability, neonatal intensive care availability, females schooling

levels, and to a lesser extent Medicaid, BCHS projects, and WIC in trends

in black neonatal mortality between 1964 and 1977. They also underscore

the importance of schooling, neonatal intensive care, abortion, Medicaid,

WIC, and to a lesser extent poverty and organized family planning clinics

in trends in white neonatal mortality in those years.

    To the extent that very ill neonates die in the postneonatal period,

one can argue that the above findings overstate the importance of neonatal

intensive care availability in race—specific birth outcomes. Yet the post—

neonatal mortality rate has fallen every year since 1964 for both races,
                                   — 38 —



suggesting that this argument is not relevant. At the same time, the
results do not imply that the construction and subsidization of additional

neonatal intensive care units has a more favorable benefit—cost ratio than

an expansion in BCHS projects for blacks if, for example, these were com-

peting programs. Although the neonatal intensive care effect exceeds the

BCHS project effect by .4 deaths per thousand live births, the costs of M

and I projects and CHCs probably are smaller than the costs of constructing

and maintaining sophisticated neonatal intensive care units. A similar

comment applies to the .3 deaths per thousand live births differential bet-

ween the white neonatal intensive care and organized family planning

effects. Indeed, the cost of providing appropriate birth control infor-

mation to poor women undoubtedly is less than the cost of providing them

with prenatal and neonatal care services.

    Our results can be compared to those contained in the study by Grossman

and Jacobowitz (1981). Our estimates confirm Grossman and Jacobowitz's

conclusion with respect to the key role of abortion in black birth out-

comes. Our schooling effects are somewhat larger than theirs, which

implies that this variable may operate by influencing the mix of inputs

selected by families to produce healthy infants. Finally, we provide evi-

dence of the roles of neonatal intensive care units, WIG, and CHCs in birth

outcomes, which is not contained in their study.

    Our results are relevant to the actual and potential impacts on neona-

tal mortality of a number of dramatic policy reversals by the Reagan

Administration since the beginning of 1981. We refer to budget cutbacks

which curtailed the rates of growth in such programs as WIG, Medicaid, M

and I projects, CFICs, and subsidized family planning services. When infla—
                                       — 39 —


tion   is taken into account, the absolute size of some of these programs

declined in real terms. In spite of these cutbacks, the infant mortality

rate declined from 12.6 deaths per thousand live births in 1980 to 11.2

deaths per thousand live births in 1982, and the neonatal mortality rate

fell from 8.5 deaths per thousand live births In 1980 to 7.6 deaths per
                                 27
thousand live births in 1982.

    Why did the infant mortality rate continue to fall after 1980? Our

results suggest that the detrimental effects of reduced spending levels for

social programs may have been more than offset by the continued growth in
                         28
abortion availability,        neonatal intensive care availability, and female

schooling levels. Of course, the cutbacks may have lagged impacts on

neonatal mortality. In any event our findings imply that the program

reductions may have retarded the rate of decline in the neonatal mortality

rate of the poor since 1980.

    Our results also are relevant to the current U.S. policy debate with

respect to attempts by the Right to Life movement and its supporters in

Congress to outlaw abortion except when it is necessary to preserve a

pregnant woman's life. During the past few years, the anti—abortion move-

ment has tried to achieve this goal either by means of a constitutional

amendment or an act of Congress. Our estimates indicate that, if these

efforts are successful, neonatal mortality, especially among blacks, may

fall slower than otherwise and may even rise.

    2The perinatal period is the period around the time of birth, generally

defined as from 20 weeks of gestation up to 7 days of life.

    3Brief descriptive and historical information concerning these factors

is as follows. Medicaid, enacted in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social

Security Act of 1935, is the joint Federal—state program to finance the
                                   F —2

medical care services of low—income families who are covered by the aid to

families with dependent children (AFDC) program. Maternal and infant care

projects originated in the 1963 amendment to Title V of the Social Security

Act. The amendment provides special Federal grants for projects designed

to provide adequate prenatal and obstetrical care to reduce the incidence

of mental retardation and other conditions caused by childbearing complica-

tions as well as to lower infant and maternal mortality. The program to

create and fund community health centers was started by the Office of

Economic Opportunity as part of the War on Poverty in 1965. By 1973

overall control of the centers had been shifted to the Bureau of Health

Care Delivery and Assistance (formerly called the Bureau of Community Health

Services), DHHS. CHCs deliver comprehensive ambulatory care, both primary

and preventive, to poverty populations in medically underserved areas. The

Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC

program) was authorized by a 1972 amendment to the Child Nutrition Act of

1966. Under the program the Federal government gives cash grants to state

health departments and local health clinics to provide special nutritious

food supplements to low—income pregnant and lactating women, infants, and

children up to four years of age who are nutritional risks. Federal sub-

sidization of family planning services for low—income women originated in

the 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act. Federal efforts in this

area were expanded by the Family Planning Services and Population Research

Act of 1970 and by the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act. These

subsidies go to family planning clinics organized by hospitals, state and

local health departments, Planned Parenthood, and other agencies. Prior to

1967 all states of the United States had laws which permitted abortion only
                                   F—3

when it was necessary to preserve a pregnant woman's life. By the middle

of 1970, sixteen states had reformed their laws to increase the number of

circumstances under which abortions could be performed. In 1973 the

Supreme Court ruled most restrictive state laws unconstitutional.

Information on neonatal intensive care units is provided below.

         indirect costs of obtaining a good are generated by the time spent

traveling, waiting, and obtaining information about the good. We use the

terms cost and availability as synonyms. In particular, with other factors

held constant, an increase in availability is associated with reductions in

direct and indirect costs.

    5The variable b can be interpreted as the probability of a low—birth weight

birth.

    6Some of the nonmedical inputs, such as maternal cigarette smoking and alco-

hol use, have negative marginal products in the birth weight production func-

tion.

    7The input demand functions are reduced form equations because they are

obtained by maximizing a utility function subject to production and resource

constraints. Note that the above specification contains the restriction that

prenatal care and the exogenous risk factors affect survival only through their

impacts on birth weight, but this restriction does not affect the nature of the

reduced form. Note also that such endogenous risk factors as mother's age at

birth, parity, gestational age, and legitimacy status of the birth can be

incorporated into the birth weight production function. This would add

equations for each of these factors to the reduced form but would not alter

the reduced form survival equation (7). As explained below, we focus on
                                   F—4

the estimation of equation (7) in this paper.

    8For an attempt to estimate structural neonatal mortality rate production

functions, see Corman and Grossman (in progress).

    9Potential endogeneity problems are explored in more detail in Section II.

   '°One county with a population of at least 50,000 persons in 1970 was elimi-

nated from the sample because it was the only such county characterized as an

isolated rural county with no incorporated place with a population of at least

2,500 persons in 1970. In addition, Washington, D.C. was excluded because

of difficulty of defining its relevant market area. In particular, many

nonresidents use its sophisticated neonatal intensive care hospitals, and

these facilities are not likely to be widely available to its relatively

large black population.

   ''These advances are described by the American Academy of Pediatrics

(1977), the Committee on Perinatal Health (1977), and Budetti et al.

(1981).

   121n the context of the household production function model of consumer

behavior, the sign of the efficiency effect in a particular output demand

function is ambiguous if, for example, an increase in the mother's

schooling raises her productivity in the production of healthy infants by a

smaller percentage than her productivity in other household activities

(Grossman 1972; Michael 1972). Nevertheless, we think that it is reaso-

nable to expect a negative schooling coefficient in the neonatal mortality

rate regression.

   '3This assumes that the production of healthy infants is more time—

intensive than the production of other commodities. Note that the
                                      F—S

employment variable is a positive correlate of the opportunity cost of a

potential mother's time, but it is also a negative correlate of the amount

of time that she allocates to the production of healthy fetuses. That is,

women in families with strong preferences for healthy offspring are less

likely to work when they are pregnant, no matter what their opportunity

cost is.   Put differently, the employment variable is endogenous and may be

correlated with the disturbance term in the infant survival demand func-

tion. We use this variable in the regressions because it is the only

available measure of the opportunity cost of time and because the

regression coefficients of the other variables are only slightly altered by

its exclusion.

       more detailed justification for the aggregation of N and I projects

and CHCs is contained in the Appendix.

    '5Federal funding of abortions resumed temporarily in February 1980,

pending a review by the U.S. Supreme Court of a ruling by Federal District

Judge John F. Dooling Jr. that declared the Hyde Amendment unconstitu-

tional. In June 1980 the Supreme Court reversed Judge Dooling's decision

and upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment.

    '6The above point is best illustrated in the context of the following

pooled cross—sectional time—series regression model:

           d. =a0 +ax. +ctd.
           Jt         ljt     2jt—1
Here djt is the neonatal mortality rate in the jth county in year t and

    is an availability measure. Assume that initially, the correlation

between x. and d.i is positive, reflecting the placement of the public

program in counties with above average infant mortality rates. Ultimately,

however, the correlation between the current program level and lagged mor—
                                   F—6

tality will become negative if x has a substantial impact on d. each

year and if the correlation between      and         is positive and fairly

large.   If the Initial correlation between x and dti is negative,

reflecting placement of programs in low mortality areas then the correla-

tion between these two variables will become more negative the longer the

program is in effect. Either way, Inclusion of the lagged mortality rate

results in coefficients being biased toward zero. Clearly this model could

be modified to allow the availability measure to affect neonatal mortality

with a lag. Note that, although the lagged neonatal mortality rate used

empirically pertains to 1970, the point just made is relevant to programs

such as WIC that began after 1970 if the level of WIC is serially corre-

lated with programs that began before 1970. Note also that estimation of

the preceding model or one that relates the change in neonatal mortality to

changes in exogenous variables is beyond the scope of this paper because

county— or area—specific time series for a number of key independent

variables are not available. As it stands, the creation of our data base

required a considerable amount of time and effort.

    171f serial correlation bias exists and the sign of reverse causality

bias is zero or negative, then inclusion of the lagged neonatal mortality

rate will provide lower bound estimates of the absolute values of program

effects, and exclusion of this variable will provide upper bound estimates

of program effects, On the other hand, if serial correlation bias exists

and the sign of reverse causality bias is positive, then inclusion or

exclusion of the lagged mortality results in program coefficients being

biased toward zero. In this case, the specification with the lower program

coefficients will indicate which bias is stronger. That is, if inclusion
                                     F—i

 (exclusion) of the lagged rate results in lower coefficients, this implies

 that the serial correlation bias (reverse causality bias) dominates.

     '8As indicated in Section I, the coefficient on x. in equation (12)

 could be positive if the program at issue lowers the price of medical care

 paid by the poor and therefore lowers the cost of a birth.

     19The above approach differs from that of Grossman and Jacobowitz

 (1981). They estimate the fraction of births to low—income women and then

 fit an equation of the form

         d. =    ÷ (a0 —
                         S0)k. +   ct1k.x.
We do not adopt this procedure because we focus on the reduced form, and

k. is an endogenous variable.

    20The numerically small and statistically insignificant black schooling

effect in regression (4—B2) reflects at least in part the serial correla-

tion bias discussed in Section II. In particular, the black schooling

variable rose more rapidly both in absolute and in percentage terms than

the white schooling variable between 1964 and 1977.

    21080 and P080 are positively correlated in the white sample (r =    .13)
and negatively correlated in the black sample (r = —.07).     When OBG alone

is deleted from the regressions, the coefficient of POBG is positive and

insignificant in each sample. The coefficients of the other variables are

very similar to those obtained when both OBG and POBG are deleted.

    22The positive relationship between the physician variable and the

neonatal mortality rate may reflect causality from the latter to the

former. In particular, physicians may be attracted to areas where neonatal

mortality rates are high and the demand for their services is relatively
                                     F—8

large. In principle, the use of the lagged neonatal mortality rate

controls for this potential reverse causality relationship, but apparently

it is not successful in this case. Attempts to fit the neonatal mortality

equation by two—stage least squares with the physician variable treated as

endogenous also were not successful.

    23A one—tailed test is employed because the alternative hypothesis is

that each coefficient is negative.

    240n a race—specific basis, a variable was retained if it had the

correct sign and a t—ratio greater than one in at least one of the four

relevant regressions. There was one exception to this algorithm. For whi-

tes, the percentage of board—certified obstetricians/gynecologists was

deleted because it had a positive and significant effect when the physician

availability measure was deleted.

    25The sources for the values of the independent variables in the extra-

polations, and the assumptions that underlie these values are available in

the Appendix to this paper, which is available on request.

    26The obstetrician/gynecologist component is very small in absolute

value for blacks and positive for whites because the number of obstetricians/

gynecologists per thousand women aged 15 to 44 fell slightly between 1964

and 1977.

    27Race—specific data are not yet available for years after 1980.

    28Recall that Cates (1981) reports that the ban on Federal funding of

abortions under Medicaid has had little impact on the number of abortions

obtained by low—income pregnant women.

                   I. Data and Measurement of Variables


    The basic data set used here is the Area Resource File (ARF), a county—

based data service, prepared by Applied Management Sciences, Inc., for the

Bureau of Health Professions, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

It incorporates information from different sources for the 3,077 counties

of the United States. These counties can also be aggregated into larger

geographic areas such as Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas and

States. The ARF is updated continuously to reflect the most recent data

available. On the version of the ARF employed in this paper, socioeconomic

characteristics are taken from the 1970 Census of Population. Socioeconomic

characteristics from the 1980 Census of Population were not available on

the ARF when we began this paper. Note, however, that we were able to add

one key 1980 Census variable, the race—specific percentage of women aged 15

to 44 with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level, to our

version of the ARF. Note also that the race—specific number of women aged

15 to 44 in 1975 is available on our ARF tape. Note finally that schooling

and employment levels of women ages 15 to 49 still are not available on the

most recent version of the ARF.

   The race—specific percentage of women aged 15 to 44 with family income

less than 200 percent of the poverty level in 1980 (POV*) was computed by

the Alan Guttmacher Institute (Ad, the technical assistance division of

Planned Parenthood) from data in the 1980 Census of Population. It is

highly correlated with the percentage of women aged 15 to 44 with family

income less than 150 percent of the poverty level in 1980. The former
                                   A- 2

variable performed slightly better in the regression analysis than the

latter variable, both as an independent variable and as a denominator in

measures of the availability of public programs for poor women. The

results are not, however, sensitive to the poverty measure employed. Since

poverty and family income are highly correlated, the latter is omitted from

the regressions. In equations not shown in the Section III of the paper,

race—specific median family income in 1969 projected to 1975 based on

county trends in non—race specific per capita income was included as an

independent variable. Its coefficient was not significant. We emphasize

the poverty measure rather than median family income because the former

pertains to women in childbearing ages. Note that regression results are

not sensitive to the substitution of family income for poverty.

    The percentage of women aged 15 to 49 who had at least a high school

education in 1970 (HSP*) and the percentage of women aged 15 to 49 employed

in 1970 (EMP*) were taken from the ARF. The original source was the 1970

Census of Population, Women of Childbearing Age Tape.

    The number of non—federal obstetricians/gynecologists in patient care

in 1975 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 in 1975 (0BG) and the percentage

of such physicians who are board certified (POBC) were taken from the ARF.

The percentage of board—certified obstetricians/gynecologists was available

for all non—federal physicians in this specialty as opposed to those in

patient care. Attempts to include in the regressions such additional

variables as the number of pediatricians in patient care (or the number of

hospital—based pediatricians in patient care) per thousand women aged 15 to

44 and the percentage of board—certified pediatricians resulted in severe

multicollinearity problems and were abandoned in the final specifications.
                                      A- 3

The results presented in Section III are similar to those obtained with a

physician measure defined as the sum of obstetricians/gynecologists and

pediatricians per thousand women aged 15 to 44.

    The three dichotomous variables that reflect the eligibility of low—

income women who are pregnant for the first time for Medicaid coverage of

their prenatal care (MPA, MPIJ, and MPN) were obtained directly from Letty

Wunglueck of the Health Care Financing Administration. The dichotomous

variable pertaining to Medicaid financing of newborn care (MNEW) was taken

from Davidson, Simon, and Connelly (1982). The state—specific average

annual Medicaid payment per adult recipient in AFDC families in fiscal 1976

(MBEN) came from the Health Care Financing Administration (1979). Medicaid

payments per adult recipient is employed rather than Medicaid payments per

AFDC family or Medicaid payments per child recipient in AFDC families

because prenatal care is received by women, and newborn care often is paid

under the mother's Medicaid number.

    In preliminary regressions we used an estimate of the county—specific

percentage of poor women aged 15 to 44 who received AFDC payments in 1976

as a positive correlate of Medicaid availability. This variable had a

positive and in some cases statistically significant effect on neonatal

mortality. This may reflect the endogenous nature of the AFDC status of

low—income women. In particular, the birth rate of poor women in states

with generous AFDC programs is likely to be higher than in other states as

is the percentage of such women on AFDC. Given a higher death rate of

babies born to poor mothers than of those born to nonpoor mothers, one will

observe a positive relationship between the neonatal death rate and the

percentage of poor women on AFDC. Moreover, it is inappropriate to control
                                   A— 4

for this effect by including the percentage of births to poor women as a

regressor in the reduced form because the latter variable is endogenous.

Note that the county—specific average monthly AFDC payment per recipient

also was employed in preliminary regressions. This variable was not a

significant predictor of neonatal mortality because it captures two effects

that go in opposite directions. An expansion in AFDC payments augments the

resources available to poor women but also encourages them to have more

children. Both the AFDC eligibility measure and the AFDC benefit measure

were excluded from the final set of regressions because the coefficients of

the other variables were not sensitive to their omission.

    Organized family planning availability is given by the number of orga-

nized family planning clinics in 1975 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 with

family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level in 1975 (FPCLINP).

These clinics are organized by hospitals, state and local health depart-

ments, Planned Parenthood, and other agencies such as M and I projects and

CHCs. The numerator was obtained from a survey conducted by the Alan

Guttmacher Institute and described by Forrest (1980). The denominator per-

tains to poor women because the clinics primarily service poor women and

because the relevant public program is aimed at the poor. Since the

numerator is not race—specific, neither is the denominator. The latter is

obtained by applying the race—specific percentage of women aged 15 to 44

with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level in 1980 to

the race—specific number of all women aged 15 to 44 in 1975.

   The extent of the maternal and infant care program and the community

health center program is given by the sum of M and I projects and CHCs in

1976 per thousand women aged 15 to 44 with family income less than 200 per—
                                   A-S

cent of the poverty level in 1975 (BCHSP). The number of poor women serves

as the denominator of this variable for the same reason that it serves as

the denominator of the family planning measure. M and I projects and CHCs

are aggregated in the numerator to reduce multicollinearity among the inde-

pendent variables in the data set and because the coefficients of separate

M and I and CHC measures were not significantly different from each other

in preliminary regressions. Moreover, although CHCs are not limited in

terms of the type of medical care services provided or the age classes of

low—income recipients, the centers were designed in part to service target

populations with high infant mortality rates. In addition, all centers

must provide prenatal and post partum care (Goldman and Grossman 1982).

Finally, the Bureau of Community Health Services (BCHS, renamed the Bureau

of Health Care Delivery and Assistance in 1982) of the U.S. Department of

Health and Human Services has overall administrative responsibility for

both M and I projects and CHCs.

    The number of M and I projects per county in 1976 was taken from the

Bureau of Community Health Services (n.d.) and from unpublished information

provided by Joann Gephart of the Bureau of Health Care Delivery and

Assistance. The number of CHCs per county in 1976 was obtained from the

BCHS Common Reporting Requirements data tape, which is described in detail

by Goldman and Grossman (1982, 1983). The Count of CHCs includes a small

number of migrant health centers and Appalachian health centers. Note that

double counting of some organized family planning clinic providers occurs

because certain N and I projects and CHCs provide these services and thus

are included in the ACT data. This is not, however, a serious problem

because the simple correlation coefficients between FPCLINP and BCHSP in
                                     A—6

the white and black samples (.17 and .13, respectively) are not large.

    The state—specific percentage of eligible pregnant women served by WIC

in 1980 (WIC) was taken from the Select Panel for the Promotion of Child

Health (1981). Although this variable reflects use as well as availabi-

lity, it is less closely related to use than a measure such as the number

of users of BCHS projects per thousand poor women. This is because the

users of BCHS projects receive a well defined set of services while the

users of WIC do not.

    Information on abortion providers is contained in annual surveys taken

by the Alan Cuttmacher Institute (for example, Forrest, Sullivan, and

Tietze 1979; Henshaw et al. 1981).

    Neonatal intensive care availability is measured by the sum of the

state—specific number of hospitals with Level II, Level III, or Levels II

and III neonatal intensive care units in 1979 per thousand women aged 15 to

44 in the state in 1975 (NEOH). Hospitals that provide neonatal intensive

care are generally divided into three levels based on the intensity of care

each is equipped to deliver. Level I hospitals provide minimal or normal

newborn care; Level II hospitals provide intermediate care and are someti-

mes called neonatal intermediate care hospitals; and Level III hospitals

provide the most intensive care and are sometimes called neonatal intensive

care hospitals (Budetti et al. 1981). Specific definitions of these three

levels of neonatal care are contained in the recommendations of the

Committee on Perinatal Health (1977), which were developed as guidelines

for the regional development of perinatal health services. According to

the committee, the function of Level I hospitals ...is to provide services

                                   A-7

minor complications." Level II hospitals can "...provide a full range of

maternal and neonatal services for uncomplicated patients, for the majority

of complicated obstetrical problems, and certain types of neonatal

illnesses." Level III hospitals "...must be able to provide the full range

of resources and expertise required for the management of any complication

of pregnancy or of the newborn." Level III hospitals are designed to he

regional centers that accept referrals from other hospitals and coordinate

and direct the transportation of referred patients.

    As summarized by Budetti et al. (1981) and Sheridan (1983), many defi-

nitional problems arise in attempting to measure the number of hospitals

with Level II or Level III neonatal intensive care units in the U.S. These

difficulties are reflected in data contained in the American Hospital

Association's (AHA) annual survey of hospitals. Until its 1979 survey, the

AHA did not distinguish between Level II and Level III hospitals, but it

did distinguish between hospitals with neonatal intensive care units and

hospitals with neonatal intermediate care units. From 1976 (the first year

in which the AHA counted hospitals with neonatal intensive or intermediate

care units) to 1979, the number of hospitals with neonatal intensive care

units declined (AHA 1977, 1979). Budetti et al. (1981) attribute this

apparent reduction to problems encountered in the first years of reporting

a new survey item and to definitional issues.

    Given the above problems and the availability of level designations in

the 1979 ABA survey, this survey was used as the primary data base to

construct the neonatal intensive care measure employed in this paper. The

AHA survey was supplemented, however, by the 1979 Guide to Referral Centers

Providing Perinatal and Neonatal Care (Level III hospitals) prepared by
                                   A—8

Ross Planning Associates of Ross Laboratories and by Ross's 1982 Guide to

Centers Proving Perinatal and Neonatal Special Care (Level TI and Level III

hospitals). A tape with all hospitals that reported a neonatal intensive

care unit, a neonatal intermediate care unit, or both units was obtained

from the AIM. If the hospital designated its unit as Level II or Level III

it was included in our measure; if it designated its unit as Level I, it

was excluded. Hospitals with a neonatal intensive care unit and a neonatal

intermediate care unit were retained if at least one of the units was

designated as Level II or III. Hospitals with missing level designations

were retained and designated as Level III if they appeared in the 1979 Ross

guide. Those with missing level designations were retained and designated

as Level II if they appeared in the 1982 Ross guide (but not the 1979

guide) or if they appeared in neither guide but were designated as neonatal

intensive care hospitals on the AFIA tape and reported positive beds and

patient days pertaining to this type of care.

   Hospitals in the 1979 Ross guide but not on the AIM tape also were

included in our variable. Hospitals in the 1982 Ross guide but not on the

AHA tape were excluded because the criteria for inclusion in the 1982 guide

were such more vague than the criteria for inclusion in the 1979 guide

(Ross Planning Associates 1979, 1982), and some of the hospitals listed may

be Level I facilities. In addition, certain hospitals in the 1982 guide

may have opened their neonatal intensive care units in 1981 or 1980.

Finally, only 62 percent of the hospitals in the 1982 guide responded to a

Ross survey on beds, admissions, patient days, staffing patterns, and

equipment. On the other hand, over 95 percent of AHA member hospitals

responded to the 1979 AHA survey which collected similar information. We
                                  A-9

were reluctant to include Ross Level II hospitals that were not on the AHA

tape in our count because information on the measures just listed, which

can be viewed as supporting evidence of the Level II designation, was

missing for many of them. Note that all Ross Level III hospitals that were

not on the AHA tape responded to the Ross survey in writing or by

telephone.

    The count of neonatal Intensive care hospitals does not distinguish

between Level II and Level III hospitals because of the definitional

problems referred to above. The variable in the regressions pertains to

the number of hospitals with neonatal intensive care units rather than to

the number of neonatal intensive care units because Level III hospitals

provide a full range of services, including those delivered by Level II

hospitals, but are likely to report only one neonatal intensive care unit.

The measure used here contains facilities defined as neonatal intermediate

care hospitals by the AHA if their designations are Level II. No attempt

was made to enter the number of Level I neonatal intensive care hospitals

per thousand women aged 15 to 44 as a regressor because of potential multi—

collinearity between it and such regressors as the neonatal intensive care

variable actually used, the number of abortion providers, and the number of

obstetricians/gynecologists. We believe that our neonatal intensive care

variable is the most relevant measure of the role of hospital availability

in current birth outcomes in the U.S.

    The lagged and current rate—specific neonatal mortality rates were com-

puted from the ARF. Grossman and Jacobowitz (1981) argue that the overall

lagged infant mortality rate (not race— and age—specific) is superior to

the race— and age—specific measure if the overall rate was used to identify
                                      A - 10


target populations with poor initial health levels. Results with the

latter variable (not shown) are very similar to those contained in Section

[II.



                  II. Extrapolations: Sources and Assumptions

       With two exceptions, the terminal values of the independent variables

in the extrapolations are given by the race—specific weighted means in

Table 2 of the paper. The exceptions pertain to the schooling and

employment levels of women aged 15 to 49 since 1970 measures are used in

the regressions. The race—specific percentages of women aged 15 to 49 with

at least a high school education in 1977 (the terminal year) and in 1964

(the initial year) were taken from the Bureau of the Census (various

years). The assumption was made that the race—specific ratio of the per-

centage of wome aged 15 to 49 with at least a high school education to the

percentage of women aged 25 and over with at least a high school education

in 1970 also applied to 1964 and 1977. Terminal and initial values of the

race—specific percentage of women 15 to 49 employed were computed from the

Bureau of Labor Statistics (1982).

       The initial values of the Medicaid, Cl-IC, M and I, abortion, and WIC

measures are set equal to zero. This is because the Medicaid and CHC

programs were not enacted until 1965; there were few M and I projects in

operation until 1967 (Bureau of Community Health Services n.d.); the WIC

program did not start until 1972; and no state reformed its abortion law

until 1967. Although abortion was permitted to preserve a pregnant woman's

life in 1964, the number of providers per thousand women aged 15 to 44 was

extremely small in that year.
                                   A - 11


    The initial value of the number of organized family planning clinics

pertains to 1965. It was computed by applying the ratio of users per cli-

nic in 1968, reported by Cutright and Jaffe (1977), to the number of users

in 1965, also reported by Cutright and Jaffe. The number of hospitals with

neonatal intensive care units in 1964 was estimated from data given by

Sheridan (1983). He presents a time series of the number of neonatal

intensive care hospitals based on a survey of Level II and Level III hospi-

tals by Ross Planning Associates. Since the survey had only a 62 percent

response rate, we multiplied his 1964 figure by the ratio of our 1979 esti-

mate to his 1979 estimate.

    The number of obstetricians/gynecologists in 1964 was obtained directly

from Jean Robak of the American Medical Association. There are no estima-

tes of the percentage of such physicians who were board certified in 1964.

Therefore, a 7.5 percentage point increase between 1964 and 1977 was

assumed. The extrapolations are not sensitive to alternative assumptions

concerning the behavior of this variable.

    The initial value of the race—specific percentage of women aged 15 to

44 with family income less than 200 percent of the poverty level pertains

to 1965. There are no actual figures for that year, but figures for 1970

are available in Cutright and Jaffee (1977). Estimates for 1965 were

obtained as follows. Let pw70 and pw65 be the percentage of white women

aged 15 to 44 with family income less than 200 percent of poverty in 1965

and 1970, respectively; let pb65 and pb70 be the corresponding percentages

of black women in each year; let yw65 and      be real median family income

of whites in 1965 and 1970, respectively; and let yb65 and yb70 be real

median family income of blacks in each year. Then pw65 is given by

    Real race—specific median family income was taken from the Bureau of

the Census (various years) and pertains to whites and nonwhites. The para-

meters ci and ab were taken from regressions of the natural logarithm of

the race—specific percentage of women aged 15 to 44 with family income less

than 200 percent of poverty on the natural logarithm of race—specific

median family income in 1980. The regressions were estimated with the

county data set employed in this paper. Based on these regressions, ci was

Set equal to —1.1, and cib was set equal to —.4.
