                                               ABSTRACT

Currently, there is insufficient evidence regarding which policies will improve nutrition, reduce BMI,
the probability of obesity and the probability of overweight nationwide. This preliminary study investigates
the impact of a nutrition-education policy relative to price policy as a means to improve nutrition and
reduce BMI. Model estimations are created with pooled cross-sectional data from the Centers for Disease
Control’s (CDC), Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), American Chamber of Commerce
Research Association (ACCRA) state-level food prices and the United States Department of Agriculture’s
(USDA) funding of state-specific nutrition-education programs from 1992 – 2006. During this period,
federal funding for state-specific nutrition-education programs rose from approximately $600 thousand
for a few states to nearly $248 million for all states. After controlling for state fixed effects, year effects
and a state specific linear time trend, I find that nutrition education spending has the intended effect
for individuals from certain, but not all, income and education-levels. Also, the results indicate that
increasing the price of food purchased for consumption away from home is consistent with decreasing
BMI, obesity and overweight for the lowest income groups. However, the overall effect is minimal.

1.     Introduction

       The average US Body Mass Index (BMI), defined as weight in kilograms divided by

height in meters squared (kg/m2), has increased dramatically since the 1980s. Due to this

rise, more Americans are classified as overweight (BMI > 25 kg/m2) and obese (BMI > 30

kg/m2). This increase has serious implications for the state of national health. A substantial

amount of cross-disciplinary research has investigated the potential reasons for the increase.

The economics literature attributes the dramatic increase with the hypothesis: the increase in

average BMI is the result of economic changes that alter Americans’ preferences for exercise

and high calorie, low-nutrient food and drinks (Philipson, 2001; Lakdawalla and Philipson,

2002; Cawley,1999; Cutler, Glaeser and Shapiro, 2003; Chou, Grossman and Saffer, 2004).

       To determine the impact of relative prices, more targeted economic research has

investigated the impact of food prices and income levels (Auld and Powell, 2008; Beyoun,

Powell, Yuan, 2008; Goldman, Lakdawalla, and Zheng, 2009), restaurant location and

advertising (Chou, Rashad and Grossman, 2008; Rashad, Grossman, Chou, 2006), and

prices of non-food items (e.g., soda prices) on BMI and obesity prevalence (Fletcher, Frisvold,

Tefft, 2010). These studies all indicate technological change causes reductions in food and

non-food prices and increases in access to high-calorie, low-nutrient food, which then shifts

the nutritional content of processed food and the nutritional choices of Americans. To

incentivize proper nutrition, economic policy typically alters the price of and/or access to low-

priced foods that offer lower nutritional content. However, invoking policies affecting access

or price may result in regressive effects that disproportionately and negatively impact those

who are more disadvantaged or part of a lower income group. For this reason, other




                                                 1
strategies that directly target consumer information may be more effective in reducing

demand without imposing regressive losses on the most economically vulnerable.

       This paper offers a preliminary study of the impact of federal spending on nutrition-

education programs on BMI, obesity and overweight. Despite a wealth of research on

nutrition-education programs from other disciplines, such as public health and nutrition, the

current economic literature fails to provide an economic analysis that compares different

policies and their overall effects on BMI, obesity and overweight. This paper contributes to

the economic literature in two ways. First, it investigates the impact of nutrition education

policy on individual-level weight outcomes. Second, the relative impact of nutrition-education

policy and price policy is considered. This study uses individual-level data from the 1992-

2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for each state. These data are

augmented with state-specific federal nutrition-education program funding levels and food

prices over the same time period.

       In addition, to my knowledge, this is the first study in any discipline to investigate the

impact of nutrition-education policy across states. Therefore, this study is an important

addition to the general investigation of the impact of price policy on weight outcomes. Extant

studies that investigate price policy have done so using state-fixed effects to control for state-

level attitudes and strategies to combat obesity. This paper improves on the previously

described strategy from the price policy literature by holding actual state-level policies and

annual expenditures to combat obesity constant in models that use state-fixed effects, year-

fixed effects and state-specific time trends. The model design, described in more detail later,

provides direct estimates of policy and expenditure impacts on BMI and obesity outcomes.

policies designed to reduce obesity.



2.        Background

2.1       BMI Growth


          Table 2 documents the large increase in prevalence of overweight and obesity among

individuals 18 years of age and older between 1976 and 2004. The 19% increase in

overweight and 55% increase in obesity over the roughly 15 - year period between NHANESII

and NHANESIII generated considerable concern. Obesity prevalence continued to rise by

42% over the roughly 15 years from NHANES (1988 – 1994) to NHANES (2003 - 2004), while

over the same time-period the increase in the prevalence of overweight remained fairly

constant at about 18%.

Data from the BRFSS provide additional evidence of these trends. As can be seen in Figure

1, the average BMI for the US population increased by roughly 7% from 1995–2006. 3 The

persistence in the trend is of interest to policy makers because the increase in the average

BMI continued even after the problems associated with increasing BMI and obesity were

identified. Additionally, the rise in the average BMI continues while expenditures on weight-

  BMI is not a perfect measure of overall fatness or health of an individual. However, given the current state of the literature I selected BMI,
 because it is the most widely accepted measure of obesity. For further information, see Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008.

                                                                        3
loss services and products designed to aid weight reduction, including medical procedures

and pharmaceuticals are rising (Reuters, April 21, 2009).

2.2      Associated Medical Complications and Costs

       The literature on obesity has been growing rapidly since the mid-1990s. The

importance and salience of the research derives from well-documented adverse health

outcomes associated with obesity and overweight (McGinnis and Foege, 1993; Allison et al.,

1999). Obesity and overweight are currently associated with an increased risk of coronary

heart disease, type-2 diabetes, certain cancers (endometrial, breast, and colon),

hypertension, high cholesterol, stroke, liver and gallbladder disease, sleep apnea and

respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, and gynecological problems (Kahn, et. al, 1997).


       In 2006, the estimated medical costs associated with obesity were $147 billion (2008

dollars) (Finkelstein, et al., 2009). At the individual level, persons with a BMI in the obese

range increase their medical expenditures by $1,429 (2008 dollars) per year when compared

                                                 4
to counterparts with a healthy BMI (Finkelstein, et al. 2009). Previously, a study using data

from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Accounts (NHA)

found that medical spending on obesity ranged from US$26.8 to US$47.5 billion dollars per

year, as described in Table 1 from Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn and Wang (2003).

         Table 1 illustrates that obesity also places a significant burden on publicly-funded

programs. In 1998, approximately 42% of the obesity-related costs were publicly financed, as

described by Table 1. In fact, the public funding of overweight and obesity rivals the amount of

public funding associated with smoking (National Center for Tobacco Free Kids, 2002).



 2.3     Policies to Combat Obesity

         As mentioned previously, the main conclusion in the economics literature is that due to

evolving technological change has correlated with a sustained increase in calorie

consumption relative to calorie expenditure. The literature varies in identification of the causal

mechanism of this imbalance. To date, the literature has focused on the implications of price

policy as a tool to effect a change away from high-calorie, low-nutrition food (Philipson ,2001;

Lakdawalla and Philipson, 2002; Auld and Powell, 2008; Beyoun, Powell, Yuan, 2008;

                                                                  5
Cawley, 1999; Cawley, Lakdawalla, and Philipson, 2002; Chou, Grossman, and Saffer, 2004;

Chou, Rashad, Grossman, 2008; Goldman, Lakdawalla, Zheng, 2009; Fletcher , Frisvold,

Tefft, 2010; Rashad, Grossman, Chou, 2006).           An understudied mechanism for change is

nutrition-education policy. Nutrition-education policy could be a successful means to reduce

individual-level BMI, particularly among higher income, more highly-educated consumers

(Chaloupka, 1991). In fact, recent economic literature has found that spending on education

programs can be a successful means to induce other healthy behaviors. For example, the

literature on anti-smoking campaigns has found that cigarette sales and anti-smoking

campaign funding are inversely related (Farrelly, et al., 2003).

       Other disciplines have devoted more attention to assessing existing nutrition-

educational programs relative to economics. Clinical studies have found that nutrition-

education has been effective in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease,

diabetes and obesity (Lasker et al., 2008; Dansinger, 2005). In addition, some specialized

research has demonstrated the effectiveness of nutrition-education programs in small clinical

trials (Connelly, et al., 2007). Other studies have examined the impact of nutrition education

on college students, finding a positive effect on nutrition and weight reduction (Clifford, et al.

2009; Byrd-Williams, et al., 2009). Given the suggestive evidence from smaller studies, it

seems likely that broad-scale federal funding of state nutrition-education programs may be an

effective means to reduce the prevalence of overweight and, more specifically, obesity without

implementing tax or other pricing policies, which are regressive and strongly opposed by

corporations and interest groups.

2.3.1 Background on Federal Nutrition-Education Funding Program

Funding: Federal and Non-federal Public Nutrition Programs



                                                  6
         Federally, nutrition and obesity education is delivered through the United States

Department of Agriculture (USDA). The USDA relies on state-level public entities, public

schools (school systems and universities), public health clinics, etc. to extend information to

the population. The USDA funds these programs through grants and other contracts to the

states’ health departments. Many of the programs are funded by the USDA through the

Supplement Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). Therefore, SNAP created the

Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program’s Education Program (SNAP-ed) to distribute the

federal nutrition-education funds. SNAP-ed is a dollar-per-dollar federal match to all non-

federal public funds already allocated at the state-level for the delivery of nutrition-education

programs.

         The USDA started allocating funds through SNAP-ed in 1988 with a grant to

Wisconsin. By 1992, USDA distributed $661,000 across seven states (Wisconsin, Minnesota,

Ohio, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington). By 2004, fifty states

participated in the program and they received a combined total of $228.2 million.

State-level Federally Funded Programs

         Currently, the USDA regulation 7 CFR 272.2 gives states the option of participating in

the program by applying for the federal match. Although participation is not mandatory, it is

strongly encouraged. The main objective is to improve the likelihood that persons eligible for

SNAP will make healthy food choices and choose physically active lifestyles. The goals are

consistent with the current Dietary Guidelines for Americans for the general US population

(U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture,

2005).




                                                 7
       Limited guidance is provided to the states regarding the structure of state nutrition

education programs. In general, states are encouraged to use “the most effective nutrition

education tools and strategies available” to develop interventions focusing on the following

key behavioral outcomes:

       1.     Eat fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free or low-fat milk products

              daily.

       2.     Be physically active every day.

       3.     Balance caloric intake from food and beverages with calories expended.


       Interventions range from broad social marketing campaigns, to the provision of a

comprehensive nutrition education curriculum, to an individual or group (direct intervention).

The indirect interventions involve social marketing campaigns which disseminate information

and messages in a variety of ways, from recipe cards and wristbands to flyers and television

or radio public service announcements. The variability in the delivery approach may result in

somewhat diffuse treatment effects despite a fairly uniform overall use of learner-centered

and behavioral-focused interventions. One representative state, Indiana, offered direct

education programs in the following settings: local cooperative extension offices, youth

education sites (preschools and day care), emergency food assistance sites, elderly services

site, WIC clinics, adult education and training sites and churches/other faith based

organization sites. The indirect materials used by programs in the state of Indiana included

widely disseminated print material and participation in public events. Given the focus of

Indiana’s program, 90% of the participants are adults (18 years old or older). In comparison,

Michigan, one of the first recipients of the funds, offers a well developed program that targets

both direct education and indirect education through multiple venues. The direct education

                                                8
sites include all the direct education venues listed for Indiana plus the following additional

sites: public schools (K-12), food stores or other retail outlets and health care sites. The

indirect education includes mass communication (radio, television, newspapers, posters),

print materials and participation in public events. The demographic profile of Michigan’s

program is estimated to be 52% school aged children (5 to 17 years old) and infants (less

than 5 years old) and 48% adults (18 years old or older) (USDA, 2004). 4



3.     Analytical Framework

       Any behavioral model aimed at describing BMI must include the energy balance

equation, defined as the difference between energy consumed and energy expended (Chou

et al., 2002; Chou et al., 2004; Philipson, 2001). If the energy consumed is greater than the

energy expended and the imbalance persists over time, an increase in BMI results. If

marginal increases in BMI persist, overweight could become obesity. To counteract the

growth in an individual’s BMI, the imbalance must be reversed. However, constraints may

impede an individual’s ability to reverse the energy imbalance and reduce their BMI. Some

constraints are exogenous, for example age and genetics, while others, such as knowledge

and prices may be influenced by policy.

       A health production framework that incorporates the energy balance framework can be

used to model improvements in health as providing utility (Grossman, 1972). When applied

to nutrition and weight gain, an individual is assumed to gain utility from alterations to the

production process that balances energy intake and output resulting in healthy weight.

Disutility results from a BMI that is outside of the healthy (normal) range (18.5 kg/m2 ≤ BMI <

25 kg/m2). With this in mind, a BMI outside of the normal range, according to economic

       4
           At the time of this writing the only data available regarding the state-specific programs was from 2004.

                                                             9
theory, must result from changes to the production process or from changes in the prices of

inputs to the production process. If BMI increases over time to be consistent with utility

maximization or the household production frameworks, then BMI must be a by-product of

some other production process, such as leisure. Chou, Grossman and Saffer (2004)

conceptualize the rise in obesity as a by-product. Household production of other

commodities, such as leisure, which can include dining out with friends, may produce effects

that negatively impact weight and health. Alternatively, leisure could also be conceptualized

as an input to health production with negative or positive marginal product depending on its

effect on BMI. In either conceptualization, negative effects may be moderated by improved

information or education about the health production process and the caloric content of

inputs to it (e.g. nutrition-education).

      In this paper, the production of an undesirable BMI is conceptualized as a by-product

of household production. Reductions in information asymmetries about caloric and

nutritional content through nutrition-education resulting in more efficient health production

can be viewed as managerial shifts in the household production process that reduce the by-

production of weight gain (Grossman, 1972). This mirrors other production processes where

economic research has shown that on-the-job training and on-the-job learning increases

production efficiency (Mincer, 1984; Barron, et al. 1989). Training and educational programs

with a targeted purpose, such as increased health production, should similarly reduce BMI

and the probability of an individual being overweight or obese. Within this framework, we also

test the hypothesis that BMI and weight outcomes are influenced by the stock of information

rather than the within period flow.


4.    Data Description and Empirical Implementation


                                               10
4.1      The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)


       Three individual-level outcomes are investigated: 1) actual BMI, 2) an indicator that the

individual’s BMI is above the normal range (overweight) (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2), and 3) an indicator

that an individual’s BMI-level is in the obese range (obese) (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). The individual-

level variables and all demographic variables used to describe the three weight outcomes

derive from repeated cross-sections of the BRFSS, an annual telephone survey of persons 18

years and older. Surveys are conducted by each participating state’s health department and

administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC uses

BRFSS to calculate national and state-specific estimates of the prevalence of lifestyles and

behaviors that contribute to various health outcomes, including obesity.

       Fifteen states participated in the first survey in 1984. State participation rose to 49

states by 1992 and all 50 states by 1996. During this time, the respondent participation in the

BRFSS rose from 96,213 in 1992 to 355,216 in 2006. The final analysis sample for the

pooled cross-section 1992-2006 includes 2,262,952 individuals from 1992-2006. 5 As was

seen in Figure 1, the U.S. average BMI increased by 2.10 kg/m2, or approximately 7%

between 1992 and 2006.

                          Overweight      Obesity




Figure 2 provides evidence of the growth in the prevalence of overweight and obesity within

the US as described by BRFSS. The growth in obesity is fed by those transitioning from a

BMI in the overweight range to a BMI in the obese range. Therefore, by focusing on

overweight rather than individual categories allows for a more accurate picture of the

“fattening” of the US population. Over the time-frame of study, the prevalence of overweight

in the BRFSS increased from 1992 to 2006 by nearly 35%.

       Further analysis of the individual-level variables used in the empirical model reader is

found in Table 3, which presents the descriptive statistics for the variables for the 1992-2006

time frame. The variables include measures of age, gender, marital status, education-level,

employment and income-levels. The income-levels are used to create a real income variable

(in 1984 dollars) for consistency with the other variables that measure prices and funding. A

description of the state-level price and funding variables presented in Table 3 are provided in

subsequent sections.

4.2      Data on USDA Funding

      State expenditures on nutrition education are measured by federal funds annually

allocated to each state’s CES office to allocate to the nutrition education program. As

previously noted, these funds represent the federal match to the public non-federal funds

allocated to the states. Because the dollar for dollar match that requires states to take the

initiative to secure the funds, it likely reflects the state’s interest and engagement in nutrition

education and is associated with endogeneity at the state-level. To the extent that unobserved


                                                                  13
determinants of state interest in providing nutrition education are correlated with unobserved

individual traits that influence food choice and weight, the endogeneity represents a potential

source of bias in estimation of the effect of expenditures on weight outcomes. For this reason,

I impose identifying restrictions, which are described later, on the estimated models in order to

obtain causal estimates of the relationship between educational funds, BMI and the

probabilities of overweight and obesity.

     In 1992, only 7 states were approved for a total of $661,076 in federal funding. 6 In 2000,

the number of states receiving funding increased to all states except Delaware, Maryland and

Alaska, for a total of $247,024,645. Expenditures are deflated by the CPI to reflect 1984

dollars. The nominal state-level funding is publicly available from the USDA. This data reflect

both participation and amount of funding. The trend in the average state-level real nutrition-

 In 1992, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Ohio, New Hampshire, New York, Oklahoma, and Washington were the only
states to receive funding. The probability of receiving funding is uncorrelated with state-level BMI trends and
BMI levels.

education funding by year is depicted in Figure 3. 7 The growth in nutrition-education funding

has increased substantially from 1992-2006.

    4.3    Price Data

        An additional policy variable of interest is food price. Given the analytical model with

individual weight as the outcome is, in effect, a reduced-form weight or health production

function, the model must include a measure of input prices (i.e., food prices). Models use

state-level food price indices, classified by whether food is purchased for preparation and

consumption at home (home food price) or purchased away from home and already prepared

(away food price). Price data is from the ACCRA Cost of Living Index, which is published

quarterly by the American Chamber of Commerce Research Association (ACCRA) for 250-

300 urban centers. The index is widely used by economists, researchers and corporations to

measure relative cost of living. Quarterly state-specific population-weighted city prices in a

given year were averaged to get annual prices.

           The state-level home food price index is calculated as a population weighted average

of the nominal prices for all items included in the home food index for each urban area in a

state. The away food price is created similarly. When calculating the away food price and

home food price, only food items that are available in the ACCRA COLI consistently from

1992-2006 are included. 8 Food prices are deflated by the CPI to 1984 prices (real home food

price and real away food price). The averages for the real home food price and the real away

food price are provided in Table 3.


4.4 Empirical Models



7
    For simplicity, I will refer to real nutrition-education funding as simply nutrition-education funding in the text.
    8
     Therefore, items such as tomatoes are excluded from the home food price calculation.

                                                              15
    In order to estimate the effect of food prices and nutrition-education funding on the weight

outcomes, we closely follow the methodologies that estimate the effect of other prices, as well

as educational campaigns funding on outcomes. Tobacco consumption and its response to

changes in price and anti-smoking campaign funding has been modeled in the past.

Examples include Chaloupka and Warner (2000), which provides an extensive review of the

cigarette price and tax literature, and Farrelly et al. (2002), which examines the anti-smoking

campaign literature.

    Linear probability models are used to estimate the effects of nutrition education funding

on two individual-level binary indicator variables: overweight and obese. For the continuous

outcome, BMI, a linear model is used. As a baseline, the following estimating equation is

offered,


 (1) Y ist =β 0 + β 1 X ist + β 2 (Real Nutrition Education Funding) st + β 3 (Real Away Food Price) st +
     β 4 (Real Home Food Price) st + β 5 State+β 6 Year+ε ist

Where i indexes the individual, s indexes the state, and t indexes the year. Y ist is one of two

individual-level indicators for the binary outcomes of having a BMI in the overweight or obese

range. For the continuous model, Y ist is the individual-level BMI (BMI). X ist is a vector of

individual demographic characteristics, including dummies for male, white, black, Hispanic,

high-school graduate, some college or more, age and age squared, and a continuous variable

for real income. Real Away Food Price and Real Home Food Price are the state and year

specific real price indices for Food Away Price and Food Home Price. State is a vector of

state dummies, and Year is a vector of year dummies. Again, β 2 , β 3, and β 4 are the

coefficients of interest. Identification of the parameters of interest in equation (1) is achieved




                                                    16
by within state variation in funding over time relative to state that does not experience

changes in funding over time.

       This identification strategy fails to control for state-specific unobserved characteristics

that may vary over time and impact weight outcomes, nutrition-education funding levels and

prices. To address this limitation, Gruber and Frakes (2006) suggest improving equation (1)

by adding controls for state-specific linear time trends.


(2)Y ist =β 0 + β 1 X ist + β 2 (Real Nutrition Education Funding) st + β 3 (Real Away Food Price) st +
    β 4 (Real Home Food Price) st + β 5 State + β 6 Year + β 7 State x Time + ε ist .

       A model described by equation (2) is more accurate if nutrition-education expenditures

are endogenous. A model with fixed state effects and year effects will not capture all potential

state-level causal responses to nutrition education. For instance, as states change funding

levels in response to local economic conditions, BMI within the state could also change.

Equation (2) includes state-specific linear time trends to ensure only the estimated real

spending on nutrition-education and price effect reflects exogenous policy changes rather

than a combination of the effects of spending, price policy changes and some unmeasured

state characteristics, (e.g. trends in nutrition awareness or social norms within a state that

differ across states and over time). This identification strategy uses the variation in

implementation of nutrition-education programs across the country to control for unobservable

factors for changes in these influences over time.

       To address any unobserved social norms regarding physical health impact funding,

prices and weight outcomes, I estimate a specification that includes a 1 year lagged value of

the state average BMI. Finally, as a falsification test, I estimate the impact of nutrition-

education funding on the probability that the individual wears a bicycle helmet.



                                                    17
       The data definitions, means, and standard deviations of all individual-level and state-

level variables were discussed previously in the data section and reported in Table 3. The

statistics are based on a sample of 2,252,664 individuals. Finally, in all regressions the

BRFSS survey weights and the standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity and

clustering within states.

   5. Results and Discussion

All results presented in this section are generated from the regressions described in

equations (1) and (2) above. Results describe the influence of both the real nutrition-

education program funding and real food prices on BMI, as well as probabilities of overweight

and obesity. Because these models are linear probability models, the presented regression

coefficients are marginal effects and the standard errors are corrected for heteroskedasticity

and clustering at the state-level.

       Table 4 provides a baseline assessment of federal nutrition spending and price effect

from estimation of equation (1). In addition, Table 4 includes the results of equation (1)

omitting the real food prices. Results in Table 4 suggest that inclusion of real food prices has

very little effect on the size of the marginal effect of nutrition education spending. In addition,

the results suggest that nutrition-education spending (on average) has the intended marginal

effect on individual level BMI, but not on probability of overweight or obesity. The size of the

effect is quite small, however, implying that a $1 million increase in expenditures will

decrease individual BMI by 0.0017 kg/m2. For the average 45 year old male, at a height of 5

feet, 9 inches (1.75 meters) and weight of 180 lbs (81.81 kg), this would be a 0.01915 lb

(0.008686 kg) loss. This model does not control for state-specific linear time trends.




                                                18
 Therefore, the results may be biased by unobserved state- and individual-level traits that

 vary over time.

          Table 5 presents the results of specification (2), the estimating equation that adds a

state-specific time trend. As shown, the estimated relationship between real nutrition-

education funding and all individual-level outcomes is positive. Interestingly, the effect of

price policy is larger in magnitude than the estimated expenditure effects and is statistically

significant for BMI.

          The positive relation between real spending on nutrition-education programs and the

weight outcomes as described in Table 5 is troubling and suggests that models controlling for

unobservable changes in the state-specific trends in attitudes about nutrition or trends in

combating obesity may still may be imprecisely estimating the average impact of real funding

for nutrition-education programs and/or price policy. For instance, the results in Table 5

suggest that reverse causality may be a source of bias. Perhaps, states with higher BMI are

allocated more federal funding or are more aggressive in obtaining funding to combat obesity.

If true, then state-specific time trends cannot control for such influence. Given a potential

reverse causality problem and the dynamics of weight, using a lagged measure of state-

specific real nutrition education funding and prices may be more appropriate when estimating

the impact on individual-level measure of BMI, obesity and overweight.

        Table 6 illustrates the effect of real nutrition-education funding and real food prices

when one and two period lags are used for real funding for nutrition-education programs, real

home food price and real away food price. In these models, an interesting change is

illustrated. While controlling for both state-specific linear and quadratic time trends, neither a

one nor two-period measure of lagged funding shows a significant impact on BMI, obesity or

overweight. However, in the two-period model, the impact of the real price of food purchased

for home consumption has a negative and significant effect on all individual-level outcome

measures. This suggests real nutrition-education program funding may be less effective than

targeted price policy. Over at least a two period lag, the results suggest increasing food

prices may reduce individual food demand to a level consistent with weight stabilization rather

than weight gain.

          Another possibility that derives from the lagged nature of intake and weight change is

that the stock of information about nutrition and calorie balance is more important than the

period-specific flow of information. Table 7 demonstrates the cumulative impact of real

nutrition education funding. As demonstrated, the impact across all three weight outcome

measures is negative. There is a statistically significant and negative impact of cumulative

real nutrition-education funding on BMI. While the impact on obese and overweight is

negative, neither coefficient is statistically significant. This result suggests, the stock of state-

level investment in real nutrition-education information has more power than the annual

investment.

          Finally, real education funding and price policies could possibly have differential effects


                                                                      21
based on income and education level. The effects illustrated in Table 5 are estimates of the

average effect for all income groups. Therefore, Table 8 considers the interactive effect of

real nutrition education policy and price policy by income level. To create the interaction

terms, the following income categories provided by the BRFSS were used: less than

$25,000/year; between $25,000 and $50,000/year; and over $50,000/year. The three

categories were interacted with real nutrition-education funding and the real food price

indices. Results indicate that the impact of real nutrition-education funding and price policy

varies by level of real income.

        From Table 8, the interaction effects allow us to identify the appropriate effect of real

nutrition-education funding for the highest income groups. In fact, only the BMI and

prevalence of obesity among the middle income group is significantly impacted by the level of

real nutrition-education funding. Table 8 also describes the differential effects of real food

prices by income group for the weight outcomes. The real food away price has the intended

and significant effect on the lowest income group. In comparison, the weight outcomes for the

highest income groups are positively, but insignificantly, influenced by increases in the real

price of food purchased for away from home consumption (real away food price). The real

price of food purchased for at-home consumption (real home food price), has an interesting

impact on one weight outcome: obese. For the highest income group, the real home food

price has a negative and significant impact on the probability of being obese.

          Another useful analysis is determining the impact of nutrition education funding by

education level. Table 9 considers the interactive effect of real nutrition education policy and

price policy by education level. To create the interaction terms, the BRFSS used the following

categories: less than a high-school education (less than high school); only a high school

degree (high school); and some college or more (some college). The three categories were

interacted with real nutrition-education funding and the real food price indices. The results are

qualitatively the same as the income effect. As expected, the effect of nutrition-education

funding has a larger impact on the higher educated group. Additionally, the same qualitative

effects result for the interaction of education level and real food prices as estimated for the

interaction of income level and real food prices. Thus, describing the same differential effects

of price policy and education policy. These results suggest the lowest income and education

levels price policies, although regressive, have a larger and more significant impact on weight

outcomes relative to funding nutrition education programs.

  6.        Conclusion

       The estimates contained in the previously reported tables suggest the nutrition-education

  funding is having less success than intended. As reported above, cumulative and lagged

  effects of real nutrition-education funding show some evidence of a larger impact on some

  measures of weight than the impact of contemporaneous funding. In addition, individuals

  from some income groups and education levels are more responsive to price and real

  nutrition-education funding than others, although the significant effects are quite small.

       These results are consistent with previous work that suggests lower income, less well-

  educated individuals are more responsive to price whereas higher income, better educated

  individuals will be more responsive to information. For lower income groups, regressive real

  price increases for food prepared away from home has the intended but perhaps not the

                                                                         24
desired regressive impacts. Also, for individuals with incomes in the range of $25,000 to

$50,000 / per year, BMI and probability of being obese appear to respond to changes in real

nutrition-education funding.

   An important note is the estimated impacts of all of the evaluated policies were small. In

addition, some evidence suggests that education policy is less effective relative to price

policy. This research takes advantage of already existing data to provide a useful analysis.

Further research could offer an investigation of the mechanisms by which states obtain and

implement nutrition education programs, as well as if different types of programs produce

better results than others. This line of research will continue as these data become available.
