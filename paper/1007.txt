                  The Transition from School to Work:
                 The Experiences of Blacks and Whites



                               ABSTRACT


     Because much of the concern about youth unemployment is motivated
by the large differences between the rates for blacks and whites, we
have pursued our earlier work by analyzing separately for black and
white youth the relationship between high school preparation and early
labor force experience. We find no striking differences between the
determinants of weeks worked by whites and non-whites upon graduation
from high school. Although vocational training in high school bears
little relationship to weeks worked upon graduation, hours worked while
in high school bear a strong relationship to later employment for
students and non-students, white and non-white. Academic performance
as measured by standardized test scores and high school class rank is
also positivelyrelated to later weeks worked by non-students, both
white and non-white. Young persons find jobs in large part through
friends and relatives or through direct application to employers or
possibly a combination of the two. Persons who are not looking for
work--and would then be classified as out of the labor force, according
to standard definitions--are apparently quite distinct from persons
who are looking for work. Those out of the labor force seem not to
be "discouraged workers" for the most part. Controlling for other
individual attributes, non-whites are much more likely than whites to
be in a post-secondary school full-time (although without controlling
for these attributes the reverse is true). A large proportion of
young men in school are also working part-time and a significant number
are working full-time. A sizeable proportion of persons in post-
secondary schools would be classified as unemployed based on official
definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate among these full-time
students is generally more than twice the rate among young men not in
school. Few high school graduates are chronically unemployed.

                   THE TRANSITION FROM SCHOOL TO WORK:

                  THE EXPERIENCES OF BLACKS AND WHITES


                                    by

                    Robert H. Meyer and David A. Wise


     In an earlier paper (Meyer and Wise [1979]), we analyzed the rela-

tionship between high school preparation and the early labor force

experience Of youth. We were particularly interested in the effect of

vocational training in high school on wage rates and weeks worked after

high school graduation and upon entry into the labor force. Our

findings showed no relationship between job related training in high

school and post-graduation weeks worked and wage rates. We did find,

however, a strong relationship between hours worked while in high

school and both weeks worked and wage rates in the first four years

after graduation. High school class rank and test scores were also

found to be positively related to early weeks worked and wage rates in

the labor force. These findings and others led us to conclude that to

prepare persons for the labor force, programs that emphasize work expe-

rience for youth may be the most likely to succeed; "the weight of our

evidence is that it offers the best chance of enhancing future labor

market experience." We also concluded on the basis of our findings that

general academic preparation would have a greater payoff than the current

forms of high school vocational training as well.

     In our earlier paper, however, we did not attempt to distinguish

the relative effects of different types of high school preparation on

the early labor force experiences of white youth from those of black
                                     -2-




youngsters. Because much of the concern about youth unemployment is moti-

vated by the large differences between the rates for blacks and whites,

we have been motivated to pursue our earlier work, in particular by ana•lyz-

ing separately for black and white youth the relationship between high

school preparation and early labor force experience. Specifically, we ask

whether work in high school among black youth bears a quantitative rela-

tionship to early labor force experience that is comparable to the rela-

tionship that exists among white youth. Concomitantly, we ask whether job

training in high school is unrelated to the job success of black youth, as

well as white youth.   In addition, in contrast to our earlier work, we have

estimated weeks worked equations for both students and non-students. A

major motivation for treating both is that much of unemployment is accounted

for by full-time students.

     The analysis presented in this paper is subject to limitations and

advantages similar to those of our early paper. It is based on male youth

who graduated from high school. A large portion of young persons enter the

labor force immediately upon graduation from high school. Many receive no

further formal education. For these youth, as well as those who continue

their education, high school preparation is a potentially important deter-

minant of early labor force experience. Because the study is limited to

high school graduates, its implications for high school dropouts must be

indirect. Among all groups of youth, high school dropouts, and in particular

black school dropouts, have the poorest labor force experiences. Nonethe-

less, labor force statistics suggest a high youth unemployment rate, even

among high school graduates. And our results for high school graduates we

think have strong implications for future generations of persons like those
                                     -3—




who now drop out, if these future generations were to remain in school.

    The analysis is based on data collected by the National Center for

Educational Statistics through the National Longitudinal Study of the High

School Class of 1972. The Study collected a wide range of school, family

background, attitude and aspiration information from approximately 23,000

high school seniors in the Spring of 1972. The 1972 survey was based on a

nation—wide sample of high schools, stratified in such a way that schools

in lower socioeconomic areas were somewhat oversampled. In addition to the

base survey, the Study included three follow-up surveys in 1973, 1974, and

1976. The follow-up surveys were used to obtain information on post-

secondary school and work choices as well as labor force experiences.'

Unlike most other data sources, this one allows us to follow a single cohort

in their transition from school to work.

     We shall begin in Section I with a series of descriptive statistics

that are intended to describe the nature of the transition from school to

work, with a particular attempt to present data in such a way that differ-

ences that should exist between the experiences of black and white youth

would be apparent. The descriptive, statistics cover patterns of post-

secondary school and work, labor force statistics, methods of job search,

distinctions between "out of the labor force" and "unemployed," and descrip-

tions of the extent of persistence of early labor force experience. These

descriptive statistics reveal findings--some of which parallel the conclu-

sions of our earlier paper--that may be summarized as follows:

     1. Non-whites are less likely than whites to be in a post-secondary



     1.   For more detail, see Levinsohn et al [1978].
                                      -4-




school full-time (although after controlling for individual attributes the

reverse is true).

       2. Among both whites and non-whites, most youth who go to school

enter in the first year after high school and attend only in consecutive

years; in and out sequences of school and work are the exception, although

not rare.

       3. Young persons find jobs in large part through friends and relatives

or through direct application to employers or possibly a combination of the

two.

       4. Only a small proportion of out-of-school youth were looking for

work--and thus unemployed--although the ratio was somewhat higher for non-

whites than for whites. The unemployment rates implied by this survey are

much lower than the official government unemployment rates based on the

Current Population Survey.

       5. A large proportion of young men in school are also working part—time

and a significant number are working full-time.

       6. A sizeable proportion of persons in school would be classified as

unemployed based on official definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate among

full-time students is generally more than twice the rate among young men not

in school. Few high school graduates are chronically unemployed.

       7. Persons who are not looking for work--and would then be classified

as out of the labor force, according to standard definition--are apparently

quite distinct from persons who are looking for work. Those out of the labor

force seem not to be "discouraged workers" for the most part.

       8. The hourly wage rates of white and non-white high school graduates

are very close. Among men out of school, non-whites work fewer weeks per
                                     -5-



year than whites, but the difference declines continuously over the four-

year period following high school qraduation.

     9. There is only a weak relationship between weeks worked in the first

year or two after graduation from high school and weeks worked two or three

years later, but as young persons grow older there is increasing consistency

between weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in the next.

     The model that we have used to describe the relationship between high

school preparation and weeks worked upon graduation is described in Section

II. A major motivation for the procedure we have adopted is to provide

estimates that represent the experience to be expected for any individual

in the population even though in large part we observe wage rates and weeks

worked for persons who are either not in school and have chosen to work

instead or who are in school full—time. In a formal sense, we will correct

for the selection bias attendant on relating weeks worked to high school

preparation only for persons who elect not to be full-time students, or only

for those who are full-time students. As we shall see, many students also

are in the labor force, but we judged that the labor force experience of

these youth should not be considered comparable to that of persons who are

in the labor force full-time.

     The results of our estimation procedure are presented in Section III.

They may be summarized briefly.

     1. We find no striking differences between the determinants of weeks

worked by whites and non-whites.

     2. Although vocational training in high school bears little relation-

ship to weeks worked upon graduation, hours worked while in high school

bear a strong relationship to later employment for students and non-students,
                                     -6-




white and non-white.

     3. Academic performance as measured by standardized test scores and

high school class rank is also positively related to later weeks worked

by non-students, both white and non-white.

     Concluding comments and discussion are presented in Section IV.

I. Descriptive Statistics

     To facilitate exposition, we have in many instances presented in

the text simplified tabulations of more detailed information that is

contained in several appendix tables, with the relevant appendix

table cited in the text. Because for recent high school graduates both

working   and further schooling are comon post—secondary choices, we will
present data first on the schooling patterns followed by high school
graduates. We   will then present in turn information on how youth find

jobs, their labor force status as students and as non-students, distinc-

tions between the unemployed and those out of the labor force, hourly wage

rates and annual earnings, and the relationship between weeks worked in

successive years following high school graduation.


A. School Status

     The percent of white young men that attend a post—secondary school

is considerably higher than the percent of non-white males who attend.

The percent of youth in school part-time does not vary greatly by race.

The percents of high school graduates in school in October 1972 and

October 1976 are shown in Table i)

    Although a lower percent of non-white youth than white youth are

in school--about 12 percentage points until 1976 when many

had completed four years of college--among youth with comparable

scholastic aptitude, high school class rank, and socioeconomic back-

ground, non-white youth are considerably more likely than white youth

to go to a post-secondary school. The relevant numbers are not shown

here but are detailed in Meyer and Wise [1979], and Venti and Wise

[1980].


B. School Attendance Patterns

     Most   youth who go to school enter in the first year after high
school and attend only in consecutive years; in and out sequences of
school and work are the exception. In Table 2 are shown the percent

of persons in school full-time in each possible number and sequence of

time periods. For example, the sequence 10101 indicates in school

full—time in October 1972, October 1974, and October 1976, but not in

school full—time in October 1973 and October 1975 (0.2 percent of white

males followed this sequence). The sequences have been grouped by year

of entry and number of interruptions.

     Although there is some movement into and out of school, it is not

attend at all and 78 percent of non-whites attend during the year imme-

diately after high school. The table reveals,however,that non-traditional

attendance patterns,although the exception,are not rar9. For example, 14

percent of whites and 21 percent of non-whites who attend at all delay

entry by one or more years, but then attend without interruption; while

another 14 percent of whites and 15 percent of non-whites interrupt their

schooling for one or more years. The differences between whites and non-

whites mirror those shown in Table 1, although it can be seen in Table 2

that the lower percent of non—whites than whites in school is accounted

for largely by the lower percent of non-white youth that enter school

right after high school graduation.

     Some explanation of the delayed entry sequences is provided in Table

3.   Define school track as the type of      school first entered by the indi-

vidual.   School track will differ from      the post-secondary alternative in

1972 to the extent that an   individual delays school attendance. While

45 percent   of young men in the vocational-technical track delay entry by

one or more years, only 13 percent of the individuals in the college

track delay by one or more years. Of men who eventually go to two-year
                                                       of men not in school in
colleges, 25 percent delay entry. In aggregate,

October 1972, about 32 percent eventually attend some type of school.

 in and out of school since they do not incorporate

examining the precentage of individuals with sequence patterns 11111 and 11110

(in school each of the first five and first four October periods respectively)

who have not obtained an academic degree. About 71 percent of the first

group and 26 percent of the second group have not obtained a "four year"

college degree. Thus, a substantial number of individuals exhibit much

slower academic progress than is commonly assumed. Unobserved movements

in and out of school may contribute substantially to slow academic progress.

(Furthermore, even measured years of school may overstate actual school

attainment, defined in terms of a measure of academic progress such as accu-

mulated credit hours.)
         Furthermore, many persons who enter post-secondary schools do not

  obtain a degree. As of October 1972, in addition to the large number

  of   students who had been in school for five consecutive October periods
  without obtaining a degree, many     others had dropped out without obtaining

  a    degree. For   example, of persons who entered four-year colleges and

  universities   in the Fall 1972,   approximately 20 percent had not obtained
                                     —12-




a B.A. degree by October 1976 and were not in school at that time.


C. How Young Persons Find Jobs

     Young persons find jobs in large part through friends and relatives

or through direct application to employers or possibly a combination of

the two. Youths who were working in October 1973 were asked which of

several possible methods they had used during 1972 and 1973 in looking

for and obtaining jobs. The alternative methods presented to the

respondents together with the percent that used each method and the

percent of those who used the method that obtained a job by that method

are shown in Table 4. The alternative methods are not mutually exclu-

sive so a given individual could have responded in the affirmative with

respect to more than one alternative.

     Close to 70 percent of all of the groups said that they made direct

application to employers and among those who did, 80 percent or more

used it successfully to find a job. About 60 percent used friends and

relatives and among those who used this method, 80 percent or so did

so successfully. Other methods were used much less often and in general

with less success.

     Public and private employment agencies and school employment

serviced were used about twice as frequently by non-white men as by

white men.

      Unions are a conduit to employment for only a small percent of

 either;    but among those who register with a union, white young men are
 considerably more likely than non-white youth to obtain a job through
 a union.

D.   Labor Force Status of Persons Not in School

        Only a small proportion of young men not in school were looking

for work. The unemployment ratios implied by this survey are much

lower than the official government unemployment rates based on Current

Population Survey data)

     While the percent of youth not in school rose very substantially

between October 1972 and October 1976, the percent of out-of-school youth

who were working full-time increased significantly, and the percent of

out-of-school youth who were working part-time or who were out of the labor

force fell dramatically (Table 5.) The percent of non-white men looking

for work declined substantially, while the percent of white men looking for

work increased slightly.

     The percents of both white and non-white men working part-time

fell by 1976 to less than half their 1972 levels, as did the percents

out of the labor force. Although the percents of non-white youth in

these   categories were in general a bit higher than the percents of
white youth, the differences were not large, especially by 1976.2 In
October 1972, the percent of non-white youth looking for work was about
twice as high as the percent of white youth in this category, but by

1976 the percents of the two groups were quite close--5.7 percent for

whites and 6.9 percent for non-whites.

        These numbers suggest a rather consistent progression from school

to work, but on average non-white youth get full-time jobs less quickly

than white youth. After four years, however, the differences between

white and non-white youth by these measures are not for the most part

striking. By October 1976, a little over four years after high school

                                                    between the CPS and the
Wise [1979]. A detailed examination of differences
National Longitudinal Survey (Parnes) is contained in Freeman [1979].

     2. From Appendix Tables 1 through 5, it can be seen that this was
true for the last 2 or 3 October periods for which data are available.

graduation, only 5.7 and 6.9 percent respectively of   white    and non-white

young men who were not in school were looking for work. As we concluded

in our earlier paper, youth unemployment does not appear from these data

to be a severe problem for this group of high school graduates, neither

whites nor non-whites.


E. Labor Force Status of Men in School

     A large proportion of persons who are in school are also working

part-time and a significant number are working full-time. As shown in

Table 6, over 25 percent of youth in four-year schools work part-time,

as of October 1972, while in 1976 almost half of white youth in four-year

schools and a third of non-white youth were working part-time. The percent

of youth in two-year and in vocational and technical schools who worked in

 1972 was generally higher than the percent in four-year schools, ranging as

high as 45 percent for white men in two year schools. By 1976, however,

among white men the percent working part-time was larger for those in four-

year schools than for those in two-year and vocational schools. Many men

who are full—time students in two-year and in vocational and technical

schools also have full-time jobs--for example, 24 percent of white men and

27 percent of non-white men in voc-tech schools in 1972 and even larger
                                    —17—




percents in 1976. Thus for many youths, and in particular those in voc-

tech schools and to a lesser extent those in two-year colleges, school

and work are joint activities.

      Many students are also looking for work, with the percent of non-

whites that is looking considerably higher in most instances than the

percent of whites that are looking for work. This is in contrast to

the quite similar percents of white and non—white youth not in school

who were looking for work. Also, the percent of two-year college

students and voc—tech students that is looking for work is in general

substantially higher than the percent of four-year college students.

In neither 1972 nor 1976 were more than a third of vocational-technical

and two-year college students out of the labor force. Among four-year

college students, approximately 60 percent were out of the labor force

in 1972, but of those in school in 1976 only 40 percent were out of the

labor force. That many students who had been in school for four or five

years had not obtained a degree is likely to be associated with working

while in school.

      These labor force participation statistics are consistent with the

supposition that two-year college and voc-tech programs are more commen-

surate with work that persons in these programs obtain than four-year

college programs are with work that persons in these programs want to

or are able to obtain.



F.   Labor Force Statistics for Men Not in School and for Full-Time
     Students

     A sizeable proportion of persons in school would be classified as

unemployed based on official definitions. Indeed the unemployment rate

among full-time students is generally more than twice the rate among

young men not in school. Unemployment rates by school status, together

with labor force participation rates and the percent of the population

employed,    are shown in Table 7.
       While in 1972 for example, only 5.3 percent of out-of-school white
youth were unemployed, 12.3, 10.9, and 12.2 percent respectively of men
in   vocational-technical, two-year, and four-year schools were unemployed.

In 1976, only 8.1 percent of non-white out-of-school young men were

unemployed, whereas 28.6 percent of those in         vocational-technical schools
                                    -19-




were unemployed, 25.8 percent of two-year students, and 16.7 percent of

four-year college students.

     At least two-thirds of persons in vocational-technical and two-year

schools are also in the labor force. From 36 to 60 percent of four-year

students are in the labor force.

     According to this survey, 7.7 percent of all white male youth were

unemployed in October 1972, while only 1.9 percent were both not in school

and looking for work. Only 39.1 percent of those looking for work in 1972

were not in school. Among all non-white youth 16.2 percent were unemployed

in 1972, while only 5.7 percent were both not in school and looking for

work; and only 49 percent of those looking for work were not in school.

Apparently many youth search for work while in school--either for current

employment or for employment upon leaving school.   It is also likely that

some youth are in school because they were unable to find desired employ-

ment while not in school; they may have been unemployed when they entered

school. By 1976, although the unemployment rate among persons in school

was considerably higher than among those in school in 1972, because fewer

youth were in school about 65 percent of unemployment was accounted for by

persons out of school.

     Are there chronically unemployed or out of work youth among these

high school graduates? According to the figures in Table 8, not many.

This table gives the percent of young men without work and the percent

unemployed for each possible number of the five October periods for

which data were available. Although consistent with the data above, non-

white youth are without work more than white youth, there are few chroni-

cally unemployed among either group. For example, 80 percent of non-white

and 89 percent of white youth were out of school and unemployed in none of

classified in only one of the five periods. Somewhat more youth in both

groups were not in school and not working, but very few were often in

this position.

G. Unemployed Versus Out of the Labor Force

     In considering the possibility that some persons could be chronically

without work, even though the average unemployment rate is rather low, we

considered both the unemployed and those unemployed together with those

out of the labor force. The latter classification suggests by implica-

tion that in their desire for work the unemployed may not be unlike those out

of the labor force. But evidence from this survey tends not to favor

this possibility. Persons who are not looking for work--and would thus

be classified as out of the labor force, according to standard definitions--

are apparently quite distinct from persons who are looking for work. Those

out of the labor force seem not to be 'discouraged workers' for the most part.

     It is sometimes argued that to measure the extent of youth

unemployment in particular, the distinction between unemployment and

being out of the labor force is not a meaningful one. Indeed, it is

sometimes suggested that all youth who are not employed should be

thought of as unemployed, largely because it is argued that they would

like to work but are so discouraged about the prospects for finding

work that they donotlook for jobs.

     In several October periods young persons in the survey who were

not employed were asked why they were not working. The form of the

question allowed the respondents to indicate which of several possible

reasons for not working applied to them. Although there were many

possibilities and although respondents could answer affirmatively to

several possibilities, thus complicating interpretation of the

responses, the answers to at least three of the questions seemed clearly

to distinguish those out of the labor force from those unemployed.
                                  -22-




    Presented to the respondents as one of the alternative reasons for

not being employed was that there were "not enough jobs."   The percent

of the unemployed and the percent of those out of the labor force who

indicated that this reason applied to them are shown in Table 8A for

two October periods, by school status. It seems clear from the table

that persons who are not looking for work do not say that a shortage of

jobs is a reason for not working nearly as often as persons who are looking

for work. The results seem to us to be inconsistent with the possibility

that a large proportion of youth who are out of the labor force are discour-

aged workers; on the contrary, these responses suggest that at most only a

small proportion could possibly be considered as though they wanted to work

but had given up searching.

      Most persons who were out of the labor force also did not give as a

reason that they had 'no career opportunities." The percents that said

that this reason applied to them are shown in Table 8B. Again, only a

small proportion of persons out of the labor force gave this as a reason

for not working, although the proportions for each group except one were

higher in 1976 than in 1972. In general, the percent of the unemployed

who gave this as a reason was two to three times as high as the percent

of those who were out of the labor force.

     Finally, in Table 8C are shown the percents of those not working

who gave as a reason that they did not have the required experience.

This reason also applied to a small percent of those out of the labor

force, but to a much larger proportion of the unemployed. In short,

these responses suggest that unemployed youth are quite distinct from

those out of the labor force and that this latter group is not composed

in substantial part of discouraged job seekers.



H. Wage Rates, Weekly Earnings and Hours, Annual Employment and
    Unemployment, and Number of Employers

     The hourly wage rates of white and non-white high school graduates

are very close. If anything, non-whites tend to earn a bit more per

hour than whites. This is true in particular for young men who are in

school. But because non-white males who are out of school work some-

what fewer hours per week on average than white males, their weekly

earnings are somewhat less than weekly earnings of out—of-school white

young men. Average hourly wage rates, weekly earnings, and weekly hours

worked for persons not in school and for those in school are shown in

Table 9. They cover all persons in the sample who were working in the

first full week of October of the year indicated. Persons working full-

time or part-time are included.

     Wage rates for white and non-white young men out of school are

virtually identical right after graduation. After four years, whites

earn about 6 percent more per hour than non-whites, presumably due in

part at least to the different schooling patterns of the two groups

and to post-high school work experience. Non-whites also work about 2

hours per week less than whites in each of the time periods and thus

have lower weekly earnings--about 8 percent in the first year and 11

percent after four years. On the other hand, non-white men who are in

school work 1.5 to 3 hours per week more than whites, earn somewhat

more per hour in all but the 1676 period, and have higher weekly earnings

in each of the periods——between 5 and 19 percent depending on the period.

Among men out of school, non-whites work fewer weeks per year than

whites, but the difference declines continuously over the four-year

period. Non-whites work 13 percent less in the first year and 5 percent

in the fourth. The differences are accounted for by both weeks looking

for work and weeks out of the labor force. Differences among white and

non-white men who are in school are somewhat less in gcneral, although
                                     -27-


as among persons not in school non-whites who are in school spend niore

weeks than whites looking for work.


I.   Does Early Experience Persist?

        There is only a weak relationship between weeks worked in the first

year    or two after graduation from high school and weeks worked two or
three years later, but as young persons grow older there is increasing
consistency    between weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in the

next.

        To describe the observed relationship between weeks worked in the

first four years after graduation from high school, we have constructed

a series of transition matrices. For each year we classified weeks

worked    into four intervals: 0 to 20, 21 to 40, 41 to 51, and 52. For
each pair of years we calculated the transition probabilities of moving
from an interval in the earlier year    to each of the intervals in the

second year. They are presented in Table hA for       white youth and in

Table 118 for non-white youth with the entries shown as percents. For
example, the matrix headed "1974-75" in the middle of Table hA says that

71   percent of the young men who worked 52 weeks   in 1974   also worked 52

weeks in 1975; 4    percent worked between 0   and 20 weeks. The numbers

below and to the left of each matrix are marginal proportions (percents).
In 1974, for example, according to Table llA, 50 percent of young white

men worked 52 weeks. All entries have been rounded to the nearest percent.

        The tables can also be used to calculate for each pair or years

the joint probability of each of the interval combinations. For example,

the matrix headed "1973-76" in the lower left of Table hA says that 1.3

percent of the 2235 white men who were not in school in both 1973 and 1976

worked less than 20 weeks in each of those years (13 percent of 10 percent).

Some persistence over time is due to measured attributes of individuals

that are similar from one period to the next. Therefore the persistence

that is observed cannot be attributed to a causal relationship between

the number of weeks worked in one year and weeks worked in subsequent

years. More detailed analysis revealed little effect of early weeks worked

on weeks worked three or four years later (see Meyer and Wise [1979]))

     The transition matrices reveal several phenomena. We will direct our

remarks first to the results for white men (Table ilA) and then discuss

only briefly particular aspects of the results for non-white young men.

The upper bound on weeks worked is reflected in the large probabilities

of remaining in the 52-week "interval" from one period to the next, much

larger than for any other interval. This is apparently because many persons

who work 52 weeks are indeed constrained by this limit. Any who "would

work" 52 weeks or more are observed to remain at the limit. Even persons

observed to work 52 weeks in one year may still be at 52 weeks in

the second even if their "propensity" to work declined between the two

time periods. From the diagonal matrices it can be seen that those who

remain at the limit for consecutive years increases from the 64 percent be-

tween the first and the second, to 71 percent between the second and the

third, to 82 percent between the third and the fourth.

     Persistence in general increases over time, as can be seen from a

comparison of the diagonal elements of the three diagonal matrices. For

example, only 12 percent of persons who are in the lowest interval in the



     1. Comparable conclusions were reached by Ellwood [1979], based on a
different data set.
                                          -31-



first year are also in that interval in the second. But 28 percent who

are in this interval in the second are also there in the third, and 49

percent who are in this interval in the third year are also there in the

fourth.

     Apparently     individual patterns   become increasingly established.

This finding suggests that our ability to identify from experience

immediately after high school those persons who will be without work

for long periods in subsequent years is quite limited, but that after

a few years, experience in one year becomes a much better predictor of

subsequent experience.

     While experience in the fourth year seems strongly related to

that in   the   third, the relationship between experience in the last

year and earlier years declines rapidly with increasingly distant time

periods. This pattern can be seen best by looking at the last row of

matrices that compares experience in each of the first three years with

experience in 1976. Of persons in the four intervals in 1975; 49, 11,

4, and 2 percent respectively are in the lowest interval in 1976. Of

persons in the four intervals in 1973, the corresponding percents are

13, 14, 4, and 4. Whereas the likelihood that a person who was in the

lowest interval in 1975 was also there in 1976 was 25 times as high as

if he worked 52 weeks in 1975; if he were in the lowest interval in

1973, the likelihood of being in the lowest interval in 1976 was only

about   3 times as high as if he had worked 52 weeks in 1973.
     We conclude that whatever the determinants of weeks worked, they
do not for the most part persist over these four years. Recall that
a small part of the relationship seen in the transition matrices is
                                     -32-


due to measured individual attributes. They are not distinguished in

the   matrices from unmeasured individual attributes (individual specific
terms) commonly referred to as representing heterogeneity. Both
measured and unmeasured individual specific characteristics produce

some   persistence over time. The remainder of the relationship over
time   may be due to a true state dependence effect or to serial corre-

lation induced by correlation over time of other factors that affect

weeks worked. Whatever the reason, however, there seems to be very

little room for a causal effect of labor force experience in the first

year of experience on the last. Any effect there may be dies out

rapidly.

       As youngsters age, their patterns of labor force experience become

increasingly stable, as we might expect to find among persons moving

from full-time school to full-time work, a process that is likely to

involve considerable searching, job changing, and the like before

settling into more or less permanent employment)

       Transition matrices for non-white males (Table 118) reveal a pattern

that is in major outline like the pattern for all young men. Detailed

comparison of the two tables seems to show, however, that persistence

from earlier to later years may on average be a bit greater for non-whites

than for whites, although the differences between the two groups are not

striking. As judged by a comparison of the diagonal elements of the

1975-76 matrices in the two tables, young non-white men have by these



     1.  Relationships like those described in this section hold as well
for persons who were in the labor force in each of the periods, who had
no post-high school training.

last two years apparently established somewhat more consistent work patterns

than white youth. In particular, while 49 percent of the 7 percent of white

male youth who worked less than 20 weeks in 1975 also worked less than 20

weeks in 1976, 63 percent of the 13 percent of non-white youth in this

category were also in the category in 1976.

II. Weeks Worked Móe1

    We will estimate jointly a non-school attendance equation together

with a weeks worked equation for students and a weeks worked equation for nczl-
                                                                 October 1972 and
students for two separate year-long periods--the first between

October 1973 and the secord between October 1974 and October 1975. Esti-

mates will be obtained separately for whites and non-whites.

    The school attendance and weeks worked equations are estimated jointly

for two reasons. One is that it is informative in talking about the

transition from school to work to have in mind the determinants of early

work versus school decisions, even when concentrating on the determinants

of weeks worked. In particular we are able to compare the effects of

individual attributes on schooling decisions of whites with the effects

for non-whites. A second reason is that to obtain consistent estimates

of the relationship between individual attributes and weeks worked we must

account for the relationship between unmeasured determinants of weeks

worked and unmeasured determinants of school attendance--that is, of being

 in the sample to which the weeks worked equation pertains, whether it be

 for students or non-students. We have corrected for "sample selection

 bias," which we shall see is substantial.

To account for the downward bias that this limit places on parameter esti-

mates in the weeks worked equation, we have used a "double"-Tobit specifi-

cation of weeks worked. Thus the model estimates jointly a Tobit weeks

worked equation together with a probit specification of non-school atten-

dance. The precise specification can be described briefly.

    Suppose that observed weeks worked for persons not in school is

denoted by small y. and the unobserved Hpropensityhl to work is denoted

capital Y. Suppose also that S. is an unobserved latent non-schooling

variable with an associated indicator variable s. that takes the value

1 if individual i is not in school and zero otherwise. Then we have

of   the expected value of observed weeks worked is given by

probability that Y is not truncated (i.e. 0 <   Y <   52).   At X = 26, this

derivative is at its maximum and is given by .76.1 It is important te dis-

tinguish the effect of a chance in an X on the expected value of y from the

effect of a change in X on y. The effect on hours worked in           as long as y

is not at or pushed to zero or 52. At these extremes, the effect on y is

zero.    It is the mixture of the effects of size     and 0 that produce the curved

graph of E(yX) in Figure 1.

     The variables used in the analysis are defined below.2




        1. Assuming that c = 22, the maximum is always at 26 but the multiple
of       depends on  and thus varies in our equation reported below.

     2. To facilitate comparison, the model is the same one that we used
in our earlier paper to describe weeks worked with the exception that in
that paper we allowed only for the weeks worked limit of 52, while in this
paper we have also incorporated explicitly the floor of zero. In the earlier
paper an insignificant number of individuals worked zero weeks. Explicit
allowance for the zero floor would have had little effect on the results.
We also estimated wage rates in that paper, but will not do so here. We
will find that the experiences of whites and non-whites are very similar
with respect to weeks worked and believe the same would be found for wage
rates. Thus we believe that the results in our earlier paper should serve
as good estimates for both groups. In addition, because the sample of non-
white youth with wage rates is small, we have found it difficult to obtain
precise estimates for that group, although preliminary analysis reveals
similar parameter estimates for whites and non-whites.

         nurse's aid)," zero otherwise.

    Hours Worked During High School: Response to the question, "On

         the average over the school year, how many hours per week

         do you work in a paid or unpaid job? (Exclude vacation.)"

         The response was by interval: 0, 1-10, 11-20, and 21 or more.

III. Results

     The parameter estimates are presented in Table 13, which for convenience

has been divided into three parts. The non-school attendance estimates are in

Table 13A.     The parameter estimates in the weeks worked equation are

presented in Tables 13B and 13C, for non-students and students, respectively.

The estimates of p, , and the likelihood values and sample sizes are shown

in Tables 13B and l3C. We shall briefly discuss first the implications of

the non-school attendance parameter estimates. Then we shall discuss the

relationships between school attendance and weeks worked. And finally we

shall consider the weeks worked parameter estimates, first for non-students

and then for students. Throughout, we shall emphasize comparison of the

results for whites and non—whites.


A. School Attendance of Whites and Non-Whites

     Persons have been classified as not in school if in the October begin-

ning the period they were not attending school. We shall discuss the

results only for the October 1972-October 1973 period; those for the later

period are similar. Because the quantitative importance of the variables

is not apparent from the estimates in Tablel3B, we will present simulations

based on these estimates.

     First consider the probability of school attendance in either 1972 or

1973 for whites and non-whites, evaluated at mean parameter values. For

whites we have evaluated the probability at the means of the right-hand

variables among whites, as well as the means among non-whites. The results

are presented in the tabulation below.

    Although white young men are more likely to be in school than non-

whites, it can be seen from the tabulation that given individual academic

and socioeconomic attributes, non-whites are considerably more likely than

whites to attend a post—secondary school) Given the mean X for either

blacks or whites, the difference between the estimates for whites and non-

whites reflects a race effect. For either race, the difference between

the estimates based on the mean for whites and the mean for non-whites

reflects the effect of differences in measured attributes of the two groups.

     We have also evaluated for each group the partial relationship between

attendance and individual attributes, by calculating the difference in

attendance probabilities for selected values of specified variables, with

other variables held at their sample means.2 They are shown below.




     1. Venti and Wise [1980a, 1980b], find that this Is true also when
only four-year colleges and universities are considered

     2.  For both whites and non-whites the representative (mean) individual
was chosen so that the probability of attending school was 0.60,

        The estimates for whites and non-whites are quite

 exceptions. Family income is unrelated to the attendance of non-whites,
                                             of whites. Also, relative to the

                                               of non-white students is less than
 the academic preparation of classmates

 the preparation of classmates of whites; thus a giver class rank represents
 lower academic achievement in the schools attended by non -bites.

B. Weeks Worked Equations

    Recall that the parameter estimates in Table 13B indicate the effect of

associated variables on weeks worked Y, except if Y is 0 or 52. Then the

effect is zero. To obtain estimates for a random person in the sample,

some of whom could be working 52 or 0 weeks, evaluated at the mean X over

the total sample, either for persons in school or for persons out of school,

the estimated coefficients must be multiplied by the relevant adjustment

factor. They are as follows:
                                                  White         Non—White
                                          1972-73 1974-75    1972-73 1974-75
     To obtain effect at mean of X         .314       .280    .351     .424
     for all persons in the sample


We shall present results based only on the estimated parameters. These in-

dicate the effect of the variables as long as neither limit is reached. If

you were to want the expected effect for a person selected at random, not

knowing whether the person were at a limit, the estimated values should be

multiplied by the adjustment factors.

     The estimated relationship between hours worked in high school and

weeks worked upon graduation and entry into the labor force is very substan-

tial for both whites and non-whites and the estimated parameters for the

two groups are very similar. The relevant estimated parameters are presented

in the tabulation below.

     There appear to be no appreciable and consistent differences among the

estimates for whites and non-whites. It can be seen from the tabulation

that the relationship between hours worked in high school and weeks worked

in the labor force could be very substantial .        For example, among non-

students, those who worked over 20 hours per week in high school are esti-

mated to work on the order of 10 weeks more per year than those who did

work at all in high school

     Evaluated at the mean X and using the appropriate adjustment factor,

twenty or more hours of work in high school for an individual selected at

random from the population is estimated to be associated with about 4 more

weeks of work after graduation than the estimate for a person who did

work in high school. In none of these cases do the estimates for whites

differ in general from those for non—whites.

     The relationship between work while in high school and subsequent

employment is if anything even more striking for students than for non-

students.
                                      -53-


      Whether these relationships reflect individual specific characteris-
tics that affect both work in high school as well as work after graduation,
or   whether work in high school itself contributes to later employment

possibilities is open to question. We have discussed this at some length

in our earlier paper and will not repeat the discussion here. We observe,

however, that the strong relationship between working while in high school

and working while in a post-secondary school suggests to us the effect of

individual specific attributes of youth that play a role in determining

work in both situations.

       Both class rank in high school and the test scores are substantially

related to weeks worked for non-students. The standard deviation of class

rank is about 25 and of the test scores is about 1. The estimated effect

on weeks worked of standard deviation changes in high school class rank

and test scores are shown below.

                           1972-73          1974-75   1972-73     1974-75

       Among youth in both groups, by these measures, the effect of test

scores is much greater than the effect of class rank. This is true in

particular for non-whites although in general the differences between whites

and non-whites are not great. Evaluated at the mean of X for the total

sample, a standard deviation increase in test scores for a white youth

selected at random is associated with an increase in weeks worked of 4.2

and 2.6 respectively in 1972—73 and 1974-75. For a non-white the increases
                                               difference between whites and
are 5.4 and 5.2 respectively. The relative

non-whites may result from differences in the qualities of the high
                                                                   class rank
schools attended by the two groups. Relative to test scores,

may be a poorer indicator of ability in lower quality than in higher quality

high schools. The effects of high school class rank and test scores on weeks

 for non-student non—whites in 1972-73 and student whites in 1974-75. The

 estimated effect for non-whites is larger than for whites in each comparison

 except students in 1974-75. Marginal effects are as follows:

                                               that for non-student non-white
      These numbers suggest the possibility
                                      school may have had some effect on
 youth, vocational training in high
                                                                in this
  employment after graduation, at least in the first year. Even
                                                          the estimated
  year, however, these estimates appear small relative to
                                         —55—




relationships   between test scores and weeks worked or between hours worked

in high school and weeks worked upon graduation. We are hesitant to make

too much of a single statistically significant coefficient because in our

earlier work although in general we found no effect of vocational training

in high school, we found a statistically significant estimate for one year.

It happened, however, to be for the 1975-76 October to October period.

Here we find that for neither whites nor non-whites is the estimate signif-

icant for the 1974-75 annual period. The results for students are also

ambiguous, as is the relationship between the effects for students versus

non-students.

       Finally, we find that parents' income bears a statistically significant

and substantial relationship to weeks worked by non-students, especially for

non-whites. The estimated effects of a standard deviation increase in

parents' income (more accurately 5.5 thousand which is approximately one

standard deviation) are as follows:


        Estimated Effect of a Standard Deviation Increase in Income

                   White                                  Non-White

           1972—73         1974-75                   1972-73     1974-75

                                     Non- Students

             1.6             1.9                       3.4            4.5

                                       Students

            -2.2                                       1.9


A possible explanation for the differences between whites and non-whites

is   that the relationship between income and weeks worked is non—linear

with   the largest marginal effects for youth from low income families. The

mean value of parents' income for non-whites is much lower than the mean
                                       -56-




for whites. In general, family income may be related to weeks worked because

as shown above a large proportion of youth find jobs through family contacts.

Those from higher income families may have better contacts.      The income

effects for students are not statistically different from zero in 1974-75.

For the 1972-73 period the estimated effect is negative for whites and

positive for non-whites.

     Finally, students in vocational and junior college work considerably
                                                          whites, as shown
more than those in four-year colleges, especially among

in the following tabulation:


                         Estimate Vocational School and Junior College Effects

                                  Whites                   Non-Whites

                             1972—73      1974-75      1972-73     1974-75

                               11.7           15.9        7.9           6.3

                                9.6           10.3        6.4           2.6
     Junior College


These results appear plausible since both junior college and vocational

school programs are more likely than four-year programs to be closely

related to particular jobs. The courses of study in these schools may also

be academically less time consuming.

IV.   Summary

      Our intent has been to distinguish possible differences in the deter-

minants of school attendance and labor force experience of white and non-

white high school graduates. The paper parallels in many respects our

earlier work on high school preparation and early labor force experiences.

Among these high school graduates, we find no striking differences between

the determinants of the work experience of the two groups, nor of their

school attendance, although after controlling for measured attributes

non-whites are much more likely than whites to attend a post-secondary

school.
