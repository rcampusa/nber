1.   Introduction

     Recent models of systematic bank runs [Diamond and Dybvig (1982), Waldo

(1985)] have been set in the context of a closed economy. The important

banking collapses of the previous century and of the first third of this

century, however, occurred in an environment marked by financial openness and

by the operation of a gold standard. Foreign holders of liquid gold reserves

could therefore ship them to a country emperiencing a banking panic and

benefit from an opportunity to acquire assets cheaply, provided that they were

themselves confident that the panic would not spread to their own banking

system.

     In this paper, we extend the bank run literature to an open economy

model. We show that a foreign banking system, by raising deposit rates in the

presence of a domestic banking panic, may generate sufficient liquid resources

to acquire assets sold by the domestic banking system at bargain prices. In

this case, foreign depositors will benefit from the domestic panic. Another

important reason for studying bank runs in an open economy framework, is that

financial crises and panics are frequently international phenomena: "...

financial   crises tend to be international, either running parallel from

country to country or spreading by one means or another from the centers where

they originate to other countries" (Kindleberger (1978) p. 118). We will show

that our simple model is able to generate the spreading of panics. Perhaps

not surprisingly, the crucial element in determining the propagation of

financial crises is the effect of interest rates on savings decisions.

     We divide the paper into three sections. In section 1, we present a

two-country   banking model   and examine its equilibrium in the absence of bank

runs. In section 2 we study the international equilibrium that would arise

with a bank run in the domestic country.      Section   3 contains conclusions.
                                                                        3




1. The Model and its No-Run Equilibrium



     In this section, we describe a simple three—period economy with financial

intermediaries in many ways similar to previous models, especially that of

Waldo (1985). Whereas previous analyses of bank runs were confined to closed

economies, we examine a two-country setting.

     The domestic economy is comprised of an infinite number of identical

individuals who live for three periods and have preferences given by:

     IJ(c1) +   tJ(c2),   O<flcl.

People consume only in periods one and two. In period zero, they receive an

endowment E ,
            0
                 identical   for all individuals.

     In   the economy, three different ways exist to transfer wealth over time:

storage with no depreciation, short term (one—period) investment with a payoff

r1, and long term (two—period) investment with payoff r2. The payoffs are

parametric. We will assume that r2 >                Individuals do not have direct
                                           r12.
access to investment technology. Because of indivisibilities (not modelled)

in the size of investment projects, they must pool their resources to invest

in a short or long term project. Such a pooling institution could be either a

bank or a mutual fund.

     Previous papers, i.e. Diamond-Dybvig (1983) and Waldo (1985), assume the

presence of unobservable, idiosynchratic shocks which generate liquidity needs

in the first period to justify the existence of banks which provide demand

deposit arrangements. The addition of this assumption would not change our

conclusions in any important way. Since the focus of the paper lies in

another direction, we simplify the analysis by ignoring this kind of shock.

We assume directly that banks providing demand deposits prevail in the
                                                                   4




society. We allow the presence of a securities market, but only for large

players as in Waldo.'

        We assume that the foreign country is a mirror image of the domestic

country: it has identical preferences, technology, endowments, and financial

institutions. Any equilibrium with no bank runs will be characterized by the

absence of trade between the two        countries.
        The budget constraints for the representative agent in the domestic

economy are given by:2



Periodl: Eo —s 0 +DD0 +FD0
                             *
Period2:o S +iDW+iFWS
            1    1    1
                        +DD1 +FD1 +C1
                                    *                 *
Period 3:         + i2(DD —DW) + i2(FD —FW) ÷ i1DD1 ÷ i1FO1 — C2



where:



E   —    period   zero endowment.

S   — storage from period zero to period one

    — storage from period one to period two

DD — deposits       in domestic banks at period j

FO. —    deposits   in foreign banks at period j

OW — withdrawals from domestic deposits in period one
FW — withdrawals from foreign deposits in period 1



   Diamond and Dybvig implicitly assume the absence of securities markets in
the presence of the sorts of contracts offered by their banks.

2 Budget constraints for foreign individuals are identical. Simply add an
asterisk (*) to represent foreign variables and parameters.
                                                                        S




      —    consumption          in period j
      — payoff     on one unit of demand deposits held for one period
i1
i2 — payoff on demand deposits held for two periods.


          Competition smong banks assures that i1—r1 and i2—r2.3

Moreover, since foreign banks have access to the same linear technology,

              and i242*. This model will have a multiplicity of equilibria due to

the indeterminacy of the division between domestic and foreign investment

arising from the identical, constant return technology. We resolve this

indeterminacy by assuming that, given identical returns, individuals will

choose deposits in banks in their own countries.

          The maximization problem therefore simplifies to



max IJ(C1) +
                  flU(C2)
s.t. E
          0
                S0 +   DD
                            0                 (A 0 )


          S+r1DWS1+DD1+C1                              (A1)

              + r2(DD — DW) +         r1DD1                   (A2)



     is   the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to period j budget constraint.

The first order conditions for this problem are:




C1 : u'(C1) — A1

     : flU'(C2) —
C2                     A2




   Alternatively, we could assume that there is a single bank aiming to
maximize consumer welfare.

DO2 : DD1(A1 — r1A2]



In equilibrium, 5, l' and DO1 will be zero, since these investments are

dominated by DO0 and (DO0 — DW).                                  Formally, in addition, we must consider the

bank solvency constraints:



r1 SIo — 1         i       DW

r1SI1 +         r2LI              i2(DD                           DD1



where SI are the short term assets purchased by the bank at time j and LI0

are the long term assets purchased at time zero.

            The equilibrium is such that the bank will invest DW in short term

securities and (E —                           OW)    in long term securities. (Recall that DO — E0 in
                                  0                                                         0

Using these conditions, we find that

2. Equilibrium with Bank Runs



          This type of model can support equilibria with self—fulfilling panics,

i.e. bank runs                    that     are triggered by events exogenous to the model's

fundamentals. Also, fundamental insolvencies may generate bank runs.
                                                                 8




     After allocations have been decided in period 0 on the basis of

predicting no runs, depositors can self—generate a run in period one by

suddenly believing that other depositors will withdraw the entire amount in

their accounts from the bank.

     This kind of scenario is similar to one described by Waldo (1985) for a

closed economy. Waldo completes his model by assuming that agents in period 0

believe that the probability is    that such a panic will occur in period one.

This probability, however, is exogenous in Waldo's model, and we choose to

assume here that it equals zero. The operational difference is that, if S>0,

depositors will invest part of their endowments in storage to protect against

the possibility of not beating the run. Equilibrium deposits in period 0 will

change accordingly. Whether or not individuals use storage technology will

not affect the thrust of our argument. For simplicity, therefore, we assume

that the exogenous event that could trigger a bank run in period one is

completely unexpected as of period zero.

     The experiment that we will consider is that of a panic occuring only in

the home country; foreign banks are not subject to panic runs. When the panic

occurs in period one, agents will demand the immediate redemption of all their

deposits (DD). We will assume that domestic agents, after withdrawing their

deposits, will use storage technology (hoarding) to transfer goods to the

second period. Solvency of the domestic banks requires that the bank pay out

    r
 lo lo
r DD —    E .   Since the liquid assets of the banks only amount to r SIlo
banks must liquidate their long term securities LI. The only potential

buyers are banks in the foreign country.

     Foreign banks can acquire resources to purchase the securities by

inducing their depositors to consume and withdraw less in period one. The

foreign bank will offer its depositors a new contractual arrangement.
                                                                   9




 Individuals can still withdraw in period one and collect the payoff i1. The

 payoff on deposits not withdrawn in period one, however, is changed to i2.

 [The (') represents foreign bank payoffs in the presence of a panic in the

 domestic banking syscem.J The maximization problem of the foreign individual

as of period one will be:



max U(C1*) +
                  fl1J(C2*)
s.c.        —
                 r1DW*        (A1)
            —
                 i'(E*      —DW*)    (A2)



The first order conditions are:

                   —
                       A1

         flTJ'(C2*) — A2

DW* : i2'/r1 —




i2'    will be determined by the equilibrium condition:

            —          (E — Dli)
                 2r2
Consumption in the second period must equal the world output of the long—term

investment.



Self-Justification of Panics



       As is common in the bank panic literature, we can demonstrate that a bank

panic in the domestic country is self—justifying. Domestic banks are assumed

to pay out funds to their depositors on a first come —    first served   basis

until they exhaust their assets.
                                                                               10




         Proposition 1: If a run occurs, the banking system is insolvent.

         Proof: Note first that for the domestic banking system to be solvent, it

must be able to sell period two securities for at least r1LI0 which implies

that foreign consumption in period one should drop to r1(SI0—LI). In this

case, the rate of return that the foreign bank can pay on deposits not
                                           2rLI
withdrawn in period one is i2 —                    —         where we used the symmetry
                                            2LI0       r2,

                      LI:.
r1SI. In order to induce a reduction in period one consumption, it is

necessary that i2 >           r,   which implies that domestic banks will be unable to

receive r1LI0 in exchange for their long term securities. The domestic banks

are then bankrupt and the run is self—justifying. (Notice that i2 < r is not

a possibility, since in this case the foreign country would be made worse off

by purchasing securities from the domestic country).

         In this case the first order conditions for the foreign country are:



 *        *_a
C1 :C1 —A1

 *                        *    *
A2
         : i21(E —DW ) — C2



To derive the explicit solution for this problem we first take i2' as given.
                                                                                          11




The solution's form is then analogous to that of the previous case, with i2'

substituted for



DW —    (       (l..a)/aE          /[r   (l-a)/a +       bl/aL   ,(l-a)/a1


                             [rl+
                               ]

       The next step is to find the equilibrium i2. To do this, we uae the

equilibrium condition:

            —
                 2r2
                        (E — fly)         (2)

where QH        is   given by period zero decisions when no bank runs were expected,

i.e.

            —
                 [r'a              E] /    [r1a+fil'ar2
       Substituting (3) into (2) and equating the result to (I) yields an
                                                                         "].       (3)


expression in i2' as a function of r1, r2, a, and fi:




2r2t/[r1)/'a + al/a.                     ,(l-a)/a] —
                                                          i2i    °[r1
                                                                         )'a +


       'al/ar2
                     (l-a)/a




Solving this non—linear expression provides the equilibrium i2' which we can
                *   *       *
use to derive DW , C1, and C2.
       Assuming a — .5, this expression reduces to a second order equation,

whose positive root is:

       i2' —         (fl2r22+(r22[ (fl2r        +r )2+r )2+r2] )l/2) /       [r1+fl2r2]
                                                                                               —

         The amount paid by foreign banks for the domestic securities is given by

the difference between the levels of foreign, first period consumption with

and without bank runs:

The liquidity needs of the domestic bank were r1E —                     l.05E0.   The liquidity

derived from short term investment is .SE. The goods acquired as a result of

long term security liquidation amount to .12E. Therefore, the total

liquidated assets of .62E fall short of the claims against the banks. The

bank run         produces     the bankruptcy of the domestic banking system.

     The result of a bank run in the domestic country is a redistribution of

wealth from the domestic to the foreign country. As a result of the domestic

panic, the total utility of the representative foreign agent has increased to

with no run in the domestic banking system.

     Finally, this simple model predicts that, at the time of the bank run,

the domestic country will experience 'a deficit in the trade balance, financed

by exports of long—term assets. In the next period, it will have a surplus in

its trade balance and a fall in national product below the no—run level.

While domestic production will not change, the share owned by foreigners will

increase and that of the residents will decrease. Therefore, while GOP will

remain constant, GNP will fall. Also, the foreign country will experience an

increase in the interest rate.

The International Transmission of Panics



     In the event of a domestic bank run, we have assumed above that a

positive flow of goods will be forthcoming from the foreign country in

exchange for long term securities. The acquisition of long term securities,

however, will favorably change the intertemporal budget constraint facing the

typical resident of the foreign country. Under the circumstances of increased

wealth, foreign depositors may in fact choose to increase their period one

consumption beyond their previous plans. Since foreign banks lack sufficient

liquidity to meet the implied withdrawals, the apparently favorable

opportunity available to the foreign country can lead to a run on the foreign

betting system. In this section we consider the conditions under which this

case may arise.                    -


     Since all domestic long—term securities are sold to the foreign banking

system, the amount of period two goods available to the typical foreign

resident will double. To encourage foreign residents to give up claims on

some of the consumption that they had planned for period one, the foreign

banking system raises the yield on deposits between period one and period two

to i2'/r1 >
              r2/r.   In Figure 1, this change is diagrammed as a shift from

budget line 1 to budget line 2, as perceived by the typical household.

     Since the foreign banking system's holdings of long term bonds will

double, we know that in equilibrium, the typical household must choose a

consumption bundle along the horizontal line 2E5 (recall that c —     r2LI).
Thus, i2' will be determined as the slope of the line through (nC, 0) and

tangent to an indifference curve along the line 2&'B. If the substitution

effect of the budget shift dominates the income effect, that tangency will

occur to the left of the point E, and foreign residents will give up some of
                                                                 14




their previously planned consumption      — 4).   They will   withdraw less that

   from the banking system, leaving foreign banks free to trade their excess

liquidity abroad for domestic securities. This was the case described in the

previous example.

     If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, however, a

tangency will occur along a budget line like line 3 at a point to the right of

E. In this case, foreign households will try to consume more than is

available in period one. This implies that a budget line like line 3 cannot

be an equilibrium. Rather, perceiving that the banks are illiquid, the

typical foreign household would then run the foreign banks, forcing them also

to dump their securities and precluding any purchases of domestic bonds.

Thus, a run on the domestic banking system would be transmitted to the foreigr

system.
     To avoid this problem and yet benefit from the run on the domestic banks,

the foreign system could impose a withdrawal ceiling on its average depositor.

For example, a ceiling of QH   — C1 — e, where e is a small positive number,

would allow the foreign economy to consume at a point close to E, an

improvement in well—being for the typical depositor.4

     If restrictions on payments are not feasible, an alternative that will

prevent the run on foreign banks is to impose controls on capital exports.

Under an effective set of controls, foreign banks would not attempt to raise

liquid resources by raising the yield on deposits. Depositors would then not

attempt to withdraw funds to increase their period one consumption plans.




   Interest rate ceilings on deposits may also prevent the run on foreign
banks. This measure, however, will also require some form of rationing
mechanism to allocate the profits from the operation.

The Limitations of Deposit Insurance



     In this model, measures like deposit insurance may be ineffective in

preventing the geographical spreading of financial crises. To implement a

deposit insurance scheme, a government would have in the background a progrsm

to tax all withdrawals and asset holdings after a run to make good depositor

claims. Since it cannot tsx foreign holders of the dumped securities,

however, its promise to repay depositors may not be credible. Since they

cannot tax the securities, they must be able to tax the real activities on

which the securities are based. If the companies which issued the securities

are located domestically, then the tax authorites may credibly promise to

generate the necessary revenues. However, if enough companies are located

abroad, as would happen in a well diversified banking system, this scheme may

not be feasible.



3. Conclusions



     In this paper we study banking crises in a world economy. We show that a

country's welfare may be increased by the occurence of a financial crisis in

the rest of the world. Thus, it may be rewarded for playing the role of

lender of last resort.

     On the other hand, we also describe conditions under which bank runs

"spread" internationally, thus propagating the disruptive effect of financial

collapses.

     In a recent paper, Smith (1987) analyzes a different environment, which

also produces a geographical contagion of panics. His model is based on the
                                                               16




existence of "reserve banks" which, by holding interbank deposits, provide the

link through which withdrawals of deposits are transmitted in the system.

     In this paper, instead, we describe how the liquidation of long term

securities by the bank initially under stress, can be the triggering factor of

international panics.
