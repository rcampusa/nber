In the 1950’s and 1960’s, the unemployment rate in both Europe and the U.S. was below


five percent. During the 1970’s European and U.S. unemployment rates increased sharply


in response to the steep increase in oil prices. In the last two decades, however, unemploy-


ment rates diverged sharply: average European rates have remained high while American


rates have returned once again to prior levels. There are a variety of institutional factors


distinguishing Europe from the U.S., including strong unions, minimum wages, generous

unemployment benefits, and high employment protection, that might explain differences in


levels of unemployment. These institutional distinctions have been present throughout the


postwar era, however, and thus they cannot by themselves explain the differences in how


unemployment rates have changed.            This unexplained divergence between unemployment


rates has been termed the “European unemployment puzzle.”


       Recent research has focussed on explaining the puzzle by considering the interaction


between institutions and long-term changes in the economic environment, thought of as

“shocks” to the environment. Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998), for example, have argued that


a long-term rise in economic turbulence, manifested in greater skill loss for displaced workers,

raises unemployment by a greater amount when unemployment benefits are higher. Increased

turbulence could thus explain why Europe, with its more generous unemployment benefits,


would experience greater increases in unemployment. Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) present

empirical evidence relating the behavior of the unemployment rate in several European

countries and the U.S. to the slowdown in TFP growth and higher interest rates.            They


show that these factors lead to larger increases in unemployment where institutions are


less “employment-friendly,” as they are in Europe relative to the U.S..          Blanchard and

Wolfers find statistically significant influence of the following institutions: the level of the


replacement rate (the share of income replaced by unemployment benefits), the duration of


unemployment benefits, the amount of employment protection, the tax wedge (the difference


between the real labor cost of a worker to an employer and the real consumption wage of the


worker), the percentage of workers who belong to a union, and the extent to which unions


and employer organizations coordinate wage setting.


   Doubt has been expressed in the literature about the importance of some of these insti-


tutions. Nickell and Layard (1999, p. 3030), for example, argue that “time spent worrying

about strict labor market regulations, employment protection, and minimum wages is proba-


bly time largely wasted”. Similarly, Garibaldi (1998) shows that the level of firing restrictions


leaves steady state unemployment rates unaffected even though it has important (offsetting)

effects on job creation and job destruction. This paper starts, therefore, by considering the


interaction between the slowdown in TFP growth and increase in real interest rates (the

shocks) and the level of unemployment benefits. Furthermore, we analyze the interaction
               SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                             3



between changes in labor taxation (as a shock) and the initial tax rate (as an institution).2


       In this paper we assess the interactions between shocks and institutions using a job

matching model of equilibrium unemployment. Following Mortensen and Pissarides (1994),


job creation and destruction are both determined endogenously, with wages set via bilateral


bargaining within employment relationships.

       Comparing steady state equilibria, unemployment is shown to increase when either the

growth rate falls, the interest rate increases, or the tax rate on labor income increases.


Moreover, each of these factors leads to a larger rise in unemployment when the replacement


rate is greater or the initial tax rate is higher.           Thus, the model exhibits the interaction

effect found by Blanchard and Wolfers.                Slower growth and higher interest rates lead to


permanent effects on unemployment, since steady state equilibria are affected: as long as


growth remains slow or interest rates remain high, job creation and destruction decisions are


impacted in a manner that raises the equilibrium unemployment rate. This is contrary to

the view of Blanchard and Wolfers and several other economists that productivity growth


and interest rates should have only a transitory impact on unemployment and should not

                                                  3
affect the natural rate of unemployment.


       Whether the interactions between the institutions and the shocks to the growth, interest,


and tax rates are sufficient to quantitatively explain both the European and American un-


employment experiences depends crucially on the cross-sectional distribution of productivity

levels. The key view expressed in this paper is that high replacement rates and high tax

   2
       Daveri and Tabellini (2000) also consider the effect of tax rates on unemployment but, as discussed in
section 4.5, the focus of their explanation is quite different from ours.
   3
       Phelps (1968), Gordon (1997), and Blanchard (2000, p. 257) also claim that the natural rate is not
affected by productivity growth.
           SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                  4



rates increase the mass of jobs that are vulnerable to the type of shocks considered here.


Indeed, it is easy to construct numerical examples where this is the case. The numerical

examples suggest that the variability of outcomes at the relationship level, which may be

tied to factors such as government protection and geographic distance, may play a role in


accounting for the European unemployment puzzle. More broadly, our model has the feature

that small changes in the cross-sectional distribution can have important quantitative effects

on equilibrium outcomes. This stands in stark contrast to the recent body of work (e.g.,


Krusell and Smith (1998)) that has argued against the quantitative relevance of details of


cross sectional wealth and income distributions in stochastic growth models with partially

uninsurable idiosyncratic risk.


   In an extension of our model, we incorporate turbulence.        Following Ljungqvist and


Sargent (1998), turbulence is modelled as a positive probability that a high-skilled worker


looses his skills when he is displaced. In our model, a rise in turbulence typically reduces


the level of equilibrium unemployment, contrary to the result of Ljungqvist and Sargent.


As in Ljungqvist and Sargent, turbulence reduces the value of employment relationships


for displaced high-skilled workers, and thus lowers the rate at which new relationships are


formed.   The destruction rate is also affected in our model, however: greater turbulence

makes high-skilled workers more reluctant to leave their jobs, and job destruction falls.


On balance, the latter effect tends to dominate and unemployment declines. Although an


increase in turbulence cannot explain the increase in European unemployment rates in the

present setting, allowing for some degree of turbulence does serve to greatly improve the


model’s ability to match the unemployment evidence quantitatively.

   Section 2 documents the European unemployment puzzle, Section 3 lays out the model

and Section 4 reports results for parameterized versions of the model. Section 5 concludes.

In this section we document the time series behavior of variables related to the European


unemployment puzzle for five European countries (France, Germany, Spain, Italy and the


United Kingdom) and the United States. Standardized unemployment rates are plotted in

Figure 1. As documented by the figure, the unemployment rates in Europe and the U.S.


were low and fairly similar in the beginning of the postwar period. During the 1970’s, un-


employment rates rose both in Europe and the U.S.. After this, however, the unemployment


rate in the U.S. declined, while European unemployment remained high.       Accounting for

this difference, and, in particular, for the persistently high unemployment rates in Europe,


constitutes a puzzle.


   One possible explanation is that European institutions may have been less favorable for


employment.    More generous European unemployment benefits, for example, might lead


workers to be more selective in accepting new jobs, thus raising European unemployment

relative to that of the U.S.. Figure 2 plots OECD standardized replacement rates, indicating


that U.S. replacement rates are much lower on average than those in Europe. Note however


that European replacement rates were already high relative to U.S. levels at the beginning


of the postwar period, when unemployment rates were similar. Thus, the rise in European

unemployment cannot be explained by changes in European replacement rates.


   The numbers in the graph may seem low. The reason is that the OECD standardized


unemployment rate gives equal weight to the replacement rate in year 1 of an unemployment


spell, to the average replacement rate in years 2 and 3, and to the average replacement rate


for years 4 and 5. Using unequal weighting is unfortunate since the replacement rate during

the first year is clearly more important than that during years 4 and 5.     We, therefore,


also report in Table 1 the benefit replacement rate and the corresponding benefit duration

measure from Nickell and Layard (1999).


       Figure 3 plots the effective tax rate on labor income from Daveri and Tabellini (2000).

Just like replacement rates, labor tax rates cannot by themselves account for the dynamic

differences between European and U.S. unemployment because tax rates were already sub-


stantially higher in Europe in the 1960’s.4


       As Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) and Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) have stressed, the

differences between European and U.S. unemployment experiences might best be explained


by the interaction between institutions and shocks to the economies. Consider, for example,


the behavior of TFP growth and interest rates over the postwar period.                   Figure 4 docu-


ments a pronounced decline in TFP growth for all of the countries considered, coinciding


roughly with the increase in unemployment. Real interest rates are considered in Figure 5,

where increases over the postwar period may be observed for every country except Germany.


Unemployment responses to the growth slowdown and rise in interest rates appear to vary


based on institutional differences between countries. Blanchard and Wolfers, in particular,


provide evidence that where institutions are less employment-friendly, e.g., where replace-


ment rates are higher, unemployment rises by a greater amount in the face of slower growth


and higher real interest rates. In the remainder of this paper we assess the extent to which an

equilibrium job market matching model can rationalize these observed interactions between

   4
       Nickell and Layard (1999) point out that the labor market consequences of taxation depend on the sum
of payroll taxes, income taxes, and consumption taxes. In this paper, differences in the taxation of labor
income and unemployment benefits play a crucial role. This means that differences in payroll taxes and
differences in the progressivity of income taxes across countries are important. Nickell and Layard (1999)
show that average payroll taxes for the period from 1989 to 1994 were lower in the US than in all European
countries considered in this paper except the UK.

institutions and unemployment responses.

In this section we present the model. Sections 3.1 through 3.4 describe the version of the

model in which there is no growth and no turbulence. In Section 3.5 we show that adding


disembodied growth is equivalent to an adjustment of the discount factor in the model with


no growth. In Sections 3.6 we introduce turbulence.



3.1. Employment Relationships.                 Production takes place within employment relation-

ships consisting of one worker and one firm, who interact through discrete time until the


relationship is severed or the worker retires. A relationship produces output           z   per period.


When a relationship is first formed, the initial value of    z   is drawn from the distribution   ν (z ).

For a continuing relationship, the value of        z   may vary as a consequence of relationship-


specific productivity shocks that occur at the start of a period. We consider two kinds of


productivity shocks.

   (1) With probability   γS   there is a switch of the productivity level      z.   In this case,   z   is


drawn again from the distribution    ν (z ).   If no switch occurs, then the relationship maintains


the previous period value of   z.

   (2) With probability   ρx   the relationship experiences an exogenous breakup, where sev-


erance occurs automatically. Exogenous breakups reflect events that permanently destroy


the productivity of the relationship; e.g., market conditions may shift adversely. Alterna-

tively, exogenous breakups can capture changes in workers’ personal circumstances that lead


them to change jobs. Assume that exogenous separations cannot occur in the period that a

relationship is newly formed.

   After the current-period productivity parameter is determined, the worker and firm de-
              SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                            8



cide whether to continue or sever their relationship, and, if the relationship is continued,


they determine the worker’s wage payment. Wages are set according to Nash bargaining,

where   π   gives the worker’s bargaining weight, and the disagreement point is severance of the

relationship. In addition, workers are subject to shocks that induce retirement, occurring


at the end of a period. Let     ρr   denote the probability of retirement. If the worker and firm

agree to sever their relationship following a switch, or if exogenous separation occurs, then


they each enter a matching market in which new employment relationships are formed. A


retiring worker, in contrast, leaves the labor market and obtains a future value of zero.



3.2. Matching Market.            New employment relationships are formed on a matching mar-


ket. Each period, the number of newly formed relationships is         m(u, v),   where   u   and   v   give


the masses of unemployed workers and firms posting vacancies, respectively.              We assume


that   m(u, v)   is a homogeneous function of degree 1 and that the total masses of workers and

firms are fixed at unity. Because the mass of workers is equal to the mass of firms, the ratio


of the mass of unemployed to the mass of vacancies and, thus, the matching probability are


fixed. Each period, a proportion        ρr   of the workers leaves the market through retirement,


replaced by an identical number of new entrant workers that flow into the unemployment

pool. Further, established workers enter the unemployment pool when their employment


relationships are severed.


   While they are unemployed, workers receive unemployment benefits equal to                 b.   To sim-

plify the analysis, we assume that benefits are linked to average wages of all workers. Unem-


ployed workers thus obtain a per period benefit of      b = φp while unemployed, where p denotes

the mean wage payment of all workers. New entrant workers do not receive unemployment

benefits.

3.3. Zero Surplus Level.                    Newly-matched workers and firms choose to accept their


match and begin an employment relationship if their initial productivity draw                            z is sufficiently

high. Correspondingly, a worker and firm in an ongoing relationship choose to continue their

relationship following a switch if the new draw of                 z   is sufficiently high. We assume that the


worker and firm bargain efficiently over the terms of their relationship, and thus they make

acceptance and continuation decisions that maximize their joint surplus. Joint surplus is

defined as follows.        Let   z   denote the current value productivity parameter following any


productivity draw, and suppose the worker obtains unemployment benefit                               b   each period he


is in the worker matching pool. Then joint surplus is given by



                    s(z, b) = (1       − τ e (z)) z + g(z) − (1 − τ u (b))b − ww (b) − wf ,                           (1)



where     g (z ) denotes the future joint value from continuing the relationship, w w (b) denotes the

worker’s future value from entering the unemployment pool in the current period when he

receives an unemployment benefit of b,                wf   indicates the firm’s future value from entering the


vacancy pool in the current period,             τ e (x)   is the tax rate on income earned in the relationship


when income is equal to          x   and   τ u (x)   is the tax rate on unemployment benefits equal to                x.

     In equilibrium,   s(z, b)       is an increasing function of        z   (as long as   τ e (x)   does not increase


too sharply with     x),   and there exists a zero surplus level              z(b)   indicating the smallest value


of   z   at which accepting or continuing the relationship yields nonzero surplus to the worker

and firm. For values of          z   below   z (b),   the worker and firm will either reject a new match,


or they will destroy an existing match. The zero surplus level is defined by the following

condition:

                                                      s(z (b), b) = 0.                                                (2)

3.4. Equilibrium.              The equilibrium conditions, involving equilibrium values of             g (z)   and


w(b),    equilibrium wage payments, and steady state conditions for the matching market, are

given as follows. The future joint value from continuing a relationship is equal to 5

3.5. Growth and Interest Rates.                          We assume that output within a relationship is equal

          t
to (1 + ξ )   z   per period, where         ξ    is the growth rate. Output, thus, displays disembodied


deterministic technological growth. We also assume that households are risk neutral and


discount future earnings using the interest rate                   r.   The model outlined above is consistent

with the presence of growth, since the parameter                        β     can be reinterpreted to capture the


growth effect when        
                         ξ = 0.      In particular,      β = (1 + ξ )/(1 + r).

   This discount factor would also be appropriate under more general assumptions about


preferences. Suppose that households pool their labor and profit incomes at the end of each


period and choose aggregate consumption to maximize the discounted utility of a represen-

tative household using the composite discount factor                         δ = (1    − ρr )/(1 + ρ), which combines
the retirement parameter,         ρr ,    with the conventional discount factor, 1/(1 + ρ). Interest rates


are determined by the following equation:


                                                   (1 + r)δMt+1 = 1,                                            (12)


where   Mt+1      is the marginal rate of substitution between consumption this period and next


period.

   For example, when the utility function of the agent is given by

                                                   ∞

Note that using         δMt+1    to discount (1 + ξ )z is equivalent to using (1 + ξ )δMt+1 to discount


z.   The relationship between          ξ   and   Mt+1     depends crucially on assumptions about the utility


function. The asset-pricing literature has shown that standard assumptions about prefer-


ences cannot explain average real interest rates.6 A related problem of standard preferences


is that the predicted effect of            ξ   on   r   is inconsistent with the data.7              Note, however, that


irrespective of the particular specification for preferences, optimizing behavior pins down


the “growth-adjusted” discount factor at


                                                                      1+ξ
                                                 (1 + ξ )δMt+1 =                  .                                  (14)
                                                                      1+r


Instead of trying to solve the difficult question of how                      ξ   affects   Mt+1 ,   this equation suggest


that one may simply use observed growth and interest rates to infer the appropriate effective

discount factor. This is the approach followed in this paper.8

     6
         See, for example, Weil (1992).
     7
         For example, the CRRA preferences used above imply that a decrease in the growth rate should lower real
interest rates, while in Section 2 we documented that the observed decrease in TFP growth rates coincided
with an increase in real interest rates.
     8
         Taking the interest rate would be appropriate if one thinks of the matching model as a partial equilibrium
model. For example, the model can be viewed as being relevant for those sectors for which growth can be

3.6. Turbulence.          In this subsection we distinguish between low-skilled and high-skilled


workers. This allows us to analyze the turbulence effect of Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998).

They argue that the European unemployment puzzle can be explained by the interaction

between high replacement rates, on one hand, and an increase in the probability that an


unemployed skilled worker cannot find a job in which he can use his acquired skills, on the

other. Unemployed workers who had previously earned high wages, and are thus entitled

to high unemployment benefits, thus, become more likely to receive low wage offers. The


corresponding increase in the rejection rate of job offers would then lead to an increase


in the unemployment rate.        As in Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) we capture an increase

in turbulence by an increased probability that a high-skilled worker becomes a low-skilled


worker.


    It is interesting to analyze an increase in turbulence in our framework because it differs


in two important aspects from the framework of Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998). First, we


allow for endogenous wage setting between the worker and the employer, meaning that the


worker can bargain for a higher wage instead of simply having a choice between rejecting or


accepting the employer’s wage offer. Second, in contrast to Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998),


the breakup decision in our model is not exogenous, but is allowed to vary in response to

changes in the economic environment. The view that employees are likely to change their


behavior is clearly formulated by Alan Greenspan in the following quote: “             But the sense of
increasing skill obsolescence has also led to an apparent willingness on the part of employees
to forgo wage and benefit increases for increased job security. Thus, despite the incredible
characterized as disembodied. We are sympathetic to this view, since one could very well argue that growth
in some sectors is better described as embodied growth. We discuss embodied growth in more detail in
Section 4.5.

tightness of labor markets, increases in compensation per hour have continued to be relatively
modest.”        9


         The current-period skill level of a particular worker is denoted by                      k,   and the high and

low skill levels are given by            h   and l, respectively. Unemployed workers obtain a per period


benefit of      bk = φpk   where    pk   denotes the mean wage payment of all skill                k   workers. When a

relationship is first formed with a worker having skill level                      k,   the initial value of   z   is drawn


from the distribution         ν k (z).   Assume     ν h (z ) > ν l (z );   i.e., the high-skill distribution first-order


stochastically dominates the low-skill distribution. In addition to the probability of a                             switch
and an        exogenous breakup, the relationship with a low-skilled worker can now also receive
an   upgrade at the beginning of the period, wherein he receives a draw from ν h(z).10
         High-skilled workers who become unemployed will become low skilled with probability                           γD.

The key feature of the model with turbulence is, thus, that there are low-skilled unemployed


workers with a high level of unemployment benefits bh .


         Adjusting the equations is reasonably straightforward. The surplus equation for a high-


skilled worker is now given by:



 sh (z, bh ) = (1     − τ e(z))z + gh(z) − (1 − τ u(bh ))bh − (γ D wl (bh) + (1 − γ D )wh(bh ) + wf ),                 (15)



where the subscripts          h   and    l   denote the skill level of the worker. The zero surplus level is

Speeches of the Day, Oct 1, 1998, 64(24): 741-745.
  10
         We assume that workers experiencing an upgrade must work for at least one period at the high skill level
in order to qualify for the benefit bh . To reduce the number of different worker classifications we assume
that in case of an upgrade a worker receives a draw of z in the range of values where an existing relationship
with a high-skilled worker who is entitled to bh would not break up.

       In the model without turbulence (γ D = 0) the value of                                zl   is the same for those workers


who receive a switch and for the unemployed who enter a new relationship, because both

are entitled to        bl .11   In the model with turbulence, however, the zero surplus level for the

unemployed with high unemployment benefits,                                zl (bh )   will be higher than the zero surplus


level for the unemployed with low unemployment benefits,                                     zl (bl ).   Note that the latter zero


surplus level still equals that of the low-skilled workers who receive a switch.


       The equilibrium conditions are modified as follows.                                  The continuation values for the

relationship with a low-skilled worker and a high-skilled worker are given by

and taxes one needs a precise differentiation of the different groups, since not all workers


with the same skill level earn the same wage and operate at the same range of values for                     z.

In particular, in the model with turbulence there are four different types of unemployed and

six different types of employed workers (see the appendix for details).12

The goal of this section is to document that the model outlined in Section 3 can explain

the divergent behavior of European and U.S. unemployment rates when key aspects of the


economic environment deteriorate.              To accomplish this, we will show that a decrease in


the growth rate, an increase in the interest rate, as well as an increase in the tax rate (the


shocks considered) lead to a higher steady state unemployment rate. Further, the magnitude


of the effect can be small at low initial tax rates and replacement rates (the institutions),

but substantial at high initial tax rates and replacement rates. The idea is that the steady


state values corresponding with the favorable economic environment capture the average


values of the unemployment rate during the 1950’s and 1960’s, and the steady state values


corresponding to the unfavorable economic environment reflect the average values of the


unemployment rate during the 1980’s and 1990’s. The 1970’s represent a transition period


that we will not try to model.


       In Section 4.1, we give the basic intuition behind our story and illustrate it using several

numerical examples that document the interaction between the reduction in the discount


factor and the level of unemployment benefits.                 In Section 4.2, we show that the same

idea applies to changes in tax rates on labor income. In Section 4.3, we demonstrate that an

increase in turbulence is not a good candidate to explain the European unemployment puzzle


in this framework, when an increase in turbulence is modelled as an increased probability

of skill loss after job separation. In Section 4.4, we emphasize the importance of the cross-

sectional distribution of productivity shocks and in Section 4.5 we discuss related literature.



4.1.       Implications of Shocks in the Benchmark Model.                                    In this section we study


the effect of changes in the growth rate and the interest rate on steady state unemployment

rates.


   Intuition.           In Section 3.5, it was established that the appropriate discount factor in


a model with disembodied growth is equal to (1 +                         ξ )/(1 + r).    Figure 6 plots the scaled

values of (1 + ξ )/(1 + r ) for five-year intervals. The graph clearly shows that combining the


growth effect and the real interest rate effect, one observes for each country a decrease in


the transformed discount factor. We will start by investigating the effect of changes in this


discount factor on the steady state unemployment rate and the interaction with the level of


the replacement rate.


   Consider again the equation that determines the zero surplus level.



                                                z + g (z )   − b − w(b) = 0.                                            (19)



To simplify the notation we have set tax rates to zero. A decrease in the discount factor

will decrease both         g (z )   and     w(b).   The question is which one will decrease more. If                    g (z )

is equal to     w(b),    then it is not hard to show that there will be no effect on                       z.   If   g (z )   is

bigger than     w(b),     then a decrease in the discount factor, not surprisingly, will have a bigger


impact on      g (z )   than on     w(b),   thus increasing     z.   The value of   g (z )   will be bigger than       w(b),

and    z   will be smaller than        b,   when the probability of receiving a switch,            γS ,   is higher than
              SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                                19



the matching probability for an unemployed worker,                       λ.   The intuition for this last result


is relatively simple.        The idea is that when            γS > λ     relationships stay together at values

of   z   that are somewhat less than          b   because by staying together they have a better chance


of quickly increasing their earnings. We find it implausible that the best way to increase


productivity is to end the relationship, and therefore, the natural case to consider is the one

where     γS > λ   and   g (z )   is bigger than   w (b).   Thus, a decrease in the discount factor increases

z    and, correspondingly, increases the rejection rate of unemployed workers along with the


breakup probability of workers within a relationship.

      Graphically, this idea is captured in Figure 7, which show how the surplus changes in


response to a decrease in the discount factor. A shift to a low growth (or high interest rate)


economy lowers the joint surplus, raising both the rejection probability for new matches


and the destruction probability for ongoing ones. Thus, the flow out of the unemployment


pool is reduced, while the flow into the pool is increased, leading to the robust prediction

of a higher steady-state unemployment rate. Further, an increase in the replacement rate,


φ,   also shifts joint surplus downward, raising the rejection and destruction probabilities.


We will show below that the effects of lower                   β   and higher    φ   are complementary, causing


a decline in    β   to have a bigger effect when              φ   is large.   It should be stressed that slower

growth and higher interest rates lead to permanent changes in unemployment, based on the


fact that unemployment is determined in steady state equilibrium. This contrasts with the

conjecture of Blanchard and Wolfers (2000), who argue that the shocks affect unemployment


in a transitory way. As long as           β   remains low, however, the zero surplus level continues to


be high, and high levels of unemployment are maintained.
              SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                             20



       Benchmark Parameterization.                     This effect may be illustrated using some numerical


examples. The distribution          ν (z )   is taken to be uniform with support [ν, ν ], while the match-


ing probability is fixed. Periods are taken to be quarters. Table 2 reports numerical values


of the parameters for our benchmark specification.


       Results for the benchmark parameterization are given in part A of Table 3, which reports

for a low- and a high-replacement-rate economy the equilibrium unemployment rates for

various values of the discount factor             β.    Note that the low- and the high-replacement-rate


economy are identical in everything except the replacement rate. As documented by the


table, a decline in growth or a rise in the interest rate, both reflected by a fall in the

discount factor     β,   lead to higher unemployment rates for high levels of the replacement rate


φ.   At low values of      φ,   however, there is no rise in unemployment associated with a fall in


β.     The model, therefore, exhibits an interaction between shocks and institutions, whereby


higher replacement rates exacerbate the unemployment effects of either a growth slowdown

or a rise in interest rates. The key aspect of this parameterization is displayed in Figure


8, which plots the cross-sectional distribution of productivity values             z,   along with the zero


surplus levels. The figure captures our basic believe that at high replacement rates, the mass

of jobs sensitive to deteriorations in the economic environment is bigger.


       Note that in the high-replacement-rate economy, only the lowest productivity jobs are


destroyed.      The average productivity of ongoing relationships will, therefore, increase in


the high-replacement-rate economy relative to the low-replacement-rate economy.13                      This

  13
       The increase in average productivity leads to an increase in average wages and, thus, an increase in
unemployment benefits. This increase in unemployment benefits leads to a further increase in the unem-
ployment rate. The effect is quantitatively, however, very small and the overall increase in the unemployment
rate would be similar if the value of b is kept constant.

is consistent with Nickell and Layard (1999), who document that labor productivity has


increased in Europe relative to the U.S..


      Duration and Flows Into and Out of Unemployment.                        In several European coun-

tries, the fraction of long-term unemployed has increased in the last few decades.14 Moreover,


Machin and Manning (1999) argue that the rise in the incidence of long-term unemployment

is mainly due to a decrease in the flows out of unemployment. To understand the relevance


of these observations for our model, consider the following steady state expression for the


unemployment rate:


                                            λw ρR u = ρD (1   − u),                                     (20)




where    ρR   is the rejection rate and   ρD   is the destruction rate (here we have abstracted from


retirement and new entrants, which do not play an important role in the numerical exercises).

In our model,     ρR is equal to ρD   (except for new entrants), so it may seem that our framework


is not consistent with the observation made by Machin and Manning (1999). Moreover, it


might be difficult to generate realistic increases in the outflow rate             λ w ρR   with a constant


matching probability.

      Because of composition effects, however, our mechanism is consistent with a substantial


increase in the     average   duration of unemployment, a substantial decrease in the               average

outflow rate of unemployment, and a modest increase in the                 average   outflow rate of em-

ployment. To clarify this statement, consider the following example of an economy with two


types of workers: type A and type B. For simplicity we assume that workers never switch

type;15 this means that both types operate with complete independence. Suppose that jobs

 14
      See, for example, Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998).
 15
      Recall that in the turbulence version of the model we allow workers to switch types, and in Section 4.3
           SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                          22



of type A workers are destroyed with probability equal to 0.1 and that jobs of type B work-


ers are destroyed with probability equal to 0.02. According to our model, these are also the

rejection rates of new job offers. Furthermore, assume that the mass of type A workers is

equal to 0.1, the mass of type B workers is equal to 0.9, the matching probability for a type


A worker is equal to 0.3 and the matching probability for a type B worker is equal to 0.8.

Then it is straightforward to calculate that the steady state unemployment rate is equal to

4.94%, that the outflow rate of unemployment is equal to 50.3% and that the outflow rate


of employment is equal to 2.61%. Now suppose that in response to a deterioration of the


economic environment the destruction rate of type A workers increases from 0.1 to 0.4, while

the destruction rate of type B workers remains unchanged. This increases the unemployment


rate from 4.94% to 9.14%. Note that for type A workers there is a substantial increase in the


outflow rate of employment. The          average   outflow rate of employment, however, increases


only from 2.61% to 3.3% because the number of employed type A workers decreases relative


to the number of employed type B workers. In the unemployment pool, the fraction of type


A workers, i.e. the workers with high unemployment duration, increases. This results in a


substantial decrease in the outflow rate of unemployment and a substantial increase in the


average unemployment duration. Specifically, the average unemployment duration increases

from 2.6 to 4.5 periods.


   Alternative Parameterizations.               An important feature of the benchmark parame-

terization is that the value of    z   is not in the support of the distribution   ν (z)   for the high

discount factor case for both the low- and the high-replacement-rate economy. Suppose in-


stead that we increase the support of      z   such that there are endogenous breakups during the

we consider the importance of composition effects in the model with turbulence.
             SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                             23



favorable, i.e. high      β,   period. If we keep the rate of exogenous breakups,       ρx ,   the same then


unemployment rates across the high-replacement-rate and the low-replacement-rate economy

would not be equal during the favorable times. We consider two alternatives to deal with


this. In the first, the rate of exogenous breakups,        ρx ,   is higher in the low-replacement-rate


economy, and in the second, the standard deviation of             z   is higher in the low-replacement-rate

economy.


      When one thinks of the low-replacement-rate economy as the U.S., then these specifica-


tions do not seem especially implausible. Since distances are bigger in the U.S., relocations


for personal reasons are more likely to lead to job termination in the U.S. than in Europe.

The presence of government subsidies could also trim the low side of the distribution in Eu-


rope. There are some empirical observations consistent with these conjectures. Nickell and


Layard (1999), for example, document that regional mobility has been substantially higher


in the U.S. than in most European countries. For the period from 1980 to 1987, for example,


an average of 2.9% of all workers changed region each year in the U.S., while for the five


European countries considered in this paper the highest percentage was observed for France,

                 16
at only 1.3%.         Also important in this respect are the observations from Nickell and Layard


(1999) about minimum wages. They report that the minimum wage relative to the country’s

average wage over the period from 1991 to 1994 was substantially higher in Sweden than in


the U.S., but in Sweden no workers were at or near the minimum wage while in the U.S.

four percent of the workers were at or near the minimum wage. In Spain, however, more


workers were at the minimum wage even though the minimum wage in Spain was lower.

   Results for Alternative Parameterizations.                       In the first alternative considered, we


set the rate of exogenous breakups,       ρx ,   in the high-replacement-rate economy equal to zero

and choose the support of the distribution such that the unemployment rate in the high-


replacement-rate economy is again equal to (approximately) 5% when β = 0.99, i.e., the value


corresponding to the favorable growth and interest rate regime. The results for this case are

reported in the first two columns of part B of Table 3 for the high- and the low-replacement-

rate economy, respectively. For the low-replacement-rate economy the zero surplus level is


still outside the support of the distribution, and changes in the discount factor have no effect


on the breakup and rejection margin. The key idea of this parameterization is graphically

presented in Figure 9.


   In the second alternative, the support of          z   in the economy with a low replacement rate is


set such that the unemployment rate is equal to 5% when               β = 0.99 and the rate of exogenous

destruction equal zero. Obviously the support for             z   will then be wider in the economy with

a low replacement rate. The results for the low-replacement-rate economy are reported in


the third column of part B of Table 3. When we compare the third column with the first


column, then we see that unemployment rates actually increase more in the low-replacement-

rate economy. This despite the fact that the mass of jobs just to the right of               z   is larger in


the high-replacement-rate economy. There is a stronger response to the level of                    z   in the


high-replacement-rate economy, however, because      − b is lower in the low-replacement-rate
                                                              z

economy, leading to a higher level of g (z ) − w. As pointed out before, the higher g (z ) − w ,


the higher the effect of changes in   β   on     z.

   Note that the matching probabilities are assumed to be equal across economies. But du-
               SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                     25



ration of unemployment has been much lower in the U.S. then in Europe,17 so it makes sense


to use a higher matching probability in the low-replacement-rate economy. In particular, we

increase the matching probability in the low-replacement-rate economy from 0.3 to 0.5 and


repeat the last experiment. The results in the fourth column of part B of Table 3 show that


the increase in the matching probability reduces the sensitivity of the unemployment rate


to a change in the discount factor, by decreasing the value of        g (z )   − w.   In fact, when we

compare the first and the fourth column we see that the unemployment rate is again more


sensitive to changes in the discount factor in the high-replacement rate economy.



4.2.       Shocks to Tax Rates in the Benchmark Model.                  In this section we discuss


the effects of differential tax rates for labor income and unemployment benefits on the


unemployment rate.         It is easy to show that when tax rates are proportional and equal


for both forms of income, tax rates have no effect on unemployment in our framework.


Because of the presence of payroll taxes and progressive income taxes, however, this is not

an empirically relevant case. In general the tax rate on labor income will be higher than the


tax rate on unemployment benefits. The effects of tax rates on unemployment are similar

to the effects of the discount rate on unemployment. Just like a reduction in the discount


factor, an increase in the tax rate differential increases the zero surplus level.           This has


important consequences for the unemployment rate only if many jobs are affected by the


increase. When most jobs have surplus values that are considerably above zero the increase


in   z   will be unimportant. A low initial tax level, just like a low replacement rate, can ensure


that most jobs have surplus levels that are high enough to be safe from increases in tax rates.

      Since only differences between the tax rate on labor income and the tax rate on un-

employment benefits matter in our model, we will normalize tax rates by setting the tax


rate on unemployment benefits,                τ u (b),   equal to zero.      Moreover, we assume that positive

profits are taxed at a constant rate and no tax credits are given for negative profits, that is,


τ z (z ) = τ z > 0   for z   >0    and   τ z (z ) = 0    for z   < 0.

       Part A of Table 4 shows the steady state unemployment rates for different values of the

discount factor and different values of            ζ , the level of per capita government purchases relative

to the mean value of          z.   We consider values of            ζ   equal to 0, 0.25, and 0.5. The empirical


literature has mainly focused on tax rates. In our framework, the tax rate is an endogenous


variable influenced by the level of unemployment benefits, the number of unemployed workers

and the level of government expenditures. Since changes in                           ζ   affects the economy in our


model only through changes in tax rates, changes in                          ζ   are the cleanest way to evaluate


the effect of changes in tax rates. Note that it makes no sense to consider larger values of


government expenditures since we have used the normalization that                           τ u = 0. We set the value

of   φ   equal to 0.5. The first column in part A of Table 4, corresponding to the case where per


capita government expenditures are equal to zero, is identical to the second column in part


A of Table 3. In this case taxes are only used to finance unemployment benefits. We see


that an increase in tax rates (caused by an increase in government expenditures) increases

the steady state unemployment rate. The results in Part B correspond to the same exercise


when the initial level of government expenditures is higher. In particular, while for part A


the support of the distribution was chosen in such a way that the unemployment rate equals

5% when       β = 0.99       and   ζ = 0,    for part B the support of the distribution was calibrated


such that the unemployment rate equals 5% when                           β = 0.99   and   ζ = 0.10.   We clearly see

that an increase in the tax rate has a bigger impact when the initial tax rate is higher.18

  18
       One could argue that it would be better to ensure that the percentage change in 1-ζ is the same for part
            SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                                    27



In particular, starting at     ζ =0     a five percentage point increase in per capita expenditures


increases the unemployment rate from 5% to 6.24%, while the same percentage point change

starting at     ζ = 0.10   increases the unemployment rate from 5% to 7.32%. Also note that

the combined change in the discount factor and the tax rate leads to substantial changes in


steady state unemployment rates.



4.3.    Shocks in the Presence of and to Turbulence.                      We now consider the extension

of the model that includes two skill levels and turbulence. In a turbulent economy, high-


skilled workers may face a loss of skills if they lose their jobs, because of skill obsolescence


or difficulty of finding a new job in the sector for which their skills are specialized. Fol-


lowing Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998), we model turbulence by assuming that high-skilled


workers who separate from an employment relationship suffer a                downgrade       to low skills with


probability     γD.   The previous version of the model, in which           γ D = 0,   may be viewed as a


“tranquil” economy in which skills never become obsolete. Greater degrees of turbulence are


reflected by higher values of     γD.   The parameters for the economies with turbulence are given


in Table 5. In the economy with a high replacement rate, exogenous destruction is set equal

to zero and the support of z is chosen in such a way that for               β = 0.99       and   γ D = 0.10   (the


favorable regime values) the unemployment rate is equal to 5%. In the low-replacement-rate


economy, all parameters are identical except the replacement rate and the level of exoge-

nous destruction, which is increased to obtain a 5% unemployment rate for                         β = 0.99    and


γ D = 0.10.

A and B of Table 4. The value of 1-ζ drops 5% (from 1 to 0.95) in part A. An equal percentage decrease in
the value of 1-ζ in part B requires a reduction in 1-ζ from 0.9 to 0.855 or an increase in ζ from 0.10 to 0.145,
slightly less than the increase to 0.15 considered. The results for the increase in    ζ   to 0.145 are, however,
very similar.
             SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                            28



      The steady state unemployment rates for different values of the discount factor and the


turbulence parameter are reported in parts A and B of Table 6 for the high- and the low-

replacement-rate economy, respectively.           In part B we see that the low-replacement-rate

economy is still far enough away from the zero surplus level of               z   and is not affected by


changes in the discount factor or the turbulence parameter. Two important observations

can be made concerning the results for the high-replacement-rate economy.                    The first is

that in contrast to Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998), an increase in turbulence               decreases    the


unemployment rate. The reason is related to the aspect of turbulence that Alan Greenspan


referred to in the quote cited in Section 3.6. In particular, faced with increased turbulence

(that is, an increased probability of skill loss), high-skilled workers are less likely to quit


their job. Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) fix the rate of destruction and do not consider a


response in the destruction rate to a change in the economic environment. In our model an


increase in turbulence does increase the rejection rate of the unemployed, because a rise in


turbulence increases the fraction of unemployed workers entitled to unemployment benefits


that are high relative to wage offers received.           This effect, however, is dominated by the


increased willingness of high-skilled workers to hold on to their jobs.


      A second observation is that in the presence of turbulence, the impact of a change in

the discount factor on the unemployment rate is substantially higher, due to a composition


effect. A decrease in the discount factor not only increases the destruction rate for each skill


level, but it also increases the fraction of low-skilled workers. Since low-skilled workers have

higher destruction rates, unemployment rates rise even further. This composition effect is


stronger for lower values of the upgrade probability,        γU .   This can be seen in part C of Table

6, which corresponds to part A except that         γU   is now equal to 0.10 instead of 0.15.
                                                                                                19
                                                                                                     We see

 19
      In addition, the standard deviation is recalibrated to obtain a five percent unemployment rate in the
               SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                                29



that a decrease of the discount factor from 0.99 to 0.97 would increase the unemployment


rate from 5% to 23% and even if we allow for an increase in turbulence (γ D increases from


0.10 to 0.15) the unemployment rate would still increase from 5% to 18.5%.


       When    γU    is equal to 0.1, the unemployment rates in the low-replacement-rate economy


are affected by the decrease in the discount factor, although the effect is very small. This

is documented in part D of Table 6.               Starting at values of      β = 0.99     and   γ D = 0.10,    a

decrease in      β   to 0.97 would increase the unemployment rate from 5% to 5.6%. Note that


at this point, an increase in        γD   to 0.15 would increase the unemployment rate slightly, to


5.7%.      The main reason why an increase in turbulence increases the unemployment rate in


the low-replacement-rate economy is not because of the effect proposed by Ljungqvist and


Sargent (that there are more unemployed workers with benefits that are high relative to


the wage offers their skills can generate). The quantitatively more important effect is that


turbulence decreases the outside option for high-skilled workers and, thus, lowers the wages


of high-skilled workers. This implies a reduction in future wages of low-skilled workers and

thus a decrease in relationship benefits for low-skilled workers. This reduction implies an

                                             20
increases in their zero surplus level.


       Turbulence and the effect on unemployment rates?.                       The question arises whether


in reality the effect of Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) is always dominated by a reduction in


the breakup probability of high-skilled workers. In our numerical examples we typically found


numerically insignificant effects from increases in the rejection rates by the unemployed,

favorable regime.
  20
       The quantitative importance of this effect is still small. For this effect to be quantitatively important,
one needs a large mass of low-skilled workers, that is, a low value of γ U . But when γ U is low, changes in
wages earned after an upgrade occurs are not very important.
              SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                            30



because the mass of unemployed is relatively small. For example, suppose that the matching


probability is equal to 50% and that both the destruction rate and the rejection rate of new

job offers is equal to 2.56%. Then it is easy to calculate that the steady state unemployment

rate would be equal to 5%. To get an increase of the unemployment rate to 10% one would


have to increase the rejection rate to 53.8%, while one only has to increase the destruction

rate to 0.054% to get the same increase in the unemployment rate.21 Also, a problematic


observation for the explanation given by Ljungqvist and Sargent (1998) is that most of the


increase in European unemployment rates is due to an increase of the unemployment of


workers with low skill levels.22


       There actually is a more robust way to increase turbulence. Mortensen and Pissarides


(1999) model an increase in turbulence as an increase in the cross-sectional variation of

z.   Table 7 reports steady state unemployment rates for different values of             β   and the cross-


sectional variation of     z   in the high-replacement-rate economy and documents that an increase


in turbulence now leads to a substantial increase in the steady state unemployment rate.



4.4.      Empirical Relevance and the Importance of Cross-Sectional Data.                         We have

generated numerical examples in which unemployment rates in the low-replacement-rate


economy do not respond to a deterioration of the economy, but unemployment rates in the


high-replacement-rate economy do. In the benchmark parameterization, in which there are


no endogenous breakups in the favorable regime, this was accomplished using two economies

  21
       There is no retirement in this example.
  22
       See Table 22 in Nickell and Layard (1999).   This empirical observation is also inconsistent with the
turbulence story told in Marimon and Zilibotti (1999), who model the increase in turbulence as an increase
in the difference between the most and least productive job a worker could get. As in Ljungqvist and Sargent
(1998) this would induce those workers with high unemployment benefits to remain unemployed longer.
              SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                                 31



that are identical except for the replacement rate. In the alternative parameterizations, the


same effects are possible when there are endogenous breakups, but now the two economies

have to differ in more than just the replacement rate.                The key hypothesis in this paper

is that the mass of jobs that were close to breaking up was substantially higher in Europe


because of high tax rates and high outside benefits. In Section 2 we documented that tax

rates and unemployment benefits are higher in Europe. But if Europe is more productive

than the U.S., then European surplus values are not necessarily lower. To shed some light


on this question, we plot in Figure 10 net profit rates in the manufacturing sector in the


U.S. and Europe. The figure documents that in the early postwar period profit rates were

higher in the U.S. than in Europe, but that in the second half of the sample period profit


rates were slightly higher in Europe. The observed pattern for profit rates is consistent with


the main hypothesis and a key prediction of this paper. The higher U.S. profit rates are


consistent with higher surplus values which ensured that jobs in the U.S. were less sensitive


to decreases in the growth rate and increases in the tax and interest rate.23 Moreover, the


increase of the profits rate in Europe relative to the U.S. is consistent with the property


of our model that a deterioration of the economic environment destroys the less productive

jobs in Europe but not in the U.S..

       For a serious investigation about the quantitative importance of the mechanism proposed


in this paper, however, one would need to know much more detailed information about the

cross-sectional distribution of surplus levels than just observed averages. In particular, one

would have to know detailed information about that part of the distribution of                       z   close to


the breakup level. Our hypothesis is that because of the higher replacement rate, there were

  23
       In the model, higher profit rates can be due to higher values of   z   and to lower unemployment benefits
which lowers workers’ outside option and wages.
            SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                        32



more jobs close to breaking up during the sixties in Europe than in the U.S.. The model with


turbulence makes it clear that even perfect knowledge of the cross-sectional distribution of

existing   jobs is not always enough to make model predictions. We saw, for example, that an

increase in turbulence lowers the zero surplus level and one could not predict the additional


mass of jobs created because these jobs never existed before.

   Time-series information on several other variables, like job creation and job destruction,

has only limited information to support or contradict the explanations proposed in this paper.


In particular, our theory offers no prediction for steady state destruction rates. Our theory


makes predictions for the destruction rate   conditional on the skill level.   That is, for each skill

level, the destruction rate should go up more in economies with high replacement rates. But


because of composition effects, aggregate destruction rates could either decrease or increase.


For example, it is possible that in the seventies a large number of low-productivity, high-


destruction-rate jobs were destroyed in Europe and never again created. This would increase


the productivity of the remaining jobs and lower the average destruction rate. Moreover,


although job protection seems to have offsetting effects on average unemployment rates, it


can have important effects on average job destruction and job creation rates and could also


be important to understand business cycle properties of unemployment rates.



4.5.   Related Literature.       There are several other papers that study the relationship

between growth and steady-state unemployment rates. A key issue is whether technological


progress is modelled as embodied or disembodied technological progress. We follow Pissarides


(1990) and model growth as disembodied technological progress, while Aghion and Howitt


(1994) model growth as embodied technological progress. In Aghion and Howitt (1994) a

relationship can only benefit from new technology by severing the relationship, going to
             SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                        33



the matching market, and getting newly matched. We argue that embodied technological


progress is a sensible approach for capital and investment but less so for labor market models.

Note that in Aghion and Howitt (1994) a worker who was part of a relationship that was

severed because of a low productivity level (relative to the newly available technology), will


actually be capable of using the newest technology, but only after having been unemployed

for some time. We argue that it makes more sense to let existing relationships incorporate

new technologies. Mortensen and Pissarides (1998) generalize Aghion and Howitt (1994) by


allowing existing relationship to upgrade to the newest available technology by paying an


upgrade cost. It seems to us that such an upgrade cost to benefit from the newest technology

should be lower for an existing firm then for a new relationship.24 This implies that firms


would never break up to obtain the new technology but rather would continue the existing

relationship and pay the upgrade cost.


      This issue is important because with embodied technological progress (allowing vacancy


costs to rise at the same rate as the productivity of new matches), an increase in growth


actually increases unemployment.25           The reason is that higher growth causes existing re-


lationships to become obsolete faster and, thus, to break up faster. This idea is used by


Hornstein, Krusell, and Violante (2000) to argue that an           increase   in embodied technological

progress that started in the 1970’s increased unemployment in those countries with high un-


employment benefits. The story we propose in this paper is more straightforward, but we are

sympathetic to the idea that in some sectors embodied technological progress is important


and has increased unemployment in the last few decades.


      The role of taxes is studied in detail by Daveri and Tabellini (2000). Their paper docu-

 24
      Our model basically assumes that the upgrade costs are equal to zero.

ments the effect of taxes on unemployment rates and growth rates and builds an overlapping-


generations model with endogenous growth to explain the empirical findings.          Note that

whereas we consider changes in tax rates and growth rates as two independent shocks, Dav-

eri and Tabellini (2000) argue that the cause of the lower growth rates actually is high tax


rates. The finding that tax rates affect growth is disputed in the literature,26 but Daveri and


Tabellini argue that one does find significant effects if one exploits both the cross-sectional


and time series variation of the data and distinguishes among countries on the basis of their


labor market institutions.



                                            5. C 
We have reassessed the European unemployment puzzle using a job matching model that


features endogenous job creation and destruction, bilateral wage bargaining, and variable


worker skill levels that may rise on the job. The model considers shocks in the form of slower

growth, higher interest rates, higher tax rates, and increased turbulence, and studies how


these shocks interact with the replacement rate and the initial tax rate level. The variability


of relation-specific productivity is also considered. Slower growth, higher interest rates, and


higher tax rates are shown to induce a larger increase in unemployment when the replacement


rate or the initial tax rate is higher, as was found empirically by Blanchard and Wolfers (2000)


and Daveri and Tabellini (2000). Higher turbulence actually reduces unemployment, due to


exerting a favorable effect on job destruction; this reverses the finding of Ljungqvist and


Sargent (1998).


      An important implication of our results is that the European unemployment problem

should not be viewed as self-correcting. The model demonstrates that slower growth and

 26
      See, for example, Nickell and Layard (1999).
          SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                   35



higher interest rates produce greater unemployment, especially in the presence of generous


unemployment benefits. Unless the shocks are reversed, or other institutional changes are

made, unemployment may be expected to remain high.

   This paper documents the importance of the cross-sectional distribution of the surplus,


especially about that part of the distribution where relationships are close to breaking up.

The key hypothesis in this paper is that the mass of jobs that were close to breaking up was

substantially higher in Europe because of high tax rates and high outside benefits. The ideal


data set to test the explanation given in this paper would be a survey held in the sixties that


asked firms and workers in the U.S. and Europe how close they were to breaking up. The

historical profit rates discussed in Section 4.1 support the view that a smaller share of jobs


were close to breaking up in the U.S. than in Europe, but a serious quantitative assessment


of the mechanism described in this paper would require much more detailed information


about the cross-sectional distribution in the sixties.

In the appendix we discuss details about the data sources and different types of relationships


in the model.


   Data Sources.      The tax data reported in Figure 3 are from Daveri and Tabellini (2000).


The net-profit rates in manufacturing are from Armstrong, Glyn and Harrison (1991). All

other data were provided to us by Justin Wolfers and we refer the reader for a more de-


tailed description of these data to the data appendix of Blanchard and Wolfers (2000) that


is available at http://web.mit.edu/blanchar/www/harry_data/. Data for standardized un-

employment rates and durations are from the Quarterly Labor Force Statistics. The OECD


replacement rates are from the OECD’s database on Unemployment Benefit Entitlements
          SHOCKS AND INSTITUTIONS IN A JOB MATCHING MODEL                                            36



and Replacement Rates. These numbers are based on an average over three family types,


two income levels, and seven unemployment duration levels. The real interest rate is the

nominal interest rate on long-term government securities less the annualized rate of inflation

over the last five years using the GDP deflator. Finally, total factor productivity is the Solow


Residual in the business sector, scaled by the labor share.


   Types of Workers.           Given tax rates and values for   b   one only needs to know the frac-


tion of low-skilled workers, the fraction of high-skilled workers, the fraction of (low-skilled)


unemployed not entitled to unemployment benefits, the fraction of low-skilled unemployed

entitled to bl , the fraction of low-skilled unemployed entitled to     bh ,   and the fraction of high-


skilled unemployed. To calculate average wages (which in turn determine unemployment


benefits) and tax rates a more precise disaggregation is needed. In Table 8 we report all the

different types of workers their outside option or unemployment benefits and if applicable


the values of   z   at which they operate.

Note: Here φ is the replacement rate, λw is the matching probability, ρx is the rate of exogenous breakups,
and σz is the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic productivity shock. The values of other parameters are
given in Table 2. In all economies the parameters are chosen such that the unemployment rate is approximately 5%
when β = 0.99. In the first column this is done by adjusting σz. Then in column 2 the value of ρx is increased to again get a 5%
unemployment rate at the lower value of φ. In the third and fourth column the value of σz is used to get a 5% unemployment rate at the
indicated matching probability.
