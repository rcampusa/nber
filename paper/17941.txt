                                             ABSTRACT

We document that the global scope and depth of the crisis the began with the collapse of the subprime
mortgage market in the summer of 2007 is unprecedented in the post World War II era and, as such,
the most relevant comparison benchmark is the Great Depression (or the Great Contraction, as dubbed
by Friedman and Schwartz, 1963) of the 1930s. Some of the similarities between these two global
episodes are examined but the analysis of the aftermath of severe financial crises is extended to also
include the most severe post-WWII crises as well. As to the causes of these great crises, we focus
on those factors that are common across time and geography. We discriminate between root causes
of the crises, recurring crises symptoms, and common features (such as misguided financial regulation
or inadequate supervision) which serve as amplifiers of the boom-bust cycle. There are recurring temporal
patterns in the boom-bust cycle and their broad sequencing is analyzed.

“Overindebtedness simply means that debts are out-of-line, are too big relative to other
economic factors. It may be started by many causes, of which the most common
appears to be new opportunities to invest at a big prospective profit… such as through
new industries… Easy money is the great cause of over-borrowing.”

Irving Fisher (1933).


           This paper follows my remarks at the XIth Angelo Costa Lecture, Rome, October

5, 2011 and draws heavily from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) and Reinhart, Kirkeegard,

and Sbrancia (2011).

           The issues I address fall into three broad areas or sections. 2 The next section

takes stock of the collateral damage, in terms of the incidence of banking crises and

currency and crashes around the world, which followed the financial turmoil that began as

the subprime crisis in the United States in the summer of 2007. Following a common

pattern in history, the financial crash has more recently morphed into full fledged

sovereign crises engulfing (to date), in varying degrees, Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Italy

and Spain. 3 Apart from its impact on domestic and international financial flows, not to

mention the changes in the landscape of the financial industry, that this crisis has

produced, the toll on the real economy has been great. The evolution of world trade helps

to illustrate the breadth and depth of the economic downturn. Global equity prices have

also followed a roller coaster pattern since the onset of crisis about four years ago. The

evidence presented here, places these developments in a broader historical and

international perspective that allows us to gauge the unusual severity of the unfolding

global crisis. Section III dwells on the aftermath of severe financial crises, and speculates

                                                                                              2
where we might be in the post-crisis cycle. The comparisons focus primarily on the

housing and labor markets, where the aftereffects of the crises have tended to linger the

longest. The fiscal implications and consequences of severe crises are discussed. Section

IV poses the question of what causes these great crises and what factors make them more

severe. The focus of this discussion is on causal factors that are common to severe

financial crises across countries and across time rather than those that are idiosyncratic to

the political and economic circumstances of the latest episode. The last section discusses

on the high (and rapidly rising) levels of public sector indebtedness in nearly all the

advanced economies and its implication for the “international financial architecture” in

the form of financial repression in years to come.



                  II. Taking stock: The global dimensions of the crisis

1. A global crisis index

        So, where are we in a historical global context? We present an index which

proxies of world economic turbulence. These aggregate crisis indices are the time series

shown for 1900-2010 in Figure 1 for the “World”. The indices shown are weighted by a

country’s share in world GDP, as we have done for debt and banking crises. The 66-

country sample accounts for about 90 percent of world GDP. The country indices

(without stock market crashes) are compiled from the time of independence (if after

1800) onward; the index that includes the equity market crashes is calculated based on

data availability. While inflation and banking crises predate independence in many cases,

a sovereign debt crisis (external or internal) is by definition not possible for a colony. In

addition, numerous colonies did not always have their own currencies. The BCDI index




                                                                                                3
stands for banking (systemic episodes only), currency, debt (domestic and external), and

inflation crisis index. When stock market crashes are added (shown separately) to the

BCDI composite, we refer to it as the BCDI +

        Figure 1 chronicles and summarizes the incidence, and to some degree the

severity of varied crisis experience. A cursory inspection of the figure reveals a very

different pattern for the pre- and post-WWII experience. The pre-war experience is

characterized by frequent and severe crises episodes ranging from the banking-crisis

driven “global” panic of 1907 to the debt and inflation crises associated with World War

II and its aftermath. The only period during the post war that we see as high an incidence

of crises is the fifties where, during World War II big countries -- Germany, Austria,

Japan, Italy -- were in a state of default and remained so through the early fifties. Plus, of

course, there were a lot of countries that had gone into default in the thirties that were still

in default. But since the immediate aftermath of World War II, we had not seen a crisis

this global in scope.

      The sharp rise in the blue line (BCDI index) that we see in 2007 and more so in

2008 is mostly dominated by banking crises and also currency crashes. Indeed, a large

share of countries in the fall of 2008, had sufficiently large depreciations to classify as a

currency crash (i.e., exchange rate depreciations exceeding 15 percent). The red line

adds stock market crashes—which were ubiquitous in 2008-2009. No doubt, when the

index is updated to reflect year-end 2011 price levels, it will reveal yet another wave of

stock market crashes.

Notes: The banking, currency, default (domestic and external) and inflation composite (BCDI index) can
take a value between 0 and 5 (for any country in any given year) depending on the varieties of crises taking
place on a particular year. For instance, in 1998 the index took on a value of 5 for Russia, as there was a
currency crash, a banking and inflation crisis, and a sovereign default on both domestic and foreign debt
obligations. This index is then weighted by the country’s share in world income. This index is calculated
annually for the 66 countries in the sample for 1800-2010:6 (shown above for 1900-onwards). We have
added, for the borderline banking cases identified in Laeven and Valencia (2010) for the period 2007-2010.
In addition, we use the Barro and Ursua (2009) definition of a stock market crash for the 25 countries in
their sample (a subset of the 66-country sample-except for Switzerland) for the period 1864-2006; we
update their crash definition through June 2010, to compile our BCDI+ index. For the United States, for
example, the index posts a reading of 2 (banking crisis and stock market crash) in 2008; for Australia and
Mexico it also posts a reading of 2 (currency and stock market crash).

2. World trade

           As to trade, we offer we offer an illustration of the evolution of trade during two

global crises. Figure 2 plots the value of World merchandise exports for 1928-2010. The

estimate for 2009 uses the actual year-end level for 2008 as the average for 2009; this


                                                                                                                            5
                                                                                                            4
yields a 9 percent year-over-year decline in 2009, the largest one-year drop since 1938.

Other large post-WWII declines are in 1952, during the Korean War and in 1982-1983,

when recession hit the United States and a 1930s-scale debt crisis swept through the

emerging world. Smaller declines occurred in 1958, the bottom of a recession in the

United States, 1998 during the Asian financial crisis and in 2001, after September 11.

 While we have reliable trade data for a most countries during World War II, there are sufficient missing
entries so as to make the calculation of the world aggregate not comparable to other years during 1940-
1947.

3. The “big picture”

             In sum, Figures 1-2 highlight the breadth, depth, and internationally synchronous

nature of the post-2007 financial crisis, especially in relation to the milder more scattered

crises episodes of the post war landscape. Even “significant global” events, such as the

break-down of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, the oil shocks of the

mid-1970s and the emerging market debt crisis of the early 1980s, pale in comparison in

terms of the incidence of crises and impacts on the real economy. Indeed, the ouput

declines registered in many advanced and emerging market economies in 2009 rank



                                                                                                          7
among the largest declines in the history of the national income accounts. In several

countries, the declines in real GDP during the second great contraction (2008-2009)

matched and even exceeded those recorded during severe “home grown” financial crises.

This list includes such diverse countries (crisis year in parentheses) as Finland (1991);

Mexico (1995); Singapore (1982); Spain (1977); Sweden (1991); Turkey (2001), among

others.

          Having suggested that the severity of this crisis is on a different scale from the

post-war norm, it is logical sequel to expect that the aftermath of the crisis will, in all

likelihood, also depart from the “standard” post-war recession-recovery pattern. To this

end, the next section summarizes selected empirical findings of the RR study on the

aftermath of severe financial crises.




                           III. The Aftermath of Financial Crises

          Let me begin by observing that, as to the present conjuncture in the United States,

the post-war recession experience should not be seen as an instructive benchmark for

where we are at present or what we should expect. The average NBER post-war

recession lasts less than a year. The worst one lasted 16 months. We passed those

milestones.

          Broadly speaking, financial crises are protracted affairs. More often than not, the

aftermath of severe financial crises share three characteristics. First, asset market

collapses are deep and prolonged. Real housing price declines average 35 percent

stretched out over six years. Second, the aftermath of banking crises is associated with

profound declines in output and employment. The unemployment rate rises an average of


                                                                                                8
7 percentage points over the down phase of the cycle, which lasts on average over four

years. Third, the real value of government debt tends to explode, rising an average of 86

percent in the major post–World War II episodes. Interestingly, the main cause of debt

explosions is not the widely cited costs of bailing out and recapitalizing the banking

system. In fact, the biggest driver of debt increases is the inevitable collapse in tax

revenues that governments suffer in the wake of deep and prolonged output contractions.

1. Unemployment

        To illustrate, Figure 3 examines unemployment rates in the wake of the 14 worst

financial crises in the post war. And what the left panel shows is the increase in the

unemployment rate from the low point to the high point. So, it’s the cumulative increase

in unemployment for that particular crisis. What the right panel shows is the duration in

years of the time it takes to go from the lowest unemployment level to the highest. On

average from bottom to peak, unemployment increases by about 7 percentage points

during the worst financial crises. In the U.S. context, low point in unemployment in 2006

was around 4 percent-a 7 percentage point increase would take it to 11 percent. The

average duration (bottom to peak) is 4.8 years.

        These indices are the official unemployment rates; we are now all aware of more

encompassing measures, such as U6 that are much higher than this when you take into

account underemployment and so on. That’s not reflected in these numbers.

        To reiterate, recovery in the aftermath of severe financial crises are protracted

affairs, in general.

       2. Public debt

                  Where there is a substantial economic downturn, high and rising unemployment,

       and imploding real estate prices – major fiscal consequences should be expected. Not

       surprisingly, the true legacy of a major financial crisis is more government debt. Figure 4

       shows the rise in real government debt in the three years following a banking crisis. The

       deterioration in government finances is striking, with an average debt rise of over 86

       percent. We look at percentage increase in debt, rather than debt-to-GDP, because

       sometimes steep output drops would complicate interpretation of debt–GDP ratios. As RR


                                                                                                                                         10
(2009) note, the characteristic huge buildups in government debt are driven mainly by

sharp falloffs in tax revenue.

        Importantly, however, another major contributor to the public debt buildup in past

crises as well as the current one if the fact that private debts before a crisis become public

debts afterwards. Nowhere is this pattern more evident in recent history that in Ireland,

where the debt/GDP of general government stood at around 25 percent in 2007 and has

since more than quadrupled. 5 In the United States, in early 2010 the transfer of the two

mortgage giants, Fannie and Freddie, added 25 percent to the general government’s debt-

to-GDP ratio.

 Reinhart (2010) documents numerous episodes where private debts ended up in the public sector balance
sheet.

                IV. Causes, Symptoms, and Amplifiers of Financial Crises

         As to the causes of these great crises, we next focus on those factors that are

common across time and geography; we discriminate between root causes of the crisis, its

symptoms, and features such as financial regulation which serve as amplifiers of the

boom-bust cycle. Pertinent to the globalization theme of this conference, the discussion

begins with the link between financial liberalization (internal and external), the financial

innovation and credit booms these spawn and banking crises.

 1. The roots


                                                                                                              12
       There is a striking correlation between freer capital mobility and the incidence of

banking crises, as shown in Figure 5. Periods of high international capital mobility

have repeatedly produced international banking crises, not only famously as they did in

the 1990s, but historically. The figure plots a three-year moving average of the share of

all countries experiencing banking crises on the right scale. On the left scale, we graph

the index of capital mobility, due to Obstfeld and Taylor (2004), updated and back cast

using their same design principle, to cover our full sample period. While the Obstfeld–

Taylor index may have its limitations, we feel it nevertheless provides a concise summary

of complicated forces by emphasizing de facto capital mobility based on actual flows.

       For the post-1970 period, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) present formal evidence

on the links of crises with financial liberalization. In 18 of the 26 banking crises they

study, the financial sector had been liberalized within the preceding five years, usually

less. In the 1980s and 1990s most liberalization episodes were associated with financial

crises of varying severity. Only in a handful of countries (for instance, Canada) did

financial sector liberalization proceed smoothly. Specifically, the paper presents

evidence that the probability of a banking crisis conditional on financial liberalization

having taken place is higher than the unconditional probability of a banking crisis.

2. The setting

                   Across countries and over the centuries, economic crises of all type follow a

similar pattern. An innovation emerges. Sometimes it is a new tool of science of

industry, such as the diving bell, steam engine, or the radio. Sometime it is a tool of

financial engineering, such as the joint-stock company, junk bonds, or collateralized debt

obligations. These usually accompany or are a direct result of financial liberalization, as

described above. Investors may be wary at first, but then they see that extraordinary

returns appear available on these new instruments and they rush in. Financial

intermediaries—banks and investment companies—stretch their balance sheets so as not

to be left out. The upward surge in asset prices continues, and that generation of financial


                                                                                                                                               14
market participants concludes that rules have been rewritten: Risk has been tamed, and

leverage is always rewarded. All too often, policy makers assert that the asset-price

boom is a vote of confidence on their regime—that “this time is different”. Only

seldom, to my knowledge, do they protest that perhaps the world has not changed and

that the old rules of valuation still apply.

         But the old rules do apply. The asset price rise peters out, sometimes from

exhaustion on its own or sometimes because of a real shock to the economy. This exposes

the weaknesses of the balance sheets of those who justified high leverage by the

expectation of outsized capital gains. Many financial firms admit losses, and some

ultimately fail. All those financial firms hunker down, constricting credit availability in

an effort to slim their balance sheets. With wealth lower and credit harder to get,

economic activity typically contracts. Only after the losses are flushed out of the financial

system and often with the encouragement of lagging monetary and fiscal ease does the

economy recover.

    3. The symptoms

         The recurring historical pattern described above is associated with some well-

defined symptoms. I will focus here on a few of the symptoms or quantitative parallels

(those listed in Table 1) that have been present during the current crisis in several

countries and that we have seen systematically in numerous earlier crises in advanced and

emerging market economies alike. 6 Specifically, large capital inflows, sharp housing and

equity price run-ups lead the “leading indicator” group. So have been surges in private




6
 These and other economic and financial indicators are analyzed in detail in Kaminsky and Reinhart
(1999).


                                                                                                     15
domestic and external debts. These symptoms are quantifiable, unlike the more nebulous

amplifiers that are discussed in the remainder of this section.

        .

                       Table 1. Quantitative antecedents of financial crises:
                               The “lead” of the leading indicators

                                   Large capital inflows
                               Sharp run-ups in equity prices
                              Sharp run-ups in housing prices
                            Inverted V-shaped growth trajectory
                                Marked rise in indebtedness



      If we were to quantify periods of capital flow bonanzas -- periods where capital

inflows are unusually large -- who comes up on the radar screen prior to the 2007-2009

crisis? As Reinhart and Reinhart (2008) document, in addition to the U.S. and the U.K.,

the other names that are listed there -- Spain, Italy, Iceland, Ireland -- are all countries

that have had a period where the large capital inflows ended badly. Capital inflows

facilitate domestic lending, fuel asset prices, and in most instances increase the

indebtedness of the private sector, the public sector (if the government behaves

procyclically), or both.

        There is a sense that the U.S. housing price bubble during 2000-2006 (primarily)

is both unique and unprecedented. The magnitude of the bubble is certainly

unprecedented to the United States--at least during the past century for which we have

comparable data. However, in a broader global context, the sub-prime bubble is neither

unique to the U.S. nor it magnitudes out of line with other real estate bubbles that have

also ended equally lamentably in financial crises.

        Figure 6 compares the run-up in housing prices over 2002-2006. The red bar

highlights the countries that had systemic banking crises. While the housing bubble in

the run-up to the subprime crisis in the US is now infamous, the chart illustrates that the

pattern of a housing price boom ahead of the financial crisis was hardly unique to the US

case. Indeed, it is fully compatible with the “standard” antecedents of a crisis, as

discussed demonstrated in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009).



                                                                                                   17
        The boom in real housing prices (or real estate, and other asset prices, more

broadly) is fueled by ample domestic credit availability, large capital inflows, and the easy

liquidity environment that, and that this facilitates the boom. Coupling the ample liquidity

environment with the presumption that this time is different and that the old rules of

valuation do not apply, then you have the makings or the ingredients for a crisis.

        As to growth (inverted V-shaped pattern) -- growth does very well ahead of the

crisis when credit is ample and wealth effects are positive (as asset prices climb) and falls

subsequently. For further evidence the reader is referred to RR.

        I cannot stress enough the importance of the last entry in Table 1, a marked rise

in indebtedness. Rising indebtedness can be domestic, external or both. In can be private,

public or both. Any combination of these forms of rising indebtedness has been a

hallmark of the pre-crisis period as far back as our data can take us. Perhaps Iceland

illustrates this point in its most extreme form, as external debts rise from about 90 percent

of GDP in 2000 to well over 900 percent of GDP in 2009. It is worth noting that stating

that there are capital inflows is usually a different of observing that a country is borrowing

from the rest of the world.

4.   The “amplifiers”

          The list (shown on Table 3) of what I have dubbed the “usual suspects” (which

 ranges from pro-cyclical macroeconomic policies to overvalued currencies and myopic

 rating agencies) despite its breadth is not meant to be exhaustive. It is a list that has

 withstood the test of time, as several of these amplifiers come up on a recurring and it is

 those are not unique to the United States subprime crisis. Countless case studies of

 banking crises, across countries and time (see references in RR) list these factors on a

 recurring basis--often blamed as underlying causes of the crises. However, it is my view

 that these factors exacerbate both the boom and bust phases of the crisis cycle. For

 example, the stylized evidence presented in Caprio and Klingebiel (1996) suggests that

 inadequate regulation and lack of supervision at the time of the liberalization may play a

 key role in explaining why deregulation and banking crises are so closely entwined. But

 it is difficult to explain a cycle with a constant. Supervision may have always been

 lacking and the regulations ill defined. But such deficiencies may have limited

 consequences when credit conditions are tight (or in the case of emerging markets when

 access to international capital markets is not possible). If, on the other hand, financial

 liberalization (domestic an external) create lending possibilities that did not exist before,

 then inadequate supervision can make a bad lending scenario worse. Outright fraud,

 (often through connected lending) which crops up as another hardy perennial in studies of

 the run-up to crises works the same way.

          The procyclicality of credit ratings (both at the sovereign and corporate levels, see

 Reinhart, 2002) also acts to amplify the cycle of lending and subsequent default and




                                                                                              20
crash. Overvalued currencies are a magnet for capital inflows while procyclical fiscal

policies add to the surge in borrowing during the boom phase of the cycle.

       Far from being mutually exclusive many, if not most of the items in this list are

present simultaneously in the most severe financial crises through out history.

5. A digression on the sequencing of crises

       Just as financial crises have common macroeconomic antecedents in asset prices,

economic activity, external indicators and so on, so common patterns appear in the

sequencing (temporal order) in which crises unfold. Obviously not all crises escalate to

the extreme outcome of a sovereign default. Yet, advanced economies have not been

exempt from their share of currency crashes, bouts of inflation, severe banking crises,

and, in an earlier era, even sovereign default. The point of this short digression is to note

that the long debt cycle we have discussed does not necessarily end with a banking

crisis—more bad news usually follows—a stylized fact that should be kept in mind when

trying to make sense of the current conjuncture.

       Investigating what came first, banking or currency crises, was a central theme of

Kaminsky and Reinhart’s (1999) “twin crises” work; they also concluded that financial

liberalization often preceded banking crises; indeed, it helped predict them. Demirgüç-

Kunt and Detragiache (1998), who employed a different approach and a larger sample,


                                                                                           21
arrived at the same conclusion. Reinhart (2002) examined the currency crash–external

default link. Our work here has investigated the connections between domestic and

external debt crises, inflation crises and default (domestic or external), and banking crises

and external default. 7 Figure 7 maps out a “prototypical” sequence of events yielded by

this literature.

        As Diaz-Alejandro (1985) narrates in his classic paper about the Chilean

experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s, “Goodbye Financial Repression, Hello

Financial Crash,” financial liberalization simultaneously facilitates banks’ access to

external credit and more risky lending practices at home. After a while, following a

boom in lending and asset prices, weaknesses in bank balance sheets become manifest

and problems in the banking sector begin. 8 Often these problems are more advanced in

the shakier institutions (such as finance companies) than in the major banks.

        The next stage in the crisis unfolds when the central bank begins to provide

support for these institutions by extending credit to them. If the exchange rate is heavily

managed (it does not need to be explicitly pegged), a policy inconsistency arises between

supporting the exchange rate and acting as lender of last resort to troubled institutions.

The very numerous experiences in these studies suggest that (more often than not) the

exchange rate objective is subjugated to the lender of last resort role of the central bank.

Even if central bank lending to the troubled financial industry is limited in scope, the

central bank may be more reluctant to engage in an “interest rate defense” policy to




7
  Reinhart and Rogoff (2004) also examined the relationship between currency crashes and inflation as well
as the currency crash–capital control (specifically, dual or multiple exchange rates) timing.
8
  In contrast to other studies of banking crises, Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999) provide two dates for each
banking crisis episode—the beginning of a banking crisis and the later peak.


                                                                                                       22
defend the currency than would be the case if the financial sector were sound. This brings

the sequence illustrated in Figure 7 to the box labeled currency crash.

        The depreciation or devaluation, as the case may be, complicates the situation in

(at least) three dimensions: (a) it exacerbates the problem of the banks who have

borrowed in a foreign currency, worsening currency mismatches; (b) inflation usually

worsens (The extent to which the currency crisis translates into higher inflation is highly

uneven across countries, as countries with a history of very high and chronic inflation

usually have a much higher and faster pass-through from exchange rates to prices); and

(c) if the government has foreign currency–denominated debt, the currency depreciation

increases the odds of an external and domestic default.

        At this stage, the banking crisis either peaks following the currency crash, if there

 is no sovereign credit crisis, or keeps getting worse as the crisis mounts and the economy

 marches toward a sovereign default (the next box in Figure 7).

        This is a very common pattern in the sequencing of crises. Notice the first entry

there has financial liberalization. And financial liberalization is really not just

liberalization proper, but big innovation, creations of new market. In the current

conjuncture, the creation or the growth of securitization of mortgages is a big factor.

Notice, perhaps more grimly, that the last entry is a debt crisis, which brings me to my

remarks on debt resolution.

          V. From Goodbye Financial Repression, Hello Financial Crash to Goodbye
                   Financial Crash-Hello Financial Repression?


        Periods of high indebtedness have historically been associated with a rising

 incidence of default or restructuring of public and private debts. Sometimes the debt

 restructuring is subtle and takes the form of “financial repression.” In the heavily

 regulated financial markets of the Bretton Woods system, a variety of restrictions

 facilitated a sharp and rapid reduction in public debt/GDP ratios from the late 1940s to

 the 1970s. Reinhart, Kirkeegard, and Sbrancia (2011) document the resurgence of

 financial repression in the wake of the ongoing financial crises and the accompanying

 surge in public debts in advanced economies. This cycle in financial regulation, is

 perhaps the last box in the flow chart shown in Figure 7.

        In light of the record or near-record levels of public and private debt, deficit/debt

 reduction strategies are likely to remain at the forefront of policy discussions in most of




                                                                                            24
the advanced economies for the foreseeable future. 9 Throughout history, debt/GDP ratios

have been reduced by (i) economic growth; (ii) a substantive fiscal adjustment/austerity

plans; (iii) explicit default or restructuring of private and/or public debt; (iv) a sudden

surprise burst in inflation; and (v) a steady dosage of financial repression that is

accompanied by an equally steady dosage of inflation. (Financial repression is defined in

Box 1) It is critical to clarify that options (iv) and (v) are only viable for domestic-

currency debts (the euro area is a special hybrid case). Since these debt-reduction

channels are not necessarily mutually exclusive, historical episodes of debt reduction

have owed to a combination of more than one of these channels.

Financial repression is most successful in liquidating debts when accompanied by a

steady dose of inflation. Low nominal interest rates help reduce debt servicing costs

while a high incidence of negative real interest rates liquidates or erodes the real value of

government debt. Inflation need not take market participants entirely by surprise and, in

effect, it need not be very high (by historic standards).



1. Financial repression defined


           Financial repression includes directed lending to the government by captive

domestic audiences (such as pension funds or domestic banks), explicit or implicit caps

on interest rates, regulation of cross-border capital movements, and (generally) a tighter

connection between government and banks, either explicitly through public ownership of

some of the banks or through heavy “moral suasion”. Financial repression is also

sometimes associated with relatively high reserve requirements (or liquidity


9
    See Reinhart and Rogoff (2010).


                                                                                              25
requirements), securities transaction taxes, prohibition of gold purchases (as in the US

from 1933 to 1974), or the placement of significant amounts of government debt that is

nonmarketable.

In the current policy discussion, financial repression issues come under the broad

umbrella of “macroprudential regulation.”

       We suggest that the combination of high public and private debts in the advanced

economies (and the attendant pressures towards creating captive audiences for

government debt) and the perceived dangers of currency misalignments and

overvaluation in emerging markets facing surges in capital inflows (and, thus, the

pressures towards currency intervention and capital controls) interact to produce a “home

bias” in finance and a resurgence of financial repression. It is not called financial

repression but unfolds in the context of “macroprudential regulation.”

Succinctly, while emerging markets may increasingly look to financial regulatory

measures to keep international capital “out” (especially as the expansive monetary policy

stance of the US and others persists), advanced economies have incentives to keep capital

“in” and create a domestic captive audience to facilitate the financing for the high

existing levels of public debt. Concerned about potential overheating, rising inflationary

pressures and the related competitiveness issues, emerging market economies are altering

the regulatory frameworks that deter cross-border financial flows in their eternal quest for

higher yields. This offers advanced and emerging market economies the common ground

of agreeing to increased regulation and/or restrictions on international financial flows

and, more broadly, the return to more tightly regulated domestic financial environment—

often referred to as “financial repression.”




                                                                                           26
2. Negative real interest rates during 1945-1980 and again post-2008

       One of the main goals of financial repression is to keep nominal interest rates

lower than would otherwise prevail. This effect, other things equal, reduces the

governments’ interest expenses for a given stock of debt and contributes to deficit

reduction. However, when financial repression produces negative real interest rates and

reduces or liquidates existing debts, it is a transfer from creditors (savers) to borrowers

(in the historical episode documented in Reinhart and Sbrancia, 2011 and summarized

here--the government).

       The financial repression tax has some interesting political-economy properties.

Unlike income, consumption, or sales taxes, the “repression” tax rate (or rates) are

determined by financial regulations and inflation performance that are opaque to the

highly politicized realm of fiscal measures. Given that deficit reduction usually involves

highly unpopular expenditure reductions and (or) tax increases of one form or another,

the relatively “stealthier” financial repression tax may be a more politically palatable

alternative to authorities faced with the need to reduce outstanding debts.


        Liberal capital-market regulations and international capital mobility reached their

heyday prior to World War I under the gold standard. However, the Great Depression,

followed by World War II, put the final nails in the coffin of laissez-faire banking. It was

in this environment that the Bretton Woods arrangement of fixed exchange rates and

tightly controlled domestic and international capital markets was conceived. The result

was a combination of very low nominal interest rates and inflationary spurts of varying




                                                                                              27
degrees across the advanced economies. 10 The obvious results were real interest rates--

whether on treasury bills (Figure 8), central bank discount rates, deposits or loans—that

were markedly negative during 1945-1946.


        For the next 35 years or so, real interest rates in both advanced and emerging

economies would remain consistently lower than the eras of freer capital mobility before

and after the financial repression era. In effect, real interest rates were, on average

negative. Binding interest rate ceilings on deposits (which kept real ex-post deposit rates

even more negative than real ex-post rates on treasury bills) “induced” domestic savers to

hold government bonds. What delayed the emergence of leakages in the search for

higher yields (apart from prevailing capital controls) was that the incidence of negative

returns on government bonds and on deposits was (more or less) a universal phenomenon

at this time. The frequency distributions of real rates for the period of financial

repression (1945-1980) and the years following financial liberalization shown in Figure

8, highlights the universality of lower real interest rates prior to the 1980s and the high

incidence of negative real interest rates.


        A striking feature of Figure 8, however, is that real ex-post interest rates (shown

for treasury bills) for the advanced economies have, once again, turned increasingly

negative since the outbreak of the crisis. Real rates have been negative for about one half

of the observations and below one percent for about 82 percent of the observations. This

turn to lower real interest rates has materialized despite the fact that several sovereigns

have bee teetering on the verge of default or restructuring (with the attendant higher risk

premia). Real ex-post central bank discount rates and bank deposit rates (not shown

here) have also become markedly lower since 2007.


       No doubt, a critical factor explaining the high incidence of negative real interest

rates in the wake of the crisis in the aggressively expansive stance of monetary policy

(and more broadly, official central bank intervention) in many advanced and emerging

economies during this period. This raises the broad question of to what extent current

interest rates reflect market conditions versus the stance of official large players in

financial markets. A large role for non-market forces in interest rate determination is a

key feature of financial repression.

                                     Concluding reflections

       I have already discussed the consequences of high public and private debts in the

advanced economies and the attendant pressures towards financial repression to ease the

burden of debt servicing. Not discussed here but a re-enforcing trend isthe perceived

dangers of currency misalignments and overvaluation in emerging markets, and the

attendant pressures towards currency intervention and capital controls—connected to the

broader issue of “macroprudential regulation” a part of the evolving trend toward greater

financial repression.

       The two sets of pressures on central banks, in the North and South, are

complementary. While emerging markets may increasingly look to financial regulatory

measures to keep international capital “out” (especially as the expansive monetary policy

stance of the US and Europe persists-as it is likely), advanced economies have incentives

to keep capital “in” and create a domestic captive audience to facilitate the financing for

the high existing levels of public debt. Concerned about potential overheating, rising

inflationary pressures and the related competitiveness issues, emerging market economies

may welcome changes in the regulatory landscape that keep financial flows at home

rather than let them spill across borders. This offers advanced and emerging market

economies the common ground of agreeing to increased regulation and/or restrictions on

international financial flows and, more broadly, the return to more tightly regulated

domestic financial environment—“financial repression.”

       The scenario sketched here entails both financial de-globalization (the re-

appearance of home bias in finance) and the re-emergence of more heavily regulated

domestic financial markets. As some of these trends are already unfolding in individual




                                                                                          31
countries, it is a useful exercise to examine these developments as part of a broader

global picture.
