                                          ABSTRACT

A substantial amount of money is spent on technology by schools, families and policymakers
with the hope of improving educational outcomes. This paper explores the theoretical and
empirical literature on the impacts of technology on educational outcomes. The literature focuses
on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for educational purposes: i) classroom
use in schools, and ii) home use by students. Theoretically, ICT investment and CAI use by
schools and the use of computers at home have ambiguous implications for educational
achievement: expenditures devoted to technology necessarily offset inputs that may be more or
less efficient, and time allocated to using technology may displace traditional classroom
instruction and educational activities at home. However, much of the evidence in the schooling
literature is based on interventions that provide supplemental funding for technology or additional
class time, and thus favor finding positive effects. Nonetheless, studies of ICT and CAI in schools
produce mixed evidence with a pattern of null results. Notable exceptions to this pattern occur in
studies of developing countries and CAI interventions that target math rather than language. In
the context of home use, early studies based on multivariate and instrumental variables
approaches tend to find large positive (and in a few cases negative) effects while recent studies
based on randomized control experiments tend to find small or null effects. Early research
focused on developed countries while more recently several experiments have been conducted in
developing countries.

1. Introduction

       Schools and families around the world spend a substantial amount of money on

computers, software, Internet connections, and other technology for educational purposes. The

use of technology is ubiquitous in the educational system in most developed countries. For

example, essentially all instructional classrooms in U.S. public schools have computers with

Internet access (U.S. Department of Education 2012). Most countries in Europe also have high

rates of computer access in schools (European Commission 2013). In addition to school level

investment in technology, central governments frequently play an active role in providing or

subsidizing investment in computer and Internet access. The U.S. federal government spends

more than $2 billion and recently increased the spending cap to $3.9 billion per year on the E-

rate program, which provides discounts to schools and libraries for the costs of

telecommunications services and equipment (Puma, et al. 2000, Universal Services

Administration Company 2013, Federal Communications Commission 2014). England provided

free computers to nearly 300,000 low-income families at a total cost of £194 million through the

Home Access Programme. 1 A growing number of schools are experimenting with one-to-one

laptop or tablet programs that provide a computer to each student and often allow the student to

take the computer home (Warschauer 2006; Maine Education Policy Research Institute 2007;

Texas Center for Educational Research 2009). 2 These programs are potentially expensive -- for

example, equipping each of the 50 million public school students in the United States with a

  The Euro 200 Program in Romania and the Yo Elijo Mi PC Program in Chile are additional examples of
government programs providing computers to low-income children.
2
  Extensive efforts to provide laptops to schoolchildren also exist in many developing countries. For
example, the One Laptop per Child program has provided more than 2 million computers to schools in
Uruguay, Peru, Argentina, Mexico and Rwanda, and started new projects in Gaza, Afghanistan, Haiti,
Ethiopia and Mongolia. See http://one.laptop.org/about/countries.

laptop would cost tens of billions of dollars each year even if these laptops were replaced only

every three years.

        Families also spend a substantial amount of money on computers, software, and Internet

connections each year. In the United States, for example, 86 percent of schoolchildren have

access to a computer at home. Although current levels of access to home computers and Internet

connections among schoolchildren are very high, access is not evenly distributed across

countries or across the population within countries. Less than one quarter of schoolchildren in

Indonesia, for example, have access to a computer at home that they can use for schoolwork. In

the United States, 98 percent of the 12 million schoolchildren living in households with $100,000

or more in income have access to a computer at home, but only 67 percent of the 12 million

schoolchildren living in households with less than $25,000 in income have access. These

disparities in access to home computers and the Internet are known as the Digital Divide.

        A better understanding of how computer technology affects educational outcomes is

critical because it sheds light on whether such technology is an important input in the educational

production process and whether disparities in access will translate into educational inequality.

This paper explores the theory and literature on the impacts of technology on educational

outcomes. Although technology is a broad term, the paper focuses on the effects of computers,

the Internet, and software such as computer assisted instruction, which are currently the most

relevant forms of new technology in education. 3 The discussion focuses primarily on the impacts

of computers, the Internet and software on educational outcomes instead of impacts on other

forms of human capital such as computer skills (although we discuss a few studies). 4 We

  Computer skills training (CST) or computer science, which are vocational or academic subjects with
benefits in the labor market, have generally been of less interest in the area of the economics of education.

consider studies that examine the impacts of technology on measurable educational outcomes,

such as grades, test scores, retention, graduation, and attendance. Attention is also largely, but

not entirely, restricted to studies from the economics literature.

        The literature focuses on two primary contexts in which technology may be used for

educational purposes: i) classroom use in schools, and ii) home use by students. These contexts

differ fundamentally in terms of who makes the investment decision and who controls how the

technology is used. Districts and schools determine the level of technology investment and

control how it is used in the classroom to aid instruction. Parents and students make decisions

over investment in computers, the Internet, software, and other technologies at home. One

unifying theme of the discussion is that the use of technology is placed in the context of

educational production functions commonly discussed in the economics literature.

        Investment in computer hardware, software and connectivity may offset other inputs that

affect student achievement in the context of the household and the school. Likewise, time spent

using computers offsets other educational or recreational activities. We discuss the extent to

which the estimates in the literature reflect these tradeoffs. Investment in computers for schools

is divided into two broad areas: i) investment in information and communications technologies

(ICT) generally, such as computer hardware and Internet connections, and ii) specific software

used for computer aided instruction (CAI). Computer use at home poses a unique challenge for

estimation as the context is less conducive to policy interventions and randomized trials. We




Angrist and Lavy (2002) note that “CST skills seems undeniably useful, just as typing was a useful skill
taught in American high schools earlier in the twentieth century, but most of the recent interest in the
educational use of computers focuses on CAI and not CST.” We also do not focus on the analysis of the
relationship between technology and the labor market for which there has been an extensive literature.

2. Technology Use in Schools

2.1 Estimates of rates of technology use in schools

       Access to computers in public schools has increased manifold in the last thirty years. In

the United States, there were only 0.008 computers per student in 1984, or 1 computer per 125

students (Coley, Cadler, and Engel 1997). Figure 1 displays recent trends in the number of

computers per student based on data from the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES).

As recently as 1998, there were 0.15 computers per student and only half of these computers had

Internet access. The most recent data available from the NCES, which is from 2008, indicates

that there are 0.32 computers per student and essentially all computers have Internet access.

       Germany, the UK, Japan, and other OECD countries also have high levels of computer

access. Table 1 reports the average number of computers available per student for the 50 most

populous countries in the world with data reported in the 2012 Programme for International

Student Assessment (PISA) conducted by the OECD. These data indicate that there are 0.95

computers per 15 year-old student in the U.S., 1.02 in the United Kingdom, 0.65 in Germany,
                                                5
and 0.56 in Japan. PISA data contain, to the best of our knowledge, the most uniform measure of

computer access across all countries, but provide estimates of the number of computers per

student that are much higher than most other sources. For example, the PISA estimates are nearly

three times higher for the United States than those reported by the NCES, which is likely partly

due to counting the number of “available” computers to students of a specific age, including

those shared with students in other grades, but is also partly due to the most recent NCES data

being from 2008. 5

        Table 2 presents the results of the European Commission’s survey of school computer

access and use. The survey reveals rates of computer access more similar to those in the U.S. for

several countries, including Austria, Denmark and Spain. Across all EU countries represented in

the study, there are 0.20 computers per student in the 8th grade and 0.33 computers per student in

the 11th grade. More than 50 percent of middle school students in the EU reported using a

computer during lessons at least once each week. It is clear that the computer has become a

regular part of classroom instruction in developed countries. 6

        Interestingly, in the United States, schools serving students from the lowest income

households have an almost identical number of computers per student as schools serving

wealthier households (U.S. Department of Education 2012), though the quality of these

computers may differ. However, there is a notable digital divide across countries. Many

developing countries still have relatively low rates of computer and Internet access. PISA reports

5
  To create their measure of computers per student, PISA uses responses to the following two questions:
"At your school, what is the total number of students in the <national modal grade for 15-year-olds>?,"
and "Approximately, how many computers are available for these students for educational purposes?"
This measure is different than those collected by other institutions such as the U.S. Department of
Education, the European Commission, and UNESCO. These institutions consider the total number of
school computers and the total number of school students.
6
  Simple counts of computers and Internet connections provide only a general sense of each country’s
level of technology adoption. Potentially important differences in the quality of technology and the
intensity of technology use (e.g. hours per day) are rarely documented in a systematic way.

computer access rates in Brazil, Romania, Turkey, and Vietnam that are approximately one-

fourth those in developed countries. UNESCO (2014) reports that the Philippines has more than

400 students per computer. 7 Due to a lack of uniform data over time, it is difficult to determine

the rate at which computer access is changing in many countries and how persistent the digital

divide is likely to be.



2.2 Theory

Access to computers in schools may improve student outcomes in several ways. Computer

software has the potential to provide self-paced instruction that is typically difficult to achieve in

group instruction (Koedinger et al. 1997). Likewise, the content of instruction may be

individualized to the strengths and weaknesses of the student. Because students can use

instructional programs without the direct supervision of a teacher, ICTs and computer aided

instruction hold the promise of increasing the overall amount of instruction that students receive

(Cuban 1993 and Barrow, Markman, and Rouse 2009), while still allowing parents and teachers

to monitor student progress. The Internet represents a potentially valuable resource for finding

out information about a wide range of educational topics for reducing the coordination costs of

group projects. Computers, the Internet, software and other technologies, because of their

interactive nature, may engage schoolchildren in ways that traditional methods cannot (Cuban

2003). Further, enhanced computer skills may alter the economic returns to education, especially

in fields in which computers are used extensively. These factors, in addition to the direct benefits




7
 The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) Institute for Statistics
has recently been tasked with improving global data on ICT availability and use (UNESCO 2009). While
UNESCO has produced reports for several regions since 2012 (Latin America, the Caribbean, and the
Arab States), the coverage is still quite limited.

                                                   7
of being computer literate in the workplace, society and higher education, are behind the decision

to invest in ICT and CAI in schools.

        The most relevant policy question of interest is whether schools are choosing the optimal

levels of technology relative to traditional inputs. That is, with limited financial resources and

instructional time, can schools, district, states, or countries increase academic achievement by

investing more in technology. The answer to this question necessarily involves a trade-off

between inputs. Financial investment in computers, Internet connections, software and other

ICTs is likely to offset investment in traditional resources such as teachers and textbooks.

Likewise, time spent using computers in the classroom may offset traditional group instruction

by the teacher or independent learning by the student. These tradeoffs imply that the theoretical

predictions of the effect of ICT and CAI investment are ambiguous.

        Computer resources can be added to a standard model of education production (for

examples in the literature see Hanushek 1979, 1986; Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain 2005; Figlio

1999; and Todd and Wolpin 2003). The binding constraints in such models are the budget for

school resources and the amount of class time available for instruction. With these constraints,

the comparison of interest is the effectiveness of a dollar invested in ICT relative to a dollar

invested in traditional school resources and, analogously, the effectiveness of an hour of

classroom time allocated to CAI relative to an hour of traditional instruction. In practice,

however, the literature frequently estimates the effect of supplemental investment in ICT and

supplemental class time using CAI. 8 These estimates of the effect of ICT and CAI reflect

whether technology can have a positive effect on education in the absence of constraints.


8
  The distinction between estimates based on inputs that are supplements to, rather than substitutes for,
traditional instruction is rarely made adequately in the literature. A notable exception is Linden (2008),
which makes the distinction the focal point of parallel experiments – one that substitutes for traditional
instruction with CAI and another that provides supplemental CAI outside of regular school hours.

                                                     8
         We consider a model of value-added education that provides a framework in which to

discuss the empirical studies discussed in the following section. 9



(2.1) Ait=f(Xit,Ait-1,Sit,Cit,TitS,TitC) s.t.   PtSSit + PtCCit ≤ Bt      and    TitS + TitC ≤ T



A measure of academic achievement, Ait, is assumed to depend on the characteristics of a student

and his or her family, Xit, prior year achievement, Ait-1, investment in traditional and computer

resources, Sit and Cit, and time allocated to traditional and computer instruction, TitS and TitC. The

investments Sit and Cit can be thought of as a per-student average allocation if they are not chosen

at the student level, subject to prices PtS and PtC and a per-student budget Bit. Likewise, the

amount of time spent on traditional and computer instruction is constrained by total available

instructional time T. Note that this model could also be considered at the level of a specific

subject of interest. Conversely, if schools or districts cannot choose individual specific input

levels, academic outcomes and inputs could be in the aggregate (e.g. the median score on a math

exam).

         If schools choose the optimal levels of investment and time allocation, then an exogenous

reallocation toward technology will result in a negative or zero effect on the educational

outcome. If schools do not make optimal choices, then the resulting change is likely to depend on

several factors. Shifting investment to technology may have a direct effect on the quality of

instruction. Greater investment in technology could improve the effectiveness of time dedicated

to computer-based instruction and the corresponding reduction in traditional resources may

reduce    the    effectiveness      of   time    dedicated     to      traditional   instruction.   Of   course,


9
  See Hanushek (1979) for an early discussion of value-added models in the economics of education
literature.

                                                        9
complementarities between certain technologies and teacher skills could offset some of the

negative effect on traditional instruction. These effects, holding the respective time allocations

fixed, will be positive if ∂A/∂C > ∂A/∂S. However, schools may change the allocation of

instructional time in response to the change in resources. For example, a school with more

computers may allocate more time to computer-based instruction and less to group instruction

led by a teacher. Thus the total effect of changing the allocation of financial resources may also

reflect a reallocation of instructional time, [∂A/∂C + ∂A/∂TC*∂TC/∂C] – [∂A/∂S +

∂A/∂TS*∂TS/∂S].

       This model can be extended to account for different assumptions about the allocation of

classroom time. First, computers may increase the total amount of instruction a student receives

if teachers must divide their time between group and individual instruction. In this scenario,

some traditional class time, TS, is wasted for students and CAI can fill in these down periods.

This should cause increased investment in ICT, and CAI in particular, to be more likely to have a

positive effect on educational outcomes. Alternatively, students may use computers for non-

instructional activities that offset instructional time. Furthermore, mechanical problems with

technology could create instructional downtime. That is, some computer-based instructional

time, TC, may be wasted and thus crowd out more productive instruction. This should cause ICT

investment to be more likely to have a negative effect. We discuss each of these adjustments to

the model and the implications for interpreting estimates in the literature.

       Barrow, Markman, and Rouse (2009) propose a model to argue that CAI may increase

total instructional time during a class period or school day. They assume that a teacher j divides

class time between providing group instruction, TjG, and individualized instruction for each

student i, Tij. Each student receives group instruction and his or her share of individual



                                                 10
instruction. Computer instruction, TiC, provides supplemental instruction during periods when the

teacher is giving individual instruction to other students. This model differs from the baseline

model presented above in that CAI replaces down time rather than traditional instruction. The

revised constraints make these trade-offs clear.



(2.2)   TjtG + Tijt + TitC ≤ T and TjtG + ∑Tijt ≤ Tj



The return to computer-based instruction, ∂A/∂TC, is not offset by a reduction in traditional

instruction, ∂A/∂TS. Modeled in this way, CAI will improve academic outcomes if it provides

any academic benefit: f(Xit,Ait-1,Tit,TtG,TitC) ≥ f(Xit,Ait-1,Tit,TtG, 0). 10

        Belo, Ferreira, and Telang (2014) model a case in which time spent using computers is

not necessarily productive. For example, students may use computers to watch videos or engage

in social networking activities that do not improve traditional academic outcomes. In this case,

computer time TC is divided between learning time TL and distraction time TD. Thus the new time

constraint is TitS + TitL + TitD ≤ T. This implies that the difference in the marginal returns, ∂A/∂TC

– ∂A/∂TS, depends on both the effectiveness of TL relative to TS and the share of TC that is spent

on non-instructional activities. These two models highlight that the effects of CAI estimated in

the literature may stem from differences in the quality of the two types of instruction or changes

in productive instructional time.

        In practice, many empirical studies identify the effects of ICT investment using policies

that increase investment in technology at “treated” schools but not at “control” schools without

10
  Note that time not allocated to active teacher or computer instruction is modeled to have no academic
benefit for the student. In practice, time spent receiving individualized computer instruction is substituting
for whatever the students would have been doing during this time, which may have been independent
learning. Thus the estimated effect of CAI in this model may be the benefit of CAI relative to independent
learning.

                                                       11
an offsetting reduction in traditional resources. For example, policies exploited by Angrist and

Lavy (2002) and Leuven et al. (2007) create some schools that are “winners” and receive larger

shares of national ICT investment. 11 These designs seem to favor finding a positive effect

relative to a design in which investment must satisfy the budget constraint. Specifically, there

does not need to be an offsetting reduction in traditional resources. That is, these designs may

estimate [∂A/∂C + ∂A/∂TC*∂TC/∂C] – [∂A/∂TS*∂TS/∂S] without the offsetting effect ∂A/∂S.

Further, there could be an income effect that increases investment in traditional resources (e.g. if

funding normally used for computers is used to hire teachers’ aides). Thus a positive effect could

be found even if the marginal dollar of investment in technology is not more effective than the

marginal dollar invested in traditional resources, and (perhaps) even if technology has no benefit

for educational production. Despite the fact that these designs favor finding positive effects, they

could nonetheless produce negative estimates if time is reallocated to computer-based instruction

and this has smaller returns than traditional instruction (e.g. if a high fraction of computer time is

non-instructional). It is also possible that schools may reallocate funds away from traditional

instruction to maintain or support investments in technology.

       An analogous discussion is relevant for interpreting the results in the CAI literature. If

CAI substitutes for traditional instruction, then the estimated effect is a comparison of the

marginal effects of traditional instruction and CAI (i.e. ∂A/∂TC – ∂A/∂TS). This is the economic

and policy question of interest. However, many policies and experiments used to evaluate CAI

increase a student’s instructional time in a specific subject (e.g. Rouse and Krueger 2004) or total

instructional time (e.g. Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden 2007). This occurs when non-

academic classes or classes dedicated to other subjects are reallocated to the subject being


11
  Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) exploit the E-Rate subsidy that results in varying prices of computing
across schools and thus has both a price and an income effect.

                                                  12
considered, or when instruction is offered outside of regular school hours. That is, the estimated

effects in the literature frequently reflect an increase in T rather than just an increase in TC and

the corresponding reduction in TS. Thus the results should be interpreted as some combination of

the effect of substituting CAI for traditional instruction and increasing instructional time. It is

worth noting that the benefits of CAI, like those of ICT more broadly, may be attenuated if

students use computers for non-academic purposes instead of the intended instruction.

        Therefore, many empirical studies on ICT and CAI are structured in favor of finding

positive effects on academic outcomes. Interpreting and comparing the estimates in the literature

requires careful consideration of whether computer resources are supplementing or substituting

for traditional investment. Estimates across studies are also likely to differ due to variation in

treatment intensity (the amount of financial investment or the number of hours dedicated to

computer use), the duration of the treatment, the quality of the investment, and the quality of the

traditional investment or instruction that is offset.



2.3 Empirical Findings

2.3.1 Information and Communication Technologies Investment

        Research on the effects of ICT investment in schools has closely mirrored the broader

literature on the effects of school investment (see, for example, Betts 1996; Hanushek, Rivkin,

and Taylor 1996; and Hanushek 2006). Early studies of ICT in the education literature focused

on case studies and cross-sectional comparisons (see Kirkpatrick and Cuban 1998; Noll, et al.

2000 for reviews). Studies in the economics literature have often exploited natural policy

experiments to generate variation over time in ICT investment (e.g. Angrist and Lavy 2002;

Goolsbee and Guryan 2006; Leuven 2007; Machin, McNally, and Silva 2007). Recent studies of



                                                  13
CAI have generally relied on randomized control trials (e.g. Rouse and Krueger 2004; Banerjee,

Cole, Duflo, and Linden 2007; Mathematica 2009; Carillo, Onofa and Ponce 2010; Mo et al.

2014). This section focuses on three important dimensions of variation in the literature: 1) the

type of investment (ICT or CAI); 2) the research design (cross-sectional, natural experiment, or

RCT); and 3) the interaction of the investment with traditional instruction (supplemental or

substituting).

        Fuchs and Woessmann (2004) examine international evidence on the correlation between

computer access in schools (and homes) and performance on PISA, an internationally

administered standardized exam. They show that simple cross-sectional estimates for 32

countries might be biased due to the strong correlation between school computers and other

school resources. The authors note that evidence based on cross-sectional differences must be

interpreted cautiously. Omitted variables are likely to generate positive bias in cross-country

comparisons. However, cross-sectional estimates within countries may exhibit negative bias if

governments target resources to schools that serve higher proportions of students from low

income households. Once they control for an extensive set of family background and school

characteristics, they find an insignificant relationship between academic achievement and the

availability of school computers.

        Most recent research on ICT investment has exploited policies that promote investment in

computer hardware or Internet access. The majority of studies find that such policies result in

increased computer use in schools, but few studies find positive effects on educational outcomes.

This is in spite of the fact that many of these studies exploit policies that provide ICT investment

that supplements traditional investment. The results suggest that ICT does not generate gains in

academic outcomes or that schools allow computer-based instruction to crowd out traditional



                                                14
instruction. Regardless, a null result in this context is a stronger result than if there was a binding

constraint that required substitution away from investment and time allocated to other inputs.

        Angrist and Lavy (2002) find higher rates of computer availability in more disadvantaged

schools in Israel, which may be due to the Israeli school system directing resources to schools on

a remedial basis. Thus cross-sectional estimates of the effect of computer access are likely to be

biased downward. To address this, the authors exploit a national program that provided

computers and computer training for teachers in elementary and middle schools. The allocation

of computers was based on which towns and regional authorities applied for the program, with

the highest priority given to towns with a high fraction of stand-alone middle schools. They

present reduced-form estimates of the effect of the program on student test scores and they use

the program as an instrumental variable to estimate the effect of computer aided instruction

(defined broadly) on test scores. 12 Survey results indicate that the computers were used for

instruction, but the authors find negative and insignificant effects of the program on test scores.

While the identification strategy estimates the effects of supplemental financial investment in

ICT, it did not necessarily result in supplemental class time, so the estimates may reflect the

tradeoff between computer aided and traditional instruction. The authors argue that computer use

may have displaced other more productive educational activities or consumed school resources

that might have prevented a decline in achievement.

        The finding that ICT investment generates limited educational gains is common in the

literature. Leuven et al. (2007) exploit a policy in the Netherlands that provided additional

funding for computers and software to schools with more than seventy percent disadvantaged

students. Using a regression discontinuity design, they find that while additional funding is not


12
  An identifying assumption for the instrumental variables interpretation is that CAI is the sole channel
by which computers would positively or negatively affect academic performance.

                                                    15
spent on more or newer computers, students do spend more time on a computer in school

(presumably due to new software). But the estimates suggest a negative and insignificant effect

on most test score outcomes. The authors come to a similar to conclusion as Angrist and Lavy

(2002) that computer instruction may be less effective than traditional instruction.

        In the United States, Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) examine the federal E-Rate subsidy for

Internet investment in California schools. The subsidy rate was tied to a school’s fraction of

students eligible for a free or reduced lunch, which generated variation in the rate of Internet

investment, creating both an income and price effect. 13 Schools that received larger subsidies had

an incentive to offset spending on traditional inputs with spending on Internet access. The

authors find increased rates of Internet connectivity in schools, but do not find increases in test

scores or other academic outcomes. The authors note that access to the Internet may not improve

measurable student achievement and that promoting early adoption of technology may result in

schools investing too soon in technologies and thus acquiring inferior or higher-cost products. In

a more recent paper, Belo, Ferreira, and Telang (2014) examine if broadband use generates a

distraction that reduces academic performance in Portugal. They find very large negative effects

when using proximity to the internet provider as an instrument for the quality of the internet

connection and time spend using broadband.

        More recently, Cristia et al. (2014) examine the introduction of the Huascaran program in

Peru between 2001 and 2006. The program provided hardware and non-educational software to a

selected set of schools chosen on the basis of enrollment levels, physical access to the schools,

and commitment to adopt computer use. Using various weighting and matching techniques, they

find no effect of the program on whether students repeat a grade, drop out, or enroll in secondary

13
  The authors attempt to exploit discrete cutoffs in prices to implement a regression discontinuity design.
Unfortunately, this does not result in a strong enough first stage to generate reliable estimates, so they
exploit time variation in a difference-in-differences design.

                                                    16
school after primary school. These studies highlight the importance of considering the policy

estimates in the context of an educational production function that considers classroom inputs

and time allocation. Despite ICT funding being supplemental to traditional investment,

computers may reduce the use of traditional inputs given time constraints.

       There are, however, exceptions to the finding that ICT investment does not generate

educational gains. Machin, McNally, and Silva (2007) exploit a change in how government ICT

funds are allocated in England to generate variation in the timing of investment. This approach

results in generally positive estimates for academic outcomes. The authors note that their results

may be positive and significant in part because the schools that experienced the largest increases

in ICT investment were already effective and thus may have used the investment efficiently.

Barrera-Osorio and Linden (2009) find somewhat inconclusive results with statistically

insignificant, but point estimates of effects, when they evaluate a randomized experiment at one

hundred public schools as part of the “Computers for Education” program in Colombia. The

program provided schools with computers and teacher training with an emphasis on language

education, but they find that the increase in computer use was not primarily in the intended

subject area, Spanish, but rather in computer science classes. Teacher and student surveys reveal

that teachers did not incorporate the computers into their curriculum.

       A recent trend in educational technology policy is to ensure that every student has his or

her own laptop or tablet computer, which is likely to be a much more intensive treatment (in

terms of per-student time spent using a computer) than those exploited in the policies discussed

above. One of the first large scale one-to-one laptop programs was conducted in Maine in 2002,

in which all 7th and 8th grade students and their teachers were provided with laptops to use in

school. Comparing writing achievement before and after the introduction of laptops, it was found



                                                17
that writing performance improved by approximately one-third of a standard deviation (Maine

Education Policy Research Institute 2007). Grimes and Warschauer (2008) and Suhr et al. (2010)

examine the performance of students at schools that implemented a one laptop program in

Farrington School District in California relative to students at non-laptop schools. They find

evidence that junior high school test scores declined in the first year of the program. Likewise,

scores in reading declined for 4th grade students during the first year. At both grade levels,

however, the scores increased in the second year, offsetting the initial decline. This pattern may

reflect the fixed costs of adopting computer technology effectively. The changes in these cases

are relatively modest in magnitude, but are statistically significant.

       A study of the Texas laptop program by the Texas Center for Educational Research

(2009) exploited trends at twenty-one schools that adopted the program relative to a matched

control group. Schools were matched on factors including district and campus size, region,

proportion of economically disadvantaged and minority students, and performance on the Texas

Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS). The laptop program was found to have some

positive effects on educational outcomes. Cristia et al. (2012) were able to exploit a government

implemented randomized control trial (RCT) to estimate the effect of a laptop policy in Peru.

After fifteen months, they find no significant effect on math or language test scores and small

positive effects on cognitive skills.

       Taken as a whole, the literature examining the effect of ICT investment is characterized

by findings of little or no positive effect on most academic outcomes. The exception to this is

mixed positive effects of one-laptop initiatives. The modest returns to computer investment is

especially informative in light of the fact that nearly all of the estimates are based on policies and

experiments that provided supplemental ICT investment. The lack of positive effects is



                                                 18
consistent across studies that exploit policy variation and randomized control trials. Because

these initiatives do not necessarily increase class time, the findings may suggest that technology

aided instruction is not superior to traditional instruction. This finding may be highly dependent

on specifically what technology is adopted and how it is integrated into a school’s curriculum.

The studies above generally do not specify the way in which ICT was used. In the next section,

we examine studies that focus on the use of specific, well-defined software programs to promote

mathematics and language learning.



2.3.2 Computer Assisted Instruction

       Computer aided instruction is the use of specific software programs on computers in the

classroom. 14 Frequently these programs are individualized or self-paced in order to

accommodate differences in student ability or speed. CAI lends itself to evaluation using

randomized control trials because access to software can be offered at the student or classroom

level. CAI frequently targets a specific subject area that is tested before and after the software is

introduced. Kulik and Kulik (1991) and Liao (1992) summarize the early education literature,

which generally suggests positive effects. The evidence from economic studies is mixed and

suggests that the characteristics of the intervention are important. Studies in this area differ

significantly in the extent to which CAI is a substitute or a supplement to traditional instruction.

Interestingly, evidence of positive effects appears to be the strongest in developing countries.




14
  Computer aided instruction (CAI), computer aided learning (CAL), and E-learning are used
synonymously in the economics and education literatures.

                                                 19
This could be due to the fact that the instruction that is being substituted for is not as of high

quality in these countries. 15

        Rouse and Krueger’s (2004) evaluation of “Fast ForWord”, a language and reading

program, is one of the earliest examples of evaluating a specific CAI using an RCT. They

conducted a randomized study that exploited within-school, within-grade variation at four

schools that serve a high fraction of non-native English speakers in the northeastern United

States. The intervention pulled students out of their otherwise scheduled classes to receive 90-

100 minutes of individualized computer aided instruction. The instruction these students missed

was not necessarily in reading and language, so treated students received supplemental

instruction in this subject area as a result. Despite the construction of the experiment, which

favors gains in reading and language skills, they find little to no positive effects across a range of

standardized tests that should be correlated with reading and language skills. The authors argue

that computers may not be as effective as traditional classroom instruction.

        In a large randomized study, the U.S. Department of Education and Mathematica Policy

Research (2007, 2009) evaluated six reading and four math software products for students in

elementary, middle, and high school. Randomization was across teachers within the same

schools. Nine of the ten products were found to have no statistically significant effect, while the

tenth product (used for 4th grade reading) had a positive effect. The study also examined how

usage and effects changed between the first and the second years of implementation, allowing

the researchers to test if teacher experience with the products was an important determinant of

outcomes. They found that usage actually decreased on average in the second year and there

were no positive effects.

15
  There are well documented deficiencies in teacher quality and attendance and other education factors in
developing countries. For example, Chaudhury et al. (2006) examine the rate of teacher absenteeism,
which is 19 percent, and teacher effort in Bangladesh, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Peru and Uganda.

                                                   20
       Some studies, however, find positive effects of CAI initiatives. Barrow, Markman and

Rouse (2009) exploit a within-school randomization at the classroom level in three large urban

districts in the U.S. They find statistically significant positive effects of computer aided

instruction when treated classes are taught in the computer lab using pre-algebra and algebra

software. They also find some evidence that the effects are larger for classrooms with greater

enrollment, which is consistent with the predictions of their model of time allocation (discussed

in Section 2.2). The authors note that such effects may not translate to different software or

different schools, but conclude that the positive findings suggest that CAI deserves additional

evaluation and policy attention especially because it is relatively easy to implement compared

with other interventions.

       Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and Linden (2007) note that the generally insignificant effects of

computer interventions in developed countries may not hold in developing countries where

computers may replace teachers with less motivation and training. They test an intervention in

India in which trained instructors guided students through two hours of computer instruction per

week, one hour of which was outside of the regular school day. Thus the intervention was a

combination of guided computer instruction by a supplemental instructor and additional class

time. They find that the intervention has large and statistically significant effects on math scores,

but also find significant fade-out in subsequent years. However, Linden (2008) finds very

different results when attempting to separate the effects of in-class “substitution” for standard

instruction from out-of-school “complements”. Using two randomized experiments, test score

effects for 2nd and 3rd graders in India were large and negative for the in-school intervention

and insignificant and positive for the out-of-school intervention. The negative in-school results

could stem from the fact that the program was implemented in “well-functioning network of



                                                 21
NGO-run schools” or that the specific software being used was ineffective. That is, both the

nature of the technology and what is being substituted for are important considerations when

evaluating effect sizes.

        Carrillo, Onofa and Ponce (2010) find positive effects of the Personalized

Complementary and Interconnected Learning software in Ecuador. The program was randomized

at the school level and provided three hours of individualized math and language instruction to

treated students each week. The initiative produced positive gains on math scores and no effect

on language scores. Mo et al. (2014) conduct a randomized experiment at 72 rural schools in

China. The intervention provided 80 minutes of supplemental math instruction (math based

computer games) per week during what would otherwise be a computer skills class. The

intervention was estimated to generate an increase in math scores of 0.17 standard deviations for

both 3rd and 5th grade students. It is important to note that the instruction was supplemental both

in terms of providing additional mathematics instruction and not offsetting another academic

subject. 16

        In an analysis of randomized interventions (both technological and non-technological) in

developing countries, Kremer, Brannen, and Glennerster (2013) hypothesize that CAI tailored to

each student may be the most effective. McEwan (2014) concludes that computer based

interventions in primary schools have higher average effects (0.15 standard deviations) than

teacher training, smaller classes, and performance incentives. However, he makes the important

point that it is “misleading” to compare effect sizes without considering cost.



2.3.3 Computer Skills

16
 The authors note that their results may differ from Linden (2008) due to the fact “that by integrating the
CAL program during a relatively unproductive period of time…the substitution effect may have been
minimized.”

                                                    22
       Computer use in schools may benefit students in two ways: through the acquisition of

computer skills that are useful in the labor market; and through the acquisition of basic skills

such as math, reading, and writing. The economics literature has provided different justifications

for focusing on the effectiveness of computers as a pedagogical tool for acquiring basic skills.

Angrist and Lavy (2002) argue that computer skills training (CST) “seems undeniably useful”

whereas the evidence for CAI “is both limited and mixed”. Fuchs and Woessmann (2004)

provide the antithetical justification for focusing on CAI, arguing that the literature finds little

evidence that computer skills have “direct returns on the labor market” whereas the returns to

basic academic skills are undeniable. There is clearly a need for more research on the effect of

computer skills on labor market outcomes.

       Most of the studies discussed in this paper do not estimate the effect of ICT on computer

skills. A primary challenge is that academic exams do not provide a direct measure of computer

skills, so these benefits may go unmeasured. For example, Goolsbee and Guryan (2006) note that

ICT may “build skills that are unmeasured by standard tests”. Several studies find evidence that

enhance education in computer skills may be the primary result of many initiatives. For example,

Barrera-Osorio and Linden (2009) find a significant increase in computer use in computer

science and not in any other subject. Likewise, Bet, Ibarrarán and Cristia (2014) find that

increased availability of technology affected time spent teaching digital skills, but computers

were not used in math and language. Recent one-to-one laptop program policies have highlighted

the need for “21st century skills”, which go beyond basic computer skills and are likely even

more difficult to measure.



2.3.4 Online College Courses



                                                23
       A new and rapidly growing area of research related to CAI is estimating the effectiveness

of online instruction for college courses. In this context, online education is frequently a method

for delivering traditional instruction (e.g. streaming videos of college lectures). The primary

question of interest is how student performance in online courses compares to performance in the

equivalent traditional course. Evidence from the first wave of studies appears to show that, at this

time, Internet courses are less effective than in-person instruction. However, because online

courses are lower cost per student, performance differences do not necessarily mean that online

courses are not cost effective. Further, online courses may expand the number of students able to

take courses due to financial, enrollment, or geographic constraints.

       Several recent studies exploit randomized assignment of students to online and in-person

education at the college level. Figlio et al. (2013) conduct a randomized experiment at a U.S.

university and find evidence that in-person instruction results in higher performance in

introductory microeconomics, especially for males, Hispanics, and lower-achieving students.

Alpert, Couch and Harmon (2015) use a random experiment to evaluate instruction in an

introductory economics course by traditional face-to-face classroom instruction, blended face-to-

face and online instruction, and exclusive online instruction. They find evidence of negative

effects on learning outcomes from online instruction relative to traditional instruction, but no

evidence of negative effects from blended instruction relative to traditional instruction. Bowen et

al. (2014) conduct an experiment at six college campuses to compare traditional instruction to

“hybrid” in-person and online instruction for a statistics course. They find no significant

performance difference in performance between the two groups. Bettinger et al. (2014), using

variation in access to in-person courses as an instrument, find lower performance and higher

variation for students enrolled in online courses. Patterson (2014) proposes internet distractions



                                                24
as a possible reason for reduced performance in online courses. He conducts an experiment

which finds that student performance improves when they use a commitment device to limit

access to certain webpages. In related work, Joyce et al. (2014) find experimental evidence that

the frequency of class meetings remains important even when course materials are available

online.



Summary

Several patterns emerge when evaluating the effects of computer use in schools. Divisions in the

literature emerge in terms of the nature of the intervention being studied, the research design, the

parameter being estimated, and the school context. We provide an overview of each study and its

key characteristics and findings in Table 4. The most prominent distinction is the division

between ICT and CAI focused studies, which tend to coincide with methodological differences.

The high cost of ICT hardware and connections, and the fact that it does not target specific

students has meant that the majority of rigorous empirical research has exploited natural

experiments generated by government policies. In contrast, several studies evaluating CAI

software, which can target specific classrooms or students, have used randomized control trial

designs. It is important to note that despite the division between these two types of studies, ICT

investment is likely to be a necessary condition for making CAI available. 17

          Both ICT and CAI produce somewhat mixed evidence of the effect of computers on

student outcomes, though there appears to be more evidence of positive effects in studies of CAI.

There are several reasons why CAI studies may be more likely to find positive effects. One

explanation is methodological. Beyond differences in research design, it may be the case that

17
  This has a direct analogue in the economics of education literature more broadly. Many studies examine
how funding affects student outcomes (with little regard for the specific inputs the funding makes
possible) while other studies examine the effects of specific inputs.

                                                  25
targeted CAI is more likely to generate positive effects than broader ICT initiatives. Specifically,

CAI studies are more likely to result in supplemental instructional time. That is, while ICT

studies may reflect a tradeoff between time allocated to computer-based instruction and

traditional instruction, CAI estimates may reflect the net increase in instruction and therefore be

biased in favor of positive findings. Further, ICT investment may not result in an increase in

educational software and may increase computer use that detracts from traditional instruction

(e.g. non-educational computer games, social networking, or internet use). By contrast, CAI

studies focus narrowly on specific software and the educational outcomes that these are likely to

affect.

          Some of the notable exceptions to the pattern of null effects occur in studies set in the

context of developing, rather than developed countries. This may indicate that the quality of the

education or other activities being substituted for is lower. There also appears to be some

evidence that interventions which target math are more likely to generate positive effects than

interventions that target language. This could be due to the relative ease of making effective

software for math relative to language or the relative ease of generating gains in math.

          The finding that the results do not adhere to clear patterns should not be surprising.

Policies and experiments differ in cost, the type of treatment (the specific hardware or software

provided), the length of the intervention (number of years), the intensity of the treatment (hours

per day), whether they supplement or substitute for other inputs, the grade levels treated, and the

academic subject targeted. We highlight these differences in Table 4. Also, relatively little

attention is given in the literature to heterogeneity in treatment effects by student characteristics,

which is likely due in part to the finding of no effect overall in many studies. Nonetheless, some

studies do differentiate the effects by gender and by baseline academic performance. While no



                                                 26
patterns by gender emerge, some studies find evidence that computer resources benefit lower

performing students more than the highest performing students (e.g. Banerjee, Cole, Duflo, and

Linden 2007 and Barrow, Markman, and Rouse 2009).



3. Technology Use at Home by Students

3.1 Estimates of rates of technology use at home by students

       Computer and Internet use at home has grown rapidly over the past two decades. It is

astonishing that only 20 years ago less than one-fourth of the U.S. population had access to a

computer at home (see Figure 2). Only 17 years ago, less than one-fifth of the U.S. population

had an Internet connection at home. The most recent data available for the United States, which

are for 2012, indicate that roughly 80 percent of the population has access to a home computer

and 75 percent of the population has access to an Internet connection at home.

       Schoolchildren have even higher rates of access to computers and the Internet at home.

Eighty-six percent have access to computers and 83 percent have access to the Internet. These

rates are considerably higher than when the CPS first collected information on home computer

access. In 1984, roughly 15 percent of children had access to a computer at home (U.S. Census

Bureau 1988) Access to home computers and the Internet also rises with the age of the student

(see Figure 3). Home Internet use rises especially sharply with the age of the student.

       Surveys from the 2012 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA)

conducted by the OECD provide information on computer and Internet access at home among

schoolchildren across a large number of countries. Table 2 reports estimates for the 50 largest

countries in the world with available data. In most developed countries a very large percentage of

schoolchildren have access to a computer at home that they can use for schoolwork. In contrast,



                                                27
schoolchildren in developing countries often have very low levels of access. For example, only

26 percent of schoolchildren in Indonesia and 40 percent of schoolchildren in Vietnam have

access to a home computer. In most developed countries a very large percent of schoolchildren

also report having an Internet connection. Although data availability is more limited for Internet

connection rates, the PISA data provide some evidence that children in developing countries

have lower levels of access than developed countries. Only 52 percent of schoolchildren in

Mexico, for example, report having an Internet connection at home. These patterns of access to

home computers and Internet among schoolchildren generally follow those for broader

household-based measures of access to home computers and the Internet published by the OECD

(2104) and International Telecommunications Union (2014a). 18 ITU data indicate that 78 percent

of households in developed countries have Internet access compared with 31 percent of

households in developing countries (ITU 2014b).

        Over the past decade the percentage of students with home computers has increased.

Figure 4 displays trends in home computer access from 2003 to 2012 for selected large countries

with available data. Home computer rates for schoolchildren have been very high in high-income

countries such as the United States and Germany over the past decade. Other large countries

have experienced rapid improvements in access to computers among schoolchildren over the past

decade. Russia has caught up with high-income countries, and access to computers in Brazil

grew from 36 percent as recently as 2006 to 72 percent in 2012. Schoolchildren in Mexico and

Turkey have also seen rapid improvements in access to home computers over the past decade.

Access to home computers has grown over the past decade for Indonesian schoolchildren, but

remains relatively low.

18
  See Caselli and Coleman (2001); Wallsten (2005); Dewan, Ganley and Kraemer (2010); Andrés et al.
(2010); Chinn and Fairlie (2007, 2010) for a few examples of previous studies of disparities in computer
and Internet penetration across countries.

                                                   28
       Even with very high rates of access to home computers and the Internet in developed

countries, large disparities remain within countries. 19 In the United States, for example, 9 million

schoolchildren do not have access to the Internet at home with the lack of access being

disproportionately    concentrated      among     low-income       and    disadvantaged      minority

schoolchildren. 20 Among schoolchildren living in households with $25,000 or less of income 67

percent have access to a home computer and 59 percent have access to the Internet at home,

whereas 98 percent of schoolchildren living in households with $100,000 or more in income

have access to a home computer and 97 percent have access to the Internet at home. Large

disparities also exist across race and ethnicity. Among African-American schoolchildren 78

percent have home computers and 73 percent have home Internet access, and among Latino

schoolchildren 78 percent have home computers and 71 percent have home Internet access. In

contrast, 92 percent of white, non-Latino schoolchildren have home computers and 89 percent

have home Internet access.

       Disparities in access to home computers within countries and across countries may

contribute to educational inequality. However, the rapidly expanding use of computers and the

Internet at home in developing countries might have implications for relative trends in

educational outcomes.



3.2 Theoretical Issues

       In addition to teacher and school inputs, student and family inputs are important for the

educational production function. The personal computer is an example of one of these inputs in

19
   See Hoffman and Novak 1998; Mossberger, Tolbert, and Stansbury 2003; Warschauer (2003); Ono and
Zavodny 2007; Fairlie 2004; Mossberger, Tolbert, and Gilbert 2006; Goldfarb and Prince 2008 for
examples of previous studies of disparities in computer and Internet use within countries.

                                                 29
the educational production process, and there are several reasons to suspect that it is important.

First, personal computers make it easier to complete course assignments through the use of word

processors, the Internet, spreadsheets, and other software (Lenhart, et al. 2001, Lenhart, et al.

2008). Although many students could use computers at school and libraries, home access

represents the highest quality access in terms of availability, flexibility and autonomy, which

may provide the most benefits to the user (DiMaggio and Hargittai 2001). Children report

spending an average of 16 minutes per day using computers for schoolwork (Kaiser Family

Foundation 2010). Access to a home computer may also improve familiarity with software

increasing the effectiveness of computer use for completing school assignments and the returns

to computer use at school (Underwood, et al. 1994, Mitchell Institute 2004, and Warschauer and

Matuchniak 2009). As with computers used in school, owning a personal computer may improve

computer specific skills that increase wages in some fields. Finally, the social distractions of

using a computer in a crowded computer lab may be avoided by using a computer at home.

       On the other hand, home computers are often used for games, social networking,

downloading music and videos, communicating with friends, and other forms of entertainment

potentially displacing time for schoolwork (Jones 2002; U.S. Department of Commerce 2004;

Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). 21 Children report spending an average of 17 minutes per day

using computers for playing games and an average of 21 minutes per day using computers for

watching videos and other entertainment (Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). A large percentage

of computer users report playing games at least a few times a week (Lenhart, Jones and Rankin

2008). Time spent using social networking sites such as Facebook and Myspace and other

entertainment sites such as YouTube and iTunes has grown rapidly over time (Lenhart 2009).


21
  Similar concerns were expressed earlier over television crowding out schoolwork time (see Zavodny
2006 for example).

                                                 30
Children report spending an average of 22 minutes per day using computers for social

networking (Kaiser Family Foundation 2010). Computers are often criticized for displacing more

active and effective forms of learning and for emphasizing presentation (e.g. graphics) over

content (Giacquinta, et al. 1993, Stoll 1995 and Fuchs and Woessmann 2004). Computers and

the Internet also facilitate cheating and plagiarism and make it easier to find information from

non-credible sources (Rainie and Hitlin 2005). In the end, it is ambiguous as to whether the

educational benefits of home computers outweigh their distraction and displacement costs.

       Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2010) present a simple theoretical model that illustrates these

points in the context of a utility maximization problem for a high school student. A linear

random utility model of the decision to graduate from high school is used. Define Ui0 and Ui1 as

the ith person's indirect utilities associated with not graduating and graduating from high school,

respectively. These indirect utilities can be expressed as:



(3.1) Ui0 = α0 + β0'Xi + γ0Ci + λ0t(Wi, Ci) + θY0(Zi, Ci) + εi0, and

(3.2) Ui1 = α1 + β1'Xi + γ1Ci + λ1t(Wi, Ci) + θY1(Zi, Ci) + εi1,



where Xi, Zi and Wi may include individual, parental, family, geographical, and school

characteristics; Ci is the presence of a home computer; Y0 and Y1 are expected future earnings;

and t is the child's achievement (e.g. test score), and εi is an additive error term. Xi, Zi and Wi do

not necessarily include the same characteristics because the individual, family and other

characteristics affecting utility, test scores and expected future earnings may or may not differ.

Achievement is determined by the characteristics, Wi, and the presence of computers is allowed

to have different effects on the utility from the two educational choices. Expected earnings differ


                                                 31
between graduating from high school and not graduating from high school, and are functions of

the characteristics, Zi, and home computers.

       In the model, there are three major ways in which home computers affect educational

outcomes. First, there is a direct effect of having a home computer on the utility of graduating

from high school, γ1. Personal computers make it easier to complete homework assignments

through the use of word processors, spreadsheets, Internet browsers and other software, thus

increasing the utility from completing schoolwork. Home access to computers offers more

availability and autonomy than school access and may familiarize students with computers

increasing the returns to computer use in the classroom. Second, access to home computers may

have an additional effect on the utility of staying in school beyond making it easier to finish

homework and complete assignments. In particular, the use of home computers may "open doors

to learning" and doing well in school (Cuban 2001 and Peck, et al. 2002), and thus encourage

some teenagers to graduate from school. Third, personal computers also provide utility from

games, email, chat rooms, downloading music, and other non-education uses creating an

opportunity cost from doing homework. The higher opportunity cost increases the utility of not

graduating from high school. On the other hand, the use of computers at home, even for these

non-educational uses, keeps children off the street, potentially reducing delinquency and criminal

activities. These activities increase the utility from dropping out of school. The two opposing

factors make it difficult to sign the effect of computers on the utility from not graduating from

high school, γ0.

       Another way in which personal computers affect the high school graduation decision is

through their effects on academic achievement. Computers could improve academic performance

directly through the use of educational software and focusing time use on content. Computers


                                               32
and the Internet, however, may displace other more active forms of learning, emphasize

presentation over content, and increase plagiarism. Therefore, the theoretical effects of

computers on academic achievement, dt/dC, and thus on the utility from graduating from high

school, λ1dt/dC, is ambiguous. Finally, computer skills may improve employment opportunities

and wages, but mainly in combination with a minimal educational credential such as a high

school diploma, implying that dY1/dC > dY0/dC.

        Focusing on the high school graduation decision, we assume that the individual graduates

from high school if Ui1 > Ui0. The probability of graduating from high school, yi=1, is:



(3.3) P(yi=1) = P(Ui1 > Ui0)=

F[(α1-α0) + (β1-β0)'Xi +(γ1 - γ0)Ci + θ(Y1(Zi, Ci) - Y0(Zi, Ci)) + (λ1 - λ0)t(Wi, Ci)]



where F is the cumulative distribution function of εi1-εi0. In (3.3), the separate effects of

computers on the probability of graduating from high school are expressed in relative terms.

Home computers have a direct effect on the graduation probability through relative utility, and

indirect effects through improving achievement and altering relative earnings. The net effect of

home computers on high school graduation, however, is theoretically ambiguous.

        Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez (2014) model the adolescent's maximization problem as one

of allocating time and money across competing uses. Adolescents devote time ti and pay a

monetary cost pi to engage in different activities within the set of all potential activities. Each

activity contributes directly to the adolescent's utility, and some activities also contribute

indirectly to utility through building human capital and increasing future living standards. Utility

can be written as U = U(A, S(A)), where A is the vector of activity choices and S(A) is the future


                                                  33
living standard given these activity choices. Not all activities increase future living standards,

and adolescents place at least some weight on future living standards in the their computation of

utility. Adolescents also face a time constraint and a budget constraint. The solution to the

resulting utility maximization problem equates the ratio of prices of any two activities to the ratio

of marginal utilities of the two activities.

        Using this framework, the introduction of home computers and broadband Internet can be

viewed as a shock to the prices and time costs of various activities. Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez

(2014) provide several examples in which computer technology reduces the prices and time costs

of activities, and thus potentially increases their use. They note that access to word processing

software reduces the cost of revising a term paper, and access to broadband reduces the cost of

conducting research for an essay. Computer and broadband access also reduce the marginal cost

of playing games or engaging in multiparty conversations with friends. The first two examples of

activities presumably have a positive impact on expected future living standards, whereas the

impact on expected future living standards of games and social networking is less clear. Even if

these two activities have positive returns, they might have smaller returns to future living

standards than the activities that they displace.

        Vigdor, Ladd, and Martinez (2014) also note that the simple model could be expanded to

incorporate the cost of technology. Although the adolescent is unlikely to purchase computers

with his/her own money, the family's purchase of computers and Internet service could crowd

out other "educational" expenditures. Another issue is that the maximization problem requires

adolescents to make decisions with long-run consequences, and they may not be "neurologically"

developed enough to make such decisions. This is less of a problem, however, if adolescents

have at least weak preferences for building human capital and improving future living standards.



                                                    34
Another point that Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez raise is that in many cases the realized time

allocations of adolescents will be determined not only by their own preferences, but by

constraints placed on them by parents, teachers and other adults. The model could be revised to

incorporate these restrictions on activities, but one important implication is that the impact of

computer technology on educational outcomes could vary with parental supervision.

       These theoretical models provide some insights into how home computers might exert

both positive and negative influences on educational outcomes, and demonstrate that the net total

effect is difficult to determine. Families and students are likely to make decisions about

computer purchases and Internet subscriptions in part based on these comparisons. If households

are rational and face no other frictions, those households without computers have decided not to

buy a computer because the returns are relatively low. However, it is also possible that various

constraints prevent households from investing in home computers even if the returns are high.

Parents may face credit constraints, be unaware of the returns to computer use, not be technically

comfortable with computers, and have concerns about privacy. There is reason to suspect that

these constraints might be important, given that households without computers tend to be

substantially poorer and less educated than other households. Thus, the effect of computers for

such families is an open and important question.



3.3 Empirical Findings

3.3.1 Effects of home computers and the Internet on educational outcomes

       Although the theoretical models provide some insights into how home computers might

exert positive and negative effects on the educational outcomes, they do not provide a prediction

of the sign and magnitude of the net effect. A small, but growing empirical literature estimates

the net effects of home computers on a wide range of educational outcomes. The literature on the
                                               35
topic has evolved over time primarily through methodological improvements. Earlier studies

generally regress educational outcomes on the presence of a home computer while controlling

for student, family and parental characteristics. More recent studies focus on quasi-experimental

approaches and randomized control experiments.

        One of the first studies to explore whether home computers have positive educational

effects on children was Attewell and Battle (1999). Using the 1988 National Educational

Longitudinal Survey (NELS), they provide evidence that test scores and grades are positively

related to access to home computers among eighth graders even after controlling for differences

in several demographic and individual characteristics including typically unobservable

characteristics of the educational environment in the household. 22

        Using data from the 2001 Current Population Survey (CPS), Fairlie (2005) estimates the

relationship between school enrollment and having a home computer among teenagers.

Controlling for family income, parental education, parental occupation and other observable

characteristics in probit regressions for the probability of school enrollment, he finds a difference

of 1.4 percentage points (base rate of 85 percent). In a subsequent paper, Beltran, Das and Fairlie

(2010) use panel data from the matched CPS (2000-2004) and the National Longitudinal Survey

of Youth (1997- 2002) to estimate the relationship between home computers and subsequent

high school graduation. They find that teenagers who have access to home computers are 6–8

percentage points more likely to graduate from high school than teenagers who do not after

controlling for individual, parental, and family characteristics. Using detailed data available in

the NLSY97, they also find that the estimates are not sensitive to the inclusion of difficult-to-find


22
  They include measures of the frequency of child-parent discussions of school-related matters, parents’
familiarity with the parents of their child's friends, attendance in "cultural" classes outside of school,
whether the child visits science or history museums with the parent, and an index of the educational
atmosphere of the home (e.g. presence of books, encyclopedias, newspapers, and place to study).

                                                    36
characteristics of the educational environment in the household and extracurricular activities of

the student. 23 Estimates indicate a strong positive relationship between home computers and

grades, a strong negative relationship with school suspension, and suggestive evidence of a

negative relationship with criminal activities.

        Schmitt and Wadsworth (2006), using the British Household Panel Survey (1991-2001),

find a significant positive association between home computers and performance on the British

school examinations. The results are robust to the inclusion of individual, household and

geographical controls, including proxies for household wealth and prior educational attainment.

Fiorini (2010) provides evidence on the impacts of home computers among young Australian

children ages 4 to 7. She shifts the focus from access to home computers to computer use among

children (although some results include computer access as an instrumental variable for

computer use). Using data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (2004-06), she

finds evidence of a positive relationship between computer use and cognitive skills among young

children.

        In contrast to these findings of positive effects of home computers on educational

outcomes, Fuchs and Woessmann (2004) find a negative relationship between home computers

and student achievement using data from 31 developed and emerging countries among teenagers.

Using the PISA database, they find that students with home computers have significantly lower

math and reading test scores after controlling for student, family and school characteristics and

country fixed effects. They find a large positive association between home computers and test

scores in bivariate comparisons without controls.



23
  The controls include religion, private school attendance, whether a language other than English is
spoken at home, whether there is a quiet place to study at home, and whether the child takes extra classes
or lessons, such as music, dance, or foreign language lessons.

                                                    37
       Although regressions of educational outcomes on home computers frequently control for

numerous individual, family and school characteristics, they may nonetheless produce biased

estimates of causal effects due to omitted variables. In particular, if the most educationally

motivated families (after controlling for child and family characteristics) are more likely to

purchase computers, then a positive relationship between academic performance and home

computers may capture the effect of unmeasurable motivation on academic performance.

Conversely, if the least educationally motivated families are more likely to purchase computers,

perhaps motivated by their entertainment value, then estimates will be downward biased.

       To address these concerns, a few recent studies (including some discussed above)

estimate the impacts of home computers on educational outcomes using instrumental variable

techniques, individual-student fixed effects, and falsification tests. Fairlie (2005) addresses the

endogeneity issue by estimating instrumental variable models. Bivariate probit models of the

joint probability of school enrollment and owning a home computer result in large positive

coefficient estimates (7.7 percentage points). Use of computers and the Internet by the child's

mother and father, and MSA-level home computer and Internet rates are used as exclusion

restrictions. Some supporting evidence is provided that these variables should affect the

probability of the family purchasing a home computer but should not affect academic

performance after controlling for family income, parental education and occupation, and other

factors. Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2010) also estimate bivariate probits for the joint probability of

high school graduation and owning a home computer and find point estimates similar to those

from a multivariate regression. Similar exclusion restrictions are used with the addition of the

presence of another teenager in the household. Fiorini (2010) uses instrumental variables for

computer use in her study of young Australian children and generally finds larger positive



                                                 38
estimates of computer use on test scores than in OLS regressions. The number of older siblings

and Internet use at work by men and women at the postcode level are used as exclusion

restrictions.

          Another approach, first taken by Schmidt and Wadsworth (2006), is to include future

computer ownership in the educational outcome regression. A positive estimate of future

computer ownership on educational attainment would raise concerns that current ownership

proxies for an unobserved factor, such as educational motivation. Future computer ownership,

however, is not found to have a positive relationship with educational outcomes similar to the

positive relationship found for contemporaneous computer ownership (Schmidt and Wadsworth

2006 and Beltran, Das and Fairlie 2010). Along these lines of falsification tests or "pencil tests"

(DiNardo and Pischke 1997), Schmidt and Wadsworth (2006) do not find evidence that other

household assets which proxy for wealth such as dishwashers, driers and cars have similar

effects on educational attainment. Similarly, Beltran, Das and Fairlie (2008) do not find evidence

of a positive relationship between educational attainment and having a dictionary or cable

television at home, which also might be correlated with unobserved educational motivation or

wealth.

          A couple of studies address selection concerns by estimating fixed effect models. The

inclusion of student fixed effects controls for differences in unobservable characteristics that are

time-invariant. Vigdor, Ladd and Martinez (2014), using panel data from North Carolina public

schools, find modestly-sized negative effects of home computer access and local-area access to

high-speed Internet connections on math and reading test scores when including fixed effects. In

contrast, they find positive estimates when student fixed effects are excluded. Beltran, Das and




                                                39
Fairlie (2010) find that adding student fixed effects results in smaller positive point estimates that

lose significance.

       Malamud and Pop-Eleches (2010) address the endogeneity problem with a regression

discontinuity design (RDD) based on the effects of a government program in Romania that

allocated a fixed number of vouchers for computers to low-income children in public schools.

The basic idea of the RDD is that schoolchildren just below the income threshold for eligibility

for a computer voucher are compared to schoolchildren just above the income threshold. The two

groups of schoolchildren close to the threshold have nearly identical characteristics and differ

only in their eligibility for the computer voucher. Estimates from the discontinuity indicate that

Romanian children winning vouchers have lower grades, but higher cognitive ability as

measured by Raven's Progressive Matrices.

       A few randomized control experiments have been conducted to evaluate the effects of

home computers on educational outcomes. The first random experiment involving the provision

of free computers to students for home use was Fairlie and London (2012). The random-

assignment evaluation was conducted with 286 entering students receiving financial aid at a

large community college in Northern California. 24 Half of the participating students were

randomly selected to receive free computers. After two years, the treatment group of students

who received free computers had modestly better educational outcomes than the control group

along a few measures. Estimates for a summary index of educational outcomes indicate that the

treatment group is 0.14 standard deviations higher than the control group mean. Students living

farther from campus and students who have jobs appear to have benefitted more from the



24
  The focus on the impacts of computers on community college students is important, unlike four-year
colleges where many students live on campus and have access to large computer labs, community college
students often have limited access to on-campus technology.

                                                 40
flexibility afforded by home computers. The results from the experiment also provide the only

evidence in the literature on the effects of home computers for post-secondary students.

        Fairlie and Robinson (2013) also conduct a random experiment, but shift the focus from

college students to schoolchildren. The experiment includes 1,123 students in grades 6-10

attending 15 schools across California. All of the schoolchildren participating in the study did

not have computers prior to the experiment and half were randomly selected to receive free

computers. The results indicate that even though there was a large effect on computer ownership

and total hours of computer use, there is no evidence of an effect on a host of educational

outcomes, including grades, standardized test scores, credits earned, attendance, and disciplinary

actions. No test score effects are found at the mean, at important cutoffs in the distribution (e.g.

passing and proficiency), or at quantiles in the distribution. The estimates are precise enough to

rule out even moderately-sized positive or negative effects. Consistent with these results, they

find no evidence that treatment students spent more time on homework and that the computers

had an effect on turning homework in on time, software use, computer knowledge, or other

intermediate inputs in education. Treatment students report spending more time on computers for

schoolwork, but they also report spending more time on computers playing games, social

networking and for other entertainment.

        Most of the evidence in the literature focuses on the effects of home computers on the

educational outcomes of schoolchildren in developed or transition economies. A couple of

previous studies use random experiments to examine the impacts of one laptop per child (OLPC)

laptops on educational outcomes in developing countries. 25 Beuermann et al. (2012) examine the


25
  Although the One Laptop per Child program in Peru (Cristia et al. 2012) and the Texas laptop program
(evaluated with a quasi-experiment in Texas Center for Educational Research 2009) were initially
intended to allow students to take computers home when needed in addition to using them in school, this
did not happen in most cases. In Peru, some principals, and even parents, did not allow the computers to

                                                   41
impacts of randomly providing approximately 1,000 laptops for home use to schoolchildren in

grades 1 through 6 in Peru. 26 They find that the laptops have a positive, but small and

insignificant effect on cognitive skills as measured by the Raven's Progressive Matrices test

(though the effect is significant among children who did not already have a home computer

before the experiment). Teachers reported that the effort exerted in school was significantly

lower for treatment students than control students and that treated children reported reading

books, stories or magazines less than control children. Mo et al. (2012) randomly distribute

OLPC laptops to roughly half of a sample of 300 young schoolchildren (grade 3) in China. 27

They find some evidence that the laptops improved math test scores, but no evidence of effects

on Chinese tests. They also find that the laptops increased learning activity use of computers and

decreased time spent watching television.



3.3.2 Heterogeneity in Home Computer Effects

        The effects of home computers on educational outcomes might differ across subgroups of

the student population. For example, minority students might benefit more or less from having a

home computer because of more limited opportunities for alternative places of access, social

interactions with other computer users, and learning about use from parents, siblings and friends.

Girls and boys may differ in how they use computers possibly resulting in differential effects.

Several studies estimate separate home computer effects by demographic group and other student


come home because of concerns that the laptops would not be replaced through the program if they were
damaged or stolen. The result is that only 40 percent of students took the laptops home, and home use was
substantially lower than in-school use. In Texas, there were similar concerns resulting in many schools
not allowing computers to be taken home or restricting their home use. The main effect from these laptop
programs is therefore to provide one computer for every student in the classroom, rather than to increase
home access.
26
   Recipients of the laptops were also provided with an instruction manual and seven weekly training
sessions.
27
   The laptops included some tutoring software and one training session was provided.

                                                   42
characteristics. For example, in Attewell and Battle's (1999) study of home computer effects on

the test scores and grades of eighth graders they find evidence of stronger positive relationships

between home computers and educational outcomes for higher SES children, boys, and whites.

Fiorini's (2010) study of the impacts of home computer use on cognitive and non-cognitive skills

among Australian children ages 4 to 7 finds evidence of larger effects for girls and children with

less educated parents. Fairlie (2012) finds larger effects of home computers on educational

outcomes for minority college students than non-minority college students.

       As with school-based interventions, the evidence is mixed with several studies not

finding evidence of heterogeneity in the effects of home computers. For example, Beltran, Das

and Fairlie (2010) estimate regressions that include interactions between home computers and

race, income or gender and, in almost all cases, do not find statistically significant interaction

effects. Fairlie and Robinson (2013) and Fairlie (2015) find no evidence of heterogeneous

treatment effects by pre-treatment academic achievement, parental supervision, propensity for

non-game use, grade, race, or gender. Beuermann et al. (2012) find some evidence of a larger

reduction in school effort for younger Peruvian children, but essentially no difference in effects

on cognitive skills for younger children and no difference in effects on school effort and

cognitive skills by gender. In their study of Romanian schoolchildren, Malumud and Pop-

Eleches (2010) do not find evidence of differential effects by gender, but do find that younger

children experience larger gains in cognitive skills. Given the lack of consistency in findings

across studies for any subgroup, it is difficult to draw strong conclusions on this question.



3.3.3 Effects on Computer Skills and Other Outcomes




                                                 43
       Several previous studies examine the impacts of home computers on computer skills.

There is some evidence of positive impacts, but surprisingly the overall evidence is not

universally strong. For example, Fairlie (2012) finds evidence of positive effects of home

computers on computer skills among college students, whereas Fairlie and Robinson (2013) find

no evidence of home computers on computer knowledge or skills among schoolchildren. Among

young children in Peru, Beuermann et al. (2012) find strong evidence that the OLPC laptops

improved scores on a proficiency test in using the laptop, but find no effects on skills for using a

Windows based computer or using the Internet. Mo et al. (2013) finds large positive effects on

computer skills from OLPC laptops for young children in China. Finally, Malamud and Pop-

Eleches (2010) find that winning a computer vouchers increased computer knowledge, fluency

and applications, but not web and email fluency among Romanian children.

       Research has also focused on the impacts of specific types of computer use or impacts on

other educational or social outcomes. For example, a few studies have explored the effects of

Facebook use among college students on academic outcomes and find mixed results (see Pasek

and Hargittai 2009, Kirschner and Karpinski 2010, and Junco 2012 for example).

Bauernschuster, Falck and Woessmann (2014) use German data to examine the effects of

broadband Internet access on children’s extra-curricular school activities such as sports, music,

arts, and drama and do not find evidence of crowd out. Finally, Beuermann et al. (2012), using

data from Peru’s randomization across and within schools, do not find evidence of spillovers to

classmates and friends (though close friends appear to become more proficient at using a laptop).



Summary




                                                44
       A few patterns emerge from the review of the empirical literature on home effects. First,

studies using multivariate regressions and instrumental variable models tend to show large

positive (and in some cases negative) effects, but studies using randomized control experiments

tend to show zero or small positive effects. As noted above, the contrast in findings may be due

to selection bias. Fairlie and London (2012) find evidence that non-experimental estimates for

community college students are nearly an order of magnitude larger than the experimental

estimates. Second, most studies estimate impacts on grades and test scores, but many studies

examine additional outcomes such as homework time, enrollment and graduation. Although

there are some differences in results across outcomes they are generally consistent within the

same study. The lack of consistent variation in findings for different outcome measures is at least

a little surprising because we might expect intermediate inputs such as homework time and

grades that are related to effort to be affected more by potential crowd-out or efficiency gains

than test scores which capture the amount of information children learned during the school year.

Although not the focus of the paper, we also review a few papers examining impacts on

computer skills and find some evidence of positive effects. But perhaps these findings are not

surprising as there is no reason to suspect a negative influence.

       Most of the earlier research was on the United States and other developed countries, but

several recent studies examine home computer impacts in developing countries. The research

focusing on developing countries tends to find smaller impacts, but it is difficult to disentangle

this from their methodological focus on random experiments. Theoretically, the effects might be

very different in the United States and other countries with a greater reliance on technology

throughout the educational system. Finally, several studies explore heterogeneity in the effects of

home computers on educational outcomes. Most of the studies examining heterogeneity focus on



                                                 45
main demographic groups such as race and gender, but studies also examine heterogeneity by

pre-treatment academic performance, parental supervision, and propensity for entertainment use

of computers. The evidence on heterogeneity is decidedly mixed with no clear evidence even for

the same group across studies.

       Overall, these results suggest that increasing access to home computers among students

who do not already have access is unlikely to greatly improve educational outcomes, but is also

unlikely to negatively affect outcomes.



4. Conclusions

Theoretically, the net effects of ICT investments in schools, the use of CAI in schools, and the

use of computers at home on educational outcomes are ambiguous. Expenditures and time

devoted to using computers, software, the Internet and other technologies may be more efficient

than expenditures on other educational inputs or may be less efficient. New technologies may

displace other more effective instructional and learning methods and distract schoolchildren, or

they may represent an effective learning tool and engage schoolchildren in learning. Thus, it is

perhaps not surprising that the findings from the rapidly growing empirical literature on the

effects of computers, the Internet and computer assisted instruction are mixed.

       The implications from these findings suggest that we should not expect large positive (or

negative) impacts from ICT investments in schools or computers at home. Schools should not

expect major improvements in grades, test scores and other measures of academic outcomes

from investments in ICT or adopting CAI in classrooms, though there might be exceptions such

as some CAI interventions in developing countries. Existing and proposed interventions to

bridge the digital divide in the United States and other countries, such as large-scale voucher



                                                46
programs, tax breaks for educational purchases of computers, and one-to-one laptop programs

with check-out privileges are unlikely to substantially reduce the achievement gap on their own.

       An important caveat to this tempered conclusion, however, is that there might be other

educational effects of having a computer that are not captured in measurable academic outcomes.

For example, computers may be useful for finding information about colleges and financial aid.

They might be useful for communicating with teachers and schools and parental supervision of

student performance, attendance and disciplinary actions through the spreading use of student

information system software (e.g. School Loop, Zangle, ParentConnect, and Aspen). Similar to

other aspects of society, schools, professors and financial aid sources are rapidly expanding their

use of technology to provide information and course content to students. A better understanding

of these potential benefits is important for future research.

       More research is clearly needed in additional areas. First, more research is needed on

benefit-cost analyses of computers, Internet connections, software, and other technologies with

attention devoted to whether expenditures on these interventions are substituting for other inputs

or represent new expenditures. The cost of various interventions is rarely documented or

considered. Though purchase costs are declining, maintenance costs may be high and devices

may become obsolete or need to be replaced frequently. Second, more research is needed on the

shape of the educational returns to technology. For example, are the marginal benefits from a

few hours of computer use in the classroom high, but then decline rapidly when computers are

used more extensively in the classroom? Third, more research is needed on the related question

of online education. There is considerable momentum towards offering online courses by

colleges, massive open online courses (MOOCs), creation of online colleges, and “flipped”

classrooms, but we know relatively little about their effectiveness relative to costs. Fourth, more



                                                 47
research is needed on the impacts of specific uses of computers. For example, computer use for

researching topics might be beneficial, whereas computer use for practicing skills may displace

other more productive forms of learning (Falck, Mang and Woessmann 2015). Each new use of

computer technology poses new possible benefits in terms of customization and flexibility, but

also creates potential pitfalls that may interfere with education. 28 One of the fundamental

challenges of studying the effects of computer technology on educational outcomes is that

research consensus often lags the implementation of new initiatives. Computer technology is

expanding rapidly from desktop computers to laptops iPads and phones, and from educational

software to Internet learning applications and social media.

  See Los Angeles Unified School District’s one-to-one iPad program for a high profile example of the
challenges of adopting new and relatively untested technology. Several schools attempted to abandon the
program after students by-passed security filters in order to access the Internet, which was not intended.
The program was suspended in light of possible flaws in the bidding process for technology provision.

Note: To create the measure of computers per student, PISA uses
responses to the following two questions: "At your school, what is the
total number of students in the <national modal grade for 15-year-
olds>?," and "Approximately, how many computers are available for
these students for educational purposes?"
