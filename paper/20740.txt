The Long Reach of Education: Early Retirement

                                             ABSTRACT

The goal of this paper is to draw attention to the long lasting effect of education on economic outcomes.
We use the relationship between education and two routes to early retirement – the receipt of Social
Security Disability Insurance (DI) and the early claiming of Social Security retirement benefits – to
illustrate the long-lasting influence of education. We find that for both men and women with less than
a high school degree the median DI participation rate is 6.6 times the participation rate for those with
a college degree or more. Similarly, men and women with less than a high school education are over
25 percentage points more likely to claim Social Security benefits early than those with a college degree
or more. We focus on four critical “pathways” through which education may indirectly influence
early retirement – health, employment, earnings, and the accumulation of assets. We find that for women
health is the dominant pathway through which education influences DI participation. For men, the
health, earnings, and wealth pathways are of roughly equal magnitude. For both men and women
the principal channel through which education influences early Social Security claiming decisions
is the earnings pathway. We also consider the direct effect of education that does not operate through
these pathways. The direct effect of education is much greater for early claiming of Social Security
benefits than for DI participation, accounting for 72 percent of the effect of education for men and
67 percent for women. For women the direct effect of education on DI participation is not statistically
significant, suggesting that the total effect may be through the four pathways.

       The central goal of this paper is to draw attention to the long lasting influence of
education. It is of course not news that education is an important determinant of a
person’s life course. The focus in this paper is the relationship between the level of
education and two routes to early retirement. One is through the Social Security
Disability Insurance program (DI), with very few people leaving DI once accepted. The
second is through the early claiming of Social Security retirement benefits by those who
have not already retired through the DI program. These routes are used
disproportionately by those who are ill-prepared to work longer because of health or
other reasons. The analysis brings to the fore just how important and long-lasting the
influence of education can be. The magnitude of the “education effect” on these
retirement outcomes is likely to be surprising to many readers. The results demonstrate
not only the enormous influence of education but also that change in the breadth and
depth of education may play an important role in improving preparation for retirement in
the future. To fix a wide range of problems that we face it will likely be necessary to
address the critical role played by education. Retirement, and preparation for retirement,
is thus in part simply an example to bring attention to the far-reaching influence of a key
foundation for well-being throughout the life course.

       We begin by considering the relationship between education and the receipt of DI
benefits for persons between the ages of 50 and 62. Then we consider the early
claiming of Social Security benefits by persons between the ages of 62 and 65 who are
not receiving DI benefits at 62. Education may affect DI participation and early claiming
of Social Security benefits in many ways. For both routes to retirement we emphasize
four critical pathways – health, employment, earnings, and the accumulation of assets –
through which education may indirectly influence early retirement decisions. Education
may affect DI decisions or the early claiming of Social Security benefits indirectly
through each of these pathways. But education may also have an additional direct effect
on both routes to retirement that does not operate through the designated pathways.
We estimate both the direct and indirect influence of education on these routes to
retirement.




                                             2
       We emphasize the influence of education on the preparedness for retirement as
well as retirement. In many ways retirement and the preparation for retirement are
simply two sides of the same coin. We often gauge how well a person is prepared for
retirement by the level of assets a person has accumulated by retirement ages. But
preparation for retirement also encompasses the ability to choose the age at which a
person would prefer to retire. Those with sufficient assets as they approach retirement
ages have greater flexibility in choosing a retirement age than those with limited assets.
An advantage of one additional year of work is that accumulated assets must provide
support for one fewer year in retirement. If a person has not accumulated sufficient
assets however, the option of delaying the claiming of Social Security benefits is limited.
Poor health also limits additional years in the labor force. So does unemployment or job
loss when retirement ages near; a person who is not employed nearing retirement age
is unlikely to be able to work longer and to delay the receipt of Social Security benefits.
Likewise, if a person’s earning capacity is low, the option of delaying claiming of Social
Security benefits is limited. On the other hand, good health, a job, and greater earning
capacity allow greater flexibility in choosing the most advantageous retirement age. At
younger ages, poor health, unemployment, low earnings capacity, and limited assets
make DI benefits more appealing or even necessary. Thus although the formal analysis
is directed to quantifying the relationship between education and retirement by way of
DI and the early claiming is Social Security benefits, the pathway variables that are
assumed to influence retirement are the same variables that determine the preparation
for retirement, in particular the flexibility to choose a preferred retirement age.

       Several recent papers – Autor, Katz and Kearney (2008), Goldin and Katz
(2008), and Agemoglu and Autor (2012) for example – emphasize the changing
education composition of the workforce and its lasting effects in the labor market. They
consider the relationship between educational trends and the restructuring of the U.S.
labor market in recent decades. In particular, they highlight the concern that the growth
in the education of the workforce has failed to keep pace with the growth of high-skill
jobs. One widely studied consequence has been growing earnings inequality or “job
polarization.” Here, we emphasize another critical aspect of the effect of education on
labor market experience: the relationship between education and routes to retirement.

                                              3
       In this paper education is taken to be a marker for all that accompanies
education and that may influence the effect of education on retirement through our
pathways.
       We recognize that the pathway approach that we present is only one possible
way of exploring the relationship between education and DI participation and between
education and the early claiming of Social Security benefits. There are at least two
issues that arise in this regard. One is that we focus attention on four pathways, but
there may be others. For example one of the pathway variables to DI participation (and
perhaps more so to early claiming of Social Security benefits) might be life expectancy.
That is, education affects life expectancy which in turn affects the decision to delay
receipt of Social Security benefits. We do not include life expectancy but we do include
health which is strongly related to life expectancy
              A second, and related issue, is the extent to which the relationship
between education and each of the pathways is causal. Education and earnings—and
education and each of the other three pathways—are strongly related, but the extent to
which this relationship is causal has been a long-standing issue in economics. Card
(1999), in his survey of the literature on the effect of education on earnings, puts in this
way: “it is very difficult to know whether the higher earnings observed for better-
educated workers are caused by their higher education, or whether individuals with
greater earning capacity have chosen to acquire more schooling.” Thus in the analysis
that follows we measure the association between education and each pathway (and the
association between each pathway and early retirement), but we make no attempt to
determine the proportion of the association that might be considered causal. Again, in
this paper “education” is taken to be a marker for all that accompanies education
without attempting to explore the mechanisms underlying the strong positive association
between education and pathways to retirement. Rather, the goal is to highlight the
magnitude of the relationship between education and an important life event – early
retirement.
       For ease of exposition, however, we often use the term “effect” to describe the
relationship (either indirectly through the pathways or directly) between education and
DI or early claiming of Social Security benefits.

       The remainder of the paper is in four sections. Section 1 presents descriptive
data that help to motivate and support the more formal analysis that follows. Section 2
presents the analysis of DI participation. Section 3 presents the analysis of the early
claiming of Social Security benefits. Section 4 is a summary and discussion.
1) Descriptive data
       The descriptive data emphasize the substantial relationship between education
and the pathway variables – health, employment, earnings, and assets – through which
education is assumed to influence DI participation and the early claiming of Social
Security benefits. We begin by describing the striking relationship between education
and DI participation and early claiming of SS benefits and then turn to the relationship
between education and the pathway variables.
       Disability Insurance and Early Claiming of SS Benefits: Table 1-1 shows the
proportion of women and men who ever applied for and who ever received DI, by level
of education and health status. The table is based on pooled data for the years 1994 to
2010 from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Health status is indicated by health
quintile which is based on a health index that is explained below. The top panel shows
the proportion of persons age 50 to 62 who ever applied for DI benefits. The middle
panel shows the proportions that received DI. Both education and health are strongly
related to DI receipt. For any health quintile, persons with low levels of education are
much more likely to receive DI than those with more education. For example, or women
in the poorest health, for example, 51 percent of women in the poorest health and with
less than a high school degree receive DI compared to 35 percent for women with a
college degree or more. Overall, 25 percent of women with less than a HS degree
receive DI compared to 5 percent for women with a college education. Of men with less
than a high school degree, 27 percent receive DI compared to 5 percent for those with a
college degree or more.

       The bottom panel of Table 1-1 shows the proportion of persons – not on DI at
age 62 – claiming Social Security benefits before the normal retirement age. Overall 71
percent of women with less than a HS degree claim Social Security benefits early but
only 44 percent of those with a college degree or more claim early. For men, 66 percent


                                             5
of those with less than a HS degree claim Social Security benefits early compared to
only 40 percent of those with a college degree or more.

education.

      The Pathway Variables and Education: The empirical model we develop
below considers how education may influence DI participation, and then the early
claiming of Social Security benefits, through four pathways – health, employment,
weekly earnings, and accumulated assets. Figure 1-1a shows four subpanels for
persons 50 to 59 – health, employment, weekly earnings, and accumulated assets. The
panels show that there are large differences by level of education for each of these
pathways, highlighting the “education advantage.”               We see that those with more


                                                     6
education are in much better health, are more likely to be working between the ages of
50 and 59, earn much more, and have much greater assets.1

                             Figure 1-2b shows four analogous panels but for persons 60 to 61 who are not
on DI. This is to show the relationship between education and each pathway for persons
eligible to claim early Social Security benefits. Health, earnings, and assets are strongly
related to level of education. There is also a noticeable relationship between education
and the proportion working at ages 60 and 61, especially for women.

                           The Health Index: The health index used to construct the quintiles in Table 1
and the health panels in Figures 1 and 2, as well as the empirical analysis in sections 3
and 4, is the first principle component of 27 health indicators reported in the HRS.
Construction of the index and its properties are described in some detail in Poterba,
Venti, and Wise (2013a). For convenience, an updated version of that discussion is
reproduced in the Appendix to this paper.
                           How long a person expects to live may be an important consideration in the
timing of the receipt of Social Security benefits, with those expecting short lives more
likely to claim benefits earlier. As noted above, we do not include subjective life
expectancy as one of the pathways through which education influences DI, or in
particular, the early claiming of Social Security benefits. We do, however, include
health, and both subjective and actual mortality are likely to be strongly related to
health. Table 1-2 below, calculated from the mortality model in Heiss, Venti, and Wise
                                                                          8
(2014), shows simulated actual life expectancy at age 66 for men and women, by level
of education and selected health deciles. These simulated life expectancies vary by
nearly a factor of three for both men and women. Simulated life expectancies by gender
and age generated by this model closely match actual life tables. We use the simulated
life expectancies because actual life expectancies are not available by level of
education and health status.

        The Accumulation of Assets: One of the pathways we emphasize is
accumulated assets at retirement. Mean asset balances by level of education are
shown in Table 1-3 and the share of total assets held in each asset type is shown in
Table 1-4. The total assets of those with a college degree or more are 4.5 times as
large as the total assets of those with less than a high school degree. The share of
assets held in different asset types also varies greatly. Social Security wealth accounts
for almost 50 percent of the total assets of those with less than a high school degree but
only about 16 percent of the assets of those with a college degree or more.2 Almost 23
percent of the total assets of those with a college degree or more are in financial assets
but only about 8 percent of the total assets of those less than high school degree is in

 In this table the capitalized value of annuity streams (Social Security and defined benefit pension
benefits) is calculated as the survival probability weighted net discounted present value of expected
benefits.

financial assets. Almost 20 percent of the total assets of those with a college degree or
more is in personal retirement accounts (401(k)s, IRAs, Keoghs and similar tax-
advantaged retirement accounts) but only 4 percent of the total assets of those with less
than a high school degree is in personal retirement accounts. Overall, non-annuity
assets account for about 73 percent of the wealth of those with a college degree or
more but only about 41 percent of the wealth of those with less than a high school
degree.

         The Less Educated Save Less, Given Lifetime Earnings: Asset balances
can be decomposed into two components: one is lifetime earnings (LE) and the other is
the propensity to save out of lifetime earnings (PS). That the less educated earn less
over their lifetimes is well known. Perhaps not so well known is that, given lifetime
earnings, those with less education save substantially less than those with more
education.
        Table 1-5 shows the ratio of mean total assets to mean lifetime earnings by
lifetime earnings decile for the four levels of education that we use throughout the
analysis.3 The table shows that (with only one exception) at each level of lifetime
earnings the ratio of mean assets to mean lifetime earnings increases systematically
with the level of education. Averaged over all lifetime earnings deciles, the ratios are
0.16, 0.18, 0.25, and 0.40 respectively for those with less than a high school degree,
with a high school degree, with some college, and with a college degree or more. We
refer to the ratio of assets to lifetime earnings as the propensity to save. The unusual

3
 This calculation is made for the subset of HRS respondents that have linked Social Security earnings
records. Although we refer to the ratio of mean wealth to mean lifetime earnings as the propensity to
save, we recognize that is a simplification. Many factors other than lifetime earnings and the propensity to
save determine assets at retirement, including bequests and gifts received and the rate of return on
investments. For much of the population, however, the saving rate out of earnings is likely to be a key
factor.

                                                    11
values for the lowest earnings decile are likely due to large assets of persons whose
earnings may not be covered by Social Security and thus have no or low reported
Social Security earnings.

       Personal Retirement Account (PRA) Ownership and Account Balances:
Figures 1-6a (males) and 1-6b (females) are reproduced from Poterba, Venti, and Wise
(2013b). The figures summarize the relationship between earnings, health, marital
status, and education on the one hand, and PRA ownership (left panel) and PRA
account balances (right panel).4 Note that these figures pertain to PRA assets only and
earnings in the figures pertain to earning in the prior wave. The most striking result is
the strong relationship between PRA ownership and education, controlling for earnings.
For example, for men, the increase in the probability of PRA ownership associated with
having a high school degree – compared to less than a high school degree – is over

  Figure 1-6a is based on estimated marginal effects from a probit model of PRA ownership. Figure 1-6b
is based on a poisson regression model for the balance in PRA accounts for households with a positive
balance. In both cases estimates were obtained from data for the 2004 and 2006 waves of the HRS (pre-
dating the financial crisis). The earnings variable used in these figures is annual earnings.

and ten times as great as the increase associated with a 10 percentile point increase in
health. The effect of a college degree (relative to less than a high school degree) is over
15 times as large as the increase associated with a $10,000 increment in earnings and
almost 17 times as great as a ten percentile point increase in health.

         Controlling for earnings, the association between education and the PRA balance
is also very large. That is, it is not just higher earnings that education delivers; among
those with the same level of earnings, those with more education also save more, as is
also highlighted in Table 1-5. While a $10,000 increment in earnings is associated with
about a $6,000 increment is the PRA balance, the effect of education ranges from about
$51,000 for a high school degree (relative to less than a high school degree) to almost
$250,000 for a college degree or more (relative to less than a high school degree). For

                                                                13
both PRA ownership and the PRA balance given ownership, the relationship between
these outcomes and a ten percentage point increase in health is approximately
equivalent to the effect of a $10,000 increase in earnings. Men who are married are also
substantially more likely than single men to have a PRA and to have larger PRA
balances given ownership. The results for women are very similar to the results for men.
2) Disability Insurance Participation
        The analysis pertains to persons between the ages of 50 and 62. We exclude
persons over the age of 62 because of eligibility for early Social Security benefits at that
age. The analysis is based on the 1996 to 2010 waves of the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). There are approximately two years between each wave of the HRS. In
each wave we include only those persons who have not previously received DI. We
determine (by using the date benefits were first received) whether a person is a first-
time recipient of DI benefits over a two-year period. An important consideration is that
DI benefits cannot commence until at least five months after the disability onset.5 This
waiting period means that each pathway variable must be measured at least five
months prior to the date at which DI is initially received.6 Table 2-1 shows summary
data by age of the first receipt of DI for all HRS respondents who ever received DI over
the 1996 to 2010 period. The percent receiving benefits is lowest at ages 50 to 53;
between ages 54 and 61 the percent is larger and fairly uniform by age.




5
  Moreover, not all initial applications receive DI – about 40-50 percent of all DI recipients receive DI after
(sometimes multiple) re-application, thus further delaying the receipt of benefits for many eventual
recipients.
6
  Values for each of the pathway variables are obtained in each survey wave. We then look ahead one
year to see if the respondent began receiving DI in a two-year window. For example, if a respondent is
interviewed on June 1, 2000 we collect values of the pathway variables on this date. Our indicator of DI
receipt is whether the respondent began receiving DI in the two-year window between June 1, 2001 and
June 1, 2003.

        We emphasize again that education has both direct and indirect effects on DI
participation choices. Education may affect DI decisions indirectly by affecting an
individual’s health, assets, employment status, or earnings capacity. Education may
also have effects on DI choices that do not operate through any of the four pathways we
describe; we label this the “direct” effect of education.7
        Estimation of the Relationship between Education and DI: We estimate
three probit specifications to understand the relationship between education and DI
participation. The first specification is simply the relationship between DI participation
and the level of education, given by:
(2-1)   DI  s1 LHS i  s 2 HS i  s 3 SC i  s 4 C M i   i

Here L H S represent less than a high school degree, H S represent high school degree
(or GED equivalent), S C represents some college, and C M represents a college


7
 In some cases the level of education itself may have a direct effect on DI participation because
education is one of many factors that are considered in the disability determination process. The
disability determination process involves five steps. The first three involve financial and medical criteria.
The fourth step determines whether the DI applicant is able to work in his or her former job. The final
step determines if the applicant has the capacity for any work. The level of education is one of the factors
considered in this final step, although the weight attached to education in this step depends on the
applicant’s age and other factors.

degree or more. The second specification is the relationship between DI participation
and each of the four pathways without controlling for education, given by:
(2-2)    DI  c  p1 H i  p 21 E1i  p 22 E 2 i  p 3W i  p 4 Ai   i

In this specification the “employment” pathway is represented by two variables: E1

indicates whether the respondent was employed and E 2 represents years since the
respondent was last employed. The second employment variable is included so that
whether a person was employed is not equated with being out of the labor force for a
long period of time. Also, H represents health, W represents weekly earnings (in
$1,000) if employed, and A represents non-annuity assets. Employment, earnings,
health, and assets are obtained from the most recent HRS wave that is at least one
year prior to the date DI participation is observed. The third specification includes both
the pathway effects and indicator variables for level of education which are intended to
capture the direct effect of education not accounted for by the pathway variables and is
given by:
         D I  c  p1 H i  p 21 EM 1i  p 22 EM 2 i  p 3W i  p 4 Ai 

         The effect of education through the pathways in specification (2), for example,
can be obtained from the following decomposition:8
         dD I         dD I dH         dD I dE M 1           dD I    dE M 2       dD I dW       dD I dA

                               dD I
where, for example,                   is the estimated marginal effect of H from the probit model ( p1 )

  For specification (2) the decomposition is incomplete because it excludes the direct
(i.e. not through the pathways) effect of education on DI. However, Tables 2-4 and 3-3
below compare the sum of the pathway effects and the direct effect of education for DI
and for early claiming respectively.
                                                                    16

education on DI through the health pathway                      is given by           H CM    H  HS    . The
                                                        dH dE                 dH

effect of education through each of the other pathway is calculated analogously.
          Estimated Marginal Effects for the Three Specifications: Table 2-2 shows
the estimates (marginal effects) for the three specifications described above. The
estimates for specification 1 simply show the total marginal effect of each level of
education on the probability of initial DI participation. Men with a college degree or more
are 2.23 percent less likely than those with less than a high school degree receive DI
between waves of the HRS. This is a large effect compared to the mean actual
probability of DI participation for men with less than a high school degree is of 2.98
percent. Women with a college degree or more are 1.97 less likely to receive DI than
women with less than a high school degree, again a large effect compared to the mean
actual probability of DI participation for women with less than a high school degree of
2.17 percent. We sometimes refer to the total “education effect” as 2.23 percent for men
and 1.97 percent for women.
          Specification 2 shows the marginal effects of each of the pathway variables
without controlling for education. Thus this specification allocates all of the effect of
education on DI participation to the pathway variables. For both men and women, all of
the pathway variables are statistically significant with the exception of weekly earnings. 9
Specification 3 includes the pathway variables as well as the education indicators to
capture the direct effect of education that does not operate through the pathway
variables. This specification minimizes the proportion of the education effect on DI that
is captured by pathway variables. The top panel under this specification shows the
estimated marginal effect of each pathway variable on DI participation. The bottom
panel shows the (direct) effect of education controlling for the pathway variables. Note
that for women, after controlling for the effect of the pathway variables, the estimated
additional direct effect of education on DI participation is not statistically significant. For
men, the direct effect of education is statistically significant for two of the three
education levels.

       To put these estimates in perspective we have calculated the probability of initial
DI participation for persons with less than a high school degree and for persons with a
college degree or more, for men and women separately. The cumulative distribution of
the probabilities is shown for men and for women in Figures 2-1a and 2-1b respectively.
The distributions for the two levels of education are very different for both men and
women. For example, the median DI participation rate for men with less than a high
school degree is 0.0196 and the median for men with a college degree or more is
0.0030, a 6.6 fold difference. Ninety six percent of those with a college degree or more
have participation probabilities that are less than the median for those with less than a
high school degree. On the other hand ninety six percent of those with less than a high
school degree have participation probabilities that are greater than the median for those
with a college degree or more. A similar, though slightly less extreme, pattern can be
seen in figure 2-1b for women.
       Pathway and Direct Effects of Education: Table 2-3 shows the mean values
for each of the pathway variables and the difference between the means of those with
less than a high school education and of those with a college degree or more. The
differences in the pathway variable means are substantial for each of the pathway
variables.
       We estimate the effect of education on DI participation through each of the
pathways using the decomposition described above. The effect of education E through
                                       dD I dH        dI
health H , for example, is given by:                      H   C ollege
                                                                            H  H S  . Here d I / d H is the
                                       dH dE          dH

estimated marginal effect reported in Table 2-2 and  H C ollege  H  H S  is obtained from the

last column of Table 2-3. Thus for specification 2 the pathway effect for health is
−0.0004 x 13.9 = −0.0053 for men. This implies that the effect of education through the
health pathway accounts for about one half of one percent of the overall difference in DI
participation rates between persons with a college degree or more and persons with
less than a high school degree.

       These pathway effects are shown in Table 2-4a. For specification 2, the sum of
the pathway effects is about 1.7 percent for men and 1.4 percent for women. Based on
specification 3, the sum of pathway effects is about 1.3 percent for men and for women.
Recall that in specification 3 in Table 2-2 the estimated marginal effects of the education
variables are not statistically significant for women. Moreover, the results in Table 2-4a
show that for women there is only a small reduction in the sum of the pathway effects
when education is included (specification 3) compared to the specification without
education (specification 2).
       A key finding is that for both men and women few of the estimated coefficients on
the pathway variables estimated in specification 2 are changed much when the
education variables are added in specification 3. The estimated coefficients on health,
not employed, and years since last job – that are estimated precisely in both
specifications – are changed by less than 3 percent for both men and women. The
estimated coefficients on weekly wage and assets for men are reduced by about 30
percent. The estimated coefficient on assets for women is reduced by about 27 percent.

       Table 2-4b shows the pathway and non-pathway effects as a percent of the total
effect of education. In specification 2, the pathway effects account for 75.3 percent of

                                                    22
the total education effect for men and 73.5 percent for women. In specification 3, the
pathway effects account for 58.7 percent and 66.4 percent of the total effect of
education for men and women respectively. In particular, as noted above, few of the
pathway percentages change much when the direct effect of education is added to the
specification. Although there is a rather close relationship between the level of
education and the mean of pathway variables, the correlation between education and
each of the pathway variables is not great enough to prevent precise estimation of both
direct and indirect effects of education on DI participation.
          Decomposition of the Wealth Effect: The level of assets can be expressed
as the product of two components – lifetime earnings (LE) and the propensity to save
out of lifetime earnings (SP). This decomposition of the effect of education on DI
participation is described by:

To calculate the LE and SP components, we need lifetime earnings, which we obtain
from Social Security records that are available for 66 percent of our sample. The first
four columns of Table 2-5 below show mean non-annuity assets, lifetime earnings, and
the savings propensity by level of education for the subsample of respondents for whom
we have linked earnings records.10

   Note that this decomposition assumes that education has independent effects on both the level of
lifetime earnings and the saving propensity. The relationship between education and earnings is well
known. Perhaps less widely understood is that education has an independent effect on the saving
propensity. The saving propensities calculated in Table 2-5 are shown below by level of education for
selected earnings deciles. These data show that within each earnings decile (i.e., holding lifetime
earnings constant), persons with less education save less than those with more education.

        The data in Table 2-5 can be used to calculate the decomposition in equation 2-
6. The effects of education attributable to the LE and SP components for specifications
2 and 3 are shown in the Table 2-6 below. Notice first that for specification 2 the sum of
the LE and SP components (that together comprise the effect of education on DI
participation through the asset pathway) is -0.0069, but the estimated effect of
education through the asset pathway in specification 2 is -0.0062 (from Table 2-4a), a
difference of 9.9%. The difference is due primarily to the different samples used in the
two calculations. For specification 3 the sum of the LE and SE components also differs
from the estimated asset effect by 9.9%.
        For men, almost 58 percent of the effect of education through the asset pathway
is due to the lower saving propensity of those with less education. About 42 percent is
due to the lower lifetime earnings of those with the least education. The relative shares
accounted for by the LE and SP components are the same for both specifications. For
women, about 56 percent of the effect of education through the asset pathway is due to
the lower saving propensity of those with the least education and about 44 percent to
the lower lifetime earnings of those with the least education.11

   Note that the shares have to be the same for specifications 2 and 3, as can be seen in the last line of
equation 2-6— dD I / dA is different for specifications 2 and 3, but the rest of the equation (the part used
to calculate the shares) is identical for both specifications.

       The Changing Effect of Education over Time: We want to simulate the
probability of DI participation for persons with less than a HS degree and those with a
college degree or more for each HRS wave from 1996 and 2008. In doing this, we
assume that the estimated marginal effect of each pathway variable shown in Table 2-2
remains constant over time. Thus any change in the relationship between education and
DI participation will be due to changes in the pathway variables over time. To illustrate,
Table 2-7 shows the effect of education through each pathway for persons in 1996 (top
panel) and 2008 (bottom panel). The calculations are for men based on specification 3.
The first two columns in each panel show mean values of each of the pathway variables
for persons without a high school degree and for persons with a college degree or more.
The third column shows the difference between those with less than a high school
degree and those with a college degree or more. Notice that the difference between the
college or more group and the less than high school group increased between 1996 and

                                              25
2008 for three of the pathway variables: health, assets, and the likelihood of not being
employed. The result is an increase in the effect for each of these pathway variables
shown in the last column – the product of the marginal effect of each pathway variable
shown in column 4 and the difference between levels of education shown in column 3 –
and a 25 percent increase in the sum of the pathway effects, from -0.0107 in 1996 to -
0.0138 in 2008. These data show that over the 12 year interval between 1996 and
2008, the likelihood of initial DI receipt has increased more for the less educated than
for the highly educated. This divergence is due, in substantial part, to the widening gaps
in health, assets, and employment between those with more and less education.

     We can also use the parameter estimates to simulate the probability of initial
receipt of DI by year for those with less than a HS education and those with a college
degree or more. These simulated probabilities are shown in Table 2-8 for each of the
HRS waves between 1996 and 2008. For men with less than a HS degree the
probability of initially receiving DI is 3.1 percent in 1996 and 3.9 percent in 2008, an
increase of over 27 percent. The probability of initial DI receipt was virtually unchanged
for college graduates over this same period. The pattern for women is similar.

                                             26
     Note that these probabilities could be calculated directly from the data used in the
estimation. There are, however, advantages to the simulated probabilities. One is that
the simulated probabilities show the effect of changes over time in the levels of pathway
variables shown in Table 2-7 for members of each education group. Recall that we
assume that the estimated marginal effect of each pathway variable shown in Table 2-2
remains constant over time and thus that any change in the relationship between
education and DI participation is due to changes in the pathway variables over time.
Another advantage is that the simulated probabilities are smoother and, unlike the
probabilities calculated directly from the data, they are not subject to small sample
variation. Perhaps the most important advantage is that the simulations demonstrate
that if we had estimates of pathway variable differences like those in Table 2-7, from
any source, we would be able to simulate DI participation in earlier years, even in the
absence of data on DI participation, if we assume that the education effects that we
estimate for the post-1996 period also apply to earlier years.

       Finally, Table 2-9 shows the correspondence between the simulated DI
probabilities and the actual probabilities. With the exception of the initial receipt of DI at
ages 51 and 52, the actual and the simulated values are quite close. The sample sizes
for ages 51 and 52 are very small and a large fraction of the sample at these ages is
composed of younger wives of men selected as HRS respondents. The estimated
probabilities for these two ages lead to a small difference in the cumulated probabilities
from age 50 to age 62. There is no difference in the cumulated probabilities from age 53
to age 62.

3) Early Claiming of Social Security Benefits
       Estimated Marginal Effects of Three Specifications: The analytic approach
we follow to understand the relationship between education and early claiming of Social
Security benefits is the same as the approach followed in the analysis of DI
participation. We begin by estimating three specifications analogous to the
specifications estimated for DI participation. The dependent variable is whether a
person begins receiving early Social Security benefits (at ages of 62, 63, or 64). The
pathway variables are measured in the most recent HRS wave prior to becoming
eligible for early benefits at age 62.
       The results are reported in Table 3-1. Specification 1, including only education
indicator variables, shows that men with a college degree or more are over 25 percent
less likely to claim Social Security benefits early than men with less than a high school
degree. Women with a college degree or more are almost 27 percent less likely to claim
Social Security benefits early than women with less than a high school degree. (The

                                                    28
probabilities for men are 40.4 for those with a college education or more and 65.9
percent for those with less than a high school degree. The probabilities for women are
57.3 and 70.6 percent respectively.)

               Data are from the 1998 - 2010 waves of the HRS. Pathway
               variables are from last wave before age 62

       Specification 2 includes only pathway variables and thus assumes that all of the
influence of education on early retirement is through the pathway variables. Perhaps
most striking is that for men, the effect of health on early retirement is not statistically


                                              29
significant. The estimated coefficient on health for women is much larger than for men
and highly significant.
       Specification 3 allows education to influence retirement through the pathway
variables, but also includes education indicators to capture the direct effect of education
not accounted for by the pathway variables. This specification minimizes the proportion
of the education effect on early claiming that is captured by the pathway variables. The
top panel under this specification shows the estimated marginal effect of each pathway
variable on early claiming. The bottom panel shows the (direct) effect of education
controlling for the pathway variables.
       Three results stand out. First, the direct effect of education is statistically
significant and large (about 18 percentage points between the highest and lowest levels
of education) for both men and women. The direct effect of education on the early
claiming of Social Security benefits may arise if, for example, persons with more
education are in occupations that provide more job satisfaction or are in occupations
that are less physically demanding or are more attached to their jobs than those with
less education.
       Second, despite the large and significant direct effect of education, few of the
estimated coefficients on the pathway variables change much when the education
variables are added in specification 3, and most of the coefficients that change
substantially were not statistically significant in specification 2.
       Third, when the direct effect of education is added in specification 3, the small
estimated effect of assets on the early claiming of Social Security benefits in
specification 2 is essentially zero in specification 3. The estimated effect of assets is
likely to be biased downward because of error in the measurement of assets. However,
experimentation with different approaches to trim asset “outliers” does not yield large or
more precise estimates of the effect of assets on early claiming.
       Pathway and Direct Effects of Education: Table 3-2 shows the mean values of
the pathway variables by level of education for both men and women observed in the
wave just before the age of eligibility for early Social Security benefits. It is clear that
there is a strong relationship between the mean level of education and each of the
pathway variables, with the exception of years since last job for women. The differences

                                               30
in the means between those with a college degree or more and those with less than a
high school degree are substantial.

      Note: Data are from the 1998 - 2010 waves of the HRS. Pathway variables are from last

       Table 3-3a shows estimates of the effect of education through each of the
pathway variables and the sum of these pathway effects for specifications 2 and 3. To
estimate the effect of education through each of the pathways, we follow the same
approach we used in analyzing DI participation. Recall that the effect of education E on
the early claiming of Social Security benefits (SS) through health H , for example, is
            dSS dH       dSS
given by:                     H   C ollege
                                                H  H S  . Here d S S / d H is the estimated marginal effect
            dH dE         dH

reported in Table 3-1 and  H C ollege  H  H S  is obtained from the last column of Table 3-2.

       For both men and women the sum of the pathway effects is about 25 percent
lower when education is added to the specification. In both specifications the sum of the
pathway effects is somewhat greater for women than for men.

  Note: Bold indicates significant at 10% level or better (for included pathway effects).

       For the most part, however, the estimated effect of education through the
pathway variables is not changed greatly when education is controlled for. For women
the estimated effect of education through three pathway variables – health, weekly


                                                   32
earnings, and years since last job – is changed by 15 percent or less; for the not
employed variable the reduction is 23 percent. For men the change for three pathways
– weekly earnings, not employed, and years since last job – is 14 percent or less. For
men the effect of health is reduced from -0.0068 to -0.0012 when education is added,
but health is not an important determinant of the pathway effects in either specification.
However, health is very significant for women. Comparing specifications 2 and 3 for
men, the only other substantial change is the reduction in the effect of education
through assets when education is added; the effect of assets is reduced from -0.0216 to
-0.0088. For women, the asset pathway also becomes less important when the
education variables are added; the effect of assets is reduced from -0.0140 to -0.0012.
       In short, there is an important direct effect of education on the early claiming of
Social Security benefits, but the addition of education has only a modest effect on the
estimated effect of education through most of the pathway variables. The pathway
variable most affected is the reduction in the estimated effect of wealth, and that effect
is greatest for men. The effect through health is also reduced for men, but health is not
an important component of the total pathway effect for men.
       Table 3-3b is similar to Table 3-3a but shows the pathway and non-pathway
effects as a percent of the total effect of education. In specification 2, the effect of
education through the pathways accounts for 36.8 percent of the total effect of
education for men and 43.6 percent for women. In specification 3, the pathway effects
account for 27.7 percent and 32.7 percent of the total effect of education for men and
women respectively. Note again, however, that most of the pathway percentages are
changed only modestly when the direct effect of education is introduced – the same
percentage changes as discussed above with respect to Table 3-3a. In particular,
similar to the results for DI participation, although the data in Table 3-2 suggest a rather
close relationship between the level of education and the mean of the pathway
variables, the correlation between the individual pathway values and the level of
education variables is not great enough to prevent us from estimating both the direct
and indirect (pathway) effects of education on the early claiming of Social Security
benefits.



                                              33
       The finding that assets have essentially no effect on the early claiming of Social
Security at all when the direct effect of education is controlled for seems surprising. In
most retirement models (Gustman and Steinmeier (1986), Stock and Wise (1990), Rust
and Phelan (1997), and Blau (2008) for example) assets affect the retirement decision.
Perhaps this is because these models do not include education in the specification.
When education is controlled for in a regression analogue of the option value model, the
effect of assets on retirement is insignificant. See for example Coile (2014), Banks,
Emerson, Tetlow (2014), and other papers in Wise (forthcoming).
       Finally, Table 3-4 shows actual and predicted proportion claiming early Social
Security benefits by level of education. The fit is very close.

4) Summary and Discussion

       The goal of this paper is to draw attention to the long lasting influence of
education. To illustrate this influence we focus on the relationship between the level of
education and two routes to early retirement – the Social Security Disability Insurance
program (DI) and the early claiming of Social Security retirement benefits. These routes
are followed disproportionately by those who are typically ill-prepared to work longer
because of health or other reasons. Of men with less than a high school degree, 27
percent receive DI between the ages 50 and 62; of those with a college degree or more
only 5 percent in this age range receive DI. Of men with less than a high school degree
who are not on DI at age 62, 66 percent claim Social Security benefits before the



                                              34
normal retirement age; of those with a college degree or more, 40 percent take Social
Security benefits early. The percentages are similar for women
       For both routes to retirement we focus on four critical pathways – health,
employment, earnings, and the accumulation of assets – through which education may
indirectly influence DI and early retirement decisions. We emphasize that in addition to
these indirect effects of education through the pathways, education may also have an
additional direct effect on both routes to retirement that does not operate through the
designated pathways. Both the direct and indirect effects are estimated. We emphasize
that in this paper we view education as a marker for all that accompanies education; we
do not attempt to identify the causal component of the relationship between education
and either DI or the early claiming of Social Security benefits.
       The analysis of DI participation considers the probability that a person between
the ages of 50 and 62 first receives DI between the approximate 2-year intervals
between waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) from 1996 to 2010. The early
claiming of Social Security benefits is also based on HRS data, but considers whether a
person not on DI at age 61 begins receiving early Social Security benefits (at the ages
of 62, 63, or 64).
       We find that the median simulated initial DI participation rate over a two-year
HRS interval for men with less than a high school degree is 0.0196 and the median for
men with a college degree or more is 0.0030, a 6.6 fold difference. The DI participation
rate for women with less than a high school degree is 0.0136 and the median for
women with a college degree or more is 0.0021, a 6.5 fold difference. Men with a
college degree or more are over 25 percentage points less likely to claim Social
Security benefits early than men with less than a high school degree. Women with a
college degree or more are almost 27 percentage points less likely to claim Social
Security benefits early than women with less than a high school degree.
       One way to summarize key findings is by the proportion of the total effect of
education that is accounted for by the influence of education through the pathways
(indirect effect) and the proportion accounted for by the direct effect of education. These
proportions are shown for DI (top panel) and early Social Security claiming (bottom
panel) in the accompanying tabulation. Two sets of proportions are shown: those on the

those on the right control for the level of education. Essentially, these two sets of
                                                                     estimates reflect the

education is strongly related to DI participation. For women, however, the estimates
suggest that it is only the indirect effect of education that influences DI participation;
controlling for the pathways – health, employment, wage, and assets – the direct effect
of education is not statistically significant. Thus it is not only the level of education itself
that matters but the relationship between education and the pathways, all important
determinants of life satisfaction more broadly. The relative effect of education on DI
through the pathways is somewhat less for men but still very important, and much less
for early claiming of Social Security benefits for both men and women.
       We emphasize two features of these estimates. First, the effect of education
through the pathways is substantially larger for DI participation than for early Social
Security claiming, whether education is controlled for or not. The estimates in the left
panel suggest that the pathway variables account for 75.3 percent of the total effect of
education on DI participation for men and 73.2 percent of the total effect for women.
Comparable percentages for the early Social Security claiming decision are 36.8
percent and 43.6 percent. Estimates controlling for the level of education (right panel)
also show that the effect of education through the pathways is also greater for DI than
for early claiming. Second, the percent accounted for by the pathway effects is lower
when the direct effect of education is allowed for (by including education levels in the
estimation specification). The smallest reduction is for DI participation for women – 73.2

                                               36
to 66.6 percent. Indeed, the estimated direct education effects for women, on which this
difference is based, are not significantly different from zero.
       An important result is that for both DI and early claiming, few of the estimated
coefficients on the pathway variables estimated in the specification without the direct
effect of education (education levels) are changed much when the education variables
are added to the specification. In particular, although there is a rather close relationship
between the level of education and the means of the pathway variables, the correlation
between education and each of the pathway variables is not great enough to prevent
precise estimation of both direct and indirect effects of education on DI participation.
That is, it is evident that the influence of education on DI participation and on the early
claiming of Social Security benefits occurs both indirectly through the four pathways as
well as directly (not by way of the pathways).
       Finally, we draw attention to the large direct effect of education on the early
claiming of Social Security benefits together with two associated and perhaps
unexpected findings. First, we find that health is not a significant determinant of early
claiming for men but a very significant determinant for women. Second, perhaps most
striking, we find that that assets have essentially no effect on the early claiming of
Social Security benefits when the direct effect of education is controlled for, a finding
that differs from estimates that do not include education in the specification. That is, the
inclusion of education in the model reveals a large direct effect of education and a
corresponding virtual elimination of the estimated effect of assets, commonly thought to
be an important determinant of retirement, and an effect of health—also thought to be
an important determinant of retirement—only for women.
       As noted in the body of the paper, the direct effect of education on early claiming
may arise for example if persons with more education are in occupations that provide
more job satisfaction or are in occupations that are less physically demanding, or are
more attached to their jobs than those with less education, or have more opportunities
for continued work in their 60’s. These and other potential reasons for the large direct
effect of education are apparently not captured, at least in full, by our pathway variables.
Many features of jobs or occupations are picked up by the earnings and employment
pathways. But these pathways may not entirely capture the effect of job attributes such

                                             37
as job satisfaction or opportunities for work at older ages. Thus it seems difficult to
determine what relevant additional pathways might be. In sum, we believe that the
parsimonious specification we use provides an informative description of the importance
of education on DI participation and on the early claiming of Social Security benefits.
Further exploration of the direct effect of education on retirement seems an important
issue for further research.
       The key findings of the paper seem robust to alternative presentations of the
data. The effect of education on early retirement is huge. Most of the effect of education
on DI participation is indirect through the effect of education on health, wealth, earnings
and employment. Most of the effect of education on the early claiming of Social Security
benefits is accounted for by the direct effect of education and not indirectly by way of
the effect of education through the health, wealth, earnings, and employment pathways.
       Finally, our focus on the effect of education on early retirement is one of many
examples that could be used to illustrate the long reach of education.

Appendix on Measuring Health

      Our analysis depends critically on measuring health status. We use a health
index that is based on respondent-reported health diagnoses, functional limitations,
medical care usage, and other indicators of health contained in the HRS. We use the
first principal component of the 27 indicators of health status that are shown in Appendix
Table 1. The first principal component is the weighted average of the health indicators
where the weights are chosen to maximize the proportion of the variance of the
individual health indicators that can be explained by this weighted average. The
variables in the table are ordered by the principal component loadings.

       This index used here is identical to that used in Heiss, Venti and Wise (2014) and
is an updated version of the index used in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2013a). Prior work
has shown that separate estimates of the index for each wave of the HRS produce
similar factor loadings, so this version of the index pools all waves. We have also
combined men and women based on the similarity of factor loadings. We use data from
all five HRS cohorts spanning the years 1994 to 2010 to estimate the principal
component index.12 The estimated coefficients are used to predict a “raw” health score
for each respondent. For presentation purposes we convert these raw scores into
percentile scores for each respondent at each age.
       The health status index that we use in this paper is a cardinal measure. It has
several important properties. 1) It is strongly related to the evolution of assets, as shown
in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2013a). 2) It is strongly related to mortality. The upper left
panel of Appendix Figure 1, abstracted from Heiss, Venti and Wise (2014) shows the
relationship between the health index in 1994 and mortality in 2010 for members of the
HRS cohort. Among those in the poorest health in 1994, approximately 51 percent are
deceased by 2010. Among persons in the best health only about 16 percent are
deceased by 2010. 3) It is strongly predictive of future health events such as stroke and
the onset of diabetes, as is also shown in the remaining panels of Appendix Figure 1.
The index value in 1994, however, has little predictive power for future episodes of
cancer. 4) It is strongly related to economic outcomes prior to 1994, such as earnings,
and to economic outcomes in later years.

  The full set of questions was not asked of all respondents for the HRS cohort in 1992 and the AHEAD
cohort in 1994. Thus we have excluded all data for these two cohorts.
