                                              ABSTRACT

We address the ordinality of test scores by rescaling them by the average eventual educational attainment
of students with a given test score in a given grade. We show that measurement error in test scores
causes this approach to underestimate the black-white test score gap and use an instrumental variables
procedure to adjust the gap. While the unadjusted gap grows rapidly in the early school years, particularly
in reading, after correction for measurement error, the education-scaled gap is large, exceeds the actual
black-white education gap and is roughly constant. Strikingly, the gap in all grades is largely explained
by a small number of measures of socioeconomic background. We discuss the interpretation of scales
tied to adult outcomes.

1    Introduction
In Bond and Lang (forthcoming) we argue that test scales are inherently ordinal. We show
that without restrictions beyond ordinality on the scales, the bounds on the evolution of the
black-white test score gap from kindergarten through third grade are uninformative. They
permit results ranging from “the gap is small in kindergarten and declines thereafter” to
“the gap is initially nonexistent and grows to be signi…cant.”We further suggest that tying
test scores to adult outcomes would solve the problem if we are willing to accept the adult
outcome as an appropriate metric, an approach taken in a di¤erent context by Cunha and
Heckman (2008) and Cunha, Heckman and Schennach (2010).
    In this paper, we follow our suggestion and show that our optimism was partially justi…ed.
We use the relation between educational attainment and test scores to measure the gap and
use an instrumental variables procedure to correct for the e¤ect of measurement error in the
tests on the scales derived from adult outcomes. We show that, measured in this way the
gap in reading is roughly constant from kindergarten through seventh grade at around .7
years of predicted education while the gap in math is close to a full year. When we measure
educational attainment not in years but in the associated average log earnings, the pattern
is similar, but the gaps are notably larger at around 10 to 12 percent.
    Junker, Scho…eld and Taylor (2012) have been very critical of economists’tendency to
treat test scores as measured without error. They show that using the reliability estimates
from an underlying item response theory (IRT) model to correct regression estimates can
have large e¤ects on their magnitude. Boyd et al (2012) show that measurement error is
noticeably larger than suggested by reliability estimates. We show that the scale based on
adult outcomes is inherently a shrinkage estimator. When applied to the outcomes of multiple
tests, the extent of shrinkage is too large. We derive an instrumental variables estimator
that allows us determine how much these “shrunk” estimates need to be “stretched” and
con…rm the importance of doing so. If we do not correct for excess shrinkage, we observe a
pattern similar to that reported by Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2006); the black-white test score
gap is initially small but rises rapidly during the early school years.
    Murnane et al (2006) argue that the Fryer/Levitt result di¤ers from that found in earlier
work (e.g., Jencks and Phillips, 1998) because they use a di¤erent test, a point con…rmed in
our earlier work. Our results suggest that di¤erences between the tests may lead to more
measurement error in “achievement tests”in the early grades.
    When we combine information from the math and two reading tests, the estimated
“education-scaled” gap averages .9 years from kindergarten through seventh grade after
adjusting for excess shrinkage. The gap on the PPVT, a test similar to those used in earlier


                                              1
studies, is also .9 years although this is admittedly not corrected for excess shrinkage.
    Strikingly, the “education-scaled” test gap in the early years, particularly in math, is
at least as large as and probably larger than the actual gap in educational attainment.
At the same time, barring some surprising narrowing of the black-white earnings gap, the
“earnings/education-scaled” test gap in kindergarten through seventh grades is likely to be
less than the future earnings gap, suggesting either that test scores contain more information
than just their e¤ect on education, as argued in Neal and Johnson (1996), or continued labor
market discrimination.
    Finally and strikingly, much, and in some cases all, of the education-scaled gaps can be
explained by a small number of controls representing the child’s early environment. Results
that condition on sociodemographics should be treated with great caution due to the socio-
logical fallacy (Jensen, 1969). However this suggests that our previous inability to explain
the test gap by environmental factors may have re‡ected scaling decisions. The achieve-
ment gap may be due to racial di¤erences in socioeconomics rather than a speci…c racial
component in human capital acquisition or the environment more generally.
    It is important to understand what our results do and do not mean. It would be easy to
interpret our results as saying that the entire black-white education gap is due to pre-school
factors. This is true only in the sense that the entire gap can be predicted on the basis of
kindergarten test scores. But it is not true if it is interpreted to mean that subsequent events
do not a¤ect the gap. To the extent that low kindergarten scores predict future attendance
at lower quality schools, less future parental support, etc., the gap is “explained”by factors
known in …rst grade. But this does not mean that di¤erences in these factors no longer
matter. Instead, our results tell us that blacks do no better or worse, on average, than would
be predicted by their early test scores.


2     Theoretical Framework
2.1    Intuition: Meaning of Rescaling
Suppose we had a very reliable and valid test in the sense that it captured everything about
a student’s current academic achievement that predicts some adult outcome, say educational
attainment, and does so perfectly. Moreover, we have good longitudinal data that provide us
with such test scores as students progress through school and on their eventual educational
attainment. It would then be possible to rescale the scores on each test by the average
eventual educational attainment of students with that score in that grade. If the sample size
for each score/grade combination were su¢ ciently large, we could ignore sampling error in


                                               2
the calculation of average education and simply say that a score of 11 on the test predicts
10.6 years of education, 12 predicts 10.8, and so on.
    Of course, no student with a rescaled score of 10.6 would get exactly 10.6 years of educa-
tion. Some would encounter better teachers in future years. Others would have unanticipated
personal problems. But, by construction, they would get an average of 10.6 years of edu-
cation, and, more generally, by construction, the di¤erence between students’ actual and
predicted education would be orthogonal to their predicted education.
    Because we are temporarily assuming that measurement is perfect, if we observe that
blacks and whites have average scores of 12.3 and 13.1 in kindergarten, we can say that
the predicted education gap in kindergarten is .8 years. By measuring the gap as students
progress through school, we can determine whether it grows or shrinks.
    It is important to recognize that even if the test score does not change over time for
an individual or group, this does not mean that intervening events have been unimportant.
Indeed, by construction, the mean population test score does not change over time. It means
that subsequent events have (on average) been those predicted by the initial test score. The
low test score in kindergarten that may have re‡ected low parental investment in the child’s
human capital, low quality pre-school and/or cognitive de…cits also predicts continued low
investment, low quality elementary and secondary schools and continued cognitive de…cits.
If the gap between two groups does not change, it means that group membership does not
provide additional information about the future beyond the information contained in the
test score. We emphasize that this is a fundamental limit of tying test scores to an adult
outcome.


2.2    Intuition: Handling Measurement Error
So far we have assumed that the test measurement is perfect. In practice our test scores will
be imperfect because of randomness due to guessing, factors a¤ecting a student’s performance
on a particular day and test content. Students who perform well on a test will, on average,
have made lucky guesses, been feeling particularly good and be relatively strong in the
content of the exam. If we use a reading test, we will underpredict the educational attainment
of students who are particularly strong in math.
    For those schooled in the use of tests as performance measures and Bayesian statistics, it is
natural to think about shrinkage estimators. An extensive discussion of shrinkage estimators
is beyond both the scope of this paper and our expertise. Shrinkage estimators can be thought
of in two complementary ways. They are biased estimators that have lower mean-squared
error than unbiased estimators. They are estimators that use additional information to


                                               3
improve unbiased estimates. We are quite used to doing this in daily life.
    Early in the season, young baseball fans are often excited that player X is batting over .400
(hits divided by o¢ cial at bats) and might be the …rst player to do so since Ted Williams in
1941. Older fans would certainly not accept an even bet that the player will …nish the season
batting above .400 even though the maximum likelihood estimate based on performance to
date is above .400. The mere fact that there have been tens of thousands of player/seasons
since 1941 and no player has batted above .400, makes it unlikely that such an outstanding
performance early in the season will persist. One does not have to be a formally-trained
Bayesian to understand this. Depending on how far into the season we are, we may “shrink”
our estimate of X’s eventual batting average to, say, .350. Similarly, if we compare the test
scores of the highest and lowest performing students on a test, and we are asked to predict
the gap between them on a similar test, we should predict that the gap will be smaller than
the one observed on the initial test.
    There are variety of approaches using Bayesian methods to shrink the estimates. Clearly,
the best approach would be to observe, in a single season, a large number of batters hitting,
say .410 after 100 at bats, and calculating their mean batting average at the end of the
season. We could then say that a .410 after 100 at bats corresponds to an expected batting
average of perhaps .335 at the end of the season.1 In general, we need sophisticated statistical
techniques to make up for the absence of such data.
    Thus if we have the true mean eventual education associated with a test score, there is
no need to shrink the estimates. In a sense, we have done so already. If the test score is pure
noise, the predicted educational attainment for each test score will just be the overall mean
education. As measurement error shrinks, the variance of the rescaled test scores grows.
    In fact, if we have multiple tests, we have the opposite problem. Let us continue our
baseball example. Suppose we are asked to predict a player’s batting average based on ten
o¢ cial at bats. Suppose, we …nd that the proper shrinkage estimate is .252 + .001*(number
of hits) for up to …ve hits, the most observed in our …ctional example. Thus a player batting
.200 (two hits) has an estimated true batting average of .254 while one with a batting average
of .300 (three hits) has an estimated true batting average of .255. We expect that in reality
there should be even more shrinkage, but this degree of shrinkage is adequate to make our
point.
    Now suppose that we are comparing two teams of 25 players each of whom has had 10
at bats. We take the average of the shrunk scores for each team. Team A’s batting average
using the shrunk scores is .254. Its players have an average of two hits each. The team has
   1
    Baseball fans will understand that we will not have these data. We leave it to those with a greater
interest in baseball statistics to …gure out how to use ex ante information most e¢ ciently in this case.



                                                   4
a total of 50 hits in 250 at bats. If the true mean batting average for the team is .254, the
odds of having only 50 hits in 250 at bats is only about 2.5 percent.2 Suppose that team
B’s batting average using the shrunk scores is .255. The team has a total of 75 hits in 250
at bats. If its true team batting average is .255, the odds of it getting 75 or more hits in 250
at bats are only about 5 percent. The likelihood that the true team batting averages di¤er
by only .001 is very small. Using the average of the shrunk estimates understates the gap.
    The same logic applies when we have many students taking tests. If there is a genuine
gap in the average performance of two exogenously selected groups, then the average of the
individually shrunk gaps will be smaller than the true average gap. Our application is in
many ways more extreme than the baseball example we provide. Our shrinkage estimator is
based on a single test, but we will have many students of each race. We will have to undo
the natural shrinkage from scaling by average education. We do this by multiplying the
estimated gap by the inverse of the shrinkage parameter. We discuss how we can estimate
this in the next subsection.
    There is one last complication we must discuss. So far, we have assumed that the number
of observations with each test score/grade combination is large. In practice, this will not
be the case. Therefore, in addition to the other sources of measurement error discussed in
the literature, our transformed scales will be subject to sampling error and thus will be the
shrunk estimates plus sampling error. However as the number of observations gets large,
this sampling error will go to 0.


2.3     A More Formal Presentation
Suppose we are interested in the di¤erence in average “achievement” between blacks and
whites in a given grade. This poses two immediate problems. The …rst is that we cannot
observe achievement directly. The second is that achievement has no natural scale.
    To solve the latter problem, suppose we are interested in achievement because it predicts
future levels of education. We can then normalize achievement at a given time to be in units
of expected completed schooling, S; so that for each individual i in grade g,

                                             Si = Aig + "ig                                            (1)

where, Aig is units of normalized achievement and "ig is a mean zero error term that re‡ects
determinants of educational attainment that arise after the measurement of achievement.
We assume that E (Aig "ig ) = 0 and E ("ig "jg ) = 0 for i 6= j. The interpretation of " is
   2
    The probability that a randomly chosen player would have …ve hits out of ten is also about .02, but the
probability that at least one of …fty players would have …ve hits is about .66.


                                                    5
important. We will therefore discuss it in greater detail later in this section.
     We assume that we have access to a series of test scores. In each grade the test score,
 ig , is a function of Aig and some noise component ig ,



                                       ig   =   g (Aig )   +   ig :                         (2)

The function g re‡ects the fact that each test is scored in some arbitrary fashion so that it is
not necessarily linear in (normalized) units of achievement while ig , re‡ects the measurement
error associated with any test.
    We further assume that measurement error is uncorrelated over time, so that E[ ir is ] =
0, 8r 6= s. As Boyd, Lankford, Loeb and Wycko¤ (2012) discuss in detail there are a
number of factors that contribute to measurement error other than those captured by test
publishers’estimates of reliability. Some of these such as luck or how the student was feeling
on a particular day are very likely to be uncorrelated over time. This assumption is less
obvious in the case of the items or domains included in the exam. We will present evidence
that suggests that such serial correlation is unlikely to be a signi…cant problem in our data.
    We derive an “education-normalized scale” in the following fashion. Suppose that is
discrete, as it is in our data. We de…ne the scale by the population mean of Si at ig :
                                                  P
                                                       ig =q
                                                               Si
                                      sg (q) =                                              (3)
                                                      Nq

where Nq is the number of individuals in that grade with a score of = q. Thus sg (q) is the
average education ultimately attained by individuals with a score of q on the test in grade
g.
   We note that in practice this approach will add sampling error to the other sources of
measurement error because we have only a …nite number of observations at each score in
each grade. In part to address this issue, we also provide one set of estimates based on a
kernel estimator that combines test scores from three tests.
   Henceforth we drop the subscript g when doing so will not cause confusion.
   It is tempting to de…ne the education-normalized test score gap by the di¤erence in the
mean of s for the two groups. However, this will be incorrect. Suppose

                                            i   = Ai +     i                                (4)

and that A and are independent and normally distributed with variances 2A and 2v ,
respectively. Note that we are fortunate in this example because the test scores have already


                                                  6
been scaled to equal the achievement scale.
   A standard result from statistical theory gives

                                 E (Aj = a) =                 1a   + (1           1) A                        (5)

where                                                             2
                                                                  A
                                                  1   =       2       2
                                                                          :                                   (6)
                                                              A   +
   Now because s (a) is just the average of A given that equals a, by the law of large
numbers
                  plim N (a)!1 s(a) = E (Aj = a) = 1 a + (1  1 ) A:                (7)

   While the conclusion that si is the shrinkage estimate of (Aj i ) does not rely on the
assumption of normality, we will maintain this assumption for the rest of the example.
Suppose we have a large number of test scores from group c: Then

                                         i2c si                   i2c i
                            sc                        =   1 + (1                        1) A                  (8)
                                         Nc            Nc
                                             i2c (Ai + i )
                                 =       1                 + (1                       1) A                    (9)
                                                  Nc

where Nc is the number of members of group c: But

                                 i2c   (Ai +      i)
             plim Nc !1      1                         + (1           1) A        =     1 Ac   + (1   1) A   (10)
                                        Nc

where Ac is the mean achievement of group c:
   By the same logic

                          plim Nc !1 sc        plim Nb !1 sb =                1   (Ac    Ab ) :              (11)

To …nd a consistent estimate of the di¤erences in achievement between the two groups, we
need to augment the di¤erence between their mean education-scaled test scores by a factor
of 1 :
   To address this overcorrection, we approximate the relation between s and A by a linear
function
                                    si = 0 + 1 Ai + i :                               (12)

The linear relation is exact under the normality assumption but need not be otherwise. In
principle, we could allow for a more general relation.
    If we observed Ai , we could estimate 1 by regressing si on Ai . We do not observe A,

                                                          7
but we do observe S which, from (1), is a noisy measure of A. We estimate

                                         si =   0   +     1 Si    + "i                  (13)

Because Si = Ai + "i with E (A") = 0; the measurement error is classical. Therefore, we can
estimate 1 consistently if we can …nd a suitable instrument for S. A natural instrument
for S is sg 1 ; the (renormed) test score from a prior test. However, the renorming includes
Si and therefore is correlated with "i : Therefore, we construct a “leave-one-out”instrument
which is the average eventual educational attainment of all other individuals with the same
test score on the prior test               P
                                             gjg 1 =q;j6=i Sig 1

                             d1 (s                      Si sig    1
                              1      w    sb ) =        sig sig
                                                                      (sw   sb ) :      (15)
                                                                  1



Note that if measurement error is positively correlated over time, we will underestimate 1 1
and therefore the magnitude of the test-score gap. In …nite samples, this will be a problem
because some individuals will earn the same test score as each other in both grade g and
grade g 1. Their completed schooling enters the calculation of both sig and sig 1 creating
correlation in the error measurement. Asymptotically this correlation goes to zero as both
the overall measurement error and correlated measurement error go to zero. We return to a
discussion of the importance of small sample bias later.


2.4       Interpretation and the Martingale Property
It is important to remember exactly what our estimates mean and how they should be
interpreted. Aig is predicted educational attainment based on achievement in grade g: If, for
example, students are tracked in subsequent years based on achievement in grade g and if that
tracking a¤ects their subsequent educational attainment, we will attribute the e¤ect of the
subsequent tracking to their achievement in grade g: This attribution might be justi…ed since
there is a clear sense in which current achievement causes the future environment. However,
in other cases current achievement may merely predict future environment without causing
it. To take an extreme example, if only school quality determines educational attainment
and school quality is perfectly correlated over time, achievement at the end of kindergarten
will perfectly predict educational attainment. It would be easy to conclude that “nothing


                                                    8
after kindergarten a¤ects the achievement gap.” Yet, as both examples make clear, this is
not the case.
    Finally we note that this interpretation has important implications for what we should
…nd in the data. By de…nition
                                     Aig+1 = Aig + ! ig+1

where ! ig+1 is the innovation in achievement between grades and

                                                 T
                                      E Aig      t=1 ! ig+t          = 0:

Thus, A is a martingale and s is a martingale augmented with measurement error. As
discussed in Farber and Gibbons (1996), this means that the covariance of the test scores

                                             g+t                                   g
              g;g+t   = E Ao       A0 +      j=1 ! j   +       g+t    Ao    A0 +   j=1 ! j   +   g
                          2        g   2
                      =   A0   +   j=1 ! j   +   g;g+t
                                                           :

The …rst two terms are independent of t: Under the assumption that measurement error is
uncorrelated over time, the last term is 0 except when t equals 0: Note that in contrast,
the covariance is increasing in g: Therefore, the model implies that the lower triangle of the
covariance matrix is constant for all terms in a column below the diagonal and increasing
from left to right. We can therefore cast light on the importance of serial correlation of the
measurement error by examining the covariance matrix of the test scores.


3    Data
The Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CNLSY) is a biennial survey of
children born to women surveyed in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort
(NLSY79). The NLSY79 is a longitudinal survey that has followed a sample of 12,686
youths who were age 14 through 21 in December 1978. The survey includes a nationally
representative sample, as well as oversamples of blacks, Hispanics, military personnel, and
poor whites. The military and poor white oversamples were dropped from later surveys.
    Since 1986, the children of women from the NLSY79 have been surveyed and assessed
every other year. Separate questions are asked for children and young adults. Children are
eligible to enter the childhood sample at birth and advance to the young adult sample at age
15. As of 2010, a total of 11,506 children born to 4,931 unique mothers had been surveyed.
    Our focus is on the Peabody Individual Achievement Tests (PIAT). Children were given
three PIAT assessments in each survey in which they were age …ve through fourteen. The


                                                       9
PIAT Mathematics (PIAT-M) measures mathematics skill as typically taught in school. It is
comprised of 84 multiple choice questions on a wide range of topics from number recognition
to trigonometry. The PIAT Reading Recognition (PIAT-RR) is an oral reading test which
assesses children’s ability to recognize letters and read single words. The PIAT Reading
Comprehension (PIAT-RC) is a test of a child’s ability to understand sentences. The PIAT-
RC is administered only if the child’s score on the PIAT-RR is su¢ ciently high.3
    We also examine the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT). The PPVT is a test of
receptive vocabulary designed to assess general aptitude. The CNLSY currently administers
this test to children at age four or …ve and age eleven, but due to variation in this policy
over time, we observe PPVT scores for children as young as three. We are interested in the
PPVT primarily as a measure of achievement before entering grade-school. Therefore we
restrict our analysis of the PPVT to those who took the test before age …ve.
    While the survey is a panel by year, we are interested in the racial achievement gap by
grade. To convert our data to such a panel, we drop any child we observe in the same grade
over multiple surveys. Because the survey was conducted biennially, this restriction binds
if the child spent three years in the same grade and thus a¤ects only a handful of individ-
uals. We focus only on the black-white test gap, and drop members of other races. These
modi…cations leave us with an unbalanced panel of 7,343 children born to 3,318 mothers.
    The sample is not nationally representative because children born before 1982, when
the mothers were age seventeen through twenty-…ve, are observed only during their later
childhood, while those born in later years are observed only during their early childhood. To
correct for this non-representativeness, we create custom weights for each grade-test designed
to make that subsample nationally representative.4 Individuals with a valid PIAT-RR raw
score below the threshold for taking the RC are included in the construction of the weights
for the PIAT-RC but are excluded from the analysis. This avoids putting undue weight in
the early grades on a small number of low achieving students who advance to the RC due
to randomly high scores. The RC results should, therefore, be interpreted as representative
of the population that would have scored su¢ ciently well on the RR to take the RC exam
in that grade. Note that we should view gaps based on the RC with caution especially
in kindergarten but also in …rst grade because the students taking the exam are not fully
representative of the overall student population.
    Table 1 shows the gap on the age-adjusted percentile scale for each test in each grade,
   3
     From 1986 to 1992, the threshold was a raw score of 15 on the PIAT-RR. This threshold was subsequently
raised to 18.

using the custom weights discussed above.5 To ease comparison with other studies, in table
1 we follow convention and normalize the scores in each grade to have mean 0 and standard
deviation 1. Because some children leave the child sample and enter the young adult sample
during 8th grade, we restrict our attention to kindergarten through grade seven.
    Each test tells a di¤erent story about the black-white test gap. In kindergarten blacks
are .65 standard deviations behind whites on the math test. This gap rises only very slightly
through seventh grade. The two reading gaps are initially only very modest but grow to
roughly the magnitude of the math gap by third grade. The PPVT, administered earlier
than the PIAT tests, shows a gap of over one standard deviation, larger than the gap on any
PIAT test in any grade.
    Taken together these tests re‡ect the myriad of …ndings in the black-white test score gap
literature. The reading tests show the pattern demonstrated by Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2006)
for the test administered as part of the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey (Kindergarten
sample). The PPVT gap appears similar to that in Jencks and Phillips (1998), while the
PIAT-M shows a nearly constant gap that is smaller than the one observed on the PPVT.
    As discussed in Bond and Lang (forthcoming), these test gaps are based on arbitrary scal-
ing decisions. Plausible order-preserving transformations of the scales can produce startling
di¤erent results. The bounds we established in that paper are very large. There we show
that without placing more structure on the scales, the gap could be small to modest and
decreasing from kindergarten through third grade or small to nonexistent in kindergarten
but growing to substantial by the end of third grade, or somewhere in between.
    In this paper, we resolve this indeterminacy by relating the scores to economic outcomes,
in particular educational attainment. To do so, we construct a sample of 3,853 children who
are observed in the panel after age 22 and for whom we know highest grade completed. We
lose roughly one-half of our observations on each test, but still have over 1000 observations
for all but the earliest PIAT-RC. We again construct custom weights so that each of these
test-grade samples is nationally representative.
    Table 2 repeats table 1 for this subsample. The magnitudes of the test gaps are generally
similar to the full sample, though at times somewhat smaller. This probably re‡ects the fact
that children who are 22 by 2010 were born no later than 1988 when the mothers were 23 to
31 and thus were born to relatively young mothers. By restricting the age of the mothers,
we reduce the socioeconomic di¤erences between black and white mothers.6 Nevertheless,
   5
     This scale represents the percentile of the distribution each child’s raw score is in for their three month
age group. Note that since we are grouping children of di¤erent ages within the same grade together, this
means that younger children may have higher percentile scores than older children within the same grade
despite having answered fewer questions correctly.
   6
     On one measure of background, mother’s AFQT percentile score, the gap between blacks and whites



                                                      11
the patterns mimic those in table 1: a math test gap that grows only very slowly, a growing
reading gap, and a pre-schooling PPVT gap that is larger than that on any subsequent test.
    Since we use this sample only to translate test scores into an education scale, the test
score gap for the older sample has no direct signi…cance. The real risk is that, because
our sample with completed education was born to young mothers, the relation between test
scores and educational attainment for this group may not be representative of the entire
population in a way that biases our estimate of the “education test-score” gap. It will be
apparent that the test scores for the older group are lower than for the sample as a whole,
but it is di¢ cult to determine whether this causes any bias in our estimates of the test score
gap.
    Not surprisingly given past research, we observe a racial gap in educational attainment.
Table 2 also displays the di¤erence in average educational attainment between blacks and
whites for each test-grade sample. We observe gaps that are generally between .70 and .85
years of education, depending on the sample. This is somewhat higher than we observe
for their parents’generation (.70) in the NLSY79 adult sample. It is unclear whether this
re‡ects a change in the gap or the nonrepresentativeness of our older sample.
    Our empirical approach depends on the assumption that measurement error is uncorre-
lated over time. Our model implies that the covariance between a test score in period t and
all subsequent test scores cov(sg sg+2j ) should be a constant for all j = 1; 2; 3:::7 and that
cov (sg+k sg+k+2j ) should be nondecreasing in k for k positive. Appendix table A shows the
unweighted covariance matrix of the test scores. We have relatively few years for which we
can test this hypothesis. In all cases the covariance terms are much smaller than the vari-
ances. While we have not formally tested the hypothesis that cov(sg sg+2j ) is constant for all
test and grade combinations, it does not appear to be severely violated. This suggests that
the correlation in measurement error induced by some individuals sharing the same scores
in tests in years g and g 2 is unlikely to be a serious concern. We address this concern
directly later in the paper.


4     Empirical Implementation
In order to obtain estimates of sg for each grade-test combination, we use all individuals
in our sample with a valid score for that grade/test and for whom we observe educational
attainment after the age of 22. We then calculate average educational attainment by score
grows by about .03 standard deviations per year increase in mother’s age at child’s birth. Moreover, white
mothers tend to be older than black mothers.
   7
     We use 2j instead of j because tests are generally administered two years apart.



                                                   12
for that sample. We apply the results of this rescaling to the entire sample. We interpolate
sg for any test scores not present in the over 22 sample. This produces a score on the new
scale for each individual with a valid test score on that grade-test.
    Figures 1-3 show the relation between the transformed score and the base percentile on
each test. While the underlying relation should be strictly increasing, not surprisingly, given
the small number of observations with a particular score on a given test, there is notable
imprecision in our point estimates. There is, however, a clear overall positive relation between
test performance and educational attainment, s, on each test in each grade.
    We …rst estimate the gap between blacks and whites using the sg scales. However as
discussed above, these scales over-correct for measurement error when applied to group
averages and thus understate the gap. We correct this by estimating the relation between
schooling and the sg scores. If schooling were a perfect measure of achievement/ability, this
would provide an estimate of how much our sg measure understates achievement. However
schooling is achievement measured with error, and so this will attenuate our correction
towards zero. We correct this by using the lagged sg values as instruments. Because the
survey is given biennially, we use two year (grade) lagged test scores. For the …rst grade and
kindergarten scores, we use the childhood PPVT s. We also use the PPVT as an instrument
for the second grade PIAT-RC due to the small size and selected nature of the sample of
children who advance to that test in kindergarten. Each instrument is calculated using the
leave-one-out method to avoid correlation arising from the use of the individual’s eventual
schooling attainment in creating the s scale.8
    We bootstrap the standard errors. Particularly in the early grades, the distribution of the
bootstrap estimates tends to be skewed. Therefore, we present the 95% con…dence intervals
for all of our estimates, which will be valid under weaker assumptions than required for the
use of the normal approximation.
    The scale discussed thus far assumes that we value all years of education equally. There
are many other possible choices. We do not attempt to consider the full range of alternatives,
which would lead to a bounding exercise similar to that in Bond and Lang (forthcoming).
Instead, we consider one quasi-monetary scale in which we scale education by the associated
mean log annual earnings. While it would be more natural to relate test scores directly
to wages or earnings, our sample is too young for this exercise to be informative, and we
therefore rely on the indirect approach.
    Using 2007 data from the American Community Survey (ACS), we calculate the average
   8
     It would be possible to estimate by using the older sample to calculate Ssg 2 and the full sample
to calculate sg sg 2 : This would probably increase the precision of our estimates somewhat, but we are
concerned that because the older sample is more homogeneous, calculating covariances from two di¤erent
samples would be problematic.

log annual earnings by years of education for white males born in 1967.9 The ACS and
CNLSY education categories do not line up exactly, particularly among those with more
than a high school diploma. We assign all CNLSY observations whom we observe with
13-15 years of education with the average log income of those in the ACS who are either
college dropouts or associate’s degree holders. We likewise assign those with 17 or 18 years of
education the average of those in the ACS with a master’s degree, and those with more than
18 years of education are assigned the average of doctoral and professional degree holders. We
exclude from our calculations those who earn less than $6,000 in salary income.10 We repeat
our estimates replacing years of education with the average log earnings values to compute
sg . Early in our research, we also experimented with a scale based on mean earnings rather
than mean log earnings. The results with the two measures were broadly similar, and we
did not pursue this approach further.


5         Results
5.1         Estimated Achievement Gaps
Table 3 shows the test score gaps as measured by sg for each PIAT grade-test. The boot-
strapped 95 percent con…dence intervals are in brackets. These scores have a clear inter-
pretation with respect to adult outcomes: the average expected educational attainment of
children with the black distribution of PPVT scores is .88 years lower than that of children
with the white distribution. When measured this way, each of the PIAT tests shows a simi-
lar pattern. There is some growth in the gap over the …rst few years of education, but the
gap stabilizes by third grade and remains roughly constant through seventh grade. Blacks,
however begin much further behind in math than in reading. Based on their math tests
in kindergarten, blacks are expected to obtain .55 fewer years of education than do whites,
compared to a gap of only .20 years on the reading recognition test. This di¤erence in the
gap closes rapidly, so that by the third grade blacks are .67 years of expected education
behind in math and .60 and .61 on the reading recognition and comprehension tests. We
remind the reader that the reading comprehension results in the earliest grades should be
treated with caution because many students in these grades do not perform su¢ ciently well
on the reading recognition test to advance to the comprehension test. Therefore the results
for the reading comprehension test are based on a selected sample. Nevertheless the patterns
for the two reading tests are similar.

    These results do not account for measurement error and the corresponding over-correction
when a shrinkage estimate based on a single test score is applied to a group average. Table 4
reports corrected gaps using the IV strategy discussed above. Strikingly, after correcting for
excess shrinkage, the three tests show a consistent story. There is no evidence in any test that
the black-white test gap grows over time. On the math test, the kindergarten black-white
test gap projects that, on average, blacks will obtain 1.24 fewer years of education than
whites do. This gap is substantially larger than the black-white education gap observed
in the data, and is consistent with Lang and Manove (2011), who show that blacks obtain
more education than whites do conditional on test scores. By seventh grade the gap has, in
fact, decreased to .89 years of education, though we cannot reject that it is unchanged. The
reading recognition test shows a gap of .64 years of education in kindergarten and remains
‡at at .68 years in seventh grade.
    We are unable to estimate the gap on the reading comprehension test at kindergarten
with any precision. While our estimates suggest that this test, as scaled by educational
attainment, is mostly noise, we cannot precisely pin down the size of the bias this creates,
and thus our con…dence interval spans 10 years of education. Using the …rst grade as our
reference point then, we again see no evidence of growth in the test gap through seventh
grade. As noted above, however, this is still a somewhat selected sample. Roughly 15% of
…rst graders do not score well enough on the PIAT-RR to take the PIAT-RC. This number
is less than 1% in second grade, when we observe a .91 year education gap in performance.
From this reference point, the gap falls to .72 by seventh grade, a decline similar to the one
on the math test, although this change is again not statistically signi…cant.
    It is striking to compare tables 3 and 4. Measurement error and thus the implicit shrink-
age on the test declines dramatically as students progress through school. On the math
test, the adjustment factor is about 125 percent in kindergarten but only about 25 percent
in seventh grade. Similarly, on the reading recognition test the adjustment factor goes from
about 3 in kindergarten to .2 in seventh grade.
    We note that as Murnane et al (2006) argued and our earlier paper (Bond and Lang,
forthcoming) con…rmed with other scales, the gap on the early PPVT test is much higher
than on the PIAT. Our estimate of the unadjusted gap on the PPVT is .88 years of education.
While this is higher than all of our unadjusted gaps, it is somewhat lower than the adjusted
gap on the PIAT-M at entry and about the size of some of our early estimates of the reading
gap. While we cannot adjust the PPVT gap for measurement error, one plausible explanation
for the di¤erence between the early PIAT and PPVT estimates is that the latter test su¤ers
from much less measurement error.
    Consistent with this interpretation, the covariance between the PPVT and the two read-


                                              15
ing tests (see appendix table A) increases sharply between kindergarten and third grade from
.21 to .39 for reading recognition and from .14 to .37 for reading comprehension. Note that
this is only possible if the PIAT reading tests are doing a better job of capturing skills already
acquired by the time the children took the PPVT.11 In contrast the correlation between the
PPVT and math PIAT is roughly constant, going from .34 to .35.
     Similarly, we might expect the correlation between child’s test score and mother’s perfor-
mance on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test, often used as a measure of general intelligence,
would decline as children progress through school. In fact, this correlation increases from
kindergarten to second grade for each of the PIAT tests (not shown). While greater mea-
surement error on the kindergarten test than on the second grade test is not the only possible
explanation for this regularity, it is surely one of the simplest.
     These results show the achievement gap when test scores are calibrated using education
and treating all years of education as equally valuable. It is natural to ask whether the results
would be similar using other important metrics such as wages or earnings. Unfortunately,
the sample of respondents in the CNLSY for whom we have wage data is small and not
representative. Therefore, as discussed above, we instead scale education by the earnings
associated with each level of education, a non-linear transformation of the education scale.
     Table 5 shows the measurement-error corrected results from this exercise. The results
con…rm the patterns obtained when using completed education to scale the test scores. There
is little evidence of a growing achievement gap between blacks and whites. The math test
suggests that, given their performance in kindergarten, blacks will earn roughly 17% less
than whites do and shows no signi…cant change through seventh grade. While the size of
the gap ‡uctuates across grades, any evidence for a change in the gap is in the direction of
blacks catching up rather than falling behind.
     The gaps implied by the reading tests are similar and, if anything, lower than those
derived from the math test. Still in neither case does table 5 suggest that the gap grows as
children progress through school.
     Nevertheless, there is also a striking di¤erence between the results in tables 4 and 5.
Assuming even a 10 percent return to education, the gaps in math in table 4 suggest a (log)
wage gap on the order of .08 to .1. The math gaps in table 5 are all above this range as are
the slightly smaller estimated reading gaps. Measured by this dollar metric, the test score
gap appears substantially larger.
     To address the concern that our results are driven by di¤erences between blacks and
  11
    A possible explanation for this increased ability to capture these skills is that they are more correlated
with the more advanced skills of third graders than with the sorts of skills generally developed by the end
of kindergarten.

whites in both test scores and educational attainment, tables 6 and 7 repeat tables 4 and
5, but use only whites in the calculation of the rescaled test scores. Our estimated gaps
are similar whether we include or exclude blacks in the re-scaling of the scores although the
latter are less precise.


5.2    Uni…ed Measure of Achievement
Thus far we have considered using adult outcomes as a way to scale the individual subject
tests. In this subsection we combine information from all three tests to estimate a sin-
gle measure of achievement in each grade by forming a conditional expectation of future
achievement
                                   E[Aig jTig ] = h(Tig )

where T is the set of tests available for student i and h is the conditional expectation
function. Analogous to our earlier discussion, we do not observe achievement directly but
observe eventual educational attainment, which re‡ects achievement in grade g. Following
the theory laid out previously, if we can estimate h, we can use instrumental variables to
create corrected achievement gaps for each grade.
    We estimate h using a multivariate kernel Nadarya-Watson regression estimator. For a
set of test scores T , the estimator creates weights for each observation based on the closeness
of its test scores to T . The estimator then uses these weights to form a weighted average of
the outcome variable (in our case, education). Thus we can generate an expected outcome
conditional on the full set of tests.
    The weights depend on the choice of kernel function and bandwidth. We select a multi-
variate Gaussian kernel. For each point, the kernel weights observations around the point so
that the density is multivariate normal. The choice of kernel is inconsequential; however the
bandwidth is not (Blundell and Duncan, 1998). In a multivariate Gaussian kernel, the band-
width essentially determines the variance of the density. For bandwidth selection, we follow
Silverman’s (1986) rule of thumb, so that the bandwidth is proportional to the variance of
the distribution in the data.
    As previously noted, many children do not advance to the reading comprehension test
during the …rst two years of school. To account for this, we estimate the conditional expec-
tations separately for those who did and did not take the RC exam. In the remaining grades,
the very small sample of children who do not advance to the reading comprehension exam
is dropped from the analysis.
    Table 8 displays the results of this exercise. The …rst column shows our achievement
gap estimates using only the di¤erences in conditional expectations, not adjusting for excess


                                              17
shrinkage. We see the familiar pattern of a rising initial achievement gap. Based on their
performance on all tests in kindergarten, blacks are projected to obtain .41 fewer years of
education than whites do. This gap rises quickly, however, to .73 years in second grade and
remains roughly constant thereafter. In this respect, the results are more similar to those in
table 3 for math than for either of the reading tests. This may re‡ect the poor ability of the
early reading tests to predict educational attainment.
    However, once we correct for excess shrinkage, the growth in the gap again disappears.
The estimates in column two project a future racial di¤erence in educational attainment
of .82 years in kindergarten, with little change through seventh grade. Once again, the
projected education gap is at least as high if not higher than the actual education gap,
consistent with Lang and Manove (2011).
    The results in table 8 are broadly consistent with those in table 4. In every grade
except 7th, the estimated gap when we use all three tests lies within the range of the gaps
produced by using each of the three tests individually. However, the con…dence intervals are
consistently tighter when we use all three tests, and our estimates appear meaningful even
for kindergarten and …rst grade.
    Moreover, the gap averages about .9 years of education, almost exactly what we obtain
using the early PPVT test. This suggests that the di¤erence between the results using the
PPVT and PIAT tests may not be their content but simply greater measurement error in
the latter although we cannot test this directly
    In table 9, we repeat the exercise but instead scale the tests to represent the education-
predicted mean log incomes of each score. We …nd similar results to those of table 8. The
achievement gap remains steady at about a 12% income di¤erence, which is on par with
that shown for the math achievement tests in table 5. Our estimates are also generally more
precise than in table 5, though the improvement in precision is not nearly as substantial as
with the education-scaled scores.


5.3    Correlated Measurement Error
As discussed above, in some cases more than one individual gets the same pair of scores
on, for example, the …rst and third grade math tests. Suppose that Linda and Mike both
got 28th percentile in …rst grade and 36th percentile in third grade. Then both Linda and
Mike’s eventual education enter the calculation of the mean education associated with a 36
in third grade. Moreover, when we instrument for Mike’s third grade education-scaled score
with the mean education of everyone else with a 28 in …rst grade, Linda’s education will also




                                             18
enter that calculation. This creates correlated measurement error in …nite samples.12
    To cast light on the importance of this small sample bias for our sample, we ran four
simulations in which we took our actual data and added additional error to the education
levels. We added a mean zero normal error with standard deviations of 1, 2, 3 and 4. Since
the standard deviation of education conditional on test scores is a little less than 2 in most
grades, we in e¤ect experimented with increasing the sampling variance by 50-500 percent.
    We conducted the simulation 100 times and compared the mean estimates with our actual
estimates. The di¤erences caused by this increase in the sampling error were su¢ ciently
modest that in no case were we able to reject that the simulations produced estimates that,
on average, were equal to those obtained with the actual data. And the di¤erences between
the mean simulated and actual coe¢ cients were also visually modest, suggesting that small
sample bias due to correlated measurement error is not a major concern.13


5.4     Achievement Gaps and Sociodemographics
One of the key …ndings in Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2006) was that the early test gap could be
“explained”by a small set of sociodemographic controls. Our earlier work (Bond and Lang,
forthcoming) showed that while the gaps after controlling for sociodemographic factors were
still sensitive to scale choice, they were much more robust than the raw gaps. In tables 9
and 10, we explore the impact of sociodemographics on our “education-scaled”test gaps.
     We select a set of sociodemographic controls from the CNLSY to account for di¤erences in
the early childhood environment. We include mother’s education and age at …rst birth, and
the child’s birth weight. We also include a set of controls for the child’s home environment
from age 0-2: log family income, log hours worked per week by the mother, whether the child
ever lived in a household below the poverty line and categorical variables for number of books
in the household, amount of cuddly and plush toys, frequency with which the mother reads
to the child, whether the child sees a father-…gure daily, and frequency of eating dinner with
both parents. When we had multiple observations of these variables between age 0 and 2
we used the mean for income and hours worked, and the median category for the categorical
variables.14 From the year in which the test is administered we control for whether the
child sees a father-…gure daily and whether there are ten or more children’s books in the
  12
     Asymptotically there will be lots of such pairs but their mean deviation from expected education will go
to 0, so the IV estimator is consistent.
  13
     In one case in the experiment which added N(0,16) error, there was a noticable di¤erence between the
mean estimate of the experiment and table 4, but the variance around this estimate was much too large to
be meaningful.
  14
     If children had a median category in between two discrete categories, a new category was created for
them.



                                                     19
household, as well as family income and mother’s hours worked and poverty status. This set
of controls is based on the ones used in the CNLSY by Lang and Sepulveda (2008) to closely
match those used by Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2006) in the ECLS-K although it is probably
somewhat more extensive that the latter.
    We compute the education-scaled test scores and their measurement error corrections
as before and then add these controls to our regression to estimate the controlled test gap.
Tables 10 and 11 show the results for the education- and mean log income-scaled test scores,
respectively. While we lack precision in our estimates of the education-scaled gaps, there is
no evidence that the controlled gap increases with schooling. Our estimates using the mean
log income-scaled test scores are more precise and tell the same story. Relative to table 5, our
controls reduce the gap on every test and in every grade, sometimes quite substantially. In
fact, at no point using this scale is the test gap in reading recognition statistically signi…cant
once we control for early childhood environment.
    One must always be careful in the interpretation of achievement gaps conditional on
sociodemographics. As pointed out by Jensen (1969), environment may re‡ect heritable
factors. However, our results in table 11, in particular, suggest that the frequently observed
racial test gaps may re‡ect a common e¤ect of environment on test scores, and not a speci…c
race-based environmental disadvantage.


6     Summary and Conclusions
The comparison of tables 1, 3 and 4 leads us to a strong conclusion. The apparent growth
of the black-white test score gap from kindergarten through third grade is likely to be an
artifact of measurement error. Fryer and Levitt (2004, 2006) report this growth for the Early
Childhood Longitudinal Survey using their base scale. Our earlier work (Bond and Lang,
forthcoming) con…rms this …nding and replicates it using the base scale from a sample from
the CNLSY similar to the one in the current paper. We …nd the same growing gap when
we use percentiles (table 1) or our transformation based on eventual educational attainment
(table 3) instead of the base scale. Yet when we use instrumental variables to adjust the
estimate for the e¤ect of measurement error on the shrinkage associated with rescaling by
adult outcomes (table 4), the pattern disappears. Indeed when we use this approach on all
three PIAT tests in combination, the gap is large and consistent with the gap on the early
PPVT.
    We emphasize again that our …nding of a constant gap in grades K through 7 does not
mean that the gap neither widens nor narrows according to some other metric. It could be
that the gap between low-performing and high-performing students narrows or grows over

                                               20
these years. This is di¢ cult, if not impossible, to determine when we only have an ordinal
achievement measure. Our results say only that the racial gap does not widen or narrow
relative to the education level or the mean log earnings associated with that education level
that would be predicted on the basis of early test scores.
    In particular, our results neither support nor contradict the view that “it is all over
by …rst grade.” They are consistent with this view but also with one in which the later
environment is important but in which early test scores predict later environment.
    Despite this limit on their interpretation, we believe that our results advance our under-
standing of the black-white test score gap by elucidating the importance of measurement
error and by emphasizing that its evolution does not have a strictly racial component after
kindergarten.
