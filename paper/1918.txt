         Multicountry, Multifactor Tests of the Factor Abundance Theory

                                    ABSflACT


    This paper presents conceptually correct tests of the
Heckscher—Ohlin proposition that trade in commodities can be
explained in terms of an interaction between factor input
requirements and factor endowments. Most prior work that claims to
present tests of this hypothesis have used                      intuitive but
inappropriate generalizations of the traditional two by two model
to deal with a multidimensional reality. Moreover, prior work has
in general used measurements on only two of the three variables
(trade, factor input requirements and factor endowments) that are
required for a proper test of the H—O theory.
     We derive an exact specification of the H—O interaction in a
multicountry, multicommodity, multif actor world in the form of the
Heckscher—Ohlin—Vanek         (H—O—V) theorem which equates the factors
embodied in net trade         to excess factor supplies.    This theorem
implies sign and rank         propositions analogous to those implicitly
studied by Leontief,          but it also implies hypotheses about the
parameters   linking   factor   contents   and  factor   supplies.
Accordingly, we conduct tests of the sign and rank propositions as
well as several parametric hypotheses which permit various
assumptions about measurement errors, nonproportional consumption
and technological differences.       Our analysis uses separately
measured data on trade, factor input requirements and endowments
for twenty—seven countries and twelve factors in 1967.

     Tests of the Leontief type sign and rank propositions sharply
 reject this facet of the H—O—V model.   In particular, the sign of
 net factor exports infrequently predicts the sign of excess factor
 supplies and therefore does not systematically reveal factor
 abundance.
     The results from an extended set of tests conducted in a
 regression context reject the H—O—V hypothesis of an exact
 relationship between factor contents and national factor supplies.
 Support   is  found  for   the  H—O--V  assumption of homothetic
 preferences, but estimates of the parameters linking factor
 contents and factor supplies are found to differ significantly from
 their theoretical values. We find there is clear evidence that the
 departure of the estimated coefficients from their theoretical
 values is importantly related to differences across countries in
 the matrix of factor input requirements and, by implication, to
 violation of the assumption of factor price equalization. We also
 find that errors of measurement in both trade and national factor
 supplies are an important reason for rejection of the H—O—V
 hypothesis.

I. Introduction
     The Heckscher—Ohlin (H—O) hypothesis is most widely understood
in its two_good two—factor form: a country exports the commodity
which uses intensively its relatively abundant resource. Tests of
this hypothesis have been inconclusive for two reasons. First, the
three pairwise comparisons required by this 2 x 2 model cannot be
made unambiguously in a multifactor, multicomrnodity world. Most
previous papers that claim to present tests of the hypothesis have
used intuitive but inappropriate generalizations of the two by two
model to deal with a multidimensional reality. Second, the H—O
hypothesis is a relation among three separately observable

phenomena: trade, factor input requirements and factor endowments.
A proper test of the hypothesis requires measurements of all three
of these variables. Much prior work that claims to have tested the
hypothesis has used data on only two of the three hypotheticals.
     This paper reports conceptually correct tests of the 1-1—0

hypothesis as suggested by Learner (1980) and Learner and Bowen

(1981). We use a valid multidimensional extension of the two by
two model known as the Heckscher—Ohlin—Vanek (H—0—V) theorem which
equates the factors embodied in a country's net exports to the
country's excess supplies of factor endowments. And we use
separately measured data on trade, factor input requirements and
factor endowments to conduct the first systematic and complete

evaluation of the relationships implied by the H—O hypothesis among
these three sets of variables.
     Our methods contrast sharply with traditional approaches to
testing the H—O hypothesis. The classic test of the H—O hypothesis
is Leontief's (1953) which compares the capital per man embodied in

                                  1
a million dollars worth of exports with the capital per man
embodied in a million dollars worth of imports. Learner (1980)

shows this comparison does not reveal the relative abundance of
capital and labor in a multifactor world. Moreover, Leontiefs
study uses data on trade and factor input requirements but not
factor endowments and, in addition, his data are only for a single

country.
     A second type of purported test uses a regression of trade of

many commodities on their factor input requirements for a single

country (e.g., Baldwin (1971), Branson and Monoyios (1977),
Harkness (1978, 1983), $tern and Maskus (1981)). If the estimated
coefficient of some factor is positive, the country is inferred to
be abundant in that resource. Learner and Bowen (1981) show this
also is an inappropriate inference in a multifactor world since

there is no guarantee that the signs of the regression coefficients
will reveal the abundance of a resource. Moreover, these studies
do not use factor endowment data.'
     A third approach used to study the sources of comparative
advantage involves regressions of net exports of a single commodity
for many countries on measures of national factor supplies (Bowen

(1983), Chenery and Syrquin (1975) and Learner (1974, 1984). This
approach is conceptually correct but does not constitute a complete

test of the theory because data on factor input requirements are

not used.
     The present study computes the amount of each of twelve

factors embodied in the net exports of twenty—seven countries in

1967 using a U.S. matrix of total input requirements for 1967. The
factors embodied in trade are then compared with direct measures of

                                 2
factor endowments to determine the extent to which the data conform
to the H—C--V theorys predictions.

    We first test the traditional interpretation of the H—C

hypothesis that trade reveals relative factor abundance.2 This
analysis is analogous to Leontiefs attempt to determine the
relative abundance of capital and labor in the United States using
U.S. data alone. Our empirical results amount to a disaster for
this facet of the H—C model. Several types of measurement error
could account for this disaster. Moreover, the H—C—V model implies
a set of equalities, not inequalities, among the variables. We
therefore extend the analysis of the H—C—V model to a regression
context, and conduct an second set of tests which examine these

equalities while allowing different hypotheses about preferences,
technological differences, and various forms of measurement error.
     Overall, our results do not support the H—C—V proposition of
an exact relationship between factor contents and factor supplies.
Although support is found for the H—C—V assumption of homothetic
preferences, our estimates of the parameters linking factor
contents and factor supplies are found to differ significantly from
their theoretical values. Our work leads us to believe that the
poor performance of the H—O—V model is importantly related to

technological differences (and by implication, factor price
differences) across countries, as well as measurement errors.

II. Theoretical Framework
   Derivation of the relationships studied here starts with the

equilibrium identity expressing a country s net factor exports as
the difference between factors absorbed in production and factors


                                 3
absorbed in consumption:

(1)            AT1 =   A1Q1
                              —   A1C1

where

        A1 = KxN matrix of factor input coefficients which indicate
               the total (direct plus indirect) amount of each factor
               needed to produce one unit of output.

        T1 =   Nxl vector of net trade flows of country 1.
          = Nxl vector of country is final outputs.
          = Nxl vector of country is final consumption.
        Full employment implies A1Q1 = E1 where E1 is the Kxl vector of
country is factor supplies. Thus, the vector of factors embodied
in net trade is

(2)            F1 = A1T1 =         — A1C1.

This identity is transformed into a testable hypothesis by making
one or more of the following three assumptions:

(Al)      All individuals face the same commodity prices.

(A2)      Individuals have identical and homothetic tastes.

(A3)      All countries have the same factor input matrix, A1 = A.
        Ordinarily, the assumption of identical input matrices (A3)

would be replaced by the assumption of factor price equalization.
The alternative to factor price equalization permitted here is that
input requirements are technologically fixed and identical across
countries but countries have different factor prices and thus

produce different subsets of commodities.

        Assumptions (Al) and (A2) imply that the consumption vector of
country i is proportional to world output, C = s1Q,, where Q is
the world output vector and s1 is country is consumption share.
The consumption share can then be derived by premultiplying the



                                             4
identity far net trade (T1 =     —       by the vector of common

goods prices:
(3)        s1=(Y1—B1)/Y
where Y1 is GNP and B1 is the trade balance. If trade is balanced,
then s equals country is share of world GNP.
      If, in addition, the factor input matrices are identical, we

can write A1C = s1AQ = s1E where E =     EE    is the Kxl vector of

world factor supplies. Then, (2) can be written as

(4)        F1 = E1 —   E(Y1 — B1)/Y.
Note that if the exact relationship given by (4) were studied using
regression analysis, a test of the H—O---V model would involve

testing whether the parameter linking factor contents F1 and

national resource supplies E1 differed significantly from unity.

III. Methods of Testing
      Equation (4) specifies an exact relationship between factor
contents and factor endowments. This relationship can be tested by
measuring the net export vector T1, the factor input matrix A, and
the excess factor supplies E — s1 E and computing the extent to
which these data violate the equality given by (4). Such analysis
requires some sensible way of measuring the distance between two
matrices: the matrix with columns equal to the factor contents of
trade for each country, and the matrix with columns equal to the
excess factor supplies for each country. We first examine the
extent to which row and column elements of these matrices conform

in sign and rank without reference to any specific alternative

hypotheses. Then we report tests against alternatives involving
nonpropartional consumption, measurement errors and differences in


                                     5
input matrices.
      A typical kth element of (4), scaled by factor consumption, is

(5)        Fkj/(sjEW) =   [Ej/(sjEkW)J — 1.
If the right hand side of (5) is positive, the country is defined
to be abundant in resource k, in the sense of having an endowment

share Eki/EkW which exceeds the consumption share.4     If equation
(5) is accurate then the sign of the net exports of the factor F1
will conform in sign with the abundance indicator ((Ekj/EkW) —   1).
This sign proposition is tested for each factor (country) by

computing the frequency of sign matches between corresponding
elements in each row (column) of the factor contents matrix and the

excess factor supply matrix. Fisher's Exact test (one—tail) is
used to test the hypothesis of independence between the sign of the
factor contents and of the excess factor supplies against the
alternative of a positive association.
      Equation (5) also implies that trade should reveal the

complete ordering of factor abundance ratios. For each country or

factor, the ranking of scaled net factor exports (F}:i/tsjE.i)

should conform to the ranking of factors by their abundance,

Ekj/(sjEkW).5     These rank propositions are tested for each country

(factor) by computing the rank correlation between corresponding
columns (rows) of the scaled factor content matrix and the scaled
excess factor supplies matrix.

      These sign and rank tests do not refer to specific alternative

hypotheses and they may generate evidence against the H—O—V
hypothesis for a variety of reasons including nonproportional
consumption, various kinds of measurement errors and differences in
factor input matrices. These alternatives are studied by

                                     6
regressions of factor contents on endowments as described below.
        The general hypothesis of nonidentical, nonhomothetic tastes
cannot be allowed since then trade, which is the difference between
production and consumption, would be completely indeterminate6.
Instead, we study a specific alternative to assumption A2:

(A2') All individuals have identical preferences with linear Engel
          curves; within each country income is equally distributed.

        The modification of (4) implied by (A2') is derived by noting
that (A2') implies per capita consumption is a linear function of
per capita income. Therefore, we can write country is total
consumption of commodity j (C1) as a linear function of its
                                          7
population L1 its total income Y1:

(6)     C =                —    Ly°)
               X1L +
where
               = per capita "autonomous" consumption of commodity j
                = marginal budget shares, E1         =   1

                =

        Summing (6) over i gives the marginal budget shares
(7)       = (Q — XL)/(Y —          Ly°)
where L is world population. Inserting (7) into (6) and then
premultiplying by the kt row of A (ak), the amount of factor k
absorbed in consumption akC is

(8)     akCI = (Gk —   kY) L1   + $Y
where

           =
                      —                —      Ly°)
          = (E1 akQW1      aklXLW)/(YV
          = (Ekw   0k)/(,r — Ly°)


                                          7
       Equation (B) implies that equation (4) can be written

(9)    F1 =       — 9L1 —   (Y1   — B1)

where 8 and        are Kxl vectors with positive elements. Maintaining
assumption (A2) involves the restriction that 8 = 0 and $ =

EkW/YW.
       The possibility of measurement errors is incorporated in our
analysis in several ways. We assume measurement of net trade
differs from its true value by a constant plus a random error:

(Ml') T=W+Ti+Tie
where the vector T is the measured value of the vector T1, w is an
Nxl vector of constants and T1 is the error vector.            The null

hypothesis is that there is no measurement error bias

(Ml)      = 0

Assumption (Ml )        implies   the factor content vector is also measured

with error:

(10) F = AT =           Aw + AT + AT1e

                        = a + F + F1
where F is the measured value of F1, a = Aw           is a Kxl vector of

unknown constants and Fie is the error vector with covariance

matrix that is assumed diagonal for convenience.
        The measurements of the endowments are also assumed to be

imperfect but in a different way:

(M2 )     E   =   FE1
where E is the measured value, E1 the true value and F is a KxK

diagonal matrix with positive elements              The null hypothesis of

no measurement errors is
(M2) F = I

The form of the measurement error contained in (M2 )          is   also chosen


                                          8
for convenience since random measurement errors in more than one
variable would force us into consideration of an errors—in—
variables model which entails regressions in more than one
direction. With our assumptions, factor contents are always the

dependent variable.
         A third source of measurement error we consider is the
incomplete coverage of countries. World endowments and world GNP
are estimated here by summing across the sample of countries. The
resulting underestimates of the world totals would not affect our

analysis if excluded countries had total endowments proportional to
the sample totals. As an alternative to this assumption we can
assume that the calculated totals contain no information about
world totals. This latter assumption can be stated formally as

(M3' )        E = QE
                =
The subscript s refers to the subset of countries in the sample; Q
is a diagonal matrix containing unknown positive elements and q is
an unknown positive scalar. The null hypothesis is

(M3)            =   I   and q5 = 1.

         Combining the assumption of nonproportional consumption (A2
with the measurement error assumptions (Ml ) — (M3 ), the

expression far country is         net   trade in factor k becomes

(11) FkI = Y)c: + 'ykEki —    9kLi — J(Y1 — B1) + Fkie
where the superscript m is suppressed for notational convenience.
         The alternative to the assumption of identical input matrices
(A3) that we consider is the assumption that input matrices differ
by a proportional constant. This amounts to assuming neutral
differences in technology across countries. Since we calculate

                                          9
factor contents using the U.S. input matrix, the proportional
difference in input matrices is measured relative to the U.S.

input matrix. This assumption can be written

(A3 )          A3    = &A1

where      >   0    and      =   1.
        Assumption (A3 )         implies    that 9k'       and Fkj are now 9k/51,

and F/45, respectively, where F is country is net trade in
factor k computed using the U.S. input matrix. Substituting these
new values into (11) gives

(12)           (l/&)F = (1/3j)otk          + 'Yk5kj —   (1/j)ObL
                                 —    (1/I)k(YI—Bj)     + (1/ôj)F}.je

The EkI do not involve the term (1/) since they are measured
independent of the input matrix. Multiplication of (12> by
yields the bi—linear form:

(13) F =           ak + (jy).)Eki — OhLi
                                         —     k(ij)        + Fkie
Equation (13) identifies our most general model8 which we estimate

using an iterative maximum likelihood procedure discussed below.
        In addition to the general hypothesis contained in (13)
(hereafter denoted HG), we consider ten alternative hypotheses Hi—

1110 selected from the set of possibilities corresponding to
different choices from the list of assumptions about the theory and
the nature of measurement errors. Table 1 states each alternative
in terms of the restrictions it imposes on the parameters of (13).
        Hypotheses HG—RiO each maintain the assumption of common goods
prices (Al). Hypotheses H1—H7 further maintain the assumption of
proportional consumption while allowing tests of the assumptions of
identical input matrices (A2), measurement error in trade and the

endowments, and incomplete coverage of countries.. The hypotheses

of special interest are: H4, which leaves only ? unrestricted and
corresponds to the H—O--V hypothesis that the parameter linking

factor contents and national factor supplies is unity; H3, which
maintains the assumptions of proportional consumption (A2) and
complete coverage of countries (143); H9, which maintains only the

assumption of identical technologies (A3); and H1O, which
maintains the hypothesis that both trade and the endowments are

measured without error (Ml and 142).

       Given estimates of the unrestricted parameters in (13) under
each hypothesis, a method is required to determine the overall
performance of each alternative. One possibility is to form
indexes based on the maximized value of the likelihood function

associated with (13):

(14)        L =

where ESS is the error sum—of--squares (summed over countries and
factors) and NK is the number of observations. Values of L, like
an R2, necessarily increases as the number of parameters increases
and some form of degrees of freedom correction is required. We
adopt the asymptotic Bayes formula proposed in the context of

regression by Learner (1978, p. 113) and more generally by Schwarz

(1978):
            L- = L          —/2
(15)                 (NK)

where p is the number of parameters estimated under a given
hypothesis. Given an alternative hypothesis j and a null
hypothesis i we form the ratio:

(16)       A =    L/L1      =           (NK)ij"2.
The evidence is then said to favor the alternative if A > 1.     If

the parameter values associated with each hypothesis are considered

                                   11
equally likely a priori, then A is interpreted as the posterior
odds in favor of the alternative.


IV. Estimation Issues
         The   covariance matrix of the residual vector in equation (13)
is     assumed to be diagonal with each diagonal element corresponding
to a different factor. Processing of the data would be relatively
easy if these variances were all equal. For example, if the
endowments were all measured without error (y = 1), then equation
(13) could be estimated by ordinary least squares with dummy
variables. But the assumption of equal variances makes little
sense unless the data are scaled in comparable units. To achieve
comparability, we scale all the data by the world endowment levels

Ekw.     Furthermore, to eliminate heteroscedasticity associated with

country size, we also divide by the adjusted GNP: Y—B. Thus,
after these adjustments, equation (13) becomes

(17) F/Ski = ak(l/Sk) + (ykâj)(Ekj/Skj) — Ok(Li/Ski)
                              — ak(1/Ekw) + F?ie

where     S=     (Y—B ) E,.

                                     *
                            errors Fkie = Fkie/Ekw are assumed to be
normally distributed with mean zero and variance a2.
     The parameters in (17) are estimated using an iterative
procedure which solves the set of first order conditions for
maximizing the likelihood function (14). Given estimates ô (= 1

initially), estimates o, , and J3 are obtained by estimating
the following equation for each factor:

(18) F/S = ak(l/Sk) + yk(Ek/S) — Ok(L1/Skj) —
The estimates are then used to obtain new estimates & by

estimating the following equation for each country:


                                          12
(19) W = &1(y      Ekj/EkW)

where W =     F/Ski   —    a/Sk   — G(LI/Skj) —

Prior   to using the new estimates          obtained from (19) to re—

estimate (18), each estimate of             is divided by the estimated

value for the United States. The process of iteratively estimating
(18) and (19) continues until the value of (14) converges.
        The above two—step procedure is used to estimate the

parameters in (17) under hypotheses HG, Hi, H5, H7 and H9 since
each involves the specification that y            1. However, since
hypotheses H2, H4, HG, H8 and H1O restrict y = 1, estimates of the
unrestricted parameters under these five hypotheses are derived
using a dummy variables model applied to the data set pooled across

countries and factors, and imposing the restriction & = 1.

IV. Empirical Analyses
        Table 2 summarizes the factor content data by listing for each
country the ratio of net exports of each factor in 1957 to the

endowment of the corresponding factor in 1966, Fk/EkI. In theory,
a countrys factor abundance is revealed by the sign and magnitude
of these numbers since (5) can be rewritten

(20)         Fki/EkI = 1   — (SIEkW/Ekl)

Thus, given assumptions A1—A3, the ordering of net factor
export/endowment ratios conforms to the ordering of resource

abundance ratios Ek/EW. Further, (20) indicates net factor
exports are positive if and only if the corresponding resource is
abundant in the sense that the resource share exceeds the

consumption share, that is, Ekj/Ek
        Table 2 indicates that the United States exports .73% of the

 Factor content data are   for   196?, endowiient data are for 1966.
services of its capital stock, .99% of the services of its labor

force and 1.03% of the services of its professional/technical
workers. Thus, among these resources, U.S. trade reveals the
United States to be most abundant in professional/technical
workers, labor and then capital. Among all resources, however, the
United States is revealed most abundant in arable land; only forest
and pasture land are revealed to be scarce.10

     Learner (1980) computed these factor content ratios using
Leontiefs 1956 data and found the United States to be abundant in

capital compared to labor, thus reversing Leontiefs paradoxical
finding. The Leontief paradox is evident in Table 2 since trade

reveals labor to be more abundant than capital whereas the ordering
of U.S. resource abundance ratios (not shown) indicates the
opposite. This result, and others like it, allows us to reject the
Heckscher—Ohlin theorem using a rank test.
     Another contradictory finding is that while the U.S. is a net

exporter of labor services, the U.S. share of world labor does not

exceed its consumption share (s1) even after adjusting for trade
imbalance. Brecher and Choudhri (1982) point out that this form of
the Leontief paradox also exists in Leontiefs 1956 data. This
result, and others like it, allows us to reject the Heckscher—Ohlin

theorem using a sign test.
     One obvious anomaly in Table 2 is that Denmarks data reveal

the seemingly impossible result that it exports 1,634% of the
services of its pasture land and 690% of the services of its forest

land. This likely reflects problems in applying U.S. input—output
coefficients to other countries. Denmark is a substantial exporter
of agricultural products and the U.S. input coefficients apparently

                                  14
overstate the amount of pasture land used per unit of output in
Denmark. The formal data analysis conducted below will test the
assumption of identical input coefficients and it is clear that

this sort of evidence suggests that assumption (A3) is likely to be

rejected.11
     Formal measures of the conformity of the net export data in
Table 2 with the factor abundance data are reported in Tables 3 and
4.   The first column of Table 3 lists the frequency of sign matches
between net factor exports and excess factor supplies for each
factor. The first column of Table 4 lists comparable frequencies
for each country. For example, the sign of net capital exports and
of excess capital supplies matched in fifteen of the twenty—seven
countries.

     In general, the proposition of conformity in sign between
factor contents and excess factor supplies receives little support
when tested for each factor (Table 3). The frequency of sign
matches exceeds fifty percent for only seven of the twelve factors.
Among these, pasture land has the most sign matches with twenty—one
of twenty—seven. The three land variables, the most immobile of

the resources considered, provide the greatest support for the sign
proposition. However, the hypothesis of independence between the
sign of the factor contents and of the excess factor supplies can
be rejected (results not shown) at the 95% level for only one
resource: pasture land.


     The sign proposition also receives weak support when tested

for each country (Table 4). The proportion of sign matches equals
or exceeds seventy—five percent for only seven out of twenty—seven

countries. Moreover, the hypothesis of independence of signs is

rejected (95% level) only for Japan.'2
     The sign proposition deals with the abundance of a resource

compared with a price weighted average of other resources (the
consumption share si), but we can also compare resources two at a
time. For example, the data in Table 2 indicate the United States

is more abundant in labor than capital, yet the U.S. resource share

data indicate the opposite. The many possible pairwise comparisons
are summarized by the rank proposition which states that the order
of the data in Table 2 and the order of the resource abundance

ratios conform.
     As indicated in Tables 3 and 4, support for this rank
proposition is also mjxed.'3 The hypothesis of a zero or negative
rank correlation is rejected (95% level) for only four resources
(capital and the three land variables). All but one of the
correlations (agricultural workers) associated with the labor

variables are of the wrong sign. However, when tested country by
country (Table 4), the rank proposition receives stronger support;
twenty—six of the twenty—seven correlations are of the expected

sign and of these, fourteen are significant (5% level).
     Overall, the tests of the sign and rank propositions are
something of a disaster for the H—O—V model. The one hopeful
finding is that the rank proposition works rather well when tested

country by country. This suggests something is affecting all the
data for each country similarly since adding a number that is
constant within a country to the data would not affect the country

rank test results but would destroy the other three tests.
Possible sources of this kind of problem are differences in factor

                                  16
input matrices across countries and measurement errors in factor

consumption; the latter due either to a violation of the assumption
of proportional consumption or to errors in measuring the

consumption share.'4
     The tradition since Leontiefs study has been to examine only
propositions concerning factor rankings. But as shown in Section

II, the H—O--V model actually implies an equality between factor
contents and resource supplies and it is the study of this equation
to which we now turn. This has the advantage that it allows

explicit and relatively easy consideration of nonproportional
consumption, various forms of measurement error and technological

differences.
     In Section III hypotheses were stated which allowed one form
of nonproportional consumption, various forms of measurement error

and one form of technological differences. To test these
hypotheses, observations on factor contents, resource supplies and
population were used to estimate (17) under each hypothesis using
either the iterative maximum likelihood or the dummy variables
procedure. Table 5 reports information on the performance of each

hypothesis.
     The second column of Table 5 indicates that the value of the
error sum—of—squares (ESS) for each hypothesis. The ESS is of
course smallest for the least restricted model (HG>, although
hypotheses H3 and H7 do almost as well. The corresponding log—
likelihood values are reported in the next column. Conventional
hypothesis testing would compare the difference between these log—

likelihood values with    values at arbitrarily selected levels of



                                  17
significance. For example, the X' statistic for testing H3 against
the null is 52 (= —18.4 — (—70.4)) which would be compared against

a number like 33.92, the upper 5% of a X2 random variable with 22

degrees of freedom (the number of restrictions). The suggested
conclusion is then that the restrictions embodied in hypothesis H3
can be rejected in comparison with the unrestricted model HG.     But

this kind of treatment inadequately deals with the power of the

test which is inappropriately allowed to grow with the sample size
while the significance level is held fixed. This emphasis on power
leads to tests that avoid type II errors merely by rejecting the
alternative hypothesis and creates a serious tendency to reject
restrictions as the sample size grows. This problem is alleviated
here through the use of the asymptotic Bayes factor (16), which has
a certain arbitrariness in construction, but nonetheless has the
effect of lowering the significance level as the sample size grows
and thus maintains some reasonable relationship between the
significance level and the power.
     The fifth column of Table 5 reports the log—likelihood values

adjusted for the dimensionality of the parameter space according to
(15). A constant has been added to these numbers so that they are
all nonnegative. The corresponding Bayes factors (or odds ratios)
are reported in the last column. Hypothesis H3 emerges as the
clear winner. The unrestricted model HG is the closest, although
far behind H3. The other hypotheses are essentially impossible
given the data evidence. Such extreme values for the Bayes factors
are not uncommon, and should probably be viewed with suspicion
since they depend on a number of assumptions, normality being a



                                    18
potentially important example.
     The clearly favored hypothesis H3 allows neutral differences
in factor input matrices, biased measurements of factor contents
and multiplicative errors in the endowments,'5 but maintains the

assumptions of identical homothetic tastes and complete coverage of

countries. Hypothesis H7, which weakens H4 by allowing for
incomplete coverage of countries, is the third best hypothesis.

The second best is HG, the unrestricted model.
     The parameters of the model estimated under hypothesis H3 are

reported in Tables 6a and 6b. The hypothesis that ô       1   can be

rejected for all but two countries (Australia and Mexico) and for
eight countries, the estimates of & are of the wrong sign.
Moreover, these parameters are the factors that divide the U.S.

input matrix to produce a factor input matrix for the selected
country. Numbers in excess of one indicate countries with factors
that are more productive that the United States. Overall, the
great dispersion of the estimates of ,   particularly   the negative
values, is cause for alarm.
     Although the assumption of factor price equalization is not

explicit in our analysis, the performance of hypothesis H3 together
with the results shown in Tables 6a could be taken as evidence

against the hypothesis of factor price equalization. The
possibility of factor price differences might help explain the
variability in the estimates of    since such differences would
imply non—neutral differences in factor input matrices. We intend
to examine the possibility of non—neutral technological differences
in later research.
     The estimates reported in Table Gb are also cause for concern.

    Values of y and 8 are times 1,000; values   for fi    are times 100,000.
The predicted values   of the   factor supplies can be found by
inserting the observed values into these estimated equations. A
negative value of y indicates that the observed endowment and the
 corrected endowment are negatively correlated. This happens for
four of the labor endowments, although three of these coefficients
have large enough standard errors that the sign remains in doubt.
This leaves only production workers as the anomaly: the number of
production workers embodied in trade is negatively related with the
measured number of production workers.
     Finally, Tables 7a and 7b report the parameters estimated
under the general hypothesis HG. The results are similar to those
reported for hypothesis H3 in that the estimates of        show

considerable variation and the signs and levels of significance of

the parameters    parallel      those shown in Table 6b.

     Overall, we conclude that differences in factor input matrices
and measurement errors are significant reasons for rejection of the

H—O—V hypotheses concerning the value of the parameter linking
factor contents and national resource supplies, and thus also
rejection of the sharp hypothesis contained in the rank and sign
propositions considered previously. However, our evidence does

support the assumptions of proportional consumption16 and complete
coverage of countries.




V. Concluding Remarks
     This paper conducted conceptually correct tests of the
Heckscher—Ohlin proposition that trade in commodities can be


                                      20
explained in terms of an interaction between factor input
requirements and factor endowments. An exact specification of this
interaction in a multicountry, multicommodity, multifactor world
was derived in the form of the Heckscher—Ohlin----Vanek (H—O—V)

theorem which equates the factors embodied in net trade to excess

factor supplies. This theorem implies sign and rank propositions
analogous to those implicitly studied by Leontief, but it also
implies hypotheses about the parameters linking factor contents and
factor supplies. Tests of the sign and rank propositions as well

as several parametric hypotheses which allow various assumptions

about measurement errors, nonproportional consumption and
technological differences were conducted in a sample of twenty—
seven countries and twelve factors using 1967 trade and input
requirements data and 1966 endowment data.

     The Leontief type sign and rank propositions were generally
not supported. The sign of net factor exports infrequently
predicts the sign of excess factor supplies and therefore does not
systematically reveal factor abundance. However, within individual
nations, the ranking of net factor exports does predict the ranking
of factor supplies fairly well. Differences in the results
obtained when the sign and rank propositions were tested for each
factor and then for each country suggested bias due to measurement

errors may be important.
     A more general regression analysis made the possibility of
measurement errors in the data explicit and permitted the
formulation of several alternative hypotheses implied by the H—O—V

theorem. Among these, ten hypotheses which allow nonproportional
consumption, specific forms of measurement error, and neutral

                                   21
differences in technology across countries were subjected to test.
        The results obtained in this framework do not support the H—O—
V hypothesis of an exact relationship between factor contents and
national factor supplies. Our estimates suggest the parameter
linking factor contents and national factor supplies departs
significantly from the value implied by the H—O--V theorem. We
conclude there is clear evidence that the departure of the
estimated coefficient from its theoretical value is importantly
related to 1) differences across countries in the matrix of factor

inputs and, by implication, the violation of the assumption of
factor price equalization and 2) errors of measurement in both
trade and national factor supplies. However, we find little
evidence of nonproportional consumption of the type considered
here. Further work is required to determine whether rejection of
the H—O--V theorems parametric hypotheses reflects

nonproportionality in consumption, measurement error, or
differences in technology of a form different than that considered
here.

  An exception is Harkness (1978 and 1983) who tests the H—0—V sign
and rank propositions (see below) by comparing measured factor
contents with excess factor supplies that are inferred from
coefficients estimated by regressing factor contents on input
requirements. This analysis is suspect, however, since the
regression estimates need not correspond either in sign or rank to
a country's true excess factor supplies. See Learner and Bowen
(1981).

  Maskus (1986) reports conceptually correct tests of this
interpretation of the 1-1—0 theorem with respect to the United States
using 1958 and 1972 data.

  If factor prices are equalized, s can be derived by
premultiplying (2) by the vector of factor prices. If factor
prices are unequal, (2) can still be premultiplied by the vector of
factor prices prevailing in country i to obtain an expression
analogous to (3) but with both internal and external factor
earnings evaluated only in terms of country is factor prices.
  If factor prices are equalized, the consumption share is a
weighted average of other resources: s1 = Ek Ekj(wk/EkwkEkw) where Wk
is the world price of factor k and trade balance is assumed. Thus,
if the left and right hand sides of (5) conform in sign, the trade
data can be said to accurately reveal the abundance of a resource
compared with other resources on the average.
  scaling by s not be necessary if resources are measured in the
same units.

  In the sense that complete information on each country's
preferences would be required to determine trade.
      Equation (6) is based on the Linear Expenditure System.
  This specification was chosen after testing it against the more
general specification which sets    = R + /J. where 'r and /.4 are
unknown constants.
  This scaling ignores that M2' and M3 imply 8kj could be measured
with error. The EkW were simply the only available data that could
be used to render the measurements of the endowments unit free.
10                                           .

      Harkness (1978, Table 3) reports similar numbers for the United
 States based on 1958 data and obtained a ranking similar to that
 shown here.
 11
   Alternatively, these anomalous data values may reflect
 substantial errors of measurement in either the factor contents or
 endowments.
1'
   No variation was observed in the sign of net factor exports of
Austria, Korea and Spain (each factor was imported) and no
variation was observed in the sign of the excess factor supplies of
Denmark and the United States (each was negative).

   Both the factor content and factor supply data were scaled by
sjEkW before ranking. This scaling is necessary since the resources
are measured in different units.
14
   To examine whether errors in measuring factor consumption might
reflect errors in measuring each countrys GNP, each countrys
consumption share was computed using data (Summers, et. al., 1980)
on its real GDP corrected for purchasing power parity. In no case
did the use of these data reverse the sign of a countrys excess
factor supplies.
15
   To indicate the extent of measurement error in the endowments we
compared measured U.S. endowments with the amount of each factor
absorbed directly and indirectly in producing the 1967 vector of
U.S. final demand in both manufacturing and services (a total of
354 sectors). The ratio of the amount absorbed in production to
the endowment for each factor was: capital 2.1; total labor, .88;
prof/tech, .62; managerial, .45; clerical, .92; sales, 1.41;
service, .68; agricultural, .98; production, .99. The discrepancy
for capital likely reflects that the depreciation rate used to
compute an industrys capital stock was lower than the rate used to
compute the national capital stock. The discrepancy for managerial
workers likely reflects the exclusion of government employees in
calculating industry input requirements.
  This finding contrasts Horibas (1979) conclusion from his
analysis of the proportional consumption assumption using data on
U.S. regional trade. Using a specification similar to ours, his
analysis rejected the assumptions hypothesis concerning the value
of

                           Data Appendix

     Data on trade and factor endowments were collected for twenty—
seven countries in 1966. The twelve resources are; capital, total

workers, professional/technical workers, managerial workers, sales
workers, service workers, agricultural workers, production workers,
arable land, pasture land and forest land.

     The total content (direct plus indirect) of each factor
embodied in net trade was calculated by premultiplying each
country's net trade vector by a matrix of total factor input
requirements. Total factor input requirements were calculated from
data on direct and intermediate factor input requirements for each
industry according to the 367 order U.S. input—output table for
1967. Data on each country's trade in 1967 were first taken from
the U.N. Trade Tapes at the four and five digit level of the SITC
and then concorded to the input—output sectors in order to perform

the required vector multiplications.

     On the product.lon      capital (plant, equipment. and
inventories) inputs were based upon data prepared by the Bureau of

Labor Statistics Economic Growth Project which provided capital
stock figures measured in 1958 dollars. Labor data, measured in
number of persons, were derived from the 1971
Occupational Employment and the 1970 Census ojpplation. These
data were reclassified, to the extent possible, to be consistent
with the occupational categories at the one digit level of the
ILO's International Standard Classification of Occupations.
Sveikauskas (1983, Appendix) describes the sources of factor input
data in greater detail.


                                 25
     Land inputs were constructed from information contained in the
U.S. input—output table. Arable land is defined as proportional to
total purchases from I/O sector 2; pasture land as proportional to
total purchases from I/o sector 1 and forest Land as proportional
to total purchases from I/O sector 3 (which includes fisheries).

This method of measuring land (natural resource) inputs corresponds
to a rent definition of quantity and has been used by Baldwin

(1971) and Harkness (1978) among others.
     Factor endowment data were taken from Bowen (1980 and 1983)

with one exception. Since land input coefficients are measured in
dollars, each land endowment from Bowen was multiplied by an
imputed price so as to measure land endowments in monetary units.

Prices were imputed by dividing the total value of each type of
land input absorbed in producing total U.S. output in 1967 by the
corresponding U.S. endowment of each type of land in 1966. The
prices, in 1967 dollars, are; arable land, $142.767 per hectare;

pasture land, $108.942 per hectare; forest land, $5.6882 per
hectare.
