                                            ABSTRACT

A growing recent theoretical literature advocates the use of prudential capital control policy, that is,
the tightening of restrictions on cross-border capital flows during booms and the relaxation thereof
during recessions. We examine the behavior of capital controls in a large number of countries over
the period 1995-2011. We find that capital controls are remarkably acyclical. Boom-bust episodes
in output, the current account, or the real exchange rate are associated with virtually no movements
in capital controls. These results are robust to decomposing boom-bust episodes along a number of
dimensions, including the level of development, the level of external indebtedness, or the exchange-rate
regime. We also document a near complete acyclicality of capital controls during the Great Contraction
of 2007-2009.

1       Introduction
In the past few years, capital controls have gone from villains to heroes with little transi-
tion. During the 1990s, a decade characterized by vigorous financial flows toward emerging
countries, the predominant view was that capital controls are undesirable because they dis-
tort the international allocation of capital and in that way hinder long-run growth. In
accordance with this view, policymakers in emerging countries, with few exceptions, allowed
international capital to move largely unfettered into their economies. But many of these
experiments with free capital mobility ended in sudden stops followed by severe financial or
exchange-rate crises or both (Southeast Asia and Russia in the late 1990s, South America
in the early 2000s, and peripheral Europe in the late 2000s). These failures persuaded many
to look at capital controls with more benign eyes. Increasingly, free capital mobility has
been blamed for causing real-exchange-rate overvaluation, excess nominal wage growth, and
overborrowing during booms, opening the door to exacerbated rates of unemployment and
bankruptcy during the downward phase of the cycle. An indication of the magnitude of this
change of sentiment toward capital controls is that the International Monetary Fund, which
until recently held a long-standing position against restrictions on international financial
transactions, now considers capital controls an appropriate instrument for macroeconomic
stabilization (see International Monetary Fund, hereafter IMF, 2011).
        The recent negative experience with free capital mobility has spurred renewed interest
among academics, policymakers, and policy observers in a particular type of capital control
policy known as macro prudential policy. These are preventive interventions that take effect
before the onset of a crisis. Particular attention has been paid to capital controls as a macro
prudential instrument. A growing body of theoretical work has been devoted to charac-
terizing environments in which prudential capital controls are desirable. In general, these
models describe economies with externalities, in which capital controls represent second-best
remedies.
        New theories of prudential capital control policy can be broadly divided into two classes.
In one class, prudential capital control policy is beneficial because it can promote financial
stability.1 In the second class, prudential capital control policy is desirable because it can
improve macroeconomic adjustment in economies with nominal rigidities and suboptimal
monetary policy.2

and Uribe (2006, 2007).

                                                    1
     In the first class of models, lending is collateralized, and the value of collateral depends
on some relative price (e.g., the price of real estate) that agents take as given. During booms
the relative price in question increases, expanding the value of collateral, and inducing agents
to overborrow and overspend. In turn, overborrowing increases the probability of binding
collateral constraints and sudden stops during downturns.
     The prudential role of capital controls in the second class of theories can be illustrated
by imagining an economy with downward nominal wage rigidity and a fixed-exchange-rate
policy. During booms, the expansion in aggregate demand causes nominal wages to rise.
This carries no problems at this stage, but can be the prelude to trouble down the road. For
during the contractionary phase of the cycle, aggregate demand weakens, putting downward
pressure on real wages. A fall in real wages can occur either by a fall in nominal wages or by
an increase in prices. The first possibility is ruled out by downward nominal wage rigidity
and the second by the fixed exchange-rate regime. As a result, involuntary unemployment
emerges.
     In both classes of models there is an externality caused by the individual agent’s failure
to internalize the fact that his own spending behavior during booms causes the value of
collateral or the level of nominal wages to increase. Also, under both classes of models, it is
optimal for the policymaker to impose capital controls during booms, because, by putting
sand in the wheels of international borrowing, they contribute to curbing aggregate spending,
thereby mitigating the inefficiencies caused by the externality.
     In this paper, we investigate whether capital control policy has indeed been used in a
prudential manner as suggested by these new theories. To this end, the first contribution of
this paper is to update Schindler’s (2009) index of capital controls, which covers the period
1995-2005, by incorporating the period 2006-2011. The new data set covers 91 countries
over the period 1995-2011 at an annual frequency. The data set provides information on
restrictions on capital inflows and outflows separately and distinguishes six categories of
assets and the residency of the transacting agent.
     We use the updated data on capital controls to study the observed behavior of the
cyclical component of capital controls. We report three main findings: First, the uncondi-
tional standard deviation of the cyclical component of capital controls is small. Essentially,
policymakers do not change capital controls over the business cycle, contrary to what an
active prudential stance would suggest. Second, the cyclical components of controls on
capital inflows and outflows are positively correlated. This fact also suggests that capital
controls are not primarily used as a stabilization instrument. For if this was the case, one


                                               2
would expect that during expansions policymakers increase capital controls on inflows and
decrease capital controls on outflows and vice versa during contractions, inducing a negative
correlation between the two types of restrictions.
       The third and most important result emerges from examining the behavior of capital
controls conditional on the economy being in a macroeconomic boom or bust. We define
boom and bust episodes for three separate macroeconomic indicators, the output gap, the
cyclical component of the real effective exchange rate, and the cyclical component of the
current account. We find that on average, controls on capital inflows or outflows are virtually
unchanged during macroeconomic booms or busts. This finding suggests that over the past
one and a half decades countries around the world have not systematically applied capital
controls in a prudential or countercyclical fashion. In particular, the average policymaker
does not seem to tighten capital controls on inflows or soften capital controls on outflows to
curb expansions in aggregate activity, or overvaluations of the real exchange rate, or large
current account deficits. Capital controls are similarly unresponsive during downturns.
       These findings are robust to disaggregating the data along a number of dimensions,
including income levels, the exchange-rate regime, the level of external indebtedness, and
type of assets. The results also hold when we limit attention to the global crisis of 2007-2009
or to episodic changes in capital controls.3
       Our results allow for at least two interpretations. One is that, in light of the recent
growing theoretical literature arguing that prudential capital control policy can be welfare
improving, our findings point at a case of theory running ahead of policy practice. Under this
view, one would expect that as time goes by and the message of the new theories percolate
into policymaking circles, capital controls will become more cyclical. A second possible
interpretation is that these theories may not be capturing all of the relevant economic or
political factors that determine the cyclical properties of optimal capital controls.4 To the
extent that policymakers have a better grasp of the complexity of factors determining optimal
capital controls, our results could be interpreted as policy practice running ahead of theory.
       The present paper is related to a fast growing empirical literature on capital controls.
The primary focus of this literature has been to ascertain the effectiveness of capital controls
as macroeconomic stabilizers. See, among others, Ostry et al. (2010), Klein (2012), and
Forbes, Fratzscher, and Straub (2013). Our work departs from this literature in that its
primary focus is not to gauge the ability of capital controls to affect macroeconomic outcomes,
   3
    Klein (2012) refers to episodic changes in capital controls as ‘gates.’
   4
    See, for instance, the caveats raised by Benigno, Chen, Otrok, and Rebucci (2011 and 2013) to collateral-
constraint-based theories of overborrowing.


                                                     3
but to address the question of whether governments systematically use capital controls in a
prudential or countercyclical fashion. In this regard, our work is related to Aizenman and
Pasricha (2013) who argue that emerging countries that liberalized capital outflow controls
during the 2000s did so primarily because of concerns about net capital inflows. Our data set
does not provide evidence pointing in this direction. Specifically, we document that between
1995 and 2011 and in particular around the global contraction of 2007-2009, capital controls
on outflows or inflows displayed a mute response to booms or busts in the current account.
One important difference between our work and Aizenman and Pasricha’s is that the latter
includes restrictions on transactions between residents in the measure of capital controls. An
example is currency based measures, which restrict transactions in foreign currency even if
all parties involved are residents. By contrast, all of the restrictions included in our measure
of capital controls involve one resident and one nonresident transactor.
     The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data
used in the empirical analysis. Section 3 documents the unconditional cyclicality of capital
controls. Section 4 studies the behavior of capital controls conditional on the state of the
economy being a boom or a bust in aggregate activity. Section 5 analyzes the dynamics of
capital controls during booms and busts in the real exchange rate and the current account.
Section 6 focuses on the behavior of capital controls around the global contraction of 2007-
2009. Section 7 considers two alternative measures of capital controls, namely the Quinn
(1997) and the Chinn-Ito (2006) indices. This section also studies whether episodic capital
controls are prudential in nature. Section 8 concludes.


2    The Data
The bulk of our analysis uses Schindler’s (2009) index of capital controls. Later in section 7,
we use and briefly describe two additional indices, namely, those due to Chinn and Ito
(2006) and Quinn (1997). Schindler’s index is a de jure measure of capital controls and is
constructed from information provided by the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements
and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER) published by the IMF. The main advantage of this
index, for the purpose of the present investigation, is that it distinguishes between controls
on capital inflows and controls on capital outflows. Schindler’s original data set covers 91
countries from 1995 to 2005 at an annual frequency.
     One contribution of the present study is to update Schindler’s data set through 2011

for all 91 countries.5 Thus our capital-control data set is a panel of 91 countries and 17
years.
       The panel captures a rich set of countries, asset categories, and crises episodes. It
includes 22 developed countries, 45 emerging countries, and 24 low-income countries. It
comprises restrictions on international transactions involving six asset categories: equity,
bonds, money market instruments, foreign direct investment, collective investments (also
referred to as mutual funds, investment funds, managed funds, or simply funds), and fi-
nancial credit. These financial instruments constitute the majority of global cross-border
asset holdings. The time dimension of the panel (1995-2011) is relatively short, but covers a
significant number of crisis episodes, including those observed in Southeast Asia and Russia
in the late 1990s, South America in the early 2000s and the global crisis of 2007-2009. In
addition to the direction of flows and asset categories, the index distinguishes the residency
of the transacting agent (domestic or foreign) and the type of transaction (sale or purchase).
       The index on capital controls on inflows takes on 13 possible values given by i/12 for
i = 0, 1, . . . , 12, with 0 representing no restrictions and 1 representing restrictions on all
types of international transactions.6 The same holds for the index on capital controls on
outflows. An overall index of capital controls is constructed as the average of the indices of
capital controls on inflows and outflows.
   5
     Klein (2010) provides a limited update of Schindler’s index covering 44 countries through 2010 and does
not include controls on capital outflows.
   6
     The index is the result of a two-step aggregation procedure involving 10 binary variables representing
granular capital control indices. These granular indices are organized as follows: Four of the six asset
categories (equity, bonds, money market instruments, and collective investments) are associated with two
binary variables each, defining controls by residency (domestic or foreign), and each of the remaining two asset
categories (financial credit and foreign direct investment) is associated with one binary variable. The first
aggregation occurs at the level of each individual asset category by arithmetic averaging of their associated
binary components. This yields six indices, four taking on the values 0, 0.5, or 1, and two taking on the
values 0 or 1. In the second step, indices are aggregated across asset categories by arithmetic averaging.
This step yields the index of controls on capital inflows, which takes on 13 equally spaced values from 0 to
1. A similar aggregation procedure yields the index of controls on capital outflows.


                                                       5
     Table 1 reports means of capital control indices for different groups of countries. The
average value of the overall capital control index is 0.32. Controls on inflows are on average
somewhat lower than controls on outflows (0.29 versus 0.35). Restrictions on international
transactions appear to be a decreasing function of income. Developed countries display the
lowest values of capital controls with an average of around 0.07. The group of low income
countries displays an average capital control index eight times higher than the one observed in
developed countries. And emerging countries display an intermediate level of capital controls
with an average index five times as large as the one observed in developed economies.
     To assess the countercyclicality and prudential nature of capital controls, we use three
macroeconomic indicators, real gross domestic product (GDP), the real effective exchange
rate (REER), and the current-account-to-GDP ratio (CA). The source for GDP is World
Development Indicators, for REER is IMF-IFS, and for CA is the IMF World Economic
Outlook.
     To eliminate country-specific level and trend effects of capital controls on aggregate
activity and other macroeconomic indicators, we remove a linear trend from the capital
control indices. We also remove a log-quadratic trend from GDP and the REER and a
quadratic trend from CA. We refer to deviations of a variable from its trend as its cyclical
component. In the case of GDP, we use the terms cyclical component and output gap
interchangeably.
     Finally, we removed from the panel all countries for which the time series of GDP
is shorter than 25 years or does not cover the period 1995-2011. For more details, see
table A.1 in the expanded appendix (Fernández, Rebucci, and Uribe, hereafter FRU, 2013).
The length restriction is guided by the desire to obtain precise estimates of the trend and
cyclical components of aggregate activity. We also eliminated one country, Bahrain, for
which the AREAER does not provide data on capital controls for all six categories of assets.
The resulting panel contains 78 countries and is comprised of 22 developed countries, 36
emerging countries, and 20 low-income countries.


3    The Unconditional Acyclicality Of Capital Controls
Table 2 presents a number of statistics on capital controls that characterize their cyclical
properties. The first feature that stands out is the small standard deviations of the cyclical
components of capital controls. For all countries combined, the standard deviation of capital
inflows is 0.07. To see why this number is small, recall that the index of capital controls on

inflows aggregates 10 granular indices of controls on individual transactions (see footnote 6)
and takes on 13 equally spaced values from 0 to 1, that is, it takes on the values 0, 0.0833, 2 ×
0.0833, 3 × 0.0833, . . . , 1. Now, if a country in a given year increases the number of capital
restrictions in only one out of the 10 possible types of transactions, then its index goes up
by 0.0833. Therefore, the observed standard deviation of 0.07 is less than one transaction
out of 10. It is in this sense that we say that the standard deviation of controls on capital
inflows is small. A similar result obtains for controls on capital outflows. This means that
controls on capital flows do not move much over the business cycle.
     Recent theories of optimal capital-control policy suggest that controls on capital in-
flows should be procyclical while controls on capital outflows should be countercyclical. In
this way, capital control policy would discourage net capital inflows during expansions and
encourage them during contractions. Table 2 shows that the cyclical components of con-
trols on capital inflows and outflows are roughly acyclical. Overall, the average correlation
between output and capital controls is -0.01 for inflows and -0.03 for outflows. In the case
of controls on capital inflows for developed and low income countries, the average correla-
tion between capital controls and output are actually negative, indicating that, contrary to
what is prescribed by theory, countries tend to facilitate inflows during economic expansions.
The average correlations between output and controls on capital outflows are negative for
developed and low-income outflows, as suggested by theory, but are relatively small.
     Figure 1 displays country-by-country correlations of capital controls with output. The
figure makes clear that countries do not seem to be setting restrictions on capital flows in

a systematically countercyclical fashion. Most countries display insignificant correlations
between controls on capital flows and output. From an unconditional perspective, the sign
of the correlation for a given country appears to be dictated by the toss of a coin.7
      The observed comovement between controls on inflows and outflows also reveals the
lack of a systematic use of restrictions to curb movements in net inflows. If this was the main
purpose of capital control policy, we should observe a negative correlation between controls
on inflows and controls on outflows. Periods in which the policymaker wishes to discourage
net inflows should be associated with increaes in controls on capital inflows and reductions in
controls on capital outflows and vice versa. Figure 2 shows that this is not generally the case
in reality. In most countries, the correlation between the cyclical components of controls on
inflows and outflows is either nil or positive, suggesting that capital-control policy was not
set with the primary intention of limiting the procyclicality of net capital inflows.


4     Capital Controls During Boom and Busts
The previous section demonstrated that unconditional second moments detect little if any
macro prudential features in the observed behavior of capital controls. One reason for this
failure may be that governments do not use capital controls to smooth capital flows caused
by short-lived movements in aggregate activity. However, the government may put the
capital-control machinery at work to face larger and more protracted deviations of output
from trend. To the extent that aggregate fluctuations are dominated by relatively small and
short-lived positive and negative output deviations from trend, unconditional correlations
will fail to fully capture the countercyclical properties of capital control policy. Accordingly,
in this section we study the comovement of capital controls and aggregate activity conditional
on the state of the economy being characterized by either a boom or a bust in aggregate
activity.
      We define a boom (bust) as a period longer than three years in which GDP is always
above (below) its trend level. The peak (trough) is the largest (smallest) value reached
by the output gap during a boom (bust). These definitions identify large and protracted
expansions and contractions in aggregate activity. The average magnitude of the output gap
across peaks (troughs) is +(-)8 percent, or around 1.2 standard deviations. And the average
duration of booms and busts is 7 years.
      Figure 3 displays the average comovement between the output gap (starred lines) and

        Note. Booms (busts) are defined as periods longer than three years in which the output
        gap is always positive (negative). Capital controls and the output gap are expressed
        in deviations from trend as defined in section 2 and averaged across episodes.

the cyclical component of capital controls (solid lines) during boom and bust episodes along
with two-standard-error bands for capital controls (dashed lines). Capital controls are vir-
tually unchanged during booms or busts, and the two-standard error band is essentially cen-
tered around zero. This mute response of controls on capital inflows or outflows to booms or
busts in aggregate activity suggests that restrictions on cross-border financial transactions
do not behave in a macro prudential or countercyclical fashion.
      The comovement between capital-flow restrictions and output depicted in figure 3 is
an average over all countries in the panel. The countries included in the sample are het-
erogeneous along a number of dimensions, including income level, monetary/exchange-rate
policy, and external indebtedness. A natural question is whether the incentives to apply
cyclical capital controls depend on the level of economic development of a country. Figures 4
and 13 (the latter placed in the appendix) display the comovement between capital controls
and the output gap during booms and busts for groups of countries with different levels of
development. One important difference between rich and poor or middle income economies
is that the former are less volatile. In our sample, the standard deviation of the output gap
is 4.0 percent for developed economies, 6.4 percent for emerging countries, and 5.8 percent
for low income countries. In general, recent theories of capital controls predict that more
volatile economies are more likely to benefit from prudential capital-control policy. However,
the figures show that even after disaggregating by level of development, controls on capital
inflows or outflows do not move during booms or busts in aggregate activity. This result
suggests that capital control policy is acyclical regardless of the level of development.
      The theories surveyed earlier in the paper also suggest that, in the presence of nominal
rigidities in factor or product prices, fixed-exchange-rate economies are particularly prone to
unemployment caused by disturbances in aggregate activity. This is because the combination
of rigidity in nominal prices and in the nominal exchange rate creates rigidities in relative
prices, which can cause disequilibria in factor and/or product markets over the business
cycle. Under these circumstances, the prudential use of capital controls can be beneficial as
they have the potential to reduce the amplitude of expansions and contractions in aggregate
demand. With this motivation in mind, in figure 5 we display the comovement between
capital controls on inflows or outflows and the output gap during booms for countries with
different exchange-rate arrangements. Figure 14 in the appendix displays the same infor-
mation for bust episodes.8 Contrary to the predictions of recent theories of optimal capital

     The figures do not include the category ‘floating exchange rate’ because the panel includes two few
episodes under this regime, which makes it impossible to construct error bands. Nonetheless, point estimates
suggest that in floating regimes, capital controls do not seem to behave prudentially.

     Note. See note to figure 3. A country is classified as having a high (low) level of
     external debt if during the boom episode its net foreign asset to GDP ratio was below
     (above) the 20th percentile in the cross-country distribution. Data on net net-foreign-
     asset-to-GDP ratios are taken from Lane and Milessi-Ferreti (2007).



controls, fixed-exchange-rate economies do not seem to be more likely to resort to prudential
or cyclical capital flow restrictions to smooth the business cycle.
     Figures 6 and 15 (the latter in the appendix) display the behavior of capital controls
during booms and busts for two groups of countries, one with high levels of external debt,
defined as having a net-foreign-asset-to-GDP ratio below the 20th percentile of the cross-
country distribution, and the other with low levels (defined as the complement of the first
group). The figures show that high-debt countries are characterized by larger booms and
deeper busts than low-debt countries. However, high-debt countries do not seem to be
more likely to apply prudential capital control policy. Indeed, capital controls on inflows or
outflows appear to be unrelated to the state of the business cycle regardless of the level of
external indebtedness.

     We close this section by exploring the possibility that capital controls on some types
of assets be more cyclical than controls on other types. For instance, governments may have
more incentives to regulate capital flows involving highly liquid assets, such as money market
instruments, bonds, or equity, since this type of flows may have an easier time entering an
economy during a boom and leaving as soon as economic conditions deteriorate. On the
other hand, less liquid types of financial capital, such as foreign direct investment, may
be less linked to short-run business conditions and more to long-run conditions, such as
institutional quality, tax distortions, etc. For this type of assets, it is reasonable to expect
capital controls to be less cyclical. Figures 7 and 16 (the latter in the appendix) display the
behavior of controls on inflows during booms and busts for different categories of assets. The
expanded appendix (FRU, 2013) displays the corresponding figures for outflows. The central
result of this section holds after performing this disaggregation. That is, controls on capital
inflows or outflows appear to be unrelated to the state of the business cycle. Interestingly,


                                                                         16
this result obtains for capital flows involving highly liquid types of assets, such as bonds and
money market instruments.


5    Capital Controls, The Real Exchange Rate, And The
     Current Account
In an analysis of more than thirty empirical studies, Magud, Reinhart and Rogoff (2011)
find that two prominent rationales for governments to impose capital controls are to reduce
real exchange rate pressures and to reduce the volume of capital flows.
     The recent theoretical developments in capital-control policy discussed in section 1
provide foundations to these rationales. Consider, for example, an economy characterized
by downward nominal wage rigidity and a fixed exchange rate regime. Suppose the economy
receives a large positive external shock, such as a large reduction in the country interest
rate premium. In response to this improvement in external conditions, capital inflows surge
facilitating an expansion in aggregate activity. The increase in aggregate demand causes
an increase in wages and in the relative price of nontradables (or an appreciation of the
real exchange rate). In the presence of downward nominal wage rigidity, this situation
can be the preannouncement of a crisis. For when the favorable external conditions fade
away (i.e., when the country premium goes back up to its normal level) aggregate demand
contracts causing downward pressure on wages and a tendency for the real exchange rate to
appreciate. However, if nominal wages are rigid and the nominal exchange rate is fixed, the
downward adjustment in real wages will take place slowly, causing unemployment. In this
case, capital controls during the expansionary phase of the cycle (i.e., prudential restrictions
on international financial transactions) could be beneficial because, by discouraging capital
inflows, they contribute to curbing the expansion in aggregate demand, the real-exchange-
rate appreciation, and the initial increase in nominal wages. In turn, this moderation in wage
growth during the boom phase creates conditions for a soft landing during the contractionary
phase of the cycle.
     Theories of collateralized lending also provide a rationale for using capital controls to
moderate real exchange rate appreciations and surges in capital inflows. To see this, consider
again the example of a fall in the country interest-rate premium that causes a surge in capital
inflows, an expansion in aggregate demand, and an appreciation of the real exchange rate.
To the extent that collateral is made up in part of nontradable goods, the real exchange-rate
appreciation, by raising the relative price of these goods, produces an expansion in the value

of collateral, which incentivates households to borrow more from the rest of the world. In
this case, capital controls can be used to curb overborrowing and in this way allow for a
more efficient intertemporal allocation of domestic absorption.
        With this motivation in mind, we now analyzed the observed comovement between
capital controls and the cyclical components of the real effective exchange rate and the
current-account-to-GDP ratio (CA). Data sources and the detrending methods used for each
variable are described in section 2. As in the case of output, we define booms (busts) in the
REER or the CA as periods longer than three years in which the variable is always above
(below) trend. Figures 8 and 9 show that neither capital controls on inflows nor controls on
outflows are sensitive to booms or busts in the real exchange rate or the current account.
This result confirms the findings of the previous section suggesting that restrictions in cross-
border financial transactions do not appear to behave in a prudential or countercyclical
manner.9

6    Capital Controls and the Great Contraction
The analysis thus far leaves open the possibility that some episodes of successful prudential
capital control policy are left out precisely because capital controls managed to turn what
could have been a boom-bust cycle into a milder course of business activity. To the extent
that this type of episodes are numerous, the results presented in previous sections would
introduce a downward bias in the estimated prudential content of capital control policy.
     In an attempt to address this endogeneity problem, we analyze the comovement of
capital controls and the output gap around the Great Contraction of 2007-2009. Arguably,
this crisis originated in the United States—possibly as a consequence of the burst of a bubble
in the domestic real estate market—and then spread around the world. Under this view,
the Great Contraction can be taken as exogenous for most countries other than the United
States. Of particular interest is the fact that not all countries were affected equally by the
crisis. A natural question is then whether in countries that were less affected by the crisis,
capital control policy displayed a more prudential or countercyclical behavior.
     Figure 10 displays the behavior of controls on capital inflows and outflows and the
output gap between 2005 and 2011 for three groups of countries: Low impact, medium
impact, and high impact. Each impact group contains one third of the total number of
countries in the panel. The low impact group contains the countries with the largest output
gaps in 2009. The high impact group contains countries with the smallest output gaps
in 2009. All other countries are placed in the medium impact group. The figure shows
that regardless of the impact level, capital controls displayed virtually no movement before,
during, or after the Great contraction. If anything, low impact countries applied slightly
tighter restrictions on capital inflows in 2009 and thereafter than before 2009. Also, for this
group of countries controls on inflows and outflows moved in tandem between 2005 and 2011,
which, as argued in section 3 is at odds with a prudential or countercyclical policy stance.
This result suggests that, in general, around the Great Contraction governments did not
apply capital control policy in a systematically prudential or countercyclical fashion.

individual transactions consists of a binary indicator, the cross sectoral and time variation
that results from aggregating indices along various dimensions can be interpreted as a mea-
sure of the intensity of a country’s capital controls, because such aggregations effectively
count how many subcategories are restricted and within each categories how many types of
transactions.” Here, Schindler highlights an intensity measure that is relevant, but indirect
in nature. For the fact remains that at a granular level the index captures no information
about the degree of severity of controls on specific subcategories of assets and transactions.
       Quinn (1997) addresses this difficulty by coding the text in the AREAER describing
the type of restrictions affecting international transactions. A ranking of the importance of
these restrictions gives rise to a measure of the intensity of capital controls. The text in
the AREAER is amenable to coding because it is precise and consistent across time and
space. Quinn’s index covers 64 countries over the period 1950-1994. More recently, Quinn,
Schindler, and Toyoda (2011) extend the time coverage of the Quinn index to 2007 and 142
countries. Unfortunately, this index does not distinguish between controls on capital inflows
and capital outflows.
       Figure 11 displays the average comovement of the cyclical component of the Quinn
index and the output gap during boom and bust episodes observed in 68 countries over the
period 1995-2007.10 The results are consistent with those obtained using the Schindler index.
The Quinn index is virtually flat across booms and busts in aggregate activity. This result
confirms our finding that, on average, capital controls do not appear to be set in a prudential
or countercyclical fashion.
       A third index of capital controls that is widely used in the related literature is due
to Chinn and Ito (2006). Like the Schindler and Quinn indices, the Chinn-Ito index draws
information from the IMF’s AREAER. However, it includes information on different variables
related to restrictions on international transactions. Specifically, the Chinn-Ito index includes
four binary indicators on: (1) Openness of the capital account; (2) openness of the current
account; (3) restrictions on the repatriation or surrender of export proceeds; and (4) multiple
exchange rates for international financial transactions. The Chinn and Ito index consists of
the first principal component of these four variables. At the time of this writing, the index
was available for 182 countries from 1970 to 2011 at annual frequency.11 Figure 11 displays
the average behavior of the cyclical component of the Chinn-Ito index and the output gap

     To maximize comparability, the countries and years included correspond to the intersection of our up-
dated panel of Schindler’s capital control indices and the panel of Quinn indices updated by Quinn, Schindler,
and Toyoda.

     Earlier, Mody and Murshid (2005) constructed an index using the same dummy indicators, but aggre-
gating them by addition.

during boom or bust episodes observed in 75 countries over the period 1995-2011.12 The
figure is in line with the results obtained with the Schindler and Quinn indices. There is
virtually no movement in capital controls during booms or contractions in aggregate activity,
suggesting that on average capital control policy is not prudential in nature.
       Finally, as a third robustness check, we analyze the cyclical behavior of capital controls
in countries that apply this type of restrictions episodically. Specifically, Klein (2012) distin-
guishes capital controls into ones that are in place more or less permanently (he refers to this
category as ‘walls’) and ones that are applied episodically (he calls these ‘gates’). Although
Klein limits attention to controls on capital inflows, our data set allows us to conduct the
analysis using data on controls on inflows and outflows separately. Clearly, permanent capi-
tal controls cannot be prudential, since, by definition, they do not change over the business
cycle. A natural question, then, is whether episodic capital controls behave in a prudential
or countercyclical manner.
       To address this question, we now restrict the analysis to the group of episodic countries
listed in Klein (2012, table 2).13 The average standard deviation of the cyclical component of
capital controls across episodic countries is 0.10 for inflows and 0.09 for outflows. These num-
bers are higher than the ones corresponding to the whole sample (0.07 and 0.06, respectively).
However, the standard deviations are still small, for they are equivalent to movements in
controls in slightly more than one out of 10 of the granular type of transactions comprising
each of the two indices. This means that even episodic capital controls move little over
the business cycle. Figure 12 displays for episodic countries the behavior of capital controls
on inflows and outflows conditional on the economy being in a boom or a bust. As in the
entire sample, capital controls on inflows or outflows are virtually unchanged during booms
or busts. This result suggests that even among episodic countries, on average, restrictions
on international financial transactions do not seem to be driven by a macro prudential or
countercyclical motive.
       The expanded appendix (FRU, 2013) presents a number of robustness checks. In par-
ticular it shows that our main results hold at the level of each of the 10 granular transactions
that constitute the indices of capital controls on inflows or outflows (table A.6.a), when one
limits attention to large booms and busts (figure A.6), when output is detrended using first
differences rather than by removing a quadratic trend (table A.3.d and figure A.7), and when

     The criterion determining the country and time dimension of the sample is similar to the one described
in footnote 10.

     We eliminated the Czech Republic and Hungary because they do not satisfy our requirement of at least
25 years of output data to ensure an adequate estimate of the output gap. We also eliminated Poland for
comparability, as this country is not included in our extension of Schindler’s data set.

8    Conclusion
A growing recent theoretical literature argues that prudential capital control policy may be
optimal. According to this body of work, booms in aggregate activity carry the seeds of
economic crises. Therefore, these theories suggest that policymakers should act early and
not wait until the crisis has taken place to pick up the broken pieces. That is, during booms
controls on capital inflows should be tightened and controls on outflow loosened and vice
versa during contractions. In this paper, we set out to establish whether observed capital
control policy around the world has systematically behaved in a prudential or countercyclical
manner during the past decade and a half.
     To this end, the first contribution of our investigation is to update the index of capital
controls constructed by Schindler (2009). The new data set covers 91 countries over the
period 1995-2011. This capital control index distinguishes inflows from outflows, type of
assets, and residency.
     Equipped with this updated panel of capital control indices, we document patterns of
comovement with various macroeconomic indicators. The central result of our analysis is
that capital controls are virtually flat during macroeconomic booms or busts. This is the
case regardless of whether the indicator used to identify booms and busts is output, the
current account, or the real exchange rate. This result also holds for many different ways of
disaggregating the data, including, the level of economic development, the degree of external
indebtedness, the exchange rate regime, or the type of asset. We also document a quasi
perfect acyclicality of capital controls during the Great Contraction of 2007-2009.
     There are indications that policymakers are adopting more eclectic positions with re-
spect to the use of capital-account restriction for stabilization purposes. The IMF endorse-
ment of this type of policy in recent years is perhaps the most clear signal in this regard. It
would therefore be of interest to monitor over time the cyclical behavior of capital controls,
by, for example, updating periodically the type of analysis carried out in this paper, to gauge
the extent to which the perceived changes in views regarding the role of capital controls are
put to work.

 Note. See note to figure 3. A country is classified as having a low (high) level of
 external debt if during the bust episode its net foreign asset to GDP ratio lies below
 (above) the 20th percentile of the world distribution. Data on net external debt to
 GDP ratios are taken from Lane and Milessi-Ferreti (2007).
