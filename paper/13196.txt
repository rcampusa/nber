                                              ABSTRACT

The recently developed long-run risks asset pricing model shows that concerns about long-run expected
growth and time-varying uncertainty (i.e., volatility) about future economic prospects drive asset prices.
These two channels of economic risks can account for the risk premia and asset price fluctuations.
In addition, the model can empirically account for the cross-sectional differences in asset returns. Hence,
the long-run risks model provides a coherent and systematic framework for analyzing financial markets.

1     Introduction

From the perspective of theoretical models, several key features of asset markets are puz-
zling. Among others, these puzzling features include the level of equity premium (see Mehra
and Prescott, 1985), asset price volatility (see Shiller, 1981), and the large cross-sectional
differences in average returns across equity portfolios such as value and growth portfolios. In
bond and foreign exchange markets, the violations of the expectations hypothesis (see Fama
and Bliss, 1987; Fama, 1984) and the ensuing return predictability is quantitatively difficult
to explain. What risks and investor concerns can provide a unified explanation for these
asset market facts? One potential explanation of all these anomalies is the long-run risks
model developed in Bansal and Yaron (2004) (henceforth BY). In this model, fluctuations
in the long-run growth prospects of the economy and the time-varying level of economic un-
certainty (consumption or output volatility) drive financial markets. Recent work indicates
that many of the asset prices anomalies are a natural outcome of these channels developed in
BY. In this article I explain the key mechanisms in the BY model that enable it to account
for the asset market puzzles.

    In the BY model, the first economic channel relates to expected growth: Consumption
and dividend growth rates contain a small long-run component in the mean. That is, cur-
rent shocks to expected growth alter expectations about future economic growth not only
for short horizons but also for the very long run. The second channel pertains to varying
economic uncertainty: Conditional volatility of consumption is time varying. Fluctuations in
consumption volatility lead to time variation in risk premia. Agents fear adverse movements
in the long-run growth and volatility components because they lower equilibrium consump-
tion, wealth, and asset prices. This makes holding equity quite risky, leading to high risk
compensation in equity markets.

    The preferences developed in Epstein and Zin (1989) play an important role in the long-
run risks model. These preferences allow for a separation between risk aversion and intertem-
poral elasticity of substitution (IES) of investors: The magnitude of the risk aversion relative
to the reciprocal of the IES determines whether agents prefer early or late resolution of un-
certainty regarding the consumption path. In the BY model, agents prefer early resolution
of uncertainty; that is, risk aversion is larger than the reciprocal of the IES. This ensures
that the compensation for long-run expected growth risk is positive. The resulting model
has three distinct sources of risks that determine the risk premia: short-run, long-run, and


                                               1
consumption volatility risks. In the traditional power utility model, only the first risk source
carries a distinct risk price and the other two risks have zero risk compensation. Separate
risk compensation for shocks to consumption volatility and expected consumption growth is
a novel feature of the BY model relative to earlier asset pricing models.

   To derive model implications for asset prices, the preference parameters are calibrated.
The calibrated magnitude of the risk aversion and the IES is an empirical issue. Hansen and
Singleton (1982), Attanasio and Weber (1989), and Vissing-Jorgensen and Attanasio (2003)
estimate the IES to be well in excess of 1. Hall (1988) and Campbell (1999), on the other
hand, estimate its value to be well below 1. BY show that even if the population value of
the IES is larger than 1, the estimation methods used by Hall would measure the IES to
be close to zero. That is, in the presence of time-varying consumption volatility, there is a
severe downward bias in the point estimates of IES. Using the data from financial markets,
Bansal, Khatchatrian, and Yaron (2005) and Bansal and Shaliastovich (2007) provide further
evidence on the magnitude of the IES.

   Different techniques are employed to provide empirical and theoretical support for the
existence of long-run components in consumption and dividends. Whereas BY calibrate pa-
rameters to match the annual moments of consumption and dividend growth rates, Bansal,
Gallant, and Tauchen (2007) and Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2006) formally test the model
using the efficient and generalized method of moments, respectively. Using multivariate anal-
ysis Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) and Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron (2006) present evidence
for long-run components in consumption growth. Colacito and Croce (2006) also provide
statistical support for the long-run components in consumption data for the United States
and other developed economies. Lochstoer and Kaltenbrunner (2006) provide a production-
based motivation for long-run risks in consumption. They show that in a standard produc-
tion economy, where consumption is endogenous, the consumption growth process contains
a predictable long-run component similar to that in the BY model. There is considerable
support for the volatility channel as well. Bansal, Khatchatrian, and Yaron (2005) show that
consumption volatility is time varying and that its current level predicts future asset valu-
ations (price-dividend ratio) with a significantly negative projection coefficient; this implies
that asset markets dislike economic uncertainty. Exploiting the BY uncertainty channel,
Lettau, Ludvigson, and Wachter (2007) provide interesting market premium implications of
the low-frequency decline in consumption volatility.

   BY show that their long-run risks model can explain the risk-free rate, the level of

                                               2
the equity premium, asset price volatility, and many of the return and dividend growth
predictability dimensions that have been characterized in earlier work. The time-varying
volatility in consumption is important to capture some of the economic outcomes that relate
to time-varying risk premia.

   The arguments presented in their work also have immediate implications for the cross-
sectional differences in mean returns across assets. Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2002 and
2005) show that the systematic risks across firms should be related to the systematic long-
run risks in firms’ cash flows that investors receive. Firms whose expected cash-flow (profits)
growth rates move with the economy are more exposed to long-run risks and hence should
carry higher risk compensation. These authors develop methods to measure the exposure
of cash flows to long-run risks, and show that these cash flow betas can account for the
differences in risk premia across assets. They show that the high book-to-market portfolio
(i.e., value portfolio) has a larger long-run risks beta relative to the low book-to-market
portfolio (i.e., growth portfolio). Hence, the high mean return of value firms relative to
growth firms is not puzzling. The Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2002 and 2005) evidence
supports a long-run risks explanation for the cross-sectional differences in mean returns.

   Several recent papers use the BY long-run risks model to address a rich array of asset
market questions; among others, these include Kiku (2006), Colacito and Croce (2006),
Lochstoer and Kaltenbrunner (2006), Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2006), Chen
(2006), Eraker (2006), Piazzesi and Schneider (2005), and Bansal and Shaliastovich (2007).
Kiku (2006) shows that the long-run risks model can account for the violations of the capital
asset pricing model (CAPM) and consumption CAPM (C-CAPM) in explaining the cross-
sectional differences in mean returns. Further, the model can capture the entire transition
density of value or growth returns, which underscores the importance of long-run risks in
accounting for equity markets’ behavior. Eraker (2006) and Piazzesi and Schneider (2005)
consider the implications of the model for the risk premia on U.S. Treasury bonds and show
how to account for some of the average premium puzzles in the term structure literature.
Colacito and Croce (2006) extend the long-run risks model to a two-country setup and
explain the issues about international risk sharing and exchange rate volatility. Bansal
and Shaliastovich (2007) show that the long-run risks model can simultaneously account
for the behavior of equity markets, yields, and foreign exchange and explain the nature of
predictability and violations of the expectations hypothesis in foreign exchange and Treasury
markets. Chen, Collin-Dufresne, and Goldstein (2006) and Chen (2006) analyze the ability


                                              3
of the long-run risks model to explain the credit spread and leverage puzzles of the corporate
sector.

   Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) consider a long-run risks model with a unit IES speci-
fication. Using different methods to measure long-run risks exposures of portfolios sorted
by book-to-market ratio, they find, as in Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005), that these
alternative long-run risk measures do line-up in the cross-section with the average returns.
They further show that the measurement of long-run risks can be sensitive to the economet-
ric methods used. Hansen and Sargent (2006) highlight the interesting implications of robust
decision-making for risks in financial markets when the representative agent entertains the
long-run risks model as a baseline description of the economy.

   The above results indicate that the long-run risks model can go a long way toward
providing an explanation for many of the key features of asset markets.

   The remainder of the article has three sections. The next section reviews the long-run
risks model of Bansal and Yaron (2004). The third section discusses the empirical evidence
of the model and, in particular, its implications for the equity, bond, and currency markets.
The final section concludes.

2       Long-Run Risks Model

2.1      Preferences and the Environment

Consider a representative agent with the following Epstein and Zin (1989) recursive prefer-
ences,
                                             1−γ                    θ
                                                            1−γ 1/θ 1−γ
                              Ut = {(1 − δ)Ct θ
                                                   + δ(Et [Ut+1 ]) } ,

where the rate of time preference is determined by δ, with 0 < δ < 1. The parameter θ is
determined by the risk aversion and the IES — specifically,

                                                   1−γ
                                            θ≡            ,
                                                   1 − ψ1

γ ≥ 0 is the risk aversion parameter and ψ ≥ 0 is the IES. The sign of θ is determined by
the magnitudes of the risk aversion and the elasticity of substitution. In particular, if ψ > 1
                                                                           1
and γ > 1, then θ will be negative. Note that, when θ = 1 (that is, γ =    ψ
                                                                               ), one obtains the
standard case of expected utility.

    As is pointed out in Epstein and Zin (1989), when risk aversion equals the reciprocal
of IES (expected utility), the agent is indifferent to the timing of the resolution of the
uncertainty of the consumption path. When risk aversion exceeds (is less than) the reciprocal
of IES, the agent prefers early (late) resolution of uncertainty of consumption path. In the
long-run risks model, agents prefer early resolution of the uncertainty of the consumption
path.

    The period budget constraint for the agent with wealth Wt and consumption Ct at date
t, is
                                      Wt+1 = (Wt − Ct )Ra,t+1 .                              (1)
            Wt+1
Ra,t+1 =   (Wt −Ct )
                       is the return on the aggregate portfolio held by the agent. As in Lucas
(1978), we normalize the supply of all equity claims to be 1 and the risk-free asset to be in
zero net supply. In equilibrium, aggregate dividends in the economy (which also include any
claims to labor income) equals aggregate consumption of the representative agent. Given a
process for aggregate consumption, the return on the aggregate portfolio corresponds to the
return on an asset that delivers aggregate consumption as its dividends each time period.

    The logarithm of the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution (IMRS), mt+1 , for these

                                                   5
preferences (Epstein and Zin, 1989) is

                                               θ
                            mt+1 = θ log δ −     gt+1 + (θ − 1)ra,t+1                       (2)
                                               ψ

and the asset pricing restriction on any continuous return ri,t+1 is
                      h             θ                               i
                    Et exp(θ log δ − gt+1 + (θ − 1)ra,t+1 + ri,t+1 ) = 1,                   (3)
                                    ψ

where gt+1 equals log(Ct+1 /Ct ) — the log growth rate of aggregate consumption. The return,
ra,t+1 , is the log of the return (i.e., continuous return) on an asset which delivers aggregate
consumption as its dividends each time period.

   The return to the aggregate consumption claim, ra,t+1 , is not observed in the data,
whereas the return on the dividend claim corresponds to the observed return on the market
portfolio, rm,t+1 . The levels of market dividends and consumption are not equal; aggregate
consumption is much larger than aggregate dividends. The difference is financed by labor
income. In the BY model, aggregate consumption and aggregate dividends are treated as
two separate processes and the difference between them defines the agent’s labor income
process.

   The key ideas of the model are developed, and the intuition is provided by means of
approximate analytical solutions. However, for the key qualitative results, the model is
solved numerically. To derive the approximate solutions for the model, we use the standard
Campbell and Shiller (1988) return approximation,

                               ra,t+1 = κ0 + κ1 zt+1 − zt + gt+1 ,                          (4)

where lowercase letters refer to variables in logs, in particular, ra,t+1 = log(Ra,t+1 ) is the
continuous return on the consumption claim, and the price-to-consumption ratio is zt =
log (Pt /Ct ). Analogously, rm,t+1 and zm,t correspond to the continuous return on the dividend
claim and its log price-to-dividend ratio. The approximating constants, κ0 and κ1 , are specific
to the asset under consideration and depend only on the average level of zt , as shown in
Campbell and Shiller (1988). It is important to keep in mind that the average value of z for
any asset is endogenous to the model and depends on all its parameters and the dynamics
of the asset’s dividends.


                                                6
   From equation (2), it follows that the innovation in IMRS, mt+1 , is driven by the in-
novations in gt+1 and ra,t+1 . Covariation with the innovation in mt+1 determines the risk
premium for any asset. We characterize the nature of risk sources and their compensation
in the next section.


2.2    Long-Run Growth and Economic Uncertainty Risks

The agents’ IMRS depends on the endogenous consumption return, ra,t+1 . The risk com-
pensation on all assets depends on this return, which itself is determined by the process
for consumption growth. The dividend process is needed for determining the return on the
market portfolio. To capture long-run risks, consumption and dividend growth rates, gt+1
and gd,t+1 , respectively, are modeled to contain a small persistent predictable component,
xt , while fluctuating economic uncertainty is introduced through the time-varying volatility
of the cash flows:

                        xt+1 = ρxt + ϕe σt et+1
                        gt+1 = µ + xt + σt ηt+1                                            (5)
                       gd,t+1 = µd + φxt + ϕd σt ut+1
                         2
                        σt+1 = σ 2 + ν1 (σt2 − σ 2 ) + σw wt+1
                                   et+1 , ut+1 , ηt+1 , wt+1 ∼ N.i.i.d.(0, 1),

with the shocks et+1 , ut+1 , ηt+1 , and wt+1 assumed to be mutually independent. The pa-
rameter ρ determines the persistence of the expected growth rate process. First, note that
when ϕe = 0, the processes gt and gd,t+1 have zero auto-correlation. Second, if et+1 = ηt+1 ,
the process for consumption is ARMA(1,1) used in Campbell (1999), Cecchetti, Lam, and
Mark (1993), and Bansal and Lundblad (2002). If in addition ϕe = ρ, then consumption
growth corresponds to an AR(1) process used in Mehra and Prescott (1985). The variable
σt+1 represents the time-varying volatility of consumption and captures the intuition that
there are fluctuations in the level of uncertainty in the economy. The unconditional volatility
of consumption is σ 2 . To maintain parsimony, it is assumed that the shocks are uncorre-
lated and that there is only one source of time-varying economic uncertainty that affects
consumption and dividends.

   Two parameters, φ > 1 and ϕd > 1, calibrate the overall volatility of dividends and its

                                                7
correlation with consumption. The parameter φ is larger than 1 because corporate prof-
its are more sensitive to changing economic conditions relative to consumption. Note that
consumption and dividends are not cointegrated in the above specification; Bansal, Gal-
lant, and Tauchen (2007) develop a specification that does allow for cointegration between
consumption and dividends.

   The better understand the role of long-run risks consider the scaled long-run variance (or
variance ratio) of consumption for horizon J,

                                            V ar[ Jj=1 gt+j ]
                                                 P
                                    2
                                   σc,J   =                   .
                                              J V ar[gt ]

   The magnitude of this consumption growth volatility is the same for all J if consump-
tion is uncorrelated across time. This scaled variance increases with the horizon when the
expected growth is persistent. Hence, agents face larger aggregate consumption volatility
at longer horizons. As the persistence in x and/or its variance increases, the magnitude of
long-run volatility will rise. In equilibrium, this increase in magnitude of aggregate con-
sumption volatility will require a sizeable compensation if the agents prefer early resolution
of uncertainty about the consumption path.

   Using multivariate statistical analysis, Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) and Bansal, Kiku,
and Yaron (2006) provide evidence on the existence of the long-run component in observed
consumption and dividends. Using simulation methods, Bansal and Yaron (2005) document
the presence of the long-run component in U.S. consumption data, whereas Colacito and
Croce (2006) estimate this component in consumption for many developed economies. Note
that there can be considerable persistence in the time-varying consumption volatility as well;
hence, the long-run variance of the conditional volatility of consumption can be very large
as well.

   To see the importance of the small low-frequency movements for asset prices, consider
the quantity
                                                ∞
                                               hX                i
                                          Et          κj1 gt+j    .
                                               j=1
                                            κ1 xt
With κ1 < 1, this expectation equals       1−κ1 ρ
                                                  .       Even though the variance of x is tiny, while
ρ is fairly high, shocks to xt (the expected growth rate component) can still alter growth
rate expectations for the long run, leading to volatile asset prices. Hence, investor concerns

                                                      8
about expected long-run growth rates can alter asset prices quite significantly.


2.2.1       Equilibrium and Asset Prices

The consumption and dividend growth rates processes are exogenous in this endowment
economy. Further, the IMRS depends on an endogenous return ra,t+1 . To characterize the
IMRS and the behavior of asset returns, a solution for the log price-consumption ratio, zt ,
and the log price-dividend ratio, zm,t , is needed. The relevant state variables for zt and zm,t
are the expected growth rate of consumption, xt , and the conditional consumption volatility,
σt2 .

        Exploiting the Euler equation (3), the approximate solution for the log price-consumption
ratio, zt , has the form zt = A0 + A1 xt + A2 σt2 . The solution for A1 is,

                                                     1
                                                1−   ψ
                                        A1 =              .                                             (6)
                                               1 − κ1 ρ

        This coefficient is positive if the IES, ψ, is greater than 1. In this case, the intertemporal
substitution effect dominates the wealth effect. In response to higher expected growth, agents
buy more assets and consequently the wealth-to-consumption ratio rises. In the standard
power utility model with risk aversion larger than 1, the IES is less than 1 and therefore A1
is negative-a rise in expected growth potentially lowers asset valuations. That is, the wealth
effect dominates the substitution effect.1

        Corporate payouts (i.e., dividends), with φ > 1, are more sensitive to long-run risks and
changes in the expected growth rate lead to a larger reaction in the price of the dividend claim
                                                                                                        1

than in the price of the consumption claim. Hence, for the dividend asset A1,m =                    1−κ1,m ρ
and is larger in absolute value than the consumption asset.

        The solution coefficient, A2 , for measuring the sensitivity of the price-consumption ratio
to volatility fluctuations is latility fluctuations is

                                          0.5[(θ − ψθ )2 + (θA1 κ1 ϕe )2 ]
                                 A2 =                                        .                          (7)

    An alternative interpretation with the power utility model is that higher expected growth rates increase
the risk-free rate to an extent that discounting dominates the effects of higher expected growth rates. This
leads to a fall in asset prices.


                                                     9
An analogous coefficient for the market price-dividend ratio, A2,m , is provided in BY.

   The expression for A2 provides two valuable insights. First, if the IES and risk aversion are
larger than 1, then θ and consequently A2 are negative. In this case, a rise in consumption
volatility lowers asset valuations and increases the risk premia on all assets. Second, an
increase in the permanence of volatility shocks — that is, an increase in ν1 — magnifies
the effects of volatility shocks on valuation ratios as investors perceive changes in economic
uncertainty as very long lasting.


2.2.2   Pricing of Short-Run, Long-Run, and Volatility Risks

Substituting the solutions for the price-consumption ratio, zt , into the expression for equilib-
rium return for ra,t+1 in equation (4), one can now characterize the solution for the IMRS that
can be used to value all assets. The log of the IMRS mt+1 can always be stated as the sum
of its conditional mean and its one-step-ahead innovation. The conditional mean is affine in
expected mean and conditional variance of consumption growth and can be expressed as,
                                                      "              2 #

m0 is a constant determined by the preference and consumption dynamics parameters.

   The innovation in the IMRS is very important for thinking about risk compensation (risk
premia) in various markets. Specifically, it is equal to

               mt+1 − Et (mt+1 ) = −λm,η σt ηt+1 − λm,e σt et+1 − λm,w σw wt+1 ,             (9)

where λm,η , λm,e , and λm,w are the market prices for the short-run, long-run, and volatil-
ity risks, respectively. The market prices of systematic risks, including the compensation
for stochastic volatility risk in consumption, can be expressed in terms of the underlying
preferences parameters that govern the evolution of consumption growth:

                         λm,η = γ

                                      1 h κ1 ϕe i

                         λm,w    = (γ − )(1 − γ)                         .
                                       ψ             2 (1 − κ1 ν1 )

   The risk compensation for the ηt+1 shocks is very standard and λm,η equals the risk
                                                                           1

                                                                             ,   the risk compensation
parameters λm,e and λm,w are zero. Long-run risks and volatility are priced only when the
agent is not indifferent to the timing of the uncertainty resolution for the consumption path-
that is, when risk aversion is different from the reciprocal of the IES. For the price of long-run
risks to be positive and that of volatility risks negative, it is necessary that the agent prefers
                                                                                                 1

market prices of long-run and volatility risks are sensitive to the magnitude of permanence
parameter, ρ, as well. The risk compensation for long-run risks and volatility risks rises as
the permanence parameter, ρ

   The equity premium in the presence of time-varying economic uncertainty is

     Et (rm,t+1 − rf,t ) = βm,η λm,η σt2 + βm,e λm,e σt2 + βm,w λm,w σw2 − 0.5V art (rm,t+1 ).         (11)

The first beta corresponds to the exposure to short-run risks and the second to long-run
risks. The third beta (that is, βm,w ) captures the return’s exposure to volatility risks. It
is important to note that all the betas in this general equilibrium framework are endoge-
nous. They are completely pinned down by the dynamics of the asset’s dividends and the
preferences parameters of the agent. The quantitative magnitude of the betas and the risk
premium for the consumption claim is discussed below.

   The risk premium on the market portfolio is time varying as σt fluctuates. The ratio of
the conditional risk premium to the conditional volatility of the market portfolio fluctuates
with σt and therefore the Sharpe ratio is time varying. The maximal Sharpe ratio in this
model, which approximately equals the conditional volatility of the log IMRS, also varies
with σt . During periods of high economic uncertainty (i.e., consumption volatility), all risk
premia rise.

   The first-order effects on the level of the risk-free rate, as discussed in Bansal and Yaron
(2005), are the rate of time preference and the average consumption growth rate divided by
the IES. Increasing the IES keeps the level low. The variance of the risk-free rate is deter-
mined by the volatility of the expected consumption growth rate and the IES. Increasing


                                                  11
the IES lowers the volatility of the risk-free rate. In addition, incorporating economic uncer-
tainty leads to an interesting channel for interpreting fluctuations in the real risk-free rate.
In addition, this has serious implications for the measurement of the IES in the data, which
heavily relies on the link between the risk-free rate and expected consumption growth. In
the presence of varying volatility, the estimates of IES based on the projections considered
in Hall (1988) and Campbell (1999) are seriously biased downward.

    Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005) also consider a long-run risks model specification where
the IES is pinned at 1. This specific case affords considerable simplicity, as the wealth-to-
consumption ratio is constant. To solve the model at values of the IES that differ from 1, the
authors provide approximations around the case where IES is 1. Bansal, Kiku, and Yaron
(2006) provide an alternative approximate solution that relies on equation (4); they show
how to derive the return ra,t along with the endogenous approximating constants κ1 and κ0
for any configuration of preferences parameters.



3     Data and Model Implications

3.1    Data and Growth Rate Dynamics

BY calibrate the model described in (5) at the monthly frequency. From this monthly model
they derive time-aggregated annual growth rates of consumption and dividends to match key
aspects of annual aggregate consumption and dividends data. For consumption, Bureau of
Economic Analysis data on real per capita annual consumption growth of non-durables and
services for the period 1929-98 is used. Dividends and the value-weighted market return data
are taken from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). All nominal quantities
are deflated using the CPI.

    The mean annual real per-capita consumption growth rate is 1.8 percent, and its standard
deviation is about 2.9 percent. Table 1, adapted from BY, shows that, in the data, con-
sumption growth has a large first-order autocorrelation coefficient and a small second-order
coefficient. The standard errors in the data for these autocorrelations are sizeable. An alter-
native way to view the long-horizon property of the consumption and dividend growth rates
is to use variance ratios, which are themselves determined by the autocorrelations (Cochrane,
1988). In the data, the variance ratios first rise significantly and at a horizon of about seven


                                              12
years start to decline. The standard errors on these variance ratios, not surprisingly, are
quite substantial.

   In terms of the specific parameters for the consumption dynamics, BY calibrate ρ at
0.979, which determines the persistence in the long-run component in growth rates. Their
choice of ϕe and σ ensures that the model matches the unconditional variance and the
autocorrelation function of annual consumption growth. The standard deviation of the
innovation in consumption equals 0.0078. This parameter configuration implies that the
predictable variation in monthly consumption growth is very small — the implied R2 is
only 4.4 percent. The exposure of the corporate sector to long-run risks is governed by
φ, and its magnitude is similar to that in Abel (1999). The standard deviation of the
monthly innovation in dividends, ϕd σ, is 0.0351. The parameters of the volatility process
are chosen to capture the persistence in consumption volatility. Based on the evidence of
slow decay in volatility shocks, BY calibrate ν1 , the parameter governing the persistence of
conditional volatility, at 0.987. The shocks to the volatility process have very small volatility;
σw is calibrated at 0.23 × 10−5. At the calibrated parameters, the modeled consumption
and dividend growth rates very closely match the key consumption and dividends data
features reported in Table 1. Bansal, Gallant, and Tauchen (2007) provide simulation-based
estimation evidence that supports this configuration as well.

   Table 2 presents the targeted asset market data for 1929-98. The equity risk premium
is 6.33 percent per annum, and the real risk-free rate is 0.9 percent. The annual market
return volatility is 19.42 percent, and that of the real risk-free rate is quite small, about 1
percent per annum. The volatility of the price-dividend ratio is quite high, and it is a very
persistent series. In addition to these data dimensions, BY also evaluate the ability of the
model to capture predictability of returns. Bansal, Khatchatrian, and Yaron (2005) show
that, consistent with the implications of the BY model, price-dividend ratios are negatively
correlated with consumption volatility at long leads and lags.

   It is often argued that, in the data, consumption and dividend growth are close to being
i.i.d. BY show that their model of consumption and dividends is also consistent with the
observed data on consumption and dividends growth rates. However, although the financial
market data are hard to interpret from the perspective of the i.i.d. growth rate dynamics,
BY show that it is interpretable from the perspective of the growth rate dynamics that
incorporate long-run risks. Given these difficulties in discrimination across these two models,
Hansen and Sargent (2006) use features of the long-run model for developing economic models

                                               13
where agents update their model beliefs in a manner that incorporates robustness against
model misspecification.


3.2    Preference Parameters

The preference parameters take account of economic considerations. The time preference
parameter, δ < 1, and the risk aversion parameter, γ, is either 7.5 or 10. Mehra and
Prescott (1985) argue that a reasonable upper bound for risk aversion is around 10. The IES
is set at 1.5: An IES value that is not less than 1 is important for the quantitative results.

   There is considerable debate about the magnitude of the IES. Hansen and Singleton
(1982) and Attanasio and Weber (1989) estimate the IES to be well in excess of 1. More
recently, Guvenen (2001) and Vissing-Jorgensen and Attanasio (2003) also estimate the IES
over 1; they show that their estimates are close to that used in BY. However, Hall (1988) and
Campbell (1999) estimate the IES to be well below 1. BY argue that the low IES estimates
of Hall and Campbell are based on a model without time-varying volatility. They show that
ignoring the effects of time-varying consumption volatility leads to a serious downward bias
in the estimates of the IES. If the population value of the IES in the BY model is 1.5, then
the estimated value of the IES using Hall estimation methods will be less than 0.3. With
fluctuating consumption volatility, the projection of consumption growth on the level of the
risk-free rate does not equal the IES, leading to the downward bias. This suggests that Hall’s
and Campbell’s estimates may not be a robust guide for calibrating the IES.

   In addition to the above arguments, the empirical evidence in Bansal, Khatchatrian, and
Yaron (2005) shows that a rise in consumption volatility sharply lowers asset prices at long
leads and lags, and high current asset valuations forecast higher future corporate earnings
growth. Figures 1 through 4 use data from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany,
and Japan to evaluate the volatility channel. The asset valuation measure is the price-to-
earnings ratio, and the consumption volatility measure is constructed by averaging eight
lags of the absolute value of consumption residuals. It is evident from the figures that a
rise in consumption volatility lowers asset valuations for all countries under consideration;
this highlights the volatility channel and motivates the specification of an IES larger than 1.
In a two-country extension of the model, Bansal and Shaliastovich (2007) show that dollar
prices of foreign currency and forward premia co-move negatively with the consumption
volatility differential, whereas the ex ante currency returns have positive correlations with

                                              14
it. This provides further empirical support for a magnitude of the IES. In terms of growth
rate predictability, Ang and Bekaert (2007) and Bansal, Khatchatrian, and Yaron (2005)
report a positive relation between asset valuations and expected earnings growth. These
data features, as discussed in the theory sections above, again require an IES larger than 1.


3.3     Asset Pricing Implications

To underscore the importance of two key aspects of the model, preferences and long-run
risks, first consider the genesis of the risk premium on ra,t+1 — the return on the asset that
delivers aggregate consumption as its dividends. The determination of risk premia for other
dividend claims follows the same logic.

   Table 3 shows the market price of risk and the breakdown of the risk premium from
various risk sources. Column 1 considers the case of power utility where IES equals the
reciprocal of the risk aversion parameter. As discussed earlier, the prices of long-run and
volatility risks are zero. In the power utility case, the main risk is the short-run risk and the
risk premium on the consumption asset equals γσ 2 , which is 0.7 percent per annum.

   Column 2 of Table 3 considers the case with an IES less than 1 (set at 0.5). For long-run
growth rate risks, the price of risk is positive; for volatility risks, the price of risk is negative,
as γ is larger than the reciprocal of the IES. However, the consumption asset’s beta for long-
run risks (beta with regard to the innovations in xt+1 ) is negative. This, as discussed earlier,
is because A1 is negative (see equation (6)), implying that a rise in expected growth lowers the
wealth-to-consumption ratio. Consequently, long-run risks in this case contribute a negative
risk premium of -1.96 percent per annum. The market price of volatility risks is negative and
small; however, the asset’s beta for this risk source is large and positive, reflecting the fact
that asset prices rise when economic uncertainty rises (see equation (7)). In all, when the
IES is less than 1, the risk premium on the consumption asset is negative, which is highly
counterintuitive, and highlights the implausibility of this parameter configuration.

   Column 3 of Table 3 shows that when the IES is larger than 1, the price of long-run
growth risks rises. More importantly, the asset’s beta for long-run growth risks is positive
and that for volatility risks is negative. Both these risk sources contribute toward a positive
risk premium. The risk premium from long-run growth is 0.76 percent and that for the
short-run consumption shock is 0.73 percent. The overall risk premia for this consumption


                                                 15
asset is 1.52 percent. This evidence shows that an IES larger than 1 is required for the
long-run and volatility risks to carry a positive risk premium.

   It is clear from Table 3 that the price of risk is highest for the long-run risks (see columns
2 and 3) and smallest for the volatility risks. A comparison of column 2 and 3 also shows that
raising the IES increases the prices of long-run and volatility risks in absolute value. The
magnitudes reported in Table 3 are with ρ = 0.979 — lowering this persistence parameter
also lowers the prices of long-run and volatility risks (in absolute value). Increasing the risk
aversion parameter increases the prices of all consumption risks. Hansen and Jagannathan
(1991) document the importance of the maximal Sharpe ratio, determined by the volatility
of the IMRS, in assessing asset pricing models. Incorporating long-run risks increases the
maximal Sharpe ratio in the model, which easily satisfies the non-parametric bounds of
Hansen and Jagannathan (1991).

   The risk premium on the market portfolio (i.e., the dividend asset) is also affected by the
presence of long-run risks. To underscore their importance, assume that consumption and
dividend growth rates are i.i.d. This shuts off the long-run risks channel. The market risk
premium in this case is

                    Et (rm,t+1 − rf,t ) = γcov(gt+1 , gd,t+1 ) − 0.5V ar(gd,t+1 ),          (12)

and market return volatility equals the dividend growth rate volatility. If shocks to consump-
tion and dividends are uncorrelated, then the geometric risk premium is negative and equals
−0.5V ar(gd,t+1 ). If the correlation between monthly consumption and dividend growth is
0.25, then the equity premium is 0.08 percent per annum, which is similar to the evidence
documented in Mehra and Prescott (1985) and Weil (1989).

   BY show that their model, which incorporates long-run growth rate risks and fluctuating
economic uncertainty provides a very close match to the asset market data reported in Table
2. That is, the model can account for the low risk-free rate, high equity premium, high
asset price volatility, and low risk-free rate volatility. The BY model matches additional
data features, such as (i) predictability of returns at short and long horizons using dividend
yield as a predictive variable, (ii) time-varying and persistent market return volatility, (iii)
negative correlation between market return and volatility shocks, i.e., the volatility feedback
effect, and the (iv) negative relation between consumption volatility and asset prices at long
leads and lags. (Also see Bansal, Khatchatrian and Yaron, 2005.)


                                                 16
3.4    Cross-Sectional Implications

Table 4, shows that there are sizable differences in mean real returns across portfolios sorted
by book-to-market ratio, size, and momentum for quarterly data from 1967 to 2001. The size
and book-to-market sorts place firms into different deciles once per year, and the subsequent
return on these portfolios is used for empirical work. For momentum assets, CRSP-covered
New York Stock Exchange and American Stock and Options Exchange stocks are sorted on
the basis of their cumulative return over months t-12 through t -1. The loser portfolio (m1)
includes firms with the worst performance over the past year, and the winner portfolio (m10)
includes firms with the best performance. The data show that subsequent returns on these
portfolios have a large spread (i.e., m10 return - m1 return), about 4.62 percent per quarter:
This is the momentum spread puzzle. Similarly, the highest book-to-market firms (b10) earn
average real quarterly returns of 3.27 percent, whereas the lowest book-to-market (b1) firms
average 1.54 percent per quarter. The value spread (return on b10 - return on b1) is about
2 percent per quarter: This is the value spread puzzle. What explains these big differences
in mean returns across portfolios?

   Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2002 and 2005) connect systematic risks to cash-flow
risks. They show that an asset’s risk measure (i.e., its beta) is determined by its cash-flow
properties. In particular, their paper shows that cross-sectional differences in asset betas
mostly reflect differences in systematic risks in cash flows. Hence, systematic risks in cash
flows ought to explain differences in mean returns across assets. They develop two ways
to measure the long-run risks in cash flows. First they model dividend and consumption
growth rates as a VAR and measure the discounted impulse response of the dividend growth
rates to consumption innovations. This is one measure of risks in cash flows. Their second
measure is based on stochastic cointegration, which is estimated by regressing the log level
of dividends for each portfolio on a time trend and the log level of consumption. Specifically,
consider the projection
                                dt = τ (0) + τ (1)t + τ (2)ct + ζt ,

where the projection coefficient, τ (2), measures the long-run consumption risk in the asset’s
dividends. The coefficient τ (2) will be different for different assets.

   Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2002 and 2005) show that the exposure of dividend
growth rates to the long-run component in consumption has considerable cross-sectional
explanatory power. That is, dividend’s exposure to long-run consumption risks is an im-

                                                17
portant explanatory variable in accounting for differences in mean returns across portfolios.
Portfolios with high mean returns also have higher dividend exposure to consumption risks.
The cointegration-based measure of risk, τ (2), also provides very valuable information about
mean returns on assets. The cross-sectional R2 from regressing the mean returns on the
dividend-based risk measures is well over 65 percent. In contrast, other approaches find it
quite hard to explain the differences in mean returns for the 30-asset menu used in Bansal,
Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005). The standard consumption betas (i.e., C-CAPM) and the
market-based CAPM asset betas have close to zero explanatory power. The R2 for the C-
CAPM is 2.7 percent, and that for the market CAPM is 6.5 percent, with an implausible
negative slope coefficient. The Fama and French three-factor empirical specification also gen-
erates point estimates with negative, and difficult to interpret, prices of risk for the market
and size factors; the cross-sectional R2 is about 36 percent. Compared with all these models,
the cash-flow risks model of Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2005) is able to capture a sig-
nificant portion of the differences in risk premia across assets. Hansen, Heaton, and Li (2005)
inquire about the robustness of the stochastic cointegration-based risk measures considered
in Bansal, Dittmar, and Lundblad (2002). They argue that the dividend-based consumption
betas-particularly, the cointegration-based risk measures-are imprecisely estimated in the
time series. Interestingly, across the different estimation procedures, the cash-flow beta risk
measures across portfolios line-up closely with the average returns across assets. That is, in
the cross-section of assets (as opposed to the time series), the price of risk associated with
the long-run risks measures is reliably significant.

   Bansal, Dittmar, and Kiku (2007) derive new results that link this cointegration param-
eter to consumption betas by investment horizon and evaluate the ability of their model
to explain differences in mean returns for different horizons. They provide new evidence
regarding the robustness of the stochastic cointegration-based measures of permanent risks
in equity markets. Parker and Julliard (2005) evaluate whether long-run risks in aggre-
gate consumption can account for the cross-section of expected returns. Malloy, Moskowitz,
and Vissing-Jorgensen (2005) evaluate whether long-run risks in stockholders’ consumption
relative to aggregate consumption has greater ability to explain the cross-section of equity
returns, relative to aggregate consumption measures.

3.5       Term Structure and Currency Markets

Colacito and Croce (2006) consider a two-country version of the BY model. They show
that this model can account for the low correlation in consumption growth across coun-
tries but high correlation in marginal utilities across countries (high risk sharing despite a
low measured cross-country consumption correlation). This feature of international data is
highlighted in Brandt, Cochrane, and Santa-Clara (2006). The key idea that Colacito and
Croche pursue is that the long-run risks component is very similar across countries, but in
the short-run consumption growth can be very different. That is, countries share very similar
long-run prospects, but in the short-run they can look very different. This dimension, they
show, is sufficient to induce high correlation in marginal utilities across countries. It also
accounts for high real exchange volatility.

    BY derive implications for the real term structure of interest rates for the long-run risks
model. More recent papers by Eraker (2006) and Piazzesi and Schneider (2005) also consider
the quantitative implications for the nominal term structure using the long-run risks model.
Bansal and Shaliastovich (2007) show that the BY model can simultaneously account for the
upward-sloping terms structure, the violations of the expectations hypothesis in the bond
markets, the violations in the foreign currency markets, and the equity returns. This evidence
indicates that the long-run risks model provides a solid baseline model for understanding
financial markets. With simple modifications the model can be used to analyze the impact
of changing short-term interest rates on financial markets; that is, it can help in designing
policy.



4     Conclusion

The work of Bansal and Lundblad (2002), Bansal and Yaron (2004), Bansal, Dittmar, and
Lundblad (2005) shows that the long-run risks model can help interpret several features
of financial markets. These papers argue that investors care about the long-run growth
prospects and the uncertainty (time-varying consumption volatility) surrounding the growth
rate. Risks associated with changing long-run growth prospects and varying economic un-
certainty drive the level of equity returns, asset price volatility, risk premia across assets,
and predictability of returns in financial markets.



                                              19
   Recent papers indicate that the channel in this model can account for nominal yield curve
features, such as the violation the expectations hypothesis and the average upward-sloping
nominal yield curve. Evidence presented in Colacito and Croce (2006) and Bansal and
Shaliastovich (2007) shows that the model also accounts for key aspects of foreign exchange
markets.

   Growing evidence suggests that the long-run risks model can explain a rich array of
financial market facts. This suggests that the model can be used to analyze the impact of
economic policy on financial markets.

This table presents model-implied components of the risk premium on the consumption asset for different
values of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution parameter, ψ . All entries are based on γ = 10. The
parameters that govern the dynamics of the consumption process in equation (5) are identical to those in
Bansal and Yaron (2004): ρ = 0.979, σ = 0.0078, ϕe = 0.044, ν1 = 0.987, σw = 0.23 × 10−5 and κ1 of
0.997. The first three rows report the annualized percentage prices of risk for innovations in consumption,
the expected growth risks, and the consumption volatility risks — mprη , mpre , and mprw , respectively.
These prices of risks correspond to annualized percentage values for λm,η σ, λm,e σ, λm,w σw in equation (9).
The exposures of the consumption asset to the three systematic risks, βη , βe and βw , are presented in the
middle part of the table. Total risk compensation in annual percentage terms for each risk is reported as
prm∗ and equals the product of the price of risk, the standard deviation of the shock, and the beta for the
specific risk.

This table presents descriptive statistics for the returns on the 30 characteristic-sorted decile portfolios.
Value-weighted returns are presented for portfolios formed on momentum (M), market capitalization (S),
and book-to-market ratio (B). M1 represents the lowest momentum (loser) decile, S1 the lowest size (small
firms) decile, and B1 the lowest book-to-market decile. Data are converted to real values using the PCE
deflator. The data are sampled at the quarterly frequency and cover 1967:Q1-2001:Q4.
