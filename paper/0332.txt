              Unionization, Management Adjustment and Productivity



     The effect of unionization on
                                     productivity is examined in this paper
using time—series data on selected establishments in the U.S. cement industry.

The analysis combines statistical estimation of the union impact and interviews

with union and management officials to forge a link between econometric esti-

mation and the traditional institutional
                                           analysis of union policy and manage-
ment adjustment. The econometric analysis primarily deals with the problem of

identifying the impact of the union in the face of firm specific effects and

adjustments in labor quality. The case studies are designed to shed light on

the question of how unionization affects
                                           productivity. The empirical results
support the conclusion that unionization leads to
                                                    productive changes in the
operation of the enterprise. Evidence from the case studies suggests that

much of the gain in productivity derives from a series of extensive changes

in management personnel and procedure. These adjustments are a management

response to changes in the employment contract which follow unionization.

    Unionization entails fundamental changes n the nature of the employment

relationship. In a non—union setting the rules governing the workplace

are largely determined by management, with worker influence limited

to exit from the firm if the implied labor contract is not attractive.

Collective bargaining establishes a more direct means of influence through

the processes of contract negotiation and administration. These procedures

involve workers and the union in setting the terms and conditions of employment,

and in day to day operations. The literature on collective bargaining is

replete with evidence that these procedural changes are accompanied by

changes in the substance of the employment relation Recent analysis of

cross section data on value added per hour worked suggests a positive

union productivity effect.2 Yet there is very little evidence about the

change in productivity within an enterprise after collective bargaining is

introduced.   While numerous case studies have identified changes

in the internal operation of the firm after unionization, there has been

no attempt to link the institutional information with empirical analysis

of the union's effect on productivity. Both kinds of information are

essential to a full understanding of the impact of the union.

     This paper examines the effect of the union on productivity using

data from the U.S. cement industry. The analysis uses establishment level

data together with interviews of management and union officials to forge

a link between econometric estimation and the traditional institutional

analysis of union policy and management adjustment. Particular focus in

the empirical work is on the problem of identifying the effect of unionization

on productivity in the face of firm specific effects, and adjustments in labor

quality. The case studies, and most of the econometric analysis, are

based on the experience of six cement plants which changed union status

in the 1953—1976 period. The statistical analysis is designed to provide an

estimate of what impactunionization had, while the institutional analysis

is intended to shed light on the question of how unionization influenced

the operation of the enterprise. The paper is divided into four sections.

The first section presents the basic framework used in the empirical analysis

and includes a discussion of the empirical model, the. characteristics of

the industry and the data. Section II presents the econometric analysis

of the union impact and section III contains evidence on changes in

internal operations after unionization. Section IV presents implications

and conclusions.

Section I: The Analytical Framework

     The theoretical connection between unions and productivity has been

discussed at length elsewhere and will only be summarized briefly here In

the context of a representative production process in which output is

a function of capital and labor inputs, the productivity of labor depends

on the capital—labor ratio, the scale of operations and various institutional

factors —   e.g.   methods of organization, effectiveness of management, and

the motivation of workers. Traditional analysis limits the influence

of the union on productivity to capital—labor substitution induced by the

union wage effect.4 While increasing the capital—labor ratio in response

to a rise in the relative wage raises the productivity of labor, capital

productivity declines and the net effects are increased costs and misallocated

resources. A second channel of influence recognizes that unionization is
                                  —3—

likely to affect methods of organization and other aspects of the internal

operation of the firm. If unionization puts pressure on management to

improve operations, for example, the production process may yield a larger

volume of output for any combination of capital and labor Of courBe, the

opposite conclusion holds if unionization reduces motivation or otherwise

impedes the effective operation.of the enterprise.

     The effect of unionization on the organizational determinants of

productivity depends on changes in the labor contract and on adjustments

made by workers and management to new provisions. In most situations,

unionization entails a shift in relative power and increased worker

control over conditions of work. Freeman has argued that these changes

reduce turnover by giving workers a"voice" in the operation of the

enterprise.6 A reduction in turnover has clear implications for firm specific

training, the effectiveness of won: groups, and productivity. Similarly,

the use of seniority rules may improve training and morale. Where promotion

depends on seniority, rivalry among workers may be reduced and incentives

for assistance and cooperation increased? In addition, seniority criteria

may be less arbitrary than rankings based on managment's assessment of

ability (or other subjective criteria).   Workers' perception of their

jobs may improve with consequent improvements in motivation and morale.8

     The shift in power which accompanies unionization substantially alters

the task of management. The implication of these changes for productivity

is unclear. With higher wage rates and a formal grievance procedure,

there is an incentive for management to increase the effort obtained

from a given level of labor input, and to address aspects of the production

process which may have been neglected.9 The upshot is that management may
                                  —4—

respond to unionization by taking steps to improve performance. Yet

unionization may lead to reductions in productivity. Union power may be

used to protect malfeasance and build reduced work effort into the

contract. Management's ability to fire undesirable workers may be reduced

and the union contract may advance rules which restrict management's

ability to adjust to changing conditions. Instead of improving morale,

seniority rules may force the promotion of less productive workers, and

rules limiting displacement of workers may impede technological advance.

Numerous petty issues may be raised through the grievance process, resulting

in a disruption of production.

     These brief comments suggest that the effect of unionization depends

on a complex range of adjustments made by workers and management. Simply

identifying a particular change in the labor contract is not sufficient

to establish the impact of the union, or the process leading to changes

in performance. The resolution of the issue not only requires more

detailed information on organizational adjustments, but a statistical

estimate of the union effect as well.

The Empirical Model

     Empirical analysis of the union impact and associated institutional

change poses several problems of identification. The basic difficulty

lies in constructing an empirical "experiment" which isolates union!

non—union differences in productivity due to changes in the internal

operation of the enterprise. There are three principle problems. First, where

union and non—union establishments compete in different markets,   the   effect of

unionization on productivity may be difficult to separate from its effect

on prices if output is not measured in physical units0 1oreover productivity
                                  —5—

differences may arise from differences in technology if
                                                              11
union and non—union establishments produce different products.

Second, establishments may differ in productivity because of inherent

differences in the quality of management or other organizational factors

which are difficult to measure and control for in statistical analysis.

Unless controls for such "firm effects" are developed, the effect of the

union on productivity cannot be identified without assuming that the fixed

effects are independent of union status. Third, the union wage effect

gives firms incentive to recover costs by substituting higher for lower

quality workers. The implication is that the dapital—labor ratio must

be adjusted for labor quality differences in order to identify the union

impact due to organization factors. It is well known, however, that
                                                       12
measuring the quality of labor is inherently difficult.

     Each of these problems affects the measurement and identification

of the union impact. Sitailar difficulties arise in attempting to identify

how the process of unionization affects productivity in a particular

establishment. In the first instance, simply finding out what changes in

internal operations occurred following unionization is not trivial.

Information sources may include company and union documents, but insight

into the details of actual practice can only be developed through retro-

spective interviews. The process is thus observed through the perceptions

and memory of participants. Furthermore, in the context of changes

in operations over time, the presence of technological change common to

all establishments complicates the process of inferring the role of

unionization.

     The design of the empirical analysis in this paper reflects each of

the problems of identification. Case studies of six plants which change

union status are used to examine changes in operations after collective

bargaining is introduced. The problem of measuring the union impact is

studied in the context of a relatively simple model of production. Output is

assumed to be a function of the capital stock (K), the input of production

workers (L), and supervisory personnel (S). In addition, organizational

factors may influence the level of output obtained from a given combination

of the thre inputs. Principle focus in this paper is on the change

in output within a given establishment over time. In a time series

context, technological innovation is likely to lead to changes in the

methods of organization and management which improve the efficiency

of operations. Moreover, changes in the rate of capital utilization may

be an important source of variation in capital input. Assuming that

technology in the th firm is of the Cobb—Douglas form, these aspects of

production may be written as:

                             Q.it   =Ae
                                      0

where R is the rate of utilization, and a simple exponential trend has been

assumed for technological change.13 In this framework output per manhour

of production workers is given by

             ln(Q/L) = lnA + St +       a1ln(K/L).   +
                                                                     (2)

different elasticities of output with respect to the stock of capital and the rate

of utilization. This specification has found support in a variety of data sets and

will be examined here. The lack of employment data precludes extension of

the specification to the labor inputs as well.

      The traditional effect of unionization on input ratios is assumed to be captured

in changes in the capital—labor ratio and the ratio of supervisory to direct produc-

tion manhours. The effect of the union on organization factors can be summarized

     A* =                       *
as               (1 + b), where A0 can be thought as the index of organizational

efficiency following unionization. In this formulation b is the productivity

differential between the union and non—union regimes; given':the theoretical. consid-

erations examined earlier, b may be either positive or negative. If we assume that

unionization does not affect the technology of production, then the organization effect

may be introduced into the empirical model by re—writing ( 2           )   as:
             ln(Q/L). = mA + 5t + bUi +          a1ln(K/L)jt   + cz2ln(R/L)i

where        is a dummy variable which takes the value 1 if the firm's work force is

The Cement Industry Data

        Estimation of the basic model is based on establishment data from

the U.S. cement industry. The industry has a number of

characteristics which influence the structure and interpretation of the analysis. 15

Cement is a fine gray powder derived from a highly capital intensive process

in which limestone and clay (or shale) are crushed and ground, and fired to 2700°F

in a large rotating kiln to form partly fused pellets called "clinker." The clinker

is then finely ground, usually with a small amount of gypsum which controls setting

time. The cement powder produced in this process has a very low value—to—weight

ratio so that shipping costs generally preclude extensive geographic penetration by
                                     —8—

a single establishment. The result is a highly regional market structure, with

the bulk of output from a given establishment shipped within a 200 mile radius.'6

     The regional nature of the industry is reflected in th structure of collective

bargaining, where single employer agreements with substantial local negotiations are

the rule. The unionized sector is dominated by the United Cement Lime and Gypsum

Workers International Union, who represent 75 percent of the plants in the industry.17

A little over 8 percent are non—union, and the remainder are divided among the Steel-

workers, joint councils and independent unions.   In terms of employment

and compensation the cement industry is much like other

highly unionized, highly capital intensive sectors. Most tasks in a cement plant

involve operating, monitoring or maintaining large peices 01 equipment so that skill

levels range from semi—skilled operators to highly skilled machinists and electricians.

Most employment is concentrated in plants with 150—200 workers and the employment

relationship is relatively long term.18 From 1958 to 1974 the monthly quit rate in

cement averaged 0.648 percent compared to 1.910 percent for total manufacturing.1-9At

least part of the reason for extended job tenure lies in the relatively high rates

of compensation: in 1976, average hourly earnings in cement were $7.26 compared to

$5.19 in manufacturing. 20

    Perhaps, the most crucial aspect of the industry for the current analysis is the

relatively homogeneous nature of the product. Cement isessentiallya commodity pro-

duced to universally accepted ASTM specifications with very little variance from one

plant to another.21-The homogeneous nature of the product together with official product

classifications and quality standards permits comparison of output in different

establishments in physical terms. Since 1919 the Portland Cement Association has
                                       —9—

conducted an annual survey of association members which provides information on the

production of clinker, finished cement, cement shipments, and manhours for each of

the respondent firm's establishments. This survey constitutes the basic source of
                                       22
data used in the empirical analysis.

     The PCA survey provides annual data on tons of finished cement, hours of work,

plant location, annual plant capacity and, for recent years, the age and capacity

of individual kilns. The data on manhours is broken down by department, permitting

the construction of variables measuring production and supervisory or non—production

labbr input. The supervisor category includes plant management, foremen and super-

visors, clerical staff and laboratory personnel. The production category includes

workers in the quarry, the raw grinding and finishing departments, and the general

labor group. Beginning in 1973 information is available on the installation date

and "practical" capacity of individual kilns. Letting C. be the capacity of kilns

of the •th vintage, the capital stock in the ith plant in year t is defined as

                       Kit = Ext
                                   1C        O<A<l
                                                                          (4)

The adjustment parameter X reflects the effects of depreciation, obsolescence
           23
and vintage. rhe data set is completed with information on utilization and union

status. Utilization is measured as the ratio of cement production to unadjusted

plant capacity. Union status was determined by examining records from the Cement

Employers Association, and the United Cement, Lime and Gypsum Workers International

Union.

Section II: Estimates of the Union Effect

   The cement industry provides a useful empirical framework for the analysis of

unionization and productivity. The use of data on establishments producing homo—

genous output measured in physical units avoids the problems inherent in comparing

productivity in value terms. Moreover, among plants of the same vintage technology

is relativelystandardized, liinlttUe riwJ2r m1or_differene&

between union and non—union establishments. Evidence presented in Clark (1979)

shows that constraining the production process in the union and non—union sectors

to be identical does not obscure important technological distinctions and does

not affect inferences about the union effect. The evidence from cross

section data suggests the union productivity differential is about 6—8 percent

irrespective of the technology constraint. These results imply that price

and technology effects are controlled for in the choice of industry. Thus,

primary focus in the empirical work here is on the analysis of firm fixed

effects and labor quality using time series data on six establishments which

change union status.

Unionization and Firm Specific Effects

    The model specified in (   3)   assumes that the parameters of the production

function are constant across firms and over time. Even with a common set of

output elasticities, however, productivity may vary across establishments because

of differences in organizational factors. It is common in production function

analysis, for example, to attribute part of any unexplained variation in output to

differences in managerial ability.24 Differences in morale and motivation may play

a similar role. If differences in managerial ability and motivation exist, omitting

them may lead to biased estimates of production parameters, Including the

union productivity effect. Without direct measures of the organizational factors,

productivity effects specific to the firm cannot be held fixed in cross section data.

With the addition of a time series dimension, however, firm specific effects can

be introduced through assumptions about the error term. In the present instance,

we assume that the errors in C      3)   have the following "fixed effects" structure:

 We       have assumed that the firm specific component
                                                             ()    is   fixed, and that

 are uncorrelated across establishments and over time2.5 Under this specification,

 consistent estimates of (          3)   can be obtained with pooled data by introducing

 individual establishment intercepts.

           The introduction of firm intercepts controls for a particular kind of auto—

correlation in the errorsof a given establishment. Without
                                                                         separate intercepts, the
errors of a given firm will appear to be serially correlated because the mean error

(     1
          ) is   common to all observations. Even with the common mean removed, however, it

is    entirely possible that additional serial correlation will remain.            To allow for

that possibility, ( 3         )   may be estimated assuming a first order autoregressive process:


                                               £ = it—f"it                          (6)

where p is the autocorrelatjon coefficient and uj has mean zero and is uncorrej.ated

across establishments and over time. Under this assumption consistent estimates

of ( 3       )   can be obtained by covariance analysis with a non—linear
                                                                          procedure to estimate
p.


           Estimation of the basic model and its several variants is based on data

for six establishments which underwent unionization in the 1953—1976 period.26

Since some of the plants were constructed after 1953 we do not have data

on all establishments for each year. There are a total of 104

observations Or an average of 17.3 per establishment.              In order

to provide perspective Table 1 presents summary measures of productivity and its

determinants for the industry as a whole and for the before/after sample.

The before/after sample is further examined in line 2 of the table

which presents mean values from the union and non—union regimes7 The data in

considerably   younger than the industry average. The age of the plants is reflected

in the capital—labor ratio and the lvl of productivity. On average the before!

after plants are 25 percent more productive than the industry average, and operate

witha 28.7 percent higher capital—labor ratio. It should be noted that the average

level of productivity in the sample masks a good deal of diversity across plants. The

diversity appears to be more than might be explained by variation in input ratios,

suggesting the presence of firm specific effects. The data on total capacity suggest

that the before/after plants are slightly smaller than the industry average, but

are much more tightly grouped around the mean.

     The differences in average productivity and input ratios following unionization

are presented in line 2. The data reveal a substantial increase in productivity in

the union regime, while the capital—labor ratio actually falls. The fall in the

capital—labor ratio reflects the adjustment procedure which reduces K as time passes,

unless new capacity is added. In general, changes in input ratios are quite small

and the evidence suggests that the sign and magnitude of the union differential will

depend more heavily on the effect of utilization rates, returns to scale and techno-

logy changes than on variation in input ratios.


Section II:     Empirical Results

     Table ( 2   )   presents estimates of the basic model un#v several   alternative

specifications. Without parameter restrictiors, a full version of equation (3 )
                                                            of utilization is mea-

sured as the ratio of output to unadjusted capacity, which also serves as the basis

for our measure of the capital stock. Thus under the complete specification, equation 3

is almost an identity. In the absence of independent information about utilization

 (or the capital stock) restrictions on the parameters are necessary to estimate the
                                    - 14   -




union effect. One possibility is to adopt the specification that R is constant or

proportional to variations in the stock. A second possibility is to impose constant

returns to scale. This assumption is consistent with evidence from cross section

data reported in Clark (1979). Estimates under both assumptions are presented tn

table 2.

     The empirical evidence suggests that unionization increases productivity after

controlling for capital—labor substitution, technological change and individual firm

effects. In line 1 utilization is assumed to be proportional to the capital stock and

is omitted from the equation. Before correcting for autocorrelation the point estimate

of the union effect lies between 8 and 10 percent with the, higher estimate coming

under non—constant returns to scale. Except for the estimated scale parameter in

line la, the production parameters are consistent with evidence from the cross section

data. Given the dominance of the time series dimension of the data, total man-

hours may be picking up variation in the omitted utilization variable. The

apparent bias in the scale coefficient, however, is of little consequence for estima-

tion of the union effect.

     The unadjusted Durbin—Watson statistics in lines la and lb provide some indication

of the extent of serial correlation. The effects of autocorrelation are examined

assuming a first order autoregressive process in the errors. We retain the fixed

effects specification of the establishment component in the error, and constrain the

autocorrelation coefficient to be identical in each firm. We further estimate the

union effect conditional on values of the production parameters obtained in cross

section data. Initial unconstrained estimates yielded absurd values of the output

elasticities and returns to sca1e8 Fixing the production parameters transforms the

model into an equation explaining total factor productivity. In effect we regard

the time series evidence on the production parameters as relatively weak, and

have allowed the xesults from the cross section analysis to serve as dominant

prior information.

ficient    in the basic model given in line 1. Under constant returns the estimated

coefficient actually increases, while the standard error rises slightly. Minor

changes are registered in the non—constant returns results. The insensitivity of

the   results to the autocorrelation specification is not due to fixing the production
parameters.    When   the constrained version of line la was estimated without correcting
for autocorrelation, the union coefficient was .108 with a standard error
of .070.
      Autocorrelation    is a more important factor in line 2 where the utilization rate

is introduced under the assumption of constant returns to scale. Without correcting

for autocorrelation, the estimated union effect is little changed from the estimates

in line 1. Under the autocorrelation specification the estimated union effect dec-

lines to .064. Thus, allowing for autocorrelation makes the union effect more sen-

sitive to model specification and reduces somewhat the precision of estimates. In

general, however, the evidence suggests that unionization led to an increase in pro-

ductivity, with the iagnitude of the effect likely to fall in the range from 5—10

percent.

      The estimates of the union effect take into account short run variations

 in input ratios, scale, and establishment effects; trend movements in

basic variables, as well as technological change, are captured in the time trend.

 In spite of these controls, the possibility that the union coefficient reflects

unmeasured changes in the environment cannot be ignored. It is not impossible

 to conceive of abrupt changes in the environment of the firm which are coincident

with unionization, imperfectly reflected in input ratios and a smooth time trend,

and which raise productivity. The impact on productivity of any omitted

variables with the same time structure as the union variable will be compounded

 in the union coefficient.29
                                        — 17 —


     The seriousness of the omitted variable bias is not obvious. Since the plants

in the before/after sample were organized at different points in      time,   the omitted

variable   argument requires that abrupt changes in the eiiv ironment occur at di lie rent
times, and perhaps in different regions.      It seems unlikely that such changes would
happen to coincide with unionization in each instance. Nevertheless, the issue
may be examined using data on a control group which does not undergo unionization,
but is subject to other changes in the environment. As long as productivity in the

control group reflects the influence of omitted variables, comparison with the before!

after plants should give at least a rough indication of their effects. For each

before/after plant we use a control group composed of the establishments in the

region where the plant is located. The use of a regional control is consistent with

the regional structure of the industry,    but should also capture any changes in
the environment common to all firms.3°
     It is not appropriate simply to introduce     average regional productivity as a

control variable in the basic regression without some adjustments. Productivity

in the region presumably reflects trend movements in technology, as well as the more

discontinuous changes which are of principle interest here. Accordingly, we drop

the time trend from the basic model and allow regional productivity to capture both

gradual and uneven changes in the firm's environment. The results presented in line

3 suggest that the previous finding of a union effect on the order of 5—10

percent is essentially unchanged after controlling for variation in regional

productivity. With utilization excluded, the union effect under non—constant returns

is .092 with a standard error of .046; under constant returns the union

coefficient is .069 with a standard error of .043. In contrast, adding the

utilization rate assuming constant returns to scale increases the union effect

to .121 with a standard error of .029. There is little evidence of systematic

bias in the estimated union productivity effect due to omitted factors

correlated with productivity in other establishments in the region. The

region correction leaves basic conclusions unchanged.

      Taken together, the empirical evidence in this section suggests that unionization

led to increases in productivity. The direction of the union effect appears to be

quite robust, while the exact order of magnitude and precision of the estimates

depends on model specification. However, the variation in tiLe size of the effect

occurs over a moderaboly narrow range, and in general the   evidence   Is consistent

with a union productivity differential of about 7—8 percent.

Unionization and Labor Quality

      This section uses evidence obtained in case studies of unionization in the six
plants together with theoretical analysis, to gauge the extent of quality bias in
the   empirical anlaysis in section II. The estimates in table 2 fail to control for

differences in worker quality following unionization. If unionization induces firms

to hire higher quality workers, the estimated union effect may reflect quality dif-

ferences as well as any organizational changes in the enterprise. The evidence ex-

amined in this section does not address the issue of union/non—union differences in

worker quality. The more modest purpose of the analysis is to place an upper bound

on the potential bias, under the assumption thatunionization leads to an increase

in the quality of labor.

      The effect of unionization on labor quality depends on the extent of change

in the level and the structure of wages, and the technology of production. To fix

ideas, consider a cement plant prior to unionization which operates in a competitive

labor market comprised of low and high quality workers. Prior to unionization the

firm presumably has complete freedom to match workers and jobs, so that a quality

mix is chosen which minimizes cost, given technology and the structure of wages

defined in terms of quality. Unionization is likely to encourage a shift in the

quality mix. If, for example, the union contract restricts hiring to an entry job

classification with a common starting wage and establishes 1)romotion based on senior-

ity, the firm has a clear incentive to substitute high   [or lOW quality   workers.
                                          — 19 —


As long as the present value of the earnings stream of high quality workers rises,

unionization will be followed by an increase in the average quality of the work force.

      The extent of the quality increase and the resultant rise in productivity will

depend on the change in compensation and the technology of production. The relation-

ship between a change in the average wage and consequent changes in productivity

through quality improvements may be developed more formally using a model in which

worker quality enters the    production    process explicitly?1To begin,    we assume quality
affects the production process by augmenting the eFficiency oF the work           Force.   in

a   standard two input framework this may be written as:
                                     Q    = f(K,bL)                            (7)
where   Q   is output, K is capital input, and L is total hours worked. The efficiency
index (b)is a function of labor quality:
                                     b    =   g(M)                             (8)
where M represents innate characteristics (e.g. mechanical aptitude). This specifi-
cation makes clear the distinction between           the level of quality and efficiency or pro-

ductivity. While it is probably true that b is always an increasing Function of N, there

is no reason to suppose that labor quality enters every production process in exactly the

same way; the shape of g(M) is likely to differ from one siLuation to another.

        Given the production function the firm's optimization problem can be written:

                                 max Z = PQ — rK - wL

                                 K,L,N                                          (9)

                                  s.t. Q      = f(K,   bL)

We assume that r is constant, but that w is an increasing function of N. Note that

all workers are paid the same wage. Since the elasticity of substitution between

workers of different quality is assumed to be infinite a rise in w results in

 complete substitution of higher for lower quality labor.32 Thus, the level of N is

 the same for all workers.
                                          — 20 —
     The level of M the firm chooses depends on the following first order conditions:

which determines the optimal level of N.

     To illustrate the relation between productivity and an exogenous increase in the

wage we specify the following simple functional forms for ( 7 ),     (8   )   and the wage—

qi-iality function:

                                  Q   = AK(bL)                         (14)


                                 b = BM1                0< X           (15)

                                 w C±M                  0<             (16)

Using (15) and ( 16) and the reduced form expression for M from ( 13) we obtain an

expression relating b and w:

                               bB (w                                   (17)
The elasticity of b with respect to exogenous changes in w (i.e. y/) is the key par-

ameter in the system. It determines the extent to which the firm can recover the

incremental cost of an exogenous wage increase by hiring workers of higher quality.

Stability requires (X/5)<1, so that wages rise more rapidly than productivity for a

given change in N. This makes good intuitive sense, since if it were not true, the

firm could lower unit costs by raising the wage. Given stability, the elasticity Is

bounded by zero and one, since        and y are both positive. Whether the    elasticity
is close to either bound in a given situation will depend on technology and the

wage—quality function facing the firm.

     The model can be used to examine the effect of unIonization on labor quality
                                               — 21 —


and productivity. Assume that the introduction of collective bargaining raises w by

  percent. Because of contract rules and associated legal problems the firm cannot

adopt the optimal level of M immediately.33Until the workforce has completely turned

over,    the firm will have both old (pre—union) and new (post—union) workers and the
new workers will be of higher quality. Let the retat lye ef I i c lency adan tage (I .
ratio of marginal products) of new workers be given by (I + h), where
                                          Ii                                          (18)

The production process after unionization can be written

                                    Q =   AK[L        + (1 +    h)L]1                 (19)


where o and n indicate old and new respectively, and the efficiency index has been

expressed in terms of the efficiency of old workers. Unionization also has organi-

zation effects, so that

                                           A=A1 (l+d)                                 (20)

where A1 indicates organizational aspects of the firm in the non—union era, and d

is a measure of the union productivity effect. To simplify the analysis assume that

  is not affected by unionization.

        Since the production processes in the two regimes differ only by a constant,

the union and non—union observations may be pooled using a simple union dummy. In

logarithmic form we have

                               ln(Q/L) =
                                               lnA1
                                                      ÷ [d + hD(l —     )] U + 3ln(K/L)      (21)

where   L= L   + L, D =   L11/L,   and U takes on a value of one if the observations are
drawn from the union era, and zero otherwise. The coefficient on the union dummy cap-

tures both organization effects and the influence of quality adjustments. The empirical

analysis in section II assumed that hD(l —              13)
                                                              = 0 so that the union coefficient could

be identified with the organization effect (d). The magnitude of the bias induced

by the assumption is an empirical question and depends on the values attached to labor's

share (1—8), the efficiency advantage of new workers (h), and the proportion of new
                                      — 22 —


workers in the total workforce (D).
     To gauge the influence of omitted quality measures, evidence has been gathered

on all three magnitudes. The share of production workers has been estimated in

Clark (1979); for the purpose of illustration, we use a value of 0.45. Estimates

of the other two parameters have been obtained in a less straightforward fashion.

The efficiency advantage of new workers depends on the union wage effect ( ) and

on the elasticity of efficiency with respect to changes in the wage (/cS). We have

no information on yore, beyond the condition 0< I'5 < 1.   Since our purpose is to

obtain an upper bound on the quality effect, we have chose to use a relatively large

value of 0.8.

     Information on the proportion of new workers in the workforce has been obtained

through case studies of unionization in the six cement plants, the full details of

which are examined in the next section. Information in Clark (1978) suggests that the

union wage effect falls in the range from 12 to 18 percent. Both values are used in the

calculations below. To measure D in a given plant, estimates of the percentage of

the 1976 workforce who were employed at the time the plant was unionized were

obtained. The average value of D in 1976 in the six plant sample was .34 with a range

from .05 to .65. This overstates the proportion of new workers relevant for present

purposes. Since the estimated union effect is an average, D should be measured by

an average value over the sample period. If D grows at a constant rate throughout

the union era, then the estimated value at the midpoint of the period would be appro-

priate. Both the midpoint and the endpoint values will be used below.

     Table 3 summarizes the assumed values of (1—13), h and D and presents alterna-

tive calculations of the effect of quality on productivity. Columns 1 and 2 contain

estimates of the quality effect for alternative values of h. These calculations sup-

port the conclusion that changes in quality are likely to have had a small effect on

 productivity. Under the most generous assumptions, quality improvements raise produc-

 tivity by a little over two percent. Under more realistic assumptions about turnover,

the effect is close to one percent. These results suggest that while the
estimated union coefficient in the empirical analysis may be an overestimate of

the union productivity effect, the extent of the bias is quite small.

Correcting for changes in quality leaves the basic findings intact.

Section IV: Case Studies of the Union Organization Effect

     Within the framework laid out in section I unionization may lead to a variety

of changes in the labor contract and the internal operation of the firm. The empirical

evidence in section II suggests that adjustments consequent to unionization are, on

balance, productive. Yet measurement of the impact of tile union deals with only half

of the issue. We argued earlier that the union effect arises through a complex

process of organizational and behavorial change. A complete analysis requires not

only measurement, but identification of the channels of union influence.

     This section presents evidence from a series of case studies of tile unionization

experience in the six before/after plants. Through interviews with union and manage-

ment officials we attempted to identify worker and management response to changes in

the labor contract brought on by unionization. The interviews conducted were truc—

tured around the distinction between changes in contract provisions on the one hand,

and the response or adjustment to the changes on the other hand. In the first phase

of the interview we examined exisiting practices under the union contract in terms

of compensation, internal mobility (promotions, transfers), exit and entry (hiring,

layoffs), dispute settlement, technological change and work practices. The inter-

views were supplemented with evidence from written contracts. Once the procedures

governing each category were clear, respondents were asked to contrast experience

under collective bargaining with practice before unionizaton using the same categories.
                                            — 25 —


                                                             and
      The second phase of the interview dealt with responses

adjustmen1to changes in the rules.       Information was sought from both unton and

management representatives on the behavior and adjustment of both groups. However,

with management representatives, most of the second phasc was devoted to a discussion

of   changes in management procedure and personnel, whi le the un ion [Ut cry I ew- t etided

to

apparent from these discussions that retrospective interviews provide only weak
evidence on the more     subtle effects of unionization. Changes in morale and motiva-

tion, differences in work group efficiency, and the amount and quality of on —the—

job training appear to be difficult to assess without carefully designed question-

naires administered before and after unionization,and without measurement and obser-

vation of the process in question.

Changes in the Labor Contract

       Differences in the labor contract serve as necessary or enabling conditions

for a union productivity effect. The extent of change in rules governing the employ-

ment relation is an important determinant of the scope and magnitude of union in-

fluence. Analysis of the labor contract thus serves as a useful check on the plausi-

bility of the statistical analysis and the examination of adjustments in

operations. Table 4 sunarizes contract changes in the before/after plants

following unionization.

        The   evidence on the labor contract under the union and non—union regimes reveals
 a fundamental change in rules covering exit and entry, internal mobility, and dispute
 settlement with a more moderate impact in compensation. The moderate union impact
 on   compensation evident in line 1, is consistent with evidence on the union wage

 effect found in cross section data and with information obtained through interviews

 and discussions with union and management officials not connected with the before/after

 plants. The apparent increase in compensation occurs through a variety of forms,

with   direct adjustments in straight—time rates often assuming a minor role. Four of

six plants followed a policy of paying union scale, and in one plant substantial bon-

uses were used to bring earnings on par with union plants. Even where union scale on

existing jobs was paid, some change in the average wage occurred through changes in

the number of job classifications, and in re—assignment of workers to different

(i.e., higher) classifications, Fringe payments were less closely linked to the union

contract, but even here, changes more often took the form of liberalizing the existing

package rather than adding totally new benefits.

       In contrast to compensation, somewhat greater changes occured in provisions govern-

ing entry and exit, and internal mobility. In both union and non—union settings a

distinction is made between internal and external sources of labor. Under both

regimes, promotion from within was the most common form of filling job openings, but

the internal/external distinction was much looser in the non—union situation. We found

a policy of hiring "outsidet' workers into maintenance jobs in every plant, and in

three of the six plants, hiring from outside was practiced at all levels of the job

structure. Furthermore, in situations involving internal mobility the scope of manage-

ment discretion is broader and the rules governing internal movement were less explicit

and specific than is the case in the union setting. Without the union, job mobility

within the plant depended solely on the decisions of the department foreman or plant

manager, with no restrictions on the process of matching workers and jobs. The

criteria for making judgments about job requirements and qualifications were not

explicit; we found no evidence of formal evaluation systems, or attempts to communicate

management's views of ideal qualifications.

       The contrast with the union setting is quite sharp. Internal mobility under

collective bargaining is governed by a formal plant—wide job posting and bidding
procedure, with explicit criteria for selection. Contracts in some of the plants

containprovisions allowing management to take ability into account, but in practice

plant—wide seniority is the principal factor. The existence of a formal procedure
                                          — 28 —


with   explicit criteria for choosing among workers has several organizational conse-

quences. Perhaps the clearest change is the reduced role of management judgment.

In the non—union setting, the foreman (or plant manager) decided both the    criteria
for filling jobs, and who met the criteria in a specific situation.     AbIlity con-
siderations were given greater weight in the non—union setting; but there is some

evidence that personal factors also were takeninto account. Union officials and

some representatives of management generally agreed that personalities were important

in determining who was promoted, and that foremen sometimes "played favorites."

Whether such preferences came at the expense of ability, or whether personalities

were important only in choosing among people of equal ability is not clear. It is

fair to say, however, that the introduction of the union essentially eliminated

personal considerations in decisions regarding post—hiring job mobility.

       The changes in rules governing internal mobility underscore the fundamental

shift in authority and power which occurs with unionization. The limits on manage-

ment discretion are clearly revealed in line 4 which summarizes the different

methods of resolving disputes in the union and non—union regimes. In each plant

unionization was followed by the introduction of a formal grievance procedures with

outside arbitration. The grievance procedure replaced a "system" in which worker's

problems were dealt with in an ad hoc fashion. Prior to unionization, none of the

plants in the before/after sample had regular channels of communication through which

grievances or complaints could be expressed. Individuals with grievances had to

raise    them with supervisors, who heard the dispute and rendered judgernent. in contrast to
the union regime where too frequent use of the system i.s often a problem, information
from both union and mangement officials suggests that in the non—union setting few
problems were ever raised. The evidence implies that the absence of quarantees against

recrimination was a strong deterrent.

Changes in the Behavior of Workers

        For workers, the introduction of a grievance procedure and an increase in compen—
                                        — 29 —


sation   augur for adjustments of several kinds. In the interviews we sought to uncover

evidence on changes in worker morale, as well as exit behavior, including permanent

separations initiated by workers, absenteeism and subpar or disruptive work effort

evidenced in discipline problems. The evidence available through the interviews is

summarized in line 1 of Table 5 .   The table presents a statement of prior expectations

about worker/management adjustments in column 1, and evidence on observed changes

in each of the six plants in columns 2—7. Unfortunately, neither survey data or

measures of quit or absenteeism rates were obtained. As a result, the evidence on

worker behavior is relatively weak. As the summaries in line la suggest, the inter-

views revealed a decline (3) or no change (2) in the quit rate in five of the six

plants studied; in one plant quits were perceived to have risen. We found some

evidence of an increase in absenteeism, and a decline in major discipline problems.

In the main, these results are indicative of verymoderate changes in exit behavior.

It seems likely that had quits or absenteeism changed substantially, we would have

uncovered much greater awareness of that adjustment. As it stands the interviews

lead to the conclusion that reductions in turnover and other forms of exit behavior

were not a principal connection in the union—productivity nexus.

     The question of worker morale, examined in line lb, was one of the few issues

where substantial disagreement between union andmanagement representatives emerged.

In two of the plants examined, management officials felt that morale had declined

or had not changed, while union representatives perceived definite improvements. In

the four other situations, morale apparently improved in two and was not much affected

in the others. These conclusions are based on impressionistic and perceptual infor-

mation and underscore the point made earlier, that the interview format is not well

suited to the analysis of morale and motivation. Although the changes in the labor

contract provide strong prior grounds for expecting substantial changes in morale,

there appears to be insufficient evidence to confirm or disprove those expectations.

Management Adj ustments

     The introduction of collective bargaining fundamentally changes the task of manage—

ment. Managers are faced with constraints on old procedures and practices, and the

processes of negotiation and contract administration constitute a reduction of manage-

ment power. Decisions traditionally within the purview of management are often chal—

lenged as a matter of routine. The magnitude of the change which unionization entails

depends on the style of management in the non—union era. As the summar-les in line

2a suggest, in five of the six plants studied an essentially authoritarian management

was confronted by a significant shift in power and authority. Previous methods,

particularly the manner of handling and dealing with workers, were no longer viable

(i.e., were much more expensive). The evidence suggests that successful management

in the union context required new management procedures and practices. Perhaps the

most cogent description of the differences in the management process before and after

unionization was given by a plant manager who remarked:" . .   . before   the union this

place was run like a family; now we run it like a business."

     The major change in plant management uncovered in the interviews were introduced

by a new plant manager, and in some instances, new supervisors. Given the substantial

change in the nature of industrial relations, the identification of the old manager

with the non—union regime, and the likelihood that previous management was involved

in attempts to block unionization, the change in plant management is not surprising.

While re—training permitted many front line supervisors to make the adjustment to a

union regime, training was not a viable option in the case of plant managers. The

interviews suggest that a new manager was in some sense a pre—requisite for innovation

in management methods.

     In most of the before/after plants, new management meant new procedures and prac-

tices. Before the interviews were conducted, changes in management procedure could

be expected on theoretical grounds. Apart from capital—labor substitution and labor
                                       — 32   —




qualIty   adjustments, the union wage affect creates incentives for management to extract

more work effort from a given level of employees. These expectations were clearly

realized.    As line 2b reveals, the interviews uncovered changes in management
methods in all plants. The magnitude o: the change varied Iron sttuation to situation,
with a more professional, businesslike app roach to labor rd at ions by Iron t I Inc sup-
ervisors the most common adjustment. In four of the six plants we found at:temps to
increase work effort and work group efficiency primarily through    introduction ol

formal methods of organizational control. The adjustments in formal control proce-

dures took several forms. In essence, however, they amounted to a system of produc-

tion goals or targets accompanied by procedures for the review and monitoring of

performance. The evaluation often occured in newly introduced staff meetings, which

were used for communication, training, and assessment of conditions and progress.

Substantial changes in formal procedures were not introduced in all plants. Yet,

even where formal procedures were changed only moderately, the interviews suggest that

management monitored work performance and manning requirements more closely.

     Taken together, the evidence-summarized In Table 5 suggests that unionization

led to substantial changes in mangement in each of the before/after plants. Not

all adjustments noted were observed in all plants, but each plant experienced change

in a number of dimensions. The existence of a pattern of management adjustment across

plants organized at different points in time, suggests that the observed changes are

not due solely to general technical change. While technical change maybe at work

in the processes we observed, It seems clear from the interviews that unionization had

a significant independent effect. Our tentative conclusion, therefore, is that an

improvement in plant management is one of the key adjustments to unionization. These
results may be interpreted as evidence   of a modern union "shock   c[Icct." Tue Lnsti—
tutional analysis is consistent with a    broad range of earlier studies on the   effects
 of unionization and provides a partial explanation of the union effect estimated

 in setiofl II.

Section IV: Conclusions and Implications
        The examination of collective bargaining and productivity in this study

has yielded empirical results on the magnitude of the union productivity effect,

and   the case studies have provided some insight into the channels through which
unions influence productivity. The empirical evidence suggests that
unionization leads to gains in productivity of 6—8 percent. The finding appears
to   be relatively robust with respect to model specification and adjustments for

changes in labor quality and other omitted factors. While the evidence is

indicative of productive changes in operations after unionization, the precision

of the estimates suggests caution in drawing conclusions about exact orders of

magnitude.

        Similar caution applies to the institutional analysis. It is clear

from the evidence in section III, that additional information on worker behavior

is needed before definitive conclusions about the union effect may be drawn.

It   does appear that unionization leads to fundamental changes in the   labor

contract,    which may lead to changes in the behavior of workers and managers.

The available evidence, however, provides a reasonably clear picture only about

management adjustments. In most of the plants studied, we found significant

changes in the style and substance of management. Observed changes ranged from

introduction of staff meetings, to on line time standards for equipment

maintenance. These results support the conclusion that unionization significantly

alters the processes of management. Union effects which work through other

channels——i.e. exit behavior, work group effectiveness——are less subject to

analysis through interviews, and evidence from the case studies is essentially

weak and inconclusive.

      The results of the cement industry analysis have important implications
for understanding the function and impact of the union, and for questions
of   organizational change and productivity. The finding that unionization induces

an increase in productivity implies that reductions in efficiency which follow

capital—labor substitution are offset to some extent by organization effects.

Thus, the efficiency effects of the union may be much different than previously

supposed. The question of overall efficiency is, of course, much    broader      than

adjustments made by the firm, and the effect of unions on productivity is only

one aspect of the overall impact of the union. Moreover, it is likely that

the effect of unionization will be different in different situations.

       The processes of adjustment observed in the six plants seem to he coasisteut

with   evidence from the organizational behavior literatare on the determinants of

successful organizatioflal change.4 Without examples of organizational failure,

however, it is difficult to draw conclusions about the specific circumstances

and policies which lead to successful adaptation. Further research on the

process of unionization in diverse industrial settings is essential to a

deeper understanding of the problem. Not only might further study sharpen

our understanding of the operation and broad consequences of the union, hut

it may yield insights   into the general processes of organizationail   change

and adaptation and thus contribute to the development of public and private

policies to enhance productivity.

     A more theoretically oriented discussion is presented in Brown and Medoff

 4.   The capital—labor ratio is understood to be adjusted for differences in quality.
      The traditional channel of union influence is discussed in Johnson and
      Mieskowskj (1970), and in the paper by Lewis in Bradley (1959).

 5. This effect assumes the existence of unexploited opportunities to increase
     profits and is, therefore, closely related to the concept of X—efficiency
     developed by Leibenstein; see Leibenstein (1976) for an extended analysis.

 6. See Freeman (1976) for a statement of the "exit—voice" model of the union.

 7. This effect is discussed in Williamson, Wachter and Harris (1975).

 8. Research in organizational behavior suggests that there is no necessary
     link between morale and productivity. However, it does appear that
     morale problems may inhibit performance, even though high morale need
     not lead to high performance. Moreover, the link between motivation and
     productivity is quite strong, and is affected by workers' perceptions
     See Lawler (1973).

 9. See Radner (1975) for an analytical treatment of managerial behavior
     governed by bounded rationality and satisf icing which are implicit in
     this sentence.

10. This problem greatly complicates inferences based on comparison of value
     added per hour worked. Brown and Medoff (1978) have shown that if cost
     differences are fully reflected in differences in prices, the estimated
     union coefficient in their model identifies only a price effect.

11. See Brown and Medoff (1978) for an illustration of the ambiguity introduced
     by potential differences in technology.

12. The point is that observable characteristics (age, sex, race, education etc.)
     may be poor indicators of the "true" attribute of interest (e.g. mechanical
     aptitude). Thus hedonic wage equations, which are often used to capture
     quality differences, may be subject to serious bias due to omitted
     (unobservable) variables. See Brown and Medoff (1978) for an application
     of quality adjustments based on wage equations.

13.   While the Cobb—Douglas form is restrictive, evidence presented in Clark
      (1979) suggests that the form of the production function has little
      affect on inferences about the union differential in the cement industry.

21. ASTM stands for American Society for Testing Materials. There are 10
     types of cement recognized by the ASTM, each specified according to
     minimum quality standards.

22. The PCA survey covers about 80 percent of the industry. The composition
     of the overall sample varies slightly from year to year, but there appears
     to be no systematic variation in participation by region, union status,
     size or productivity.

23. The use of equipment capacity to measure the stock of capital is common
     in studies of electricity generation. See Nerlove (1963) for references
     to the basic literature.

 24. See Mundiak (1963) for a discussion of this issue.

 25. An alternative specification is provided by a variance components model.
      A key assumption of that model, however, is that the firm specific
      component is a random variable, and hence uncorrelated with other
      explanatory variables. The issue of bias is thus assumed away.

 26. One of the plants in the sample was organized following its acquisition by
      a larger cement producer. For this establishment we may be confounding
      the effects of unionization with the effects of acquisition. However,
      dropping this plant from the sample did not change the basic results studied
      in several specifications the estimated union effect was significantly larger.

27.   There is some question as to how to define union status. Many of the
      affects of unionization could conceivably be felt with the organization
      of local chapter of the union; some of the effects would follow the
      recognition of the union as the collective bargaining agent; while
      others would require the signing of a contract. In the results reported
      here, the union dummy takes on a value of one in each year following the
      year in which the local was chartered by the international, if less than six
      months elapsed between chartering and the end of the year. If more than six
      months elapsed, the year of charter also received a value of one.

28. Under the specification in line 1, for example, the capital coefficient
     was .137(.l32) and the coefficient on lnL was —.336(.l86).

29. The problem is similar to the difficulty encountered in estimating the effects of
     training programs. An important distinction is that the "treatment"
     (i.e. unionization) occurs at different points in time in the present
     instance.

30. The regional correction is only a very rough measure of the influence
     of common factors. The appropriate measure would seem to be average
     productivity of plants of similar vintage in the region. Our measure of
     regional productivity does not distinguish plants on the basis of vintage.
     The estimate of regional productivity is based on data available from the
     PCA.  In the early years it includes plants older than the before/after
     sample, and new plants in the later years. The effect is to  rasc
     the average rate of regional productivity growth.


31. This model has been-used extensively; see Ashenfelter and Johnson (1972).

32. More sophisticated models might allow for less than infinite substitutability
     between workers of different quality. The result would be to reduce
     quality adjustments.

33. It might be supposed that the firm would anticipate the inability to adjust
     immediately, and compensate by hiring workers above the optimal level.
     But the wage rule obviates such behavior, since all workers would have to
     be paid the necessarily higher wage. In addition, the higher wage would
     become the floor in future collective bargaining.

34. Greiner has suggested that successful changes in organizations involve the
     presence of compelling internal or external pressure, the intervention of
     a leader from outside the organization who acts as a catalyst, a thorough
     re—examination of operations and problem solving through shared authority
     or power. While not a reflection of the ideal in all respects, the
     unionization process in the six plants is broadly similar. See Clark (1978)
     and Greiner (1967) for a discussion of these issues.
