Drug control policy can have unintended consequences by pushing existing users to alternative,
possibly more dangerous substances. Policies that target only new users may therefore be
especially promising. Using commercial insurance claims data, we provide the first evidence on a
set of new policies intended to reduce opioid initiation in the form of limits on initial prescription
length. We also provide the first evidence on the impact of must-access prescription drug
monitoring programs (MA-PDMPs), laws that do not target new users, on initial opioid use.
Although initial limit policies reduce the average length of initial prescriptions, they do so
primarily by raising the frequency of short prescriptions, resulting in increases in opioids
dispensed to new users. In contrast, we find that MA-PDMPs reduce opioids dispensed to new
users, even though they do not explicitly set out to do so. Neither policy significantly affects
extreme use such as doctor shopping among new patients, because such behavior is very rare.

1    Introduction

    Policymakers have a longstanding interest in regulating the use of potentially addic-
tive substances. The use of many drugs is illegal, often through outright prohibition or
through age restrictions, as in the case of alcohol and tobacco. Even when legal many
substances are heavily taxed, in part to discourage use. Moreover, potentially addic-
tive drugs are often formulated in such a way as to discourage abuse. For example, the
long-acting opioid Oxycontin was reformulated in 2010 so that it could not be crushed
and snorted to deliver an immediate, potent dose. Although such policies may deter
drug and alcohol use, they have potentially harmful unintended consequences. Taxing
cigarettes encourages substitution towards higher nicotine-content products (e.g. Evans
and Farrelly (1998); Cotti et al. (2016)). When Oxycontin was reformulated, both its use
and misuse fell, but many users substituted towards heroin, and opioid-related overdoses
skyrocketed (Alpert et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019). Harmful consequences arise because
these policies not only deter new users, but they also target inframarginal users, who, if
they are undeterred, end up either bearing higher costs or substituting to more danger-
ous substances. In this paper, we ask whether substance use policies can deter new users
without causing harmful compensatory behavior.
    We study the regulation of addictive substances among new users in the context of
prescription opioids. Opioid use and misuse are major public health concerns, as re-
flected in the high and rising number of opioid-related deaths. Opioids were involved in
roughly 47,500 deaths in 2017—1.7% of the national total, an increase of 9.6% since 2016
and over 300% since 1999 (Scholl et al., 2019; Ruhm, 2018). Rising mortality, combined
with widespread use and misuse of prescription and illegal opioids, has been labelled
an opioid crisis. Policy responses to this crisis have entailed attempts to thwart prescrip-
tion drug misuse, mitigate harm, and improve access to treatment. Most state policies
have been ineffective in reducing opioid prescribing (Meara et al., 2016). An exception
is must-access prescription drug monitoring programs (MA-PDMPs), which require pre-
scribers to check state databases of controlled substance prescribing before writing an
opioid prescription. These laws reduce opioid use and, especially, tail outcomes such as


                                             1
doctor shopping (filling prescriptions from several doctors) and extremely high levels of
use (Buchmueller and Carey, 2018). However, they may unintentionally increase crime
and illicit drug use (Mallatt, 2017; Dave et al., 2018).
   In this paper we focus on a set of recently-enacted policies specifically designed to pre-
vent new users from becoming addicted to opioids. These are laws that limit the strength
and length of opioid prescriptions for new users with acute, non-cancer pain. Only two
states had such laws prior to 2011, but by the end of 2018, 26 states had passed initial
prescription limits. The typical law limits an initial prescription for acute pain to seven
days supply; prior to such laws, it was possible to write a prescription for 31 days or
longer (Davis et al., 2019). Policymakers had two specific motivations in passing these
laws. First, they hoped to limit unintentional addiction among new patients, who dili-
gently take their prescription, not appreciating the risks of developing opioid addiction.
For example, former Ohio Governor John Kasich, stated that “by setting aggressive pre-
scription limits, we’re taking big steps to prevent opiate addition from happening in the
first place" (Kasich, 2017). Consistent with this concern, observational evidence indicates
that the probability of becoming a chronic opioid user rises sharply in the length of the
initial prescription (Shah et al., 2017). Second, large initial prescriptions create a stock
of drugs available for diversion to non-prescribed users. Not all patients consume the
entire prescription and policymakers hoped to reduce diversion possibilities by reduc-
ing the number of leftover opiates. Diversion of prescriptions is considered the source
of drugs for a large fraction of current misusers (Lipsari and Hughes, 2017), and prior
research shows state policies may reduce diversion (Surratt et al., 2014). Research to date
has neither examined the effectiveness of initial prescription limits laws, nor considered
how policies in general affect opioid initiation.
   We evaluate whether state opioid policy can influence initial prescriptions, including
both the hazard and intensity of new use. We estimate difference-in-differences models
using health insurance claims data from a national commercial insurer. As our focus
is new use, our sample is restricted to cancer-free, initially “opioid-naïve" patients who
had not filled an opioid prescription in at least the prior 12 months. This focus on new
users is novel to the literature and there are at least two reasons to care about this group.


                                               2
While harm reduction among all existing users is important, reducing initiation is the
most promising avenue to improving opioid use disorders in the longer run. Second, to
the extent that opioids are addictive, it may be much harder to discourage existing users
than to prevent new use, and efforts to discourage existing users may be more likely to
induce substitution towards more dangerous illicit drug use.
      Our claims data, which begin in 2007 and run through March of 2018, offer several
advantages over previously used data to study opioid use and prescribing. Much of the
prior research that has examined the effect of state laws has used state-level aggregate
data on dispensed totals derived from DEA records or from Medicaid. It is not possible
to study new users with these data, making it difficult to examine laws targeting ini-
tial prescriptions. Recent research has also used individual level Medicare claims data.
Opioid use is common among Medicare beneficiaries, but those data give an incomplete
picture of opioid use in the United States. Moreover, Medicare data are available gener-
ally with a 2-3 year lag, which makes it hard to study effects of state initial prescription
limit laws.
      We begin by describing the characteristics of new opioid use. Every month, about 1
percent of people with no prior opioid use fill an opioid prescription. Our first finding is
that initial prescriptions are fairly short, only 6.4 days on average. Even in states without
a limit on initial prescription length, 80 percent of initial prescriptions last for 7 days or
fewer, and 91 percent are for 14 days or fewer; this is true even in the earliest years of our
data.1 As the modal law limits initial prescriptions for acute pain to 7 days or fewer, there
is therefore little scope for these laws to bite. Some laws impose tighter limits; however,
we find that even in states with 3-5 day limits, initial prescriptions are often for longer
than the statutory amount.
      Our second finding is that, nonetheless, these laws work to reduce the length of the
initial prescription. Initial limit policies reduce the probability of an initial prescription
exceeding 7 days by 20 percent, and overall the laws reduce the average length of the
initial prescription by about half a day. However, rather than reduce initial prescription
length by reducing the frequency of long prescriptions, initial limit policies in fact in-
1
    Shah et al. (2017) similarly find that 70 percent of initial prescriptions are for 7 days or fewer.


                                                          3
crease the frequency of short prescriptions; in particular, we find that the laws induce
physicians to write more prescriptions for 1-7 days. Although the laws also generate a
reduction in long prescriptions, the net effect is a 4 percent increase in the hazard of new
prescriptions, as well as a 6 percent increase in the total amount of opioids dispensed to
new patients. These results suggest that initial prescription limits are ineffective in reduc-
ing opioids dispensed to new users. One possible mechanism for these surprising results
is that physicians could interpret the initial prescription limits as signalling the safety or
acceptability of short prescriptions.
      While limits on initial prescriptions appear ineffective at reducing mean opioid con-
sumption among new users, they could still reduce low-probability events such as dan-
gerous levels of consumption or doctor shopping. We find no evidence to support this
view. Limits on initial prescriptions are not associated with reductions in the probability
of having high days supply, high daily dose, overlapping claims, or doctor shopping in
the initial spell. We caution, however, that such extreme events may take many months or
years to develop from the initial prescription, and these laws may be too recently passed
to detect effects on these outcomes. Overall, our evidence suggests that initial prescrip-
tion limits have not been effective in their goal of reducing opioids dispensed in the initial
spell.
      Although initial prescription limits appear ineffective at reducing new opioid use,
other state prescribing policies may be more effective. We find that MA-PDMPs deter
new use, decreasing the hazard of initial prescriptions by about 3 percent. However, like
initial limit policies, they have no impact on markers of dangerous use among new en-
rollees in the short run. These finding are novel to the literature, which has not considered
the impact of MA-PDMPS on new use.2 Overall, our findings suggest that initial prescrip-
tion limits may not be particularly effective for reducing new use, but that MA-PDMPs
may be even more effective than previously thought, as they reduce both new as well as
extreme use.
2
    Kilby (2015) estimates the impact of MA-PDMPs on new opioid use, but does not consider MA-PDMPs
    in particular. She finds quantitatively small effects, about 40 percent of our estimate, which is consistent
    with the evidence in Buchmueller and Carey (2018) that non-must-access PDMPs have limited impacts on
    opioid use.

2     Background

2.1   Opioid prescribing in the United States

    The focus of our study is opioid analgesics, which are prescription painkillers. Prior to
the 1990s, opioids were prescribed relatively rarely, because physicians were concerned
about addiction, and downplayed pain management. Prescribing increased in the 1990s,
when the medical community began to define pain as the “fifth vital sign" and increas-
ingly acknowledged the historic under-treatment of pain (Merboth and Barnason, 2000;
Mularski et al., 2006; Tompkins et al., 2017). Simultaneously, Oxycontin—a high dose,
extended release opioid—was launched for use in the U.S. in 1996 and was subsequently
heavily marketed as having a lower potential for abuse than existing (short-acting) opi-
oids (Van Zee, 2009).
    These two changes in the culture of pain management were followed by a rapid in-
crease in both opioid prescriptions and opioid-related mortality in the United States. In
the recent past, the United States has prescribed an exceptional amount of opioids. For
example, from 2007 to 2009 Americans consumed about 15 doses of opioids per person
per year, twice as many opioids per capita as did the second ranking nation, Canada,
and 7.5 times as many as the average European country (International Narcotics Control
Board, 2010). Opioid prescribing in the United States has declined about 10 percent from
its 2010 peak, but remains extremely high relative to other countries (Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, 2018).
    This high rate of opioid prescribing has alarmed policy makers and public health of-
ficials. It raises the possibility that individuals will develop dependence disorder, and
that a large volume of opioids may be diverted, i.e. consumed by those without a valid
prescription; indeed, 10.7 million people misused prescription pain killers in 2013-2014
(Lipsari and Hughes, 2017). The rise in opioid use is particularly alarming as it has
been accompanied by a dramatic rise in opioid related mortality. Deaths from natural
and semi-synthetic opioids (including prescription opioids) roughly quadrupled between
2000 and 2016, and deaths from heroin and synthetic opioids (such as fentanyl, which is
dramatically stronger than heroin) have grown even more rapidly (Hedegaard et al., 2017;

                                              5
Ruhm, 2018). The increase in opioid-related mortality has been so large that it has led to
an increase in overall mortality rates for some cohorts of non-Hispanic white Americans
(Case and Deaton, 2015; Kochanek et al., 2016).
      High opioid use could increase opioid-related mortality through several channels.
First, prescription opioids are potentially addictive, meaning that patients develop tol-
erance, requiring ever stronger and closer to fatal doses to manage their pain. (White and
Irvine, 1999). Second, even at low levels, opioids can be dangerous when taken in com-
bination with benzodiazepines (e.g. Xanax), a commonly prescribed class of sedatives
(White and Irvine, 1999; Jones et al., 2012). Benzodiazepines were involved in 3 percent
of opioid-analgesic-related overdoses in 2011 (Chen et al., 2014). Third, for some, pre-
scription opioids act as a gateway to stronger and more dangerous drugs such as heroin
and fentanyl, which carry a higher risk of overdose, as has been observed with Oxycon-
tin’s reformulation (Alpert et al., 2018; Evans et al., 2019).


2.2     Policy responses

      There have been several dimensions of U.S. policy responses to limit opioid prescrib-
ing and use. Our focus is on limits on initial prescriptions for acute pain and on MA-
PDMPs, two sets of recently enacted laws that we describe in more detail below. Other
policy responses include features designed to either reduce access or reduce harm asso-
ciated with use. Examples of such policies include abuse-deterrent reformulation, and
rescheduling of low-strength opioids to make them harder to obtain and refill. There
are also a host of state-specific policies that in earlier times, Meara et al. (2016) find to be
largely ineffective in reducing opioid prescribing. In addition to state-specific policies, the
CDC issued prescribing guidelines in July 2016, urging prescribers to avoid writing long
and strong opioid prescriptions (Dowell et al., 2016). Some insurers have also responded
by limiting opioid access, for example with prior authorization requirements (Dillender,
2018), as have some individual health care systems.3
      Initial prescription limits In the last few years, many states have enacted laws that

limit initial prescriptions for acute pain among new opioid users. Davis et al. (2019) de-
scribe these laws in more detail and report on the dates of implementation. Panel A of
Figure 1 reports which states have such limits in effect in each year, and Appendix Table
A.1 provides further details. As of 2006, only Missouri had such a law (which was passed
decades ago) and from 2007 to 2013 only three additional states enacted initial limits. In
2016 four more states passed initial limits, followed by 17 in 2017, and one in 2018. By
the end of 2018, 26 states had some form of limits on initial opioid prescriptions for acute
pain.4
       There are reasons to believe that limiting opioid prescriptions to patients will reduce
4
    These initial prescription limits are not among the many opioid-control laws studied by Meara et al. (2016).
    They study different prescription restrictions as well as tamper resistant prescription forms, ID require-
    ments, doctor shopping, physician exams, pharmacist verification, PDMPs, and pain clinics. Their pre-
    scription restrictions do not specifically apply to new prescriptions. As they note, only Iowa and Vermont
    imposed quantitative prescription limits during their analysis periods, which runs through 2013, whereas
    most of the laws we studied were passed in 2016 and beyond.


                                                                         7
the likelihood of problematic future opioid use. Using a small-sample survey of non-
medical opioid users, Butler et al. (2016) show how an initial medical opioid prescription
affects the hazard of future non-medical use; reported median time from initial medical
prescription to the first non-medical use was six months for misuse for non medical rea-
sons, and 18 months for use to avoid withdrawal. Barnett et al. (2017) show that patients
quasi-exogenously assigned to emergency department doctors with higher opioid pre-
scribing rates are themselves more likely to get a high-strength opioid, and substantially
more likely to engage in long-term opioid use than those assigned to low-prescribing
physicians.
   These laws are heterogeneous in several dimensions. All but one limits the days sup-
ply, with limits ranging from 3 days to 35 days. The most common limit, used in 13 states,
is 7 days. In addition to restricting prescription length in days, eight states also limit the
strength of the prescription, to a certain morphine-milligram equivalent per day (e.g. 30
or 90). Many of the laws—16—allow for exceptions based on professional judgment or
for surgical pain. We show below that the statutory limits set by these laws do not always
bind, particularly for states with very short (3-5 day) limits.
   Policymakers appear to have two specific goals for these laws, beyond a general desire
to reduce opioid addiction, overdose, and mortality. First, they hope to prevent uninten-
tional addictions, which could happen if patients dutifully comply with a long prescrip-
tion, not realizing the addictive potential of opioids. Second, they hope to reduce the
supply of opioids available for diversion. Large initial prescriptions create the potential
for diversion because not everyone consumes the entire prescription. Data from the 2015
National Survey of Drug Use and Health show that of those who reported misusing opi-
oids, 60 percent did so without a valid prescription and 40 percent obtained the drugs
at no cost from a relative or friend (Han et al., 2017). For both goals, a key question for
these policies is whether they actually reduce the total volume of opioids dispensed to
new users.
   MA-PDMPS PDMPs are state-wide databases recording all prescriptions dispensed
(within a certain class, such as schedule II-IV narcotics). PDMPs enable prescribers to bet-
ter detect drug-seeking behavior (such as a patient with prescriptions from many differ-


                                              8
ent providers), as well as potentially dangerous co-prescribing (such as benzodiazepines
with opioids). PDMPs are extremely common—every state but Missouri has one as of
July 2016—but not all states require prescribers to access the database before writing a
prescription. Buchmueller and Carey (2018) argue that prescribers rarely access a PDMP
unless they are required to do so, and they show that only MA-PDMPs have an effect on
opioid use. We therefore focus on must-access provisions of PDMPs.
      We code and date MA-PDMPs following the logic of Buchmueller and Carey (2018)
as closely as possible; while their data go through mid-2012, we extend the coding of
MA-PDMPs through 2018. We begin by using the database provided by pdaps.org, the
same source as Buchmueller and Carey (2018). This database records whether each state
has a PDMP, the date of PDMP implementation, and the rules around access to PDMP.
As the database runs through July 2016, we obtain more recent coding from the National
Alliance for Modal State Drug Laws (NAMSDL).5 NAMSDL coding is current for laws
passed through January 2018, the last month of initial prescriptions we study. We define
a MA-PDMP as a PDMP which requires at least some providers to access it in at least
some circumstances, consistent with prior research.6 Panel B of Figure 1 reports which
states have MA-PDMPs in effect in each year, and Appendix Table A.1 provides further
details. Thirty states have enacted MA-PDMP legislation by the end of our sample period;
our data thus cover the 10 states enacting MA-PDMPs studied by Buchmueller and Carey
(2018), as well as an additional 20 states subsequently enacting MA-PDMPs.



3       Data and empirical strategy

3.1      Data

      We use a comprehensive database of commercial insurance claims from a large, na-
tional insurer, with both employer-sponsored plans and Affordable Care Act Exchange
plans. Our database covers claims from January 2007 through April 2018. Every state is
5

6
    We make one exception, consistent with Buchmueller and Carey (2018). Until 2015, Vermont’s PDMP
    required access only when a patient requested a replacement prescription for one that had been lost or
    destroyed. We code this as a non-must-access.


                                                     9
represented in every month. For budgetary reasons we purchased a 20 percent random
sample of all enrollees during this period, as well as a 100 percent sample of all patients
who ever filled an opioid prescription.7 When studying new fill rates, we use the 20 per-
cent sample; when studying characteristics of opioid use, we use the second sample, to
maximize power.
      To identify opioid fills, we merged in a database containing the National Drug Code
for all prescription opioids (Prescription Drug Monitoring Program Training and Tech-
nical Assistance, 2013). This database also contains a conversion factor to put different
opioids on a common scale, morphine-equivalent doses (MED), which converts units of
a given opioid into milligrams of morphine. We measure the length of a prescription by
its days supply, and the total amount of opioids prescribed as the “morphine-equivalent
days" (MED), the product of days supply, morphine equivalent doses, and strength. The
modal opioid in the claims data is 5-mg hydrocodone, which has an MME of 1, so a pre-
scription for 7 days supply would have an MED of 35.
      Sample construction and initial spells Our analysis focuses on new users, which we
define as enrollees who fill a prescription for an opioid after at least 12 months without
any opioid fills, and who were continuously enrolled for at least 12 months at the time of
the initial fill. We limit the sample to the continuously enrolled to avoid misclassifying
new enrollees as new users. Our sample is also limited to enrollees with both prescription
drug and medical coverage. Because we require a look-back period for defining new
users, our analysis sample begins in January 2008. Finally, we exclude patient-years that
have a cancer diagnoses, because the prescription limits we study do not apply to cancer
patients.
      We are interested in how MA-PDMPs and initial limit policies affect not only the initial
prescription but also subsequent use. We therefore consider outcomes during the “initial
spell," which we define as the initial prescription and any prescriptions filled during the
subsequent 90 days. We look at the initial spell in addition to the initial prescription
7
    We obtained all records over the time period January 2007- March 2018 for a randomly chosen 20 percent
    of enrollees who appeared at least once during this time period. Some individuals are present only for
    a subset of the time period, reflecting the churn in private insurance coverage, but our sample remains
    representative of privately insured enrollees and has a potentially long panel dimension.



                                                     10
because we want to measure whether shorter initial prescriptions are offset by longer
subsequent prescriptions. We focus on 90 days because our data run through April 2018,
and the last limit on initial prescriptions in our data was passed in December 2017. Thus,
90 days allows us to study all law changes and still have two months of post-period
data following each new law. To avoid censored outcomes, we further limit our sample
to those who were continuously enrolled for at least three months beyond their initial
prescription. Appendix Table A.2 shows how the sample size changes as we impose our
selection criteria. The final denominator data consists of 6.9 million enrollees, and the
final numerator data consists of 17.3 million enrollees with at least one prescription for a
controlled substance.
      We aggregate our data to state-month cells, and conduct all analyses at this level,
weighting by the appropriate sample size. These cells give the average outcomes among
enrollees whose new use begins in the given state-month. For example, the cell California-
January-2016 reflects the experiences between January and March of all enrollees in Cal-
ifornia who initiated use in January 2016, denominated by the number of opioid naive
enrollees in California as of January 2016.
      Outcomes We construct several outcomes related to the initial prescription and the
initial spell. We start with measures of average use: days supply and days MED in the
initial prescription and the initial spell, as well as number of fills in the initial spell. We
obtain the spell-level outcomes by aggregating over all prescriptions filled within three
months of the initial prescription. For example, if a patient’s initial prescription was for
seven days and she obtained an additional seven days supply prescription after eight
days, we would say her initial spell had 14 days supply. If each prescription was for 10
mg hydrophone (with an MED of 1), we would say she had 70 days MED for her initial
prescription and a daily MED of 1.56 for her initial spell.8
      We are interested not only in standard prescription outcomes but also in extreme
events which may be indicative of dangerous use or abuse. To examine extreme out-
8
    Note that we work with MED for the initial prescription but daily MED for the initial spell. The reason for
    this is that the days of the initial spell is fixed at 90, making it easy to define daily MED. But for the initial
    prescription, the denominator would be days supply, meaning that a lower daily MED could be due to a
    strong but short prescription.



                                                          11
comes, we consider five definitions of potentially problematic opioid use during the ini-
tial (90 day) spell. The first is an indicator for greater than 90 days supply, meaning that
on average over the initial spell, the patient had more than one days supply per day. Next,
we define an indicator for greater than 120 MME per day, another measure of potentially
dangerous use. Third, we look at doctor shopping, defined as having prescriptions from
three or more prescribers, a measure of drug-seeking behavior. Finally, we look at two
measures of overlapping claims: overlapping opioid prescriptions (defined as one opioid
prescription beginning at least 7 days before the prior one ends), and concurrent benzo-
diazepine use (defined as at least one day in which a patient has both benzodiazepine
and opioid days supply). We include this last outcome because benzodiazepines and opi-
oids are particularly dangerous when taken in combination (e.g. Dasgupta et al. (2016)).
These measures largely parallel those in Buchmueller and Carey (2018), but they are less
extreme, as appropriate for our focus on new users. For example, Buchmueller and Carey
(2018) define doctor shopping as having prescriptions from five or more prescribers. We
focus on less extreme outcomes because we find very few signs of potentially danger-
ous opioid use relative to their Medicare sample, and we have more power with the less
extreme outcomes.
   Summary statistics We report summary statistics for new spells in Table 1. Our sam-
ple consists of about 10.3 million new spells. The hazard of new spell initiation is just over
0.01, meaning roughly one percent of previous non-users initiate use in a given month.
The modal prescription is written by a physician. Primary care providers write about 20
percent of all prescriptions, while pain specialist-written prescriptions are rare (at least
among new users). Dentists prescribe 14 percent of initial prescriptions, and nurse prac-
titioners and physicians’ assistants collectively prescribe less than 10 percent.
   The average initial prescription is for slightly less than one week, which foreshadows
the limited scope for these laws to affect the modal existing prescription. About a quarter
of initial spells involve more than one fill. Looking across all fills in the initial spell, total
days supply averages 10.9. This demonstrates the importance of considering a period
beyond the initial prescription; as looking just at the initial prescription, misses 40 percent
of use in the first three months. The average days MED is about 114, roughly equivalent

to taking one 5-mg hydrocodone pill every four days over the initial spell. There are few
signs of dangerous use among new users, at least in their first three months of opioid use
and relative to the Medicare opioid users studied by Buchmueller and Carey (2018). For
example, about 0.1 percent of new users have a very high daily MED, and about 3 percent
have an overlapping claim. The corresponding numbers among all Medicare opioid users
are 1.7 and 9 percent (Buchmueller and Carey, 2018).
      The summary statistics suggest that initial prescriptions are fairly short, meaning lim-
its on initial prescriptions may not bind often. We show this more clearly in Figure 2,
which plots the distribution of days supply in states and months that do not have initial
prescription limits (in unshaded bars) and in states-months with limits of 7 days or fewer
(in shaded bars). The figure shows that even in states and months without any limits,
most initial prescriptions are short. Indeed, 80 percent are for 7 days or fewer, 91 percent
for 14 days or fewer, and 95 percent for 20 days or fewer.9 Thus on their face it is unlikely
initial prescription limits will have an effect for most new users, at least unless the lim-
its are fairly tight. In Figure 3, we show further that initial prescriptions do not always
conform to the statutory limits on days supply. The figure plots, for each state with an
initial prescription limit, the share of initial prescriptions exceeding the limit (in months
when the limits are in effect, and separately in months when the limits are not in effect).
Prescriptions are more likely to be conforming when limits are in effect. However, for
states with low limits, as many as half of initial prescriptions exceed the limits; for states
with 7 days supply, 10-20 percent of prescriptions exceed the limit. These exceptions may
well be legitimate (as the laws often allow for exceptions for those with non-acute pain
such as cancer), but they provide further evidence that the laws often have limited bite.

    This figure pools surgical and non-surgical prescriptions. Even among prescriptions written by surgeons,
    long prescriptions are rare: 79 percent are for 7 days or fewer, and 95 percent for 14 days or fewer.

3.2       Empirical strategy

      Estimating equation Our goal is to estimate the effect of limits on initial prescriptions
and MA-PDMPs on opioid utilization among new users. We therefore estimate regres-
sions of the following form:


                          yst = αLimitst + βM A − P DM Pst + θs + γt + εst .                              (1)


The specification controls for state and time (month-by-year) fixed effects. Our interest is
in α and β, which give the differential change in yst among states implementing limits on
initial prescriptions or MA-PDMPs, relative to the change for control states.
      Limitst indicates if a state limits prescriptions for new opioid users to 14 days supply
or fewer. This definition excludes 7 states with a limit on the initial prescription longer
than 14 days.10 We chose this cutoff because the longer limits appear to rarely bind. (See
Figure 2.) In principle we could analyze each limit separately, but power concerns moti-
vated us to pool all limits 14 days and shorter. We consider robustness to narrower and
wider definitions of Limit.
      We define M A − P DM Pst as an indicator for states requiring at least some providers
to check a PDMP in at least some circumstances, consistent with Buchmueller and Carey
(2018). However some states require checking only in limited (such as only pain clinics)
or discretionary (such as with a suspicion of abuse) circumstances. In robustness checks,
we omit states with limited or discretionary access requirements.
      The key coefficients, α and β, have a causal interpretation if changes in MA-PDMPs
and limits on initial prescriptions are uncorrelated with other state-level changes in opioid
use. Our time and state fixed effects control for many potential confounds. The time
fixed effects, for example, control for national policies and guidelines like Oxycontin’s
reformulation and the CDC’s prescribing guidelines. The state fixed effects control for
permanent differences across states in propensity to prescribe opioids.
      Threats to identification We remain particularly concerned with two broad threats
10
     The states are Rhode Island (20 days); Hawaii, Illinois, Rhode Island, and Tennessee (all 30 days); South
     Carolina (31 days); and Maryland (strength is limited to the lowest effective dose, no limit on days sup-
     ply).


                                                       16
to our identifying assumptions. First, some states implemented packages of reforms,
so there many other law changes at the same time that PDMPs become must-access or
limits on initial prescriptions are introduced. Second, states hist hardest by the opioid
epidemic may have been most likely to implement these reforms. While our state fixed
effects control for time-invariant cross-state heterogeneity, we remain concerned about
differential trends. Specifically, we are worried that high-use states have experienced
particularly large declines in opioid use since the middle of our sample period. This
is because policy makers and physicians have become aware of the dangers of opioid
prescribing, prescribing has fallen, and it has had the most room to fall in high use states.
   We address these concerns in turn. To address the first concern, we control for MA-
PDMPs; other policies are not robustly associated with declines in opioid use (Meara et
al., 2016; Buchmueller and Carey, 2018). We also note that we end up finding positive
effects of initial prescription limits. The concern that limits are implemented along with
other legal changes would imply a downward bias in our estimate, and so, if anything,
would suggest that we have underestimated the positive effects of initial prescription
limits on opioid prescribing.
   We address the second concern in two ways. First, we estimate event study models
which allow us to explore if there are differential trends in the pre-period. We do not find
evidence for such pre-trends. This is reassuring because it suggests that slow-moving
trends in opioid use or prescribing do not drive our estimates. Nonetheless it is possible
that these tests are underpowered to detect fast-moving trend shifts that could drive both
opioid prescribing and state lawmaking. Our second test for such concerns is to examine
policy impacts on a placebo outcome, benzodiazepine prescribing. This is a valid placebo
in the sense that it is not directly affected by must-access provisions or initial prescription
limits. It is, however, arguably a proxy for opioid demand, as benzodiazepines are often
taken with opioids, benzodiazepine misuse has been growing at a similar rate as opioid
misuse, and benzodiazepine misuse is associated with similar factors (Bachhuber et al.,
2016; Lembke et al., 2018; Votaw et al., 2019). To the extent that state legal changes coincide
with changes in the demand for prescription drugs, we would expect benzodiazepine
prescribing to respond as well.

4     Results

    We begin by showing that initial prescription limits increase use on the “extensive
margin," raising the probability of receiving an initial opioid prescription among the opi-
oid naive and the total amount dispensed to opioid-naive enrollees. MA-PDMPs reduce
use on this margin. We turn to the intensive margin to show that neither policy affects the
amount received conditional on receiving an initial prescription. Next, we show that nei-
ther policy has an effect on extreme or dangerous use in the short run among new users.
Finally, we present a variety of evidence establishing the validity and robustness of our
our findings.


4.1    Extensive margin

    Table 2 reports our extensive margin estimates. The first column shows the effect on
the hazard of new use. Whereas we might have expected that initial prescription limits
simply reduce the length of written prescriptions, with no extensive margin effect, we find
that these limits are associated with a 4 percent increase in the hazard of new fills. MA-
PDMPs are associated a decrease in this outcome that is slightly smaller in magnitude,

about 2.5 percent. Both estimates are statistically significantly different from zero and
from each other.
         Although initial prescription limits therefore increase the number of new prescrip-
tions, they could reduce the total amount of opioids dispensed to new patients if they
result in substantially shorter prescriptions. In Column (2) we show that that morphine-
equivalent days dispensed to new patients actually increases following the enactment
of initial prescription limits. The coefficient, which is marginally significant (p = 0.06),
implies a 6 percent increase in the quantity of opioids dispensed.
         We further investigate the surprising increase in prescribing in Figure 4. To con-
struct the figure, we estimate Equation 1 with “filled an initial prescription for d days
supply" as the dependent variable, and plot the estimated coefficients on Limits and
M ustAccessP DM P . The figure shows large clear increases in the hazard of having a
short initial prescription induced by initial limit policies, with increases at each days sup-
ply up to seven. There are small decreases in the hazard of having a long prescription,

but these decreases are small enough that they do not nearly offset the increase in short
prescriptions. Initial prescription limits therefore increase opioids dispensed to new pa-
tients by increasing short prescriptions, without sufficiently reducing long prescriptions.
MA-PDMPs, by contrast, reduce initial prescriptions written throughout the days supply
distribution.
    Who drives this extra prescribing? In Table 3, we look at the hazard of filling a new
opioid prescription from specific types of providers. We find that physicians explain all
the response, as initial prescription limits induce a 0.073 percent increase in the hazard
of new physician prescribing—greater than the overall increase. Among physicians, pri-
mary care providers are especially responsive, as they account for seven-eighths of the
overall response (0.042/0.048) but a fifth of opioid prescribing. Physicians and, in par-
ticular, primary care providers also appear especially responsive to MA PDMPs. Other
provider types are all relatively unresponsive to the initial prescription limits.

4.2     Intensive margin

    We now turn to examine outcomes for patients who receive an initial prescription for
an opioid. In Table 4, we present estimates of our main equation, looking at character-
istics of the initial prescription (in Columns 1-3) and the initial spell (in Columns 4-6),
conditional on filling an initial opioid prescription.
    The results in Columns (1) and (2) show that both initial prescription limits and MA-
PDMPs reduce the length of the initial prescription, conditional on getting an initial pre-
scription. Initial prescription limits reduce the length of the initial prescription received
by about 7 percent, and reduce the probability that the initial prescription exceeds 7 days
supply by 20 percent. On their own, these estimates might suggest that initial prescription
limits succeed in their goal of shortening initial prescriptions. Combined with the exten-
sive margin results, however, they indicate only that the limits increased the number of
short prescriptions.
    We might have feared that prescribers or patients responded to initial prescription

                                                       21
limits with stronger or more frequent prescriptions. We do not see much evidence of such
offsetting behavior. Column (3) shows that conditional on getting an initial prescription,
limits do not significantly affect the days MED (a measure of opioid quantity). Columns
(4)-(6) show that patients also do not fill more prescriptions, obtain substantially greater
overall days supply, or greater days MED over the course of their initial spell. Thus condi-
tional on getting an initial prescription, initial prescription limits appear to have minimal
effects for the average patient—their main effect is simply increasing the frequency of
short prescriptions.
   Of course, the small average effects reported in Table 4 may mask meaningful re-
sponses in the tails of the opioid use distribution. We investigate tail behavior in Ta-
ble 5. We consider five measures of extreme use (and all measures condition on receiv-
ing an initial prescription). In Columns (1) and (2), we look at high levels of use: fill-
ing prescriptions for more than 90 days supply total, or averaging more than 120 daily
morphine-equivalent doses. In Columns (3) and (4), we look at two measures of drug-
seeking behavior: obtaining opioids from at least 3 prescribers, or filling overlapping
opioid prescriptions. In Column (5) we look at an alternative measure of dangerous be-
havior: concurrent days supply of opioids and benzodiazepines. Across all outcomes
we generally find no evidence that either initial prescription limits or MA-PDMPs reduce
dangerous use or drug seeking behavior. While some of the coefficients appear individ-
ually significant, joint significance tests show that the MA-PDMP effects are not jointly
significant, and neither are the initial prescription limit effects.

4.3     Validity tests

   We investigate the validity of our estimates in three sets of exercises. First, we show
that trends appear roughly parallel in the pre-period. Next, we conduct a falsification
exercise, showing that these laws have no impact on benzodiazepine prescribing (for the
entire population of enrollees). Finally, we show that our results are robust to alternative
ways of coding the key policies.
   Parallel trends We test for parallel trends—our key identifying assumption—by esti-
mating event-study type models. Although we have a relatively long pre-period for most
states and both policies, we have a relatively short post-period, often just a few months for
initial prescription limits, and not much longer for many states for MA-PDMPs. To show
the pre-trends along with the overall effects that underlie our difference-in-difference
models, we estimate the following event study models:

after passage, and then we pool all subsequent periods, to show the longer run effect. As
we have a longer post-period for many MA-PDMP states, we estimate separate effects in

the first and second half-years after enactment, before pooling all subsequent half-years.
If the parallel trends assumption holds, we expect γm = 0 for m < 0.
   We plot the event study coefficients in Figure 5, for three key outcomes: new fill haz-
ard, morphine equivalent days dispensed to new users, and first fill days supply (i.e. the
length of the initial prescription). We show the event study plots for the other intensive
margin outcomes in Appendix Figure A.1, for the extreme outcomes in Appendix Figure
A.2. Generally the pre-trends are insignificant, and we see little evidence of differential
trends prior to policy enactment. However, one exception is that the initial prescription
length falls in the first half prior to policy enactment, as shown in Panel E. This likely
reflects some imprecision in the exact dating of the policy, as well as possible anticipatory
behavior.
   Falsification exercise One concern with our results is that they could be driven by
state-specific changes in attitudes towards prescribing potentially dangerous substances,
or in the demand for such substances. Our parallel trends analysis suggests that such
changes, if present, would have to occur sharply around the timing of enactment of the
laws. To provide evidence against this hypothesis, we look at the impact of initial pre-
scription limits and MA-PDMPs on benzodiazepine prescribing, in the entire sample of
enrollees (rather than opioid-naive, cancer-free, and continuously enrolled). We look at
benzodiazepine use because it is not directly affected by our laws but it is arguably a
proxy for underlying opioid demand.
   Table 6 shows the results of re-estimating our main difference-in-differences model
but looking at two measures of benzodiazepine use as the outcome. Column (1) looks
at days supply of benzodiazepines dispensed per enrollee-month, and Column (2) looks
at the probability of filling any prescription for benzodiazepines in a given month. For
both outcomes, the impact of initial prescription limits and MA-PDMPs are small and
statistically insignificant.
   Robustness We examined the robustness of our findings to alternative codings of ini-
tial prescription limits and MA-PDMPs. We show the results of these robustness tests in
Appendix Table A.3. Panel A re-presents our main estimates and in Panel B we adopt a
stricter coding of initial prescription limits, only counting limits of 7 days or fewer. The

resulting estimates for initial prescription limits are generally somewhat larger in magni-
tude, although never substantially so. In Panel C, we report the results of using a looser
coding, treating all laws reported in Davis et al. (2019) as limits on initial prescriptions.
This adds another 7 states to those with limits: six which limit days supplied to between
20 and 31, and one which does not limit days supply but does limit the initial prescription
to the weakest effective does. Consistent with our expectation that looser limits are less
likely to bind, we find that under this alternative coding, limits on initial prescriptions
have an even smaller impact on days supply, and we continue to find slight offsetting
effects later in the initial spell, resulting in higher daily MED.
    We also considered an alternative coding of MA-PDMPs. Our baseline defines MA-
PDMPs as those which require at least some providers to access the PDMP in at least
some circumstance. As Buchmueller and Carey (2018) note, the weakest such PDMPs
require providers to access only in limited (e.g.for Methadone prescriptions) or discre-
tionary (e.g. only when the provider suspects abuse) circumstances. We therefore re-
estimated our models assuming a stricter definition of must-access which treats such lim-
ited or discretionary requirements as non-must-access. The alternative coding and dating


                                                     27
of MA-PDMPs may be seen in Appendix Table A.1.
      The new difference-in-difference estimates are in Panel D of Appendix Table A.3.
This alternative coding of MA-PDMPs produces very similar estimates, in part because
many of the states with limited or discretionary access requirements subsequently passed
stricter must-access requirements, making the laws highly correlated.



5       Mechanisms

      It is perhaps surprising that initial prescription limits increase the hazard of initial opi-
oid use, and that MA-PDMPs reduce it.11 In this section, we discuss the possible mech-
anisms generating this result. We caution that this discussion is speculative as we are ex
post rationalizing a surprising result.


5.1       Explaining the initial prescription limits results

      We consider three possible mechanisms for the finding that initial prescription limits
increase the hazard of initial prescriptions. Our leading explanation is that the limit acts
as a reference point for prescribers, signalling a safe or acceptable level, and therefore
increasing prescribing below that level. We rule out two alternative explanations: that
compensatory behavior such as more refills by patients or providers ends up undermin-
ing initial prescription limits, and that low out-of-pocket prices for shorter prescriptions
explains the higher rate of observed fills in the claims data.
      The most likely mechanism that we believe explains these results is that initial pre-
scription limits act as reference points. The hypothesis here is that physicians, who have
recently been exposed to many warnings urging caution in opioid prescribing, see a law
with a limit of 7 days supply and come to think that 7 days is relatively safe or socially ac-
ceptable. Thus they end up writing a 7 day supply for a patient on the margin of receiving
a prescription, who would otherwise receive no opioid. This reference point hypothesis
does not necessarily imply that some physicians increased their prescribing immediately
11
     It was surprising to us; we initially hypothesized initial limit policies would reduce the length but not
     frequency of new opioid use.


                                                       28
when states passed these laws. Rather, these laws were passed in a context of falling opi-
oid prescribing and rising skepticism about opioids. This hypothesis implies only that
initial prescription limits could reduce the decline in prescribing.
     The reference point hypothesis is consistent with several features of the data. First,
it implies that initial prescription limits increase only prescriptions perceived as safe, i.e.
short prescriptions, which is what we see in the data. It is also arguably consistent with
the effect being concentrated among primary care providers, who may need to keep track
of many different prescribing guidelines, and may therefore especially rely on heuristics.
Third, it is consistent with the non-immediate extensive margin response to the limits
evident in Figure 5, the event study figure, as a reference point would likely take time to
develop.
     Other plausible mechanisms do not fit the data as well. One possible way for initial
prescription limits to raise opioid dispensed to new users and in general is through com-
pensatory behavior. For example, given a short initial prescription, patients might seek or
physicians might write stronger prescriptions or more subsequent prescriptions. We find
no evidence for that view, as the strength does not increase and neither does the number
of prescriptions in the initial spell.12
     Still another possibility is that initial prescription limits increase initial use by chang-
ing the number of filled prescriptions rather than the number of written prescriptions. To
understand this hypothesis, note that we only observed filled prescriptions in our claims
data, not unfilled prescriptions written by physicians. If initial prescription limits induce
physicians to write shorter prescriptions that are cheaper for patients, then perhaps we
observe more fills because there are fewer unfilled, expensive prescriptions.
     Although at first this seems a potential explanation, we find this mechanism implau-
sible because there are not substantial cost differences between short and long prescrip-
tions. Appendix Figure A.3 shows that the copay per days supply of a given drug actually
declines in prescription length, so longer prescriptions are cheaper on a per day basis.13
12
   We also looked at whether initial prescription limits increased the number of pills per prescription, to
   facilitate stretching the prescription out. Our (unreported) estimates indicate that they do not.
13
   Every drug claim in our data records a copay, which we interpret as the total out-of-pocket cost to the
   patient of filling the prescription.



                                                    29
The total copay (not per days supply) increases with days supply, from about $6 for a 7
days supply to about $10 for a 20 days supply. Extremely tight liquidity constraints might
suffice to keep prevent some patients from filling a 20 days supply but not a 7 day sup-
ply. We think it unlikely that this extra $4 would be decisive, however, because we are
studying commercially insured patients who likely have some liquidity, and because we
expect that patients seeking an opioid for acute pain are unlikely to be deterred by a few
dollars.


5.2   Explaining the MA-PDMP results

   We find that MA-PDMPs reduce prescribing to new patients. We hypothesize two
possible mechanisms for this result. First, MA-PDMPs create several fixed costs of pre-
scribing opioids even to new patients, because they require prescribers to register with
the system and log each prescription, and generate a sense that the prescribers actions are
being scrutinized. Second, MA-PDMPs inform physicians that opioids are more danger-
ous or more frequently abused than they had believed, by showing them the frequency
with which patients engage in doctor shopping.
   Although we cannot fully separate these mechanisms, we find the fixed cost of pre-
scribing mechanism more plausible. This hypothesis is consistent with the evidence in
Buchmueller et al. (2018), who find that when Kentucky introduced its MA-PDMP, opi-
oid prescribing fell, and many low-volume prescribers stopped prescribing entirely, rel-
ative to a control group of Indiana prescribers. Buchmueller et al. indicate that a likely
reason for this extensive margin response is that Kentucky’s must-access provisions re-
quired prescribers to register with the database, creating a fixed cost of prescribing any
opioid. On the other hand, we think it is unlikely that MA-PDMPs informed prescribers
about the general dangers of opioid prescribing. Among new patients, our evidence sug-
gests that opioid are rarely misused, at least in the short period we follow in this analysis.
Prescribers would have had to have very low priors on the probability of misuse for this
information to push them to prescribe less.

6    Discussion and conclusions

    In response to the opioid epidemic, many states have now passed laws limiting the
length of initial opioid prescriptions written for patients with acute pain. Policy makers
hope that these laws reduce the quantity of opioids dispensed to new users, to prevent
unintentional addiction and cut down the stock of opioids available for diversion. We in-
vestigate the effects of these limits using difference-in-difference models and a sample of
new opioid users derived from claims data of a large commercial health insurer. Our find-
ings suggest that these laws have not achieved their goal. Although they are effective in
the narrow sense that they reduce the length of the initial prescription, they are less effec-
tive in reducing overall opioid dispensing to new users. We find that initial limit policies
induce a greater number of initial prescriptions, resulting in more opioids dispensed to
new users. By contrast, MA-PDMPs are effective in reducing opioids dispensed to new
users in terms of days supply (as well as reducing the extreme outcomes they were pri-
marily intended to target): they reduce the hazard of initial prescription as well as the
length of the initial prescription, as expected, and we do not observe an increase in the
subsequent number of prescriptions.
    Our results have implications for policy makers hoping to slow the rate of new opioid
use. First, initial prescription laws may be too narrowly targeted, or allow too many ex-
ceptions to be effective. On most measures these laws do not appear to reduce use, and so
it is unlikely that they are preventing development of addiction disorders or dependence.
Second, MA-PDMPs may be a more effective tool even at reducing initial prescriptions.
Thus it may be worthwhile for future research to examine implications of further modifi-
cations within MA-PDMPs, such as integration with electronic health records.
    However, our results are subject to at least two limitations. First, our sample con-
sists of commercially insured patients, thus we are not able to claim representativeness of
results for the population as a whole. However, we believe our focus on commercially in-
sured population is a valuable complement to the existing literature, especially because it
encompasses more age groups affected by high opioid overdose mortality, relative to the
more-often-studied Medicare population. Second, because we study laws which were en-


                                             31
acted only recently, we are unable to examine outcomes beyond about three months after
the initial prescription. It may be that initial limit policies reduce adverse outcomes at a
greater time horizon; the laws likely aim to reduce misuse at much greater time horizons.
   Our results may have broader implications for substance use policy. We found that
a policy that explicitly targeted new use was not effective and had negative unintended
consequences, but a policy that raised the cost of prescribing has desirable effects beyond
the intended ones. We speculate that, in general, limits on new use or overall use are
unlikely to be an effective tool. Such limits are only appealing for substances whose
harms and benefits are ambiguous. But it is in exactly that situation when a limit may
signal a safe or acceptable level, generating unintentionally higher usage. Other policies
such as explicit requirements for step therapy may be more effective, as may be policies
that raise the cost of prescribing.

Notes: Table reports the effective date of states’ limits on initial prescriptions and of MA-PDMP laws. For
states with limits, we report the maximum allowed days supply (if limited) and any other limits on the
prescription (if any). We note ambiguities in the dating of MA-PDMPs and provide alternative dates where
such ambiguity exists. a PDMP requires access only if providers have a reasonable suspicion of abuse. b
Only pain clinics must access. c Initial PDMP required access only with a reasonable suspicion of abuse;
access laws later strengthened. d Only methadone clinics must access (until 12/2015). e Until 5/2015, access
required only for patients reporting their prescription was lost or destroyed.

Notes: Table shows how our sample size changes as we impose our sample restrictions. The 20 percent
sample is a random sample of all enrollees, and the 100 percent sample consists of all enrollees who filled a
prescription for at least one controlled substance.

     Notes: “DS" stands for days supply, and “MED" is morphine equivalent doses. Hazard rate and extreme outcomes are multiplied by 100. Table
     reports estimates of the coefficients on indicators for “initial prescription limits" and “must access PDMPs", obtained from estimating OLS regressions
     of the indicated variables against policy indicators, state fixed effects, and month-year fixed effects. In Panel A we use our baseline coding of the
     policies, treating limits for 14 days or fewer as effective. In Panel B we code initial prescriptions only if they are for 7 days or fewer. In Panel C,
     we use a loose coding of initial prescription limits that treats all limits as effective. In Panel D we use an alternative coding of must-access PDMPs.
