                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses a new administrative dataset of students at a large university matched to courses and
instructors to analyze the importance of teacher quality at the postsecondary level. Instructors are
matched to both objective and subjective characteristics of teacher quality to estimate the impact of
rank, salary, and perceived effectiveness on grade, dropout and subject interest outcomes. Student
fixed effects, time of day and week controls, and the fact that first year students have little information
about instructors when choosing courses helps minimize selection biases. We also estimate each instructor's
value added and the variance of these effects to determine the extent to which any teacher difference
matters to short-term academic outcomes. The findings suggest that subjective teacher evaluations
perform well in reflecting an instructor's influence on students while objective characteristics such
as rank and salary do not. Whether an instructor teaches full-time or part-time, does research, has
tenure, or is highly paid has no influence on a college student's grade, likelihood of dropping a course
or taking more subsequent courses in the same subject. However, replacing one instructor with another
ranked one standard deviation higher in perceived effectiveness increases average grades by 0.5 percentage
points, decreases the likelihood of dropping a class by 1.3 percentage points and increases in the number
of same-subject courses taken in second and third year by about 4 percent. The overall importance
of instructor differences at the university level is smaller than that implied in earlier research at the
elementary and secondary school level, but important outliers exist.

I. Introduction



       Teaching is the central task colleges and universities perform for students. Policy

administrators often emphasize teaching as the key determinant to a college student’s

academic experience and successful transition into the labour force. Many university and

college mission statements declare that graduates should leave with strong analytical

abilities, communication skills, and be primed for fulfilling careers. Students themselves,

on the other hand, often complain colorfully in teaching evaluations about how

ineffective some instructors have been in helping them meet these goals. “I would rather

eat glass,” for example, is one student’s response to whether he or she would take one of

our (anonymous) colleague’s courses again.        As post secondary school enrolment

continues to increase along with tuition, colleges and universities face renewed demands

for better teaching and student experience. This paper analyzes the extent to which

teaching matters to students’ academic achievement and course selection, and whether

observable teacher characteristics can predict these outcomes.

       At the primary and secondary school level, the literature on the effects of teacher

quality and how to measure it is extensive. Starting with the Coleman report in 1966,

many have argued that teacher quality matters little and that families and peers are far

more important in determining test score and education attainment outcomes. Coleman

found little evidence that primary or secondary teachers’ subject expertise (measured by

test scores and college performance), completion of advanced degrees, or experience

relate to students’ subsequent performance. Several more recent meta-analyses, however,

suggest that teacher quality does in fact lead to higher test scores, but the mixed




                                            1
conclusions across studies may indicate that the size of the influence may depend on the

circumstance (Hedges et al., 1994).      Studies that examine the relationship between

teacher quality and longer-run outcomes, such as earnings, find more consistent evidence

that teacher quality matters (e.g. Card and Krueger, 1992, 1996). Rivkin, Hanushek and

Kain (2005) also point out that teacher quality may differ in many ways not captured by

observable qualifications or experience. Test score improvement differs substantially for

students with different teachers, but in the same school and grade. Rivkin, Hanushek and

Kain, and Rivkin conclude that although explanations for these differences are not readily

captured by common measures of teacher quality, they nevertheless indicate teachers play

an influential role. Jacob and Lefgren (2005) find some support for this using subjective

principal assessments of teachers – principal evaluations of the best and worst primary

school teachers predict future student achievement significantly better than measures of

teacher experience, education, and actual compensation.

       Research about the connection between teacher quality and student outcomes at

the post-secondary level is virtually non-existent. A few studies focus on the effect of

particular types of graduate assistants, but these studies rely on relatively small samples

and do not have much information on student background. For example, Borjas (2000)

analyzes the impact of foreign teaching assistants on economics students’ performances

at Harvard. More recently, Ehrenberg and Ziang (2005) examine the effects of adjuncts

(part-time faculty) on student dropout rates using institutional-level data from a sample of

U.S. universities. They find a negative relationship between student persistence and

adjunct usage, although they cannot rule out this could be driven by the tendency for

schools with higher proportion of adjuncts to also be more likely to have students on the




                                             2
margin of dropping out. The most closely related study to this paper’s is by Bettinger

and Long (2004, 2005), who estimate from an administrative dataset of public four-year

universities in Ohio the effects of adjunct professors on course selection and dropout

rates using year-to-year and class-to-class variation in first year instructors.       They

estimate that adjuncts have very small positive effects on students’ picking similar

subject courses in subsequent years (relative to full-time faculty), but adversely increase

the likelihood that students dropout in the second year.

       This paper contributes to the literature about the importance of teacher quality in

several ways. It focuses on the effects of teacher quality at the college level. Previous

studies usually look at grade-school teachers or measure teacher quality from basic

instructor characteristics, such as experience, salary, and career status. Our paper uses

both objective and subjective measures of teacher quality. We estimate average effects

from ending up with a first year college instructor who is an adjunct professor paid part-

time to teach, a lecturer paid full-time to teach, a tenure-track or a tenured professor. We

also estimate effects from ending up with an instructor that is highly paid, or that tends to

rank high or low in student responses to teacher evaluations.             Including teacher

evaluations in our analysis allows us to explore Rivkin et al.’s suggestion that observable

instructor differences do not correlate with student achievement because they do not

correlate with other, less tangible, measures of teacher quality that matter.           Our

identification strategy also differs from earlier studies. First-year college students take

many courses taught by a variety of instructors, and many end up with different

instructors teaching the same course because of differences in timetables scheduling or

because of year-to-year instructor changes. This set-up facilitates the use of course and




                                             3
student fixed effects so that we can estimate whether differences across a student’s first

year instructors correlate with differences in her corresponding course or subject-related

academic achievement.     We also estimate each instructor’s value added and the variance

of these effects to determine the extent to which any teacher difference matters to short-

term academic outcomes.

       Using administrative data from a large Canadian university between 1996 and

2005, our findings suggest that whether an instructor teaches full-time or part-time, does

research, has tenure, or is highly paid has no influence on a college student’s likelihood

of dropping a course or taking more subsequent courses in the same subject.

Interestingly, these traits are also uncorrelated with an instructor’s perceived

effectiveness (evaluated by students at the end of a course and averaged over ten years).

Subjective teacher evaluations perform much better in reflecting an instructor’s influence

on students compared to objective characteristics such as rank and salary. This influence,

however, is smaller than that implied of elementary and secondary school teachers in

earlier research.   A one standard deviation increase in an instructor’s perceived

effectiveness decreases the likelihood of dropping a class by about 1.3 percentage points

(compared to a course dropout rate of 9 percent). The same increase in perceived

effectiveness is also associated with an average increase in the number of same-subject

courses taken in second and third year by 3.0 percent of a standard deviation. The effects

are similar among males and females, science and non-science majors, but they are

notably more pronounced among students with relatively poor high school grades.

II. Data



       The study uses student and instructor administrative data from a large Canadian

university. The data cover the Fall and Winter school year periods between 1996 and

2005. We focus on the 41,402 students that entered into a full-time undergraduate Arts

and Science program, and were 17 to 20 years old on September 1 in the year of entry.

Full-time status means that all students were initially enrolled in courses offering credits

that sum to at least 3.5.    A typical student must attain 20 credits to complete an

undergraduate degree.



A. Student Data



       The raw student data come in four files. The Enrolment File contains student

application information, including gender, date of birth, mother tongue (English, French,

or Other), citizenship, entering program of study, and high school grade average. The

High School File contains more detailed secondary school transcript information,

including specific courses taken and corresponding grades, as well as high school

identifiers. High school data are missing for some out-of-province students and we

restrict our sample to the 36,144 students with non-missing high school grades. The

Registration File records registration status at the start of each Fall and Winter term

between 1996 and 2005. This file indicates the number of credits a student is enrolled in,

financial status with the university, whether in good standing (which generally means not




                                             5
on academic probation, enrolled in a full-time program with fees paid), cumulative and

current Grade Point Average (GPA), program of study, and graduation status. The

Course File contains information on courses enrolled in and credits received for each

year on September 1, November 1, January 1, March 1, and the most current status. An

advantage of this file is that it allows us to match to courses that students first enrolled in

before their first day of class, and regardless of whether they completed the course or not.

The Course File also includes course section information and final grade received.

       The first set of columns in Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for our

population of first-year students. The means are typical for undergraduate students in

Canada. Age at entry is 18.6, a majority of students that enrol are female, and high

school grade averages are tightly distributed around the mean of about 85 percent.

Annual Fall registration status shows that about 10 percent of our first-year students in

our sample did not continue to register into the Fall of their second year of the program.

The graduation rate among those who started before 2000 was 78 percent. One third of

all students report a mother tongue other than English or French, and 10 percent are of

Asian citizenship. Program at entry is almost evenly split between Science, Social

Science, and undeclared.



B. Course Data



       Some students in first year take uncommon courses or upper year courses.

Column 2 of Table 1 shows descriptive classroom statistics for all 1,029 courses taken by

at least one first year student over the 9 year period. Course selection, however, is




                                              6
concentrated among large first year introductory classes. These 47 largest courses, with

average annual enrolment sizes of 200 or more make up 78 percent of a student’s

curriculum, on average. Appendix Table A1 lists these courses and their characteristics.

We focus our main analysis on these core introductory courses to ensure the main results

are not driven by particularly small or upper year courses, and for computational reasons.

Appendix Table A2 shows that the main results remain virtually unchanged when

including all classes.

       Many courses are divided up each year into multiple classroom sections. We

match course sections to course timetables, drop evening classes that begin after 5PM,

and include time of day controls in the analysis: whether a class ever begins before

10AM, after 3PM, on Monday, or on Friday.



C. Instructor Data



       Instructor evaluations are taken near the end of semester in each class. The form

is anonymous and identical across all Arts and Science courses. The question that

administrators focus on most for tenure decisions and teaching review are the teacher

effectiveness question: “All things considered, this instructor performs effectively as a

university teacher” and the retake question, “Considering your experience with this

course, and disregarding your need for it to meet program or degree requirements, would

you still have taken this course?” The effectiveness question is on a 7 point scale,

ranging from 1 (extremely poor) to 7 (outstanding). Means are generated for teacher-

course cells. Across 1,852 first year instructors, the ‘mean of the classroom mean’ for




                                            7
effective overall, is 5.6, with a standard deviation of .60. The 25 th percentile instructor

and the 75th percentile instructors differ by almost exactly two standard deviations (5.2

versus 6.2).

       Variation around the mean of the instructor effectiveness measure is fairly

narrow. Most students give evaluation ratings of 4, 5, or 6. Another way to measure

subjective instructor quality is to look at frequency of extremely poor or good ratings.

The average fraction of students giving an instructor an overall effectiveness rating of 1

or 2 is 5.5 percent, with one unfortunate large-course instructor receiving 1 or 2 ratings

by 46 percent of his or her students. The average fraction of students giving an instructor

the highest rating in effectiveness is 25.6 percent, with a high of 91 percent and a low of

0. The mean of the fraction of students that say they would take the course again is 67.8

percent, with a standard deviation of 15.4. We call this variable the retake rate. The 25th

percentile instructor has a retake rate of 51 percent, while the 75th percentile instructor

has a rate of 80 percent.

       The instructor evaluation data include the name of the instructor, the

corresponding course, section, and year, the number enrolled in the course and the

number who filled out the forms. In a few instances, more than one instructor co-taught

a section of a course. In these cases, teacher characteristics are averaged over both, and

the pair is counted as one ‘instructor’.

       We use historical university course calendars to match an instructor’s name to his

or her corresponding position. We use an instructor’s most frequent position over the

nine year period to create an indicator variable for 1) whether an instructor is a lecturer,

employed full-time primarily to teach (31 percent), 2) whether an instructor is an




                                             8
assistant or associate professor, employed full-time and expected to do research (18

percent), 3) whether an instructor is a full professor, with tenure (27 percent), or 4)

whether an instructor falls into an other category (24 percent). We call this category

‘part-time’ because it mostly includes graduate students and adjunct professors.        In

addition to information about instructor position, this university also publicly discloses

annual earnings for employees paid more than $100,000. We use this data to create a

variable (called ‘top salary’) to indicate what years an instructor earned $100,000 or

more, calculated in 2006 real Canadian dollars using Statistics Canada’s Consumer Price

Index.

         Interestingly, instructor type and salary are largely unrelated to perceived

effectiveness. Figure 1A shows the distributions of mean perceived effectiveness across

instructors in large first year courses by instructor type.      The average perceived

effectiveness among lecturers, junior and full professors are similar (5.8, 5.6, and 5.6

respectively). Part-time instructors tend to receive lower evaluations (the mean is 5.3),

but the variance of subjective quality within each type remains high. Figure 1B shows

that the distributions of mean perceived effectiveness measure by income category are

also similar.




E. Outcomes Data



         Column 4 of Table 1 shows outcome data categorized by student and first year

class. This is our baseline dataset used for in the analysis. Most classes taken in




                                            9
freshman year last two semesters and are worth 1 credit. About 15 percent of courses are

Fall semester courses and another 15 percent are Winter courses, worth .5 credits.

Students take, on average, 4.5 course credits. As students specialize in higher years, the

average number of upper year courses in the same subject as the first year course

declines, while the standard deviation increases.

         Unlike standardized test scores often used in primary and secondary teacher

quality studies, college course grades as outcomes are problematic because they may be

adjusted by the instructor to normalize across sections or even to encourage better teacher

evaluations. We include grade outcomes for interest, but focus instead on whether a

student drops a course and whether a student enrols in subsequent courses in the same

subject.

         Across all large classes, 9.1 percent initially enrol by September 1 in a given

school year but cancel before receiving a final grade. Dropping a course is significantly

associated with short and long term academic achievement. Every full-year course

dropped is related, on average, with a 0.5 decline in GPA among courses completed that

year. Dropping a course also leads to longer completion times. Each dropped first-year

course is associated with a 7 percentage point lower probability of spending at least four

years in college and a 12 percentage point lower probability of graduating within five

years.     Students themselves choose whether to dropout so that, more likely, an

instructor’s perceived effectiveness may influence the dropout rate rather than the other

way around.1


1
  It is possible that an instructor’s evaluation (averaged over the 9 year period) could be worse were
students allowed to evaluate instructors before dropping out. In one extreme case, all disgruntled students
drop, leaving end-of-course evaluations equal and positive across courses with large and small dropout
rates. The difference between end-of-class and initial class mean evaluation, however, is likely to be small


                                                    10
        We also examine how various instructor qualities affect subject specialization.

The administrative data used in this paper does not measure well a student’s program or

choice of major, but the number of subject-courses enrolled in is strongly related to these

variables. To major in Economics, for example, a student is expected to complete three

(typically out of four or five courses) in second year in this subject, after completing

introductory Economics in first year. Program requirements in other subjects are similar.




III. Regression Methodology



        The main analysis uses data at the student-by-course-section level. Consider the

outcome of interest, yiktps , for student i , in course k , in year t , with instructor

(professor) p , in section s . We decompose yiktps by the following:




(1)      yiktps Qp 
                      X kts i k iktps ,




where Qp is a measure of subjective or objective teacher quality for instructor p , X kts

are time of day and time of week controls, i and k are student and course fixed effects

respectively, and iktps       is the statistical error term.         All standard error estimates

incorporate residual clustering grouped by instructor.

since most students finish and the difference in perceived effectiveness between dropouts and non-dropouts
is probably small. Even if it were not, we simply estimate whether variation in perceived effectiveness,
measured by students who remain in class, correlates with any academic achievement. This is an empirical
question, and one possibility explaining a weak correlation could be because of this type of measurement
error from missing evaluations.


                                                   11
       We are interested in estimating , the average impact from being taught by an

instructor whose quality differs by one unit of Qp . Course fixed effects account for

course specific outcome differences, so that we are identifying off the within-course

variation. The dropout rate for introductory Calculus, for example, is higher than the

dropout rate for Psychology and Calculus instructors tend to receive worse evaluations

than Psychology instructors.

       The key identification strategy for estimating  is to use instructor quality

variation across each student’s set of first year classes. Student fixed effects absorb

tendencies for some types of individuals to enrol in particular sets of classes or take

classes with particular types of instructors.    A remaining bias may arise if these

tendencies are not equally weighted across all courses – for example, if students who

major in Economics (and are less likely to drop economics courses) care about taking the

introductory course with a highly ranked instructor, but care less about who their

instructors are in other courses. We focus on first year courses to reduce the likelihood

of this behavior. Incoming first year students are less likely to select classes based on

instructor because little is known about instructors when selecting courses before starting

university, and instructors are often not listed in course calendars. Time of day and week

controls also help remove a possible correlation with certain types of individuals

preferring to attend or teach classes early or late in the day or preferring to avoid classes

taught on Mondays or Fridays. Individual fixed effects control for student-specific

selection selection behavior typical across all courses.




                                                12
IV. Regression Results



        Table 2 presents our main results. In column 1 of the first panel, we regress an

indicator for whether a student dropped a course on year fixed effects, course fixed

effects, and perceived instructor effectiveness (averaged over all student evaluations

recorded between 1995 and 2004). The estimated standard errors account for clustering

of residuals by instructor. The sample includes first year students between 1995 and

2004 initially enrolled in large first year classes.

        A student with an instructor who receives an average perceived effectiveness

evaluation of 4 is 1.3 percentage points more likely to drop a course compared to taking it

with an instructor who receives an average evaluation of 5 (about a 2 standard deviation

difference in instructor quality). Adding student fixed effects in column 2 and time of

day and week controls in column 3 does not change the point estimate very much, which

is expected, since few first year students likely choose courses based on its instructor. An

instructor’s experience and faculty position are insignificantly related to whether students

drop a course. Students taught by a lecturer, hired full-time to teach, are 0.8 percentage

points less likely to drop a course than if taught by research faculty (mostly full-time

professors). We cannot reject the possibility that course dropout rates are unrelated to

lecturer, faculty, or salary status. However, even conditioning on instructor rank in

column 7, students are significantly more likely to cancel a course if their instructor tends

to rank poorly on perceived effectiveness.

        Panel 2 of Table 2 uses the number of same-subject courses taken in year 2 as the

outcome variable. We use this variable as a proxy for a students’ interest in specializing




                                               13
in a subject that corresponds with a first year introductory course. The results suggest

that subjective and objective instructor qualities have minimal influence on subject

specialization. From column 3, a two standard deviation increase in perceived instructor

effectiveness increases the number of courses taken in second year in the same subject by

0.03 courses – 3 percent of the outcome variable’s standard deviation. Instructors paid

high salaries (more than $100,000 in 2005 Canadian dollars) slightly decrease the

likelihood of taking more subject courses.                All estimated instructor quality effects

combined in column 7 are insignificantly different from zero.

         Table 3 shows the same regression specification in column 7 of Table 2, but also

includes a wider set of course and subject-related outcomes. Column two indicates

students with instructors that tend to receive better evaluations also receive significantly

higher grades, on average. Of course, one explanation is that instructors that grade easier

may tend to receive better evaluations. We cannot rule out this possibility and, thus, do

not place much emphasis on the grade outcome results.2 Students taking classes with

lecturers and younger professors receive a final grade about 1.5 percentage points lower

than students taking classes with full professors. This estimate may only reflect the

possibility that lecturers and younger professors tend to grade students worse. None of

the subsequent subject grade or subject course selection outcome variables in second or

third year are significantly related to the observed instructor characteristics. This is also

true for year 2 and year 3 subject credits received. Receiving a subject credit requires

both enrolling in a subject-related course and passing it.


2
  We also used Heckman’s two-step consistent estimator with year fixed effects and without individual
fixed effects to account for selection into the grade regression samples (which depends on enrolling in a
course and completing it). We modeled being in the sample determined by high school grade, gender,
and/or first year GPA. This alternative specification produces very similar results to those shown here.


                                                     14
        Students evaluate instructors across a variety of traits, and measuring subjective

quality in terms of the portion of students that provides particularly high or low

evaluations may be more informative than summarizing quality using the mean across

students, as done in the earlier tables.     Table 4 shows estimates of the effects of

alternative measures of subjective quality on student achievement. Each coefficient

shown is from a separate regression of the outcome variable on instructor quality, course

and student fixed effects, and time of day and week controls. Interestingly, it appears to

not make much difference whether we summarize subjective quality as the mean reported

overall effectiveness, the fraction of students ranking the instructor 7 out of 7 in terms of

effectiveness, or the fraction of students ranking the instructor 1 or 2 out of 7. A two

standard deviation increase in these instructor quality measures is associated with

reduced dropout rate by 1.7, 1.4, and 1.7 percentage points respectively. The implied

effects from changes to the other instructor qualities evaluated are also similar. This is

not surprising because the assessed qualities are highly correlated – the correlations

between instructor effectiveness and the other quality variables (e.g. organized,

enthusiastic, answers questions clearly) ranges from 0.65 to 0.95. The multicolinearity is

too pronounced to regress the outcome variables on multiple quality traits and generate

precise coefficient estimates.

       The point estimates in Table 4, with few exceptions, suggest that subjective

instructor quality plays some role in determining subsequent subject courses and credits.

Only a few estimates, however, are significant, and the implied magnitude of the effect is

small. A two standard deviation increase in perceived enthusiasm, for example, leads to

an increase in the number of subject-related courses taken the following year by 4 percent




                                             15
of its standard deviation. The most informative variation comes from the retake rate– the

fraction of students who report, ‘considering my experience with this course, and

disregarding the need to take it to meet program or degree requirements, I would have

still taken this course’. A two standard deviation increase in the retake rate is associated

with a 3 percentage point reduction in the course dropout rate and an increase in the

number of subject-related courses taken in year 2 by 7.7 percent of its standard deviation.

       Tables 5 and 6 explore how the main results differ by gender, mother tongue, high

school grade, and program of study. Table 5 shows results using class dropout as the

outcome variable, Table 6 shows results using the number of subject-related courses

taken in second year.     The estimated effects from perceived effectiveness on class

dropout are very similar regardless of gender, whether English is a student’s mother

tongue or not, and whether a student enters university as a science major or not. Lecturer

status, tenure status, and top salary status are insignificantly related to course dropout for

each these sub-groups.

       The tables also suggest that instructor quality impacts students differently

depending on their past performance. From column 5 of Table 5, the effect of perceived

effectiveness on the likelihood of dropping a course is driven almost entirely by

university students with poorer high school grades. Among students in the lowest high

school grade quartile, a two standard deviation increase in subjective instructor quality

lowers the likelihood of dropping a course by 5.6 percentage points, whereas the

estimated effect among students from the top high school grade quartile is zero.

Dropping a course is still insignificantly related to lecturer and salary status for both

groups. But additional differences arise when looking a subsequent course selection.

Those from the lowest quartile with a better instructor in terms of perceived effectiveness

enrol in more related courses the following year – a two standard deviation increase in

perceived effectiveness is associated with a higher count of subject-related courses in

second year by 7 percent of a standard deviation. The estimated effect among students in

the highest quartile is about zero. The influence of instructor rank and salary also differs

by students’ high school grade quartile. Lecturers have a significant negative impact on

subject interest for students among the lowest quartile, but a positive impact among

students from the highest quartile. Compared with full professors, students from the

lowest high school grade quartile are less likely to be interested in a subject after taking

an introductory course with an assistant or associate professor, or an adjunct or emeritus

professor. Highly paid professors, however, have a positive influence on subject interest

among students with better high school grades.




V. Instructor Value Added



       University teachers may matter in ways not captured by the observable

differences we use above to estimate effects on student achievement. At the primary and

secondary level, several researchers have measured teacher specific fixed effects (or

value added) on student performance, and conclude that the effects differ across teachers

in significant ways. Value added is the expected increase or decrease in a student’s

outcome from attending a class with a particular instructor, relative to the mean outcome.

The value-added standard deviation indicates the extent to which any teacher differences




                                            17
matter in determining student performance. A zero standard deviation implies that it

makes no difference, on average, to a student’s performance which teacher she is

assigned to.

       Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger (2006) estimate teachers’ value added to elementary

and secondary student test scores. The results suggest that a change from the teacher

with the 25th percentile value added to the teacher with the 75th percentile value added

(about a 2 standard deviation difference) would affect a student’s test score by about one

quarter of its standard deviation. Aaronson, Barrow, and Sander (2002) estimate that one

semester with a high school teacher rated two standard deviations higher in value added

would add 0.3 to 0.5 grade equivalents, or 25 to 45 percent of an average school year, to a

student’s math score performance. Rockoff (2004) finds that the standard deviation in

the value added for New Jersey elementary students’ normalized test scores is 0.11.

Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain (2005) also arrive at similar estimates for Texas elementary

students.

       Consider a more general version of equation (1) where achievement depends

simply on who teaches the course. We decompose yiktps by the following:




(2)     yiktps p k kts iktps




where p is an instructor fixed effect and the variance (or standard deviation) of p is

the primary parameter of interest. The outcome may depend on a class specific effect,

kts , independent of instructor. This may be because the class is held early in the

morning, or because of a particular disruption (a fire alarm, for example). The outcome


                                            18
also depends on student specific factors, iktps , and factors other than instructor, course,

time, or section.

          Even in the absence of student selection, estimating each instructor’s value added,

̂p , from regression equation (2) will lead to measurement error, u : ̂p p u . This

makes interpretation of the magnitude and variance of the fixed effects difficult.

Measurement error will bias the calculation of var(p ) upwards [     2p u2 ] and
                                                                   2
                                                                   p 
                                                                  ˆ

previous researchers suggest this bias is often substantial.                                   To avoid it, alternative

methods or adjustments are used.

          We adopt an approach similar in spirit to Kane, Rockoff, and Staiger (2006), who

look at the year-to-year teacher covariances in mean student test scores across classes,

schools, and time. The covariance estimation approach is also similar to one used by

Page and Solon (2003) to estimate ‘value added’ to earnings from growing up in a

particular neighborhood.3

          For each course, the covariance between two students in the same section is:



(3)



C ( y i1,k * tps , y i1,k * tps ) V (p ) V (k * ts ) 2C(p , k * ts ) 2C(p , ik * tps ) 2C(k *ts , ik *tps ) ,




3
 For comparison, Page and Solon estimate that a one standard deviation in value added neighbourhood
quality would increase expected earnings by up to 18 percent. Also for comparison, the authors estimate
sibling earnings covariances to be about 0.35. This would imply a one standard deviation in ‘family value
added’ would increase earnings by 59 percent!


                                                               19
Students may select by section to be with friends or because students in similar programs

end up in similar classes. The within section covariance will be biased upwards by this

type of within-section sorting.                  To better measure the permanent component of the

instructor value-added variance, we also calculate the covariance between two students

from the same course with the same instructor but in different sections, possibly in

different years. If instructors are assigned to sections in a manner that is independent of

section fixed effects4, then the covariance across sections is:



(4)      C ( y i1,k * ,t,p,s1 , y i1,k * ,t,p,s1 ) V (p ) 2C(p , ik *tps ) .




If students take classes independently of who teaches (so that C(p , ik *tps ) 0 ), the

covariance across sections measures the permanent value added variance, V (p ) . To

address possible selection if this is not true, we also regress yiktps on course and

individual fixed effects and use the residuals to compute the across and within section

covariances in equations 4 and 5. Individual fixed effects should help control for overall

tendencies of individuals to choose classes based on instructor or program.

         We follow the covariance estimation procedure used by Solon and Page (2003)

for common neighbors. Let y
                           iktps be the residual from regressing y iktps on course and



year fixed effects or course and individual fixed effects. This first step adjusts for

possible outcome differences by courses or time. The covariance is calculated as follows:



4
 This assumption may not be true if instructors prefer teaching at a particular time of day, taught over less
than the 9 year period the data span. In these cases, the across section covariance estimate will be biased
upwards.


                                                               20

where I ktps is the number of individuals within section ktps , Sktp is the number of

sections in a course, T is the number of courses, K is the number of years, and N ' is the

number of observations in the numerator. We calculate the square root of the covariance

for an upper-bound estimate of the standard deviation of instructor value added fixed

effects. Ninety-five percent confidence regions are estimated by bootstrap.

       The results are presented in Table 7.                                         All outcome variables, except course

dropout, are standardized to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1. The within-section

covariance for first year standardized course grade is 0.019. Column 1 shows the square

root of this value, 0.138, which is an estimate for the standard deviation of instructor

fixed effects on grades for a given course. A two standard deviation difference in

instructor fixed effects between students would thus account for approximately a 3.4

percentage point difference in grade performance (2*0.138*13, with 13 being the

standard deviation of a first year student’s grade). Since grading is often at the discretion

of the instructor, we cannot attribute this variation to instructor value added. We can

only conclude that a small portion of a courses’s grade distribution occurs from being

taught by different instructors.

       The covariance estimates fall when using residuals after including individual

fixed effects (in column 2), and when calculating the across-section covariance (in

column 4) instead of within-section. This suggests at least some sorting of students by

section and by instructor. Our preferred estimates are from columns 3 and 4. Column 3



                                                                         21
may overstate the instructor value added variation because of possible student sorting.

Column 4 may understate the variation because the individual fixed effects may absorb

some of the instructor effects before we calculate the instructor effect variation from the

residuals. The true variation probably lies somewhere in the middle. Fortunately for

interpretation, the covariance estimates in both cases are similar for all but one of the

student outcomes.5

         The standard deviation of value added for a student’s likelihood of dropping out,

from columns 3 and 4, is about 0.012. This suggests, for a class size of 200, about an

additional 5 students would drop the course if an instructor’s value added was two

standard deviations lower. This estimate is not much higher compared to that implied

from the 1.4 percentage point effect due to a two standard deviation decrease in perceived

instructor effectiveness.

         Turning to subsequent outcomes in following years, a two standard deviation

difference in the effect an instructor has on the number of same-subject courses taken in

year 2 can explain about 0.07 to 0.20 of an extra subject-course, on average (6 to 16

percent of the standard deviation in the number of subject courses). The average effect

on third year course selection is lower, and the year 2 and year 3 grade covariance

estimates between students enrolled in same-subject courses and with the same first-year

instructor are negative and not significantly different from zero (not shown in table).




5
  The estimated standard deviations for instructor fixed effects using the larger sample of first year students
taking any course (not just large first year courses) are almost identical to the ones shown here.


                                                      22
VI. Conclusion



       In this paper, we address the question whether differences in teacher quality

among currently acceptable university instructors matter to students’ achievement and

course interest. To analyze this, we use a new administrative dataset of students at a

large Canadian university matched to first year courses and corresponding instructors.

Instructor quality is measured by objective, subjective, and value added measures. We

identify our estimates using variation across different sections within the same course.

The within-course analysis provides an intuitive counterfactual estimate of how different

a student’s subsequent achievement would be expected to be if she enrolled in the same

course but with a different type of instructor.        To control for individual specific

characteristics and selection behavior we include student fixed effects. Remaining

selection on teacher quality is likely to be small since, for many first-year courses,

instructors are not listed in course calendars and students must pick the courses we match

to (as of September 1) with little or no prior knowledge about instructors. We also control

for time of day and week controls to minimize remaining selection issues.

       We find that differences in commonly observed instructor traits, such as rank,

faculty status, and salary, have virtually no effect on student outcomes. There are no

average differences in students’ dropout, subsequent grade, and course selection

outcomes by instructor tenure or tenure-track status, full-time or part-time lecturer status,

and salary status (whether an instructor earns more than CDN$100,000 in the year

taught). These results are consistent across alternative model specifications and student

populations. They suggest that, at the margin, universities can hire cheaper part-time or




                                             23
full-time lecturers without expecting adverse impacts to student achievement.          The

findings are similar to Bettinger and Long (2004), who find small and often insignificant

effects on subsequent course interest from taking a first year class with an adjunct or

graduate student instructor. They are also similar to Jacob and Lefgren (2005) and others

who find elementary and secondary teacher experience, education status, and salary have

little impact on test scores.

        What does matter is instructors’ perceived effectiveness and related subjective

measures of quality evaluated by students. Interestingly, subjective instructor evaluations

have almost no correlation with instructor rank or salary, yet vary widely within these

categories. Students with instructors that tend to receive high evaluations are less likely

to cancel a course, more likely to receive better grades, and somewhat more likely to take

similar courses in following years. To help quantify this, consider that the average

instructor ranking in perceived effectiveness among the instructors ranking in the bottom

quarter is 4.8 on a 7 point scale, and the average among instructors ranking in the top

quarter is 6.3. If first-year instructors ranked in the bottom quarter could be replaced

with instructors ranked in the top, we estimate that the course dropout rate would fall by

2 percentage points, and the number of related courses taken in second year would

increase by about 4 percent. For comparison, if we were to replace entering first-year

students in this university from the bottom quarter of high school grade averages with

students from the top quarter, the dropout rate would fall by 6.4 percentage points.

        The second and third year effects suggest that any one instructor’s influence on

student achievement and behaviour fades over time.          But exposure to consistently

effective teachers each year or consistently ineffective ones could have a large




                                            24
cumulative impact. The impact is greater for students with initially poor academic

achievement in high school, but about the same for males and females, science and non-

science majors, and minority and non-minority students.

       We also estimate the value added variance to indicate the extent to which any

observable or unobservable teacher difference matters to academic outcomes.           The

findings suggest that subjective teacher evaluations perform well in reflecting an

instructor’s influence on students. Increasing an instructor’s value added by one standard

deviation reduces a course’s dropout rate by 1.2 percentage points, which is not much

larger in magnitude compared to the effect of a standard deviation increase in perceived

instructor effectiveness. We interpret the overall college instructor influence on student

achievement as smaller than the overall influence suggested in earlier value added

research for elementary and secondary school teachers. Class grade distributions and

dropout rates differ across college instructors teaching the same course, but less so

compared to class grade distributions across elementary and secondary school instructors.

Standardized effects from a change in instructor quality are about half the size or lower

for college instructors than for elementary and secondary teachers (e.g. Kane, Rockoff,

and Staiger, 2006, Rivkin, Hanushek, and Kain, 2005, and Jacob and Lefgren, 2006).

Perhaps by the time students enter college cognitive ability and motivation are less

malleable than in early childhood and, consequently, teachers have less impact.
