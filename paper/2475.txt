Monetary Policy and Performance in the U.S., Japan and Europe, 1973-86



                               ABSTRACT




        Monetary policies in the U.S., Japan, Germany and the United
Kingdom over the period 1973—1986 are compared and evaluated, with the
aim of drawing lessons for monetary policy from the recent historical
record. All four countries shifted during this period to money
targeting, though with differing degrees of commitment, seriousness and
persistence. The Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan each focus on one
money target, described by the Bundesbank as a target, and by the Bank
of Japan as a proJection. None of the countries has stuck rigorously to
the taraets, though the Bank of Japan has come close.
        The most striking contrast in the outcomes of policy is between
Japan and Germany in the second oil shock. Both their central banks
must by that stage have acquired significant anti—inflationary
reputations. Nonetheless, whereas the rate of increase of nominal wages
in Japan fell to accommodate the increased price of oil, and Japan
avoided a recession, the rate of wage increase in Germany increased, and
was followed by a serious recession. The cause of the difference in
results appears to lie much less in the credibility of the policyinakers
than in the behavior of wage—earners. Differences between the outcomes
of policy in the U.S. and U.K. also suggest that the role of the
reputation of policymakers is at best extremely difficult to quantify.
Outcomes in all countries suggest that monetary rules that do not
accommodate to changes in velocity can cause unnecessary movements in
output.

MONETARY POLICY AND PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S., JAPAN AND EUROPE, 1973-86.


                           Stanley Fischer.'


        In the period since 1973 each of the major economies has

succeeded in reducina the inflation rate after suffering the

inflationary impacts of the two oil shocks. In this paper I analyze the

policy choices——with the emphasis on monetary policy——and tradeoffs that

resulted in lower inflation for the United States, Japan, Germany and

the United KincTdom.

        The extraordinary stability of inflation, output growth and

monetary growth in both Japan and Germany after the first oil shock

appear to support the view that adherence to stable preannounced money

growth tarqets is the key to macroeconomic stability. The remarkable

stability of U.S. growth combined with low inflation in the period since

1984 in the face of unprecedented variability of monetary growth casts

some doubt on that presumption. The main aim of this paper is to draw

lessons for monetary policy from the recent historical record.

        I start with an overview of macroeconomic developments in the

four countries in the period 1972 to 1986, from the collapse of the

Bretton Woods system, through the two oil shocks and into the


'Department of Economics, MIT, and NBER. This paper was prepared for
the Third International Conference of the Institute for Monetary and
Economic Studies, Bank of Japan, June 1987. and will appear in Monetary

disinflationary eighties. Economic policy decisions in the four

countries during the two oil shocks are examined more closely in Section

11.2 In Section III I describe the different monetary targeting and,

briefly, short—run operating procedures of policy in the four countries.

The paper concludes with a discussion of the lessons of this period for

monetary targeting and policy, the role of the credibility of

policymakers, and the flexible exchange rate system.3


I. Shocks and Policy Responses.


        Basic macroeconomic developments in the four economies for the

period 1972—1986 are summarized in Figures 1, 2, and 3, which present

information on real GNP growth, inflation (measured by the CPI4), and

unemployment respectively, and in Table 1. The period has seen a

slowing of real GNP growth in all four countries, a slowing of

inflation, and an increase in unemployment. The increases in the

German and United Kingdom unemployment rates stand out. There was in

1986 a remarkable convergence of GNP growth rates and, to a lesser


2Meltzer (1985) examines shocks and policy decisions in japan and the
U.S. in the fixed and floating exchange rate periods. His econometric
emphasis is on policy reactions to all types of shocks, whereas this
paper presents a less formal examination of policy responses in four
countries to the two oil shocks.
3Meek (1983) contains several very informative papers on monetary policy
procedures in major economies.
4lnflation rates of the GNP deflator and the CPI often differ
significantly over this period. For instance, although CPI inflation
for the United States exceeded 10% on a year over year basis four times,
GNP deflator inflation never rose into the double digits. In 1986 when
CPI inflation rates in Germany and Japan were —0.2% and 0.6%
respectively, GNP deflators rose by 3.0% and 2.3%.
These are QECD—standardized measures of unemployment. The German data
here are lower than the national statistics.

extent, inflation rates, though there were wide disparities in

unemployment rates among the four economies.

        The oil shocks are clearly visible in the behavior of the

inflation rate in Figure 2. The first oil shock sharply raised the

inflation rate in the U.S., Japan and the U.K., but caused barely a

ripple in German inflation. The second oil shock produced rapid

increases in inflation in the U.S. and the U.K., a 7.8% (CPI) inflation

rate for 1980 in Japan, and more than 6% per annum (CPI) inflation in

Germany. In the second oil shock, CPI inflation rates for Germany,

Japan, and the U.S. were well above rates of increase of the GNP

deflator:6 in the case of Japan the year over year CPI inflation rate

for 1980 of 7.8% contrasts with just 3.8% on the GNP deflator.7

        Each oil shock was followed by a significant slowdown in growth

or a recession, with one exception. Japan, which had grown at double

digit rates in the sixties and at more than 8% per annum in 1972—73

suffered the trauma of a recession in 1974. Its year over year growth

rate never reached 5.5% thereafter, though it remained the most rapidly

growing of the major economies. Japanese growth slowed very little

during the second oil shock; over the entire ten year period starting in

1976 Japanese annual real GNP growth was remarkably stable at rates

between 3.1% and 5.3% per annum.

        Germany suffered recessions during both oil shocks; unemployment

rose to a new higher level after each, and has only recently shown

modest signs of reduction. The U.K. similarly experienced a recession

with each oil shock and a step increase in the level of unemployment to

a new higher level with virtually no signs of improvement thereafter.

        The pattern for the U.S. was different. The first oil shock

recession was followed by a rapid recovery and decline in unemployment.

The second oil shock produced two recessions8, the second with the

highest unemployment rate of the post—World War II period. Rapid

recovery again brought the unemployment rate down quite fast, but it

nonetheless remains above 1973 estimates of the natural rate of about


7Because of its inappropriate treatment of housing prices, the U.S. CPI
significantly mismeasured inflation in the period before 1982. For
instance, the 13.5% for 1980 seen in Figure 2 is less than 12% when
calculated on the basis of the corrected CPI introduced after 1982.
8Because the 1980 recession lasted only six months and the recovery from
that recession a year, it is sometimes argued that the entire period
from the beginning of 1980 to the end of 1982 should be regarded as one
long recession.

5.5%, and even above most current estimates of the natural rate of about

6%.

        Not so evident in the figures is the effects of the U.S. fiscal

policy shock of 1981—83 and accompanying fiscal tightening in the other

three countries. Some of the effects show up in rapid U.S. recovery

from the 1981—82 recession and slower recovery in the other economies;

others are reflected in the current account changes seen in Table 1.

        I now review in more detail the policy choices made in each

country during the two oil shocks.


II. Dealing with the Oil Shocks.


        The first oil shock hit a booming world economy that had

recently abandoned the Bretton Woods system. Raw material prices were

already rising fast as domestic inflation rates rose. Free from the

constraints of pegged exchange rates, countries believed they could

pursue their own goals with little outside constraint. In the case of

Germany the goal was low inflation; in Britain it was the maintenance of

high growth. Real growth in Britain at 7.9% in 1973 for a short while

matched the Japanese rate. In 1973, even before the oil price shock,

inflation was high in the United States as a result of expansionary

monetary and fiscal policy, and the ending of wage and price controls.

It was higher in Britain and much higher in Japan.

        Monetary growth data for the period are shown in Figure 49


9Tables in the appendix provide the data underlying each figure. All
growth rates are at annual rates for the quarter relative to the same
quarter a year before. Figure 4 shows for each country that monetary
variable that receives most attention from the monetary policymakers: Ml
in the U.S., (M2+CD's) in Japan; Central Bank Money in Germany; and
sterling M3 in the U.K. Growth rates for a variety of monetary
variables for each country are presented in Tables A—4.
                                     6



Money growth in both the U.K. and Japan exceeded 20% per annum in 1972

and 197310. Such growth rates of money had been common in Japan during

her high growth period, but not in Britain. The growth rate of both Ml

and M2 was sharply reduced in Japan at the end of 1973, before the oil

price shock hit, but money growth in the U.K. (M2) was still 27.5%

(quarter over same quarter a year earlier) in the fourth quarter of

1973. U.s. Ml and M2 growth were reduced in 1973. With the shift to a

floating exchange rate allowing Germany to pursue its domestic inflation

goals, the growth rate of central bank money in Germany was cut

drastically in the second quarter of 1973. Thus by the time of the oil

price increase money growth rates were being reduced in three of the

four countries.      And if monetary policy is judged by the nominal

interest rate (Figure 5), monetary policy had turned tight in Britain

too in mid—1973.1'

        In the next year higher oil prices fed through into higher

inflation in each country. Although there were deflationary forces in

place already, the high inflation and continuing high wage growth

reinforced the resolve of the monetary authorities in each country to

keep money growth low'2. With the oil shock adding to the rate of


'°This applies to both Ml and M2 growth rates in Japan, and M2 and
sterling M3 in the U.K. U.K. Ml growth was 14% in 1972 but only 5% in
1973.
''In this period money growth was not taken as a measure of the thrust
of monetary policy in Britain. Even if it were, the differences between
the growth of Ml, which fell drastically after the middle of 1973, and
the growth rates of M2 and M3 would have complicated the interpretation
of policy. It was in large part the correlation between N3 growth in
1973 and 1974 with the subsequent inflation that led to its later use as
a monetary target.

inflation, real balances in each country were falling, putting further

pressure on interest rates and demand. Nominal interest rates stayed

high through 1974, though they were falling rapidly in Germany.

        Slowdowns or recessions began in each country in the first

quarter of 1974. In part because the nature of cost shocks were not

then well understood, and because the unemployment rate was slow to

rise, the slowdowns did not cause any change in policy. Given the short

lag between the oil price increase and the start of the recessions, the

recessions must already have been en route, and would have taken place

as a result of the tightening of policies in mid—1973 even without the

oil price increase.

        The oil price rise served rather to intensify the recessions, as

high inflation, continued low unemployment and rapid wage growth kept

monetary and fiscal policy tight through 1974. In the U.S. the main

thrust of policy until almost the end of 1974 was to fight inflation.

Both Ml and 112 money growth were kept low and the Treasury bill rate

held high (Figure 5). There was a small full employment surplus in 1974

(Figure 6), and proposals for a tax increase to deal with the inflation.

Rates of wage increase (Figure 10) stayed high through 1974 as inflation

accelerated.

         In Japan money growth was well below the 20% rate of inflation

in 1974, with the result that real balances fell and interest rates

increased. With the monetary squeeze, real GNP growth (Figure 9) turned

negative at the beginning of 1974, and stayed negative (quarter over

same quarter a year before) throughout the year. But rates of wage
                                   8



increase and inflation remained above 20%, for another year. By the end

of 1974 the inflation rate in Japan was beginning to fall though wage

increases were still rapid, and the government budget was moving into a

larger deficit.

        Money growth was kept low in Germany through 1974. Real GNP

growth was low in 1974, turning negative at the end of year and for most

of 1975. High rates of wage increase continued through 1974, inflation

still stayed high, while unemployment remained below 2%. M2 and M3

growth were reduced in Britain in mid—1974 with interest rates and the

government budget deficit remaining high. In Britain the rate of wage

increase was accelerating at the end of 1974.

        Only at the end of 1974 did unemployment start rising in each

country. At that point interest rates in the U.S. and Germany were

falling fast. The seriousness of the recession struck home in the U.S.

at the end of 1974, leading in March 1975 to a fiscal stimulus in the

form of a $50 per taxpayer check, visible in Figure 6 in the sharp

temporary increase in the full employment deficit. The recession, high

rates of wage increase and high inflation continued well into 1975, with

the unemployment rate peaking in the second quarter. Monetary growth

(Ml) was procyclical in this recession, falling through the first

quarter of 1975, and only then beginning to increase. Even so, the

annual growth rate of Ml (quarter over the same quarter a year before)

did riot exceed 6% over the entire three years starting in 1973:4. M2

growth too fell sharply in the recession but then increased to more than

10% for the two years following the end of the recession. Inflation
                                   9



fell rapidly after the middle of 1975, and by the time of the election

campaign at the end of 1976 CPI inflation was at less than 5%•13     Wage

increases were still at double—digit rates into 1975, and did not fall

to much below 8% even after the recession.

        The decisive change in Japanese inflation cane at the end of

1974 and the beginning of 1975, with the new wage agreement in 1975

reducing wage inflation by more than 10%. At the same time nominal

interest rates began to decline, and money growth was raised. The

central government budget deficit began to increase from 1975, and

continued rising until it reached more than 5.4% of GNP in 1978.14 The

recovery of real growth started early in 1975.

        In Germany central bank money growth was raised at the beginning

of the year. Inflation and rates of wage increase too declined from

early 1975, real GN? growth turned around at about the same time as in

the United States, though unemployment peaked in the last quarter.

        The recession and inflation lasted longer in the U.K; indeed

there were two separate periods of negative real GD? growth in 1974 and

1975. Wage inflation was sharply reduced during 1975, moving from a

(quarter over same quarter a year earlier) peak of 32% in 1975:1 to

21.5% in 1975:4. Inflation moved into the low teens in 1976 as money

growth continued well below the inflation rate through 1975 and nominal

interest rates remained high. Despite a renewal of growth in 1976, the

unemployment rate in the U.K. continued rising until the end of 1977,

when it reached 6.3%, compared with 2.6% at the end of 1973.


13GNP deflator inflation never fell much below 6%, the difference again
resulting in part from the incorrect treatment of the costs of housing.

           Perhaps the most revealing contrast in this period is that

between the U.K. and Japan. Before the recession and oil price shock,

both countries had high rates of money growth. In 1973 Britain had

lower price and wage inflation, suggesting that inflationary pressures

for 1974 were higher in Britain with her lower rate of growth of

potential output. Japanese money growth was decisively reduced at the

end of 1973; it took longer in Britain. Output growth turned negative

at the same time in both countries in 1974 but recovered somewhat during

that year. However, the Japanese recession represented a much larger

reduction in growth below trend rates than the British recession. In

both countries rates of wage increase rose in 1974, more so though in

Britain.

           The decisive difference occurs at the beginning of 1975, when

Japanese wage inflation fell sharply in the new wage agreement, but

British wage inflation continued high through the end of the year. With

money growth (broader definitions) kept down in Britain in 1975 and wage

increases continuing at high rates, further recession occurred.1

Inflation in the UK came down from the 20% range to the low teens at the

end of 1976, but stayed in double dicits virtually through the remainder

of the decade.

           What are the lessons of this episode? First, the fact that the

oil shock hit overheated economies made dealing with the shock more

difficult. But it is in the nature of such shocks that they are more


'5Once again the different money stocks give different signals in
Britain as Mi. growth was relatively high in 1975. Nominal interest
rates were held in the double digits but real interest rates were still
substantially negative.
                                   11



likely to occur when demand is booming than when economies are in

recession. Second, it may be argued that the fact that an oil price

increase is both inflationary and recessionary means that monetary

policy was too restrictive for too long. Certainly Japan brought about

a big recession measured by the loss of potential output. Quite likely

a more gradual reduction in the growth rate of money in Japan, and some

accommodation of inflationary pressures in 1974 in the US and Germany

would have moderated the recessions, at the cost of a less rapid

reduction in inflation. Third, through the end of the recession

exchange rates moved surprisingly little (Figure 7). The DN appreciated

in the first half of 1973, the yen and sterling depreciated during the

recession as implied by their greater inflation, but exchange rate

movements did not play a large part in the adjustment to the oil shock.

Fourth, it is difficult not to give the behavior of wages an independent

role in the story. Japanese inflation fell fast after rates of wage

increase came down; U.K. inflation stayed high with high wage inflation.

Later in the paper I examine whether the credibility of the policymakers

in the two countries explains the difference.

        In both Germany and Japan monetary policy was in part guided by

the hope of establishing the credibility of the central bank's

determination to maintain low inflation in the new floating exchange

rate world. The recessions could be viewed as investments in

reputation, which paid off in the case of Japan in the second oil

crisis. That leaves open the question of why there was not a similar

payoff for Germany.
                                  12



        After the first oil shock German and Japanese monetary policies

were embarked on new anti—inflationary courses. Despite the

introduction of monetary targeting in 1975, there appears to have been

no significant change in the nature of U.S. monetary policy, and U.K.

monetary policy was still difficult to understand. (Fischer, 1987)

        In the years between the oil shocks the U.S. economy showed

rapid growth and declining unemployment from 1976 to 1978 while

inflation increased; Japan grew rapidly, albeit slowly by its historical

standards, with slowing inflation; German growth was moderate with

slowly falling unemployment while inflation remained at around 4%; the

U.K. succeeded in reducing the unemployment rate slightly, while the

inflation rate except in 1978 remained in double digits.

        In retrospect, it is clear that U.S. monetary policy in the

period between the oil shocks was too expansionary, even though money

growth rates did not rise much. Rather, the rapid growth and rising

inflation were accompanied by an increasing velocity of circulation (the

case of the missing money). In Japan gradually slowing money growth was

accompanied by a rising budget deficit to 1978. The possibility of

countercyclical fiscal policy was neutralized by the existence of a

massive budget deficit, a condition that is familiar in the U.S.

Central bank money growth in Germany remained around 8-11% for the

period until 1980. Noney growth and budget deficits in the U.K. were

high through the end of the decade.

The Second Oil Shock.
                                    13



         The real price of oil fell from the end of 1976 until the

beginning of 1979, then virtually doubled within the next year,

continuing its increase until the middle of 1981. With unemployment

continuing to fall in the United States and rates of wage increase

rising, the second oil shock like the first hit an economy that was

already operating close to full capacity and with high inflation. The

other major countries too had grown rapidly in 1978.

        In the U.S. the falling dollar during 1978 had led to a change

in monetary policy at the end of that year. Both Ml and M2 growth were

slightly lower in 1979 than in 1978, and interest rates were higher.

Inflation nonetheless increased, with the CPI rising 13.3% during 1979.

The GNP deflator grew 8.8%, year over year in 1979, and at virtually the

same rate during the year. Rising interest rates and oil prices account

for the more than 4% difference between CPI and GNP deflator inflation.

        Paul Voicker was appointed Chairman of the Fed in August 1979.

Confronted with rising inflation, and continued dollar weakness, the Fed

in November 1979 made its decision to stem the inflation. Accompanying

this decision, the Fed declared a change in its operating procedures to

place far more weight on meeting its monetary targets and to reduce the

emphasis put on interest rates.

        CPI inflation rates exceeding 18% per annum in the first quarter

of 1980 led to a panic imposition of credit controls in March 1980,

intensifying an extraordinarily short sharp recession that can now be

seen to have started in January 1980. Ml growth was cut to negative

rates in the second quarter of 1980, and then raised as the extent of
                                   14


the recession became clear. The recession ended in the middle of 1980

with CpI inflation down but GNP deflator inflation little reduced, and

with inflation outpacing money growth and thereby reducing real

balances. Interest rates had fallen rapidly in the recession but

rebounded just as rapidly and moved to new highs at the start of the

1981—82 recession. It was during this period that the Fed maintained

the monetary pressure that broke the inflationay momentum. Money growth

was kept low into 1982.

        The Fed kept up the pressure——visible both in low money growth

and high nominal interest rates——through August 1982, by which tine it

was clear the inflation rate had fallen and that unemployment was rising

rapidly. In August 1982, the start of the international debt crisis,

the Fed announced the end of the monetary policy inaugurated three years

earlier. Money growth was increased sharply, interest rates were driven

down, fueling the recovery that began at the end of 1982. A second

expansionary force came from the i?ajor tax cuts that went into effect in

1982; a third was the decline in the price of oil that began in 1982.

        The U.S. took a long time to deal with the second oil shock,

with the imposition of credit controls and the 1980 recession probably

prolonging the adjustment period. Rates of wage increase started

falling rapidly only after the middle of 1981, and by the end of 1982——

with the unemployment rate above 10.5%——had fallen to less than half

their 10.8% level at the start of 1981. They have continued falling

since then, as disinflation has continued.
                                    15



        Ml growth since 1982 has been on average higher than over any

other four year period since World War II, and except in 1984 well above

its target ranges.   112 growth has continued relatively smoothly, within

its target ranges. Nominal interest rates were actually higher in 1984

than in 1982 and 1983, but subsequently fell, reducing the real interest

rate.

        The great success of Japanese macroeconomic policy was the

avoidance of a recession in the second oil shock. Money growth was cut

at the end of 1979 and kept down into 1981. The nominal interest rate

rose rapidly, growth slowed somewhat, inflation rose, real growth fell

especially in 1981, but still during 1981 real GNP grew 2.5%. Wage

inflation was falling over this entire period, thereby avoiding the

pass—through of higher prices into wages. Japan was thus spared the

choice between accommodation and a wage—price spiral, or a recession,

perhaps because that choice had already been made once before. Once it

was clear that inflation was under control, the Bank of Japan permitted

an increase in money growth in the second half of 1981. The yen had

depreciated betweeen 1979 and 1980 but then appreciated into 1981,

assisting the disinflation.16

        Germany met the second oil price increase with a cut in the

growth rate of central bank money from 10% per annum in the first half

of 1979 to 5% in the first half of 1980, with interest rates moving in

the opposite direction. Price and wage inflation rose into 1980 and


161n February 1980 the Bank of Japan demonstrated its independence and
its intention of keeping inflation low by for the first time ever
raising the official discount rate during the budget debate in the Diet.
                                     16



unemployment was still falling. The Bundesbank evidently saw this as

the time when control over inflation had to be asserted; it also

attributed part of the tightness of monetary policy in 1981 to the need

to stem the depreciation of the currency; and it regarded the budget

deficit as another cause to maintain monetary tightness.

           Recession started in 1980, and unemployment began its ascent in

the middle of the year. From 2.9% (standardized definition) in the

second quarter of 1980, unemployment kept increasing until it reached

more than 8% three years later. Low money growth (4%) andthe recession

continued for over two years, with recovery getting under way only in

1983, when central bank money growth was increased to near 8%. Wage and

price inflation were surprisingly strong through 1982, with CPI

inflation still above 5%, and wages and the GNP deflator rising more

than 4% in 1982. The continuing wage increases and weakness of the

Deutschemark were the main factor ensuring the maintenance of monetary

tightness through 1982. The Bundesbank was clearly determined to move

the core inflation rate down from about 4%, the rate before the oil

shock, closer to zero, and was willing to pay the price of a long

recession and rising unemployment. It does not appear that the oil

price shock itself played a large part in creating this recession in

Germany.

           The U.K. succeeded in bringing its inflation rate down in this

same period, but here the oil price shock played only a small part.

Sterling appreciated as the price of oil increased; wage inflation

likewise increased from 1979 to 1980. Noney growth (all definitions)
                                   17


was kept well below the inflation rate and nominal interest rates

increased. A recession started in the second quarter of l980 over the

six quarters from the end of 1979 the unemployment rate more than

doubled to reach a level of 10.2%. Wage inflation came down but did not

fall below 10% until the middle of 1983.

        Under the Medium Term Financial Strategy announced in 1980

monetary growth (M3) was to be steadily reduced along with the public

sector borrowing requirement. Both money growth and the PSBR initially

exceeded target levels but were reduced steadily, and with the pressure

of rising unemployment wage and price inflation finally fell. By 1983

and 1984 U.K. inflation was close to U.S. levels. However unemployment

rates were well above those in the U.S. and were showing very little

sign of recovery. The monetary situation was once again confused, this

time because the demand function for sterling M3 appeared to be

shifting.

        During the period from 1979 to 1983 the U.S., Germany and the

U.K. each undertook a period of extremely restrictive policy designed to

break inflationary momentum. Each created a major recession, and in

Germany and the U.K. a long—term increase in unemployment. Each did

succeed in bringing down inflation. The second oil price increase was

more important in determining the timing of the U.S. policy measures

than those in the other two countries. Even so, both the U.S. and the

U.K. would have in any event had to deal with the high inflations they

were suffering before the oil price shock.
                                  18



       The German disinflation of 1980—83 is in many respects puzzling.

Relative to the U.S. and Britain, it accomplished little on the

inflation front. Year over year the CPI inflation rate peaked at 6.3%,

compared with its minimum of 2.7% in 1978; the GNP deflator never rose

more than 4.8%', compared with its minimum of 3.6% in 1976. Wage

inflation peaked in 1980 at a little over 7%. By the time monetary

policy was relaxed in 1983, the GNP deflator was rising at 3%. During

this period the unemployment rate increased from 2.9% to more than 8%.

There are two puzzling questions. First, why did the relatively low

inflation produce so much determination to maintain restrictive

policies? The answer here starts from the Bundesbank's stern views on

the dangers of inflation, and on its failure to hit its money targets

(see Table 5 below) in 1976 through 1978. It was afraid that inflation

would get out of hand. Second, why did those policies have so large an

effect on unemployment and so little effect on inflation?   It is not at

all clear why the German Phillips curve appears to be so flat during

that period. Nor is it clear why the Bundesbank pressed so hard on

money growth rather than trying to produce a more gradual disinflation,

such as had been achieved by the Bank of Japan.

        Here the contrast between Germany and Japan is most interesting.

The Bank of Japan clearly had achieved credibility by 1980. It is hard

though to credit the view that the Bundesbank lacked credibility. Up to

1979 it is difficult to tell the monetary policies of the two banks

apart——including an increase in money growth at the end of 1978 and an


'7At its quarter over same quarter a year before peak, GNP deflator
inflation in 1980:2 was 5.7%.
                                   19



increase in inflation in 1980. Once again wage behavior seems to be

key: 3apanese workers were willing to take a real wage cut; German

workers obtained higher nominal wage increases as inflation rose in

1980, arid rates of wage increase slackened only as unemployment rose.

(Bruno and Sachs, 1986).

        The two oil shock episodes tell less clear stories about the

role of policy than might have been expected. The political lessons of

the U.S. and U.K. cases are clear: eventually the pressure to deal with

double digit inflation becomes overwhelming. But the failure of the

Bundesbank's restraint in the years following the first oil shock to pay

off in the second oil shock raises important questions about both the

role of monetary targets and credibility in monetary policy.

The Aftermath.

        The U.S. rebound from the 1982 recession contrasts with the

failure of unemployment in Germany and the U.K. to recover

significantly. In contrast to the accommodative monetary policy of the

Fed, the Bundesbank kept central bank money growth at 5% or less until

1986. In the U.K. money growth, measured by the broader aggregates was

highly expansionary; though interest rates were increased in 1985 as

wage inflation resumed.

        The major difference in policies was fiscal. Table 2 presents

fiscal policy data for the period 1980—1986. From 1982 on, U.S. fiscal

policy was strongly expansionary; in 1982 and 1983 in particular German

fiscal policy was strongly contractionary. With both monetary and

fiscal policy contractionary in Germany, there was little to propel the

recovery from the recession. Although the dollar appreciation might

suggest a depreciation of the DM that would have allowed exports to

serve as the engine of growth, as they did to some extent in Japan, the

ON——tied in to its major trading partners through the EMS——did not in

fact depreciate much during this period.

          Bundesbank annual reports note the policy tradeoff between

inflation and more rapid growth, express satisfaction with the pace of

the recovery, and regret over the failure until the end of 1986 for more

rapid real growth to have an effect on unemployment. The decision to

expand more slowly than in the United States was a deliberate one,
                                   21



reflecting a greater weighting on low inflation than the U.S. political

system imposes. The Bundesbank notes frequently that its prime task is

to preserve the value of money, and it is clear that maintaining low or

perhaps eventually even zero inflation is its chief long run goal. This

goal may reflect dissatisfaction with the outcome of policy between the

oil shocks when concern over unemployment was more evident in Bundesbarik

reports but the inflation rate stayed around 4%.


III. Monetary Targeting.


        Between the oil shocks each of the central banks either

introduced monetary targeting, or shifted their procedures to focus more

on the money stock as an intermediate objective of policy. How, if at

all, did this change contribute to the secular reduction in inflation

experienced by each country?

United States.

        Monetary targeting was introduced in the U.S. in March of 1975

target ranges were specified for Ml, M2 and N3 growth rates. As shown

in Table 3, Ml and M2 outcomes fell within their target ranges in the

first year, Ml even towards the bottom of its range.   But in a pattern

that was to become quite standard, not all the money targets were

acheived simultaneously.

        Monetary targeting did not help prevent the inflationary buildup

between 1976 and 1979, in part because of data difficulties. There are

significant differences between money stock measures reported at the

time, and measures based on subsequent data revisions and

redefinitions.18 The period from 1976 saw rising Ml (new definition)


181n particular, the 5.5% Ml growth reported in Table 2 for 1979 was for
the then Mi—A definition of money, which excluded non—bank checkable
deposits. The growth rate for Mi—B, which included the latter deposits
and is close to current Ml, was nearly 2% higher.
                                      23



 growth and steadily declining target ranges for Ni——part of the then

 widely espoused gradualist strategy for reducing the inflation rate. Ni

 growth (new definition) rose sharply at the beginning of 1977,

succeeding in keeping nominal interest rates falling until late in 1978

as the recovery proceeded fast. But by the then current definitions, Ni

growth fell in 1978, and was even lower in 1979, suggesting at the time

that monetary policy was not especially expansionary. Nonetheless the

inflation rate steadily increased, from less than 6% at the end of 1976

to near 9% at the end of 1979. Rapid output growth, propelled in part

by a rising full employment deficit and falling real price of oil, was

possible with little rise in the money growth rate because of rising

velocity, caused in part by higher interest rates and in part by a shift

out of Mi (both the case of the missing money and the case of the

creation of new forms of checkable deposit).

        From the viewpoint of monetary control, the period from 1976 to

1979 is interesting for the fact that the Fed clearly intended to move

the inflation rate down through gradual reduction of the growth rate of

the various money stocks, that in terms of then available data it seemed

to be doing that from 1977 to 1979 (the growth rate of each of the M's

falls in Table 3 during that period) ,     but that it nonetheless turns out
to have been feeding the inflation.

        With the shift in monetary policy at the end of 1979, money

targets were to receive more weight and interest rates were to be

allowed to fluctuate more. But in its first two years, the new regime

had to deal with the effects on the demand for money of financial
                                  24


deregulation. The Fed declared targets for two measures of Ni that were

then being used, and in 1980 came close to meeting then. In 1981

however it was significantly below its Ml target'9, and in any event at

that time had declared targets for four different Ml measures, together

with M2, M3, and bank credit. Aside from the undershooting of the Ml

target in 1981, the Fed was above on all targets specified in Table 3 in

the years 1980—1982 that it was supposedly following monetary targets.

        Nonetheless, it was during this period that the Fed broke the

inflationary momentum of the previous twenty years——and the monetary

targets assisted in that endeavor. The reason is that the

unprecedentedly high nominal interest rates of 1980 and 1981 would not

have been politically possible without noney targets as the supposed

guides for monetary policy. When in August 1982 it became clear that

the recession and disinflation were well under way, and with high

interest rates exacerbating the developing international debt problem,

the money targets gave way, with Mi money growth exceeding 12% in the

next year and N2 money growth exceeding 17%.

        The high rates of money growth are consistent with the increase

in the demand for real balances that comes with the end of an

inflationary period, or more prosaically with a reduction in the nominal

interest rate. As nominal interest rates decline and the quantity of

real balances demanded increases, the central bank is faced with the

choice of whether to supply money more rapidly than simple nominal GNP

targeting would imply, or whether to force the increase in real balances


19The target in Table 3 is for Mi—B, close to current definitions of
money.
                                   25



through further disinflation. So long as money growth targets are not

sacrosanct, and provided the monetary authority can exercise self—

control, the growth rate of money can indeed be temporarily increased.

Even beyond the normal increase in the demand for real balances that

comes from a reduction in interest rates, the U.S. disinflation seems to

have seen a shift in the Ml demand function.20

        Instability of the demand for Ml is in part a result of

regulatory changes and innovations in the monetary system that have

changed the nature of both Ml and M2. With most interest rate controls

on bank liabilities removed, the pace of financial innovation that

affects Ml demand is likely to slow, but it is certainly the fate of

central bankers to contend with shifts in the demand function for money

in future as well.

        The extraordinary feature of US monetary policy in the 1980's

has been its success at reducing the inflation rate despite extremely

high rates of money growth. And, in the period since 1984, highly

variable money growth has been fully compatible with steady real output

growth——with 1987 likely to be another year of moderate growth and

moderate inflation despite 15% Ml growth in 1986.

        Despite its consistent failure to achieve money targets, the Fed

is required by law to announce them. That requirement serves a useful

purpose, which is to force the Fed in advance to explain its choice of


20Rasche (1986) presents the results of a comprehensive re—examination
of U.S. money demand functions, concluding that while the shift in the
demand for money function cannot be adequately explained, it can be
simply parameterized, and that money demand functions therefore continue
to play a useful role in the setting of money targets.

targets, and to explain ex post its failure to achieve them. I take up

below the question of whether it should be forced to adhere to them more

closely.

Japan.

           We have already seen how Japan dealt with its inflation problem

decisively and at high cost immediately following the first oil shock.

Up to the end of the Bretton Woods system, Japanese macroeconomic

policy, sheltered behind capital controls, had been driven by the

current account of the balance of payments and the fixed exchange rate.

Current account deficits produced contractionary policy and a growth

slowdown; surpluses turned the stop sign to go. Money growth had been

high and variable, and there was very little other than the exchange

rate to guide policy. The domestic financial markets were repressed,

with monetary policy operating to a large extent through rationing and

moral suasion. (Suzuki, 1980; Feldman, 1986)

         With the exchange rate anchor for monetary policy gone in 1973,

the Bank of Japan switched to domestic price stability as the maim

criterion for policy, with the strategic aim of gradually reducing the

inflation rate, and with the money stock as an intermediate policy

objective.21 It took decisive action in 1974 by reducing the growth

rate of (M2+CD's) to 11%, less than half the value of the previous year.


211n the Translator's Note to Suzuki (1980), Greenwood states that the
Bank of Japan announced its intention to pursue monetary targets in July
1974. This probably refers to an internal Bank of Japan decision; money
stock projections were first announced in 1978.

           So strong and sudden a contraction produced a serious recession.

But by the middle of 1975 the inflation rate was below double digits,

and it has stayed there; indeed it continued falling virtually

throughout except for a small rise during the second oil crisis. Since

the beginning of 1982 the inflation rate has not exceeded 2.5% on a year

over year basis. Money growth has contined to fall with the inflation

rate.

           Although the Bank of Japan has annual money growth targets it

does not announce them (Suzuki, 1985). Rather the Bank each quarter

publishes a projection of the growth rate of (M2+CD's) for the four

quarters ending at the end of that quarter.     Data for fourth quarter

           Suzuki (1985) explains the use of projections rather than

targets as giving the central bank flexibility and freeing it from

political pressures. In addition, this method of targeting has the

benefit of largely describing what has already been done. It also means

that divergences from target in the current quarter appear to be only

one quarter their actual size at an annual rate. Even so, the outcomes

are reasonably close to the projections.23 Note further that the

general trend of both projections and actuals is negative, which is

consistent with the gradual decline of the inflation rate in Japan.

The projected growth rates do change cyclically though. There was a

nearly 3% per annum increase in the growth rate in 1981 (this can be

seen also in Figure 4) and a more than 2% increase in the rate of growth

between 1983 and 1986.

           Remarkably, though, the standard errors in Tables 3 and 4 do not

show the Fed doing a significantly worse job than the Bank of Japan in

meeting the M2 target or projection. Using the "standard errors" in the

two tables, the Fed appears to come closer to attaining its N2 target

than the Bank of Japan does to its (M2+CD) projection.24 Further, the

standard deviation of the M2 outcome is lower in the U.S. than in Japan.

Germany.


231t is not possible to infer from Table 4 how accurately the Bank of
Japan meets its annual targets. One possibility is that the error
would increase more than proportionately with time because the known
initial conditions are further away; the other is that the Bank would
have more time to correct any errors.
24The comparison is not straightforward because while the Japanese data
are end of period, the U.S. data are quarterly averages, which biases
the comparison against the Japanese results. See also the preceding
footnote.

        The Bundesbank, the first central bank to announce money

targets, has targeted "central bank money" since the end of 1974.

Targets and outcomes are presented in Table 5•2 Central bank money

consists of non—bank currency plus 16.6% of demand deposits, 12.4% of

time deposits and borrowed funds, and 8.1% of savings deposits. In

origin it is equal to currency plus required reserves, a concept that

could be called the "required base", except that the required reserves

are calculated using reserve ratios of 1974. The Bundesbank describes

it rather as a weighted sum of components of the broad money stock, with

weights reflecting the liquidity of the components.

        Up till 1978 the target was quite high (relative to later

years), and the outcome higher. From 1979 the targets were given as a

range. The Bundesbank typically indicates where in the range it expects

to cone out, and why: accordingly "it has not been possible for the

announced target trange] to be interpreted arbitrarily by the general

public or by the Bundesbank itself".26 The target range was gradually

reduced from 1979; although the actual growth rate of CBM did not fall

steadily, it was lower after 1978 than before, and except in 1986 within

or below the range. Typically the Bundesbank was aiming for the lower

part of its range.

        The Bundesbank provides a precise rationale for the target,

which is obtained by a process essentially of targeting nominal GNP.

There is an allowance for unavoidable inflation, plus growth of real

GNP, typically at the growth rate of potential output, plus an estimate

of velocity change27. The real growth rate is that of potential output

because the Bundesbank tries rigorously to limit the temptation to

engage in countercyJ.ical policy. It appears to allow itself to adjust

for unemployment only within the target range: for instance, in 1982 and

1983 it aimed for the upper half of the target range explicitly because

unemployment was high.28 While it emphasizes that its primary

responsibility is to naintain the value of money, it permits deviations

in response to exchange rate movements——particularly in light of the

Deutschmark's role in the EMS—-and also interest rate movements. Any

deviation generates a detailed explanation.29

        The Fed's justification of its targets is generally less

precise, probably because it presents ranges for four variables and

sometimes more. Nor do past failures receive a careful explanation such

as that of the Bundesbank, probably again for the same reason.

        The targeting procedures and explanations provided by the

Bundesbank appear convincing and fully serious. By comparison with the

procedures of the Fed and the Bank of Japan, they raise the question of

whether CBM is the optimal target, whether there should be only one

target, and whether targets are preferable to projections. The outcome

of the Bundesbank's policies also raises the question of whether a

central bank should be directed to consider the impacts of its actions

on unemployment as well as the value of money.

United Kingdom.

        The Bank of England adopted M3 targets for internal use in 1973,

and began announcing the targets in 1976. The official explanation of

their adoption stressed the fight against inflation and the need to

anchor expectations.3° The U.K. has continued to publish an M3 (since

1977 sterling M3) target since then, but since 1982 has added other

targets, and in 1987 is tending to place more weight on MO, the monetary

base. Table 6 presents U.K. targets and outcomes.

           Table 6 should be read in conjunction with Figure 2, showing CPI

inflation. The first few years of monetary targeting appeared

successful, both in meeting targets (except for 1977) and in bringing

down the inflation rate. But then in 1980 M3 grew far in excess of the

target range as inflation returned to nearly 20%. The very high rate of

growth of M3 in 1980 can be explained as a result of reintermediation

following regulatory changes and the end of foreign exchange controls.

The Bank of England's failure to control its growth may be attributed to

its reluctance to push interest rates higher than they already were at a

time of sterling strength.
                                     33



        Because the sterling M3 demand function appeared to be breaking

down, the Bank of England added both an Ml and a broader monetary

aggregate target in 1982 and 1983.    It was not successful in bringing

those variables within the target range either. Since it appears that

MO, the monetary base has a stable relationship with nominal GNP, the

Bank has more recently switched to announcing MO targets. It has

succeeded in hitting these at the same time as inflation has come down,

though it emphasizes that it does not target MO in order to control the

money supply through the base. Rather it targets MO because of the

apparent stability of its demand function, aiming to hit that target

through adjustments of market interest rates.

        The Bank of England has not been successful in achieving its

monetary targets, and in the period up to 1982, was not successful

either at controlling the inflation rate. Since then inflation has come

down though M3 growth has remained high and unstable, and unemployment

has been high and stable.

Operating Procedures.

        There has been much controversy in the United States over the

Fed's operating procedures.3' It was argued that the Fed, although

specifying operating targets for monetary policy in terms of both

reserves and interest rates, was allowing the interest rate targets to

dominate, and therefore losing sight of the quantity targets.


31For a Federal Reserve view of the issues, see Lindsey (1986) for a
technical description of the operating procedures from 1979 to 1982, and
references, see Good±riend er al (1986).
                                   34



        In Japan, Germany, and the U.K., monetary policy is operated in

the short run largely through control of interest rates, and in Japan

and Germany also through control over the quantity of central bank

credit provided the banking system.32 Open market operations are

thought of as a means of influencing interest rates and thereby the

quantity of money demanded, rather than controlling the money base and

thus through a stable money multiplier the supply of money.

        These procedures and their rationale would be severely

criticized if the Fed were to espouse them explicitly. Nonetheless, they

have not hampered the ability of the Bank of Japan and the Bundesbank to

attain their monetary targets. Of course, both the Bank of Japan and

the Bundesbank hope to develop more efficient money and capital markets

in which to conduct open market operations, and the trend is clearly in

that direction.33 Still, it is difficult examining German and Japanese

monetary policy to believe that much of the blame for the Feds failures

to hit its monetary targets can derive from imperfections in the way it

tries to control the money stock, as opposed to conscious decisions that

the targets should not be met in a particular period.34



32Feldman (1986) provides a detailed description of the Japanese
financial system. Suzuki (1986) compares U.S. and Japanese financial
innovations; Suzuki (1987) is an extremely accessible account of the
liberalization and internationalization of Japanese financial markets,
and the implications for monetary policy. Descriptions of Bundesbank
operating procedures can be found from time to time in the Monthly
Report of the Deutsche Bundesbank "The Bundesbank's transactions in
securities under repurchase agreements", March 1983, pp.23—30 is useful.
The Bank of England's The Development and Operation of Monetary Policy
1960—1983 describes the money supply process and decisions.
Irk Japan the large government budget deficit and the consequent
increase in the supply of bonds have been instrumental in the
development of the money and bond markets.

by Dotsey (1986).

IV.   Conclusions.
          The record of policy reviewed in this paper raises questions

about the role of monetary targets, gradualism and credibility. In the

background there are also questions about the flexible exchange rate

system.

Monetary Targeting.

          Monetary targeting serves the valuable purpose of forcing the

central bank to announce its intentions for the next year, and of

explaining why it failed to meet them this year. Provided the targets

are taken seriously, targeting lends a coherence to monetary policy that

operating by the "touch and feel" of the market does not. Even where

targeting has not been successful, as in the U.K., the failures suggest

where to look for an explanation, and to some extent how to improve

policy.

          The adoption of monetary targeting does not necessarily imply

inactive policies. None of the four countries, including Japan, has

tried to keep money growth constant and all have responded to the

business cycle, to velocity shocks, and to the exchange rate.

Nominal GNP Taretina: The activist procedure explicitly followed by the

Bundesbank is the right way of doing nominal GNP targeting (Taylor,

1985). Each year a target is chosen for nominal GNP, based on the

desired breakdown between inflation and real growth. The monetary

target is then derived from target GNP and a forecast of velocity.

Approval of targeting in that fashion does not however imply that the

target real growth rate should always be the growth rate of potential

output, or that the target rate of inflation need necessarily be zero.
                                     36



How Many Goals of Policy? The Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan both

have as their main task the preservation of the value of the currency.

The Bank of Japan was able to reduce the inflation rate after 1975

without an apparent cost in terms of higher unemployment. The

Bundesbank's policies from 1979, combined with tight fiscal policy,

succeeded in wringing inflation out of the system at the expense of much

higher unemployment. There was in Germany virtually none of the respite

from monetary tightness that the Fed provided in the U.S. in 1982 as the

recession worsened. By giving the central bank both real independence

and as its primary responsibility the maintenance of price stability,

which virtually absolves it from concern over unemployment, the legal

system may produce a deflationary bias in the economy. If there is a

significant probability that the central bank will be the main economic

policymaker——and the growing immobilization of countercyclical fiscal

policy makes that increasingly the case——there is good reason to require

it to give weight to unemployment as well as inflation when making its

decisions .

Projections   v. Taraets: The choice between "projections" and "targets"

is a subtle one. The Bank of Japan has in the last few years maintained

stable money growth and stable projections, and presumably therefore it

has also been attaining its unpublished targets. At the same time, by

projecting only for the current quarter, it leaves itself great


35The question arises of whether central bank policy has any influence
on real variables like the rate of unemployment. There is much evidence
that expansionary policy can in the short run lead to an expansion of
output; if some hysteresis—like view of the economy is correct, then
such short—run changes in output tend to be permanent.
                                   37



flexibility for any longer period. Its credibility appears sufficient

for the projections to be regarded as targets. It is unlikely that

other central banks can rely on being able to achieve similar "targeting

without targets" in the near future.

How Many Money Targets? The Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan have each

elected to focus on just one monetary variable, the Fed on many, and the

Bank of England sometimes one and sometimes more. There is a strong

theoretical justification for the multi—target view, arising from the

fact that the central bank in fact influences many monetary variables,

each of which has a slightly different and uncertain effect on ultimate

target variables——and feedback from which makes it easier for the

monetary authority to decipher changes in the economy. By using several

targets, including perhaps interest rates (and a rule for deciding how

to compromise when they cannot all be attained) the central bank reduces

the uncertainty about the effects of its actions on the economy.    For

instance, the failure of the Fed to meet its Ni targets on many

occasions appears less serious when it does come close to achieving the

other targets.

        Nonetheless, the clarity of the one—variable approach is

appealing, both in its impact as a signal, and for the consistency it

might force on the central bank. If it could be shown empirically that

there was little to be gained (in an expected utility sense) by having

more than one money target——for instance because the correlation between

one of the monetary variables closely controllable by the central bank

and nominal GNP was exceptionally close—-it might be worthwhile

narrowing the list of targets to one.
                                    38



        In both Japan and Germany the single targeted monetary variable

has smaller variance of velocity than that of other money concepts.36

In the U.K. M3 velocity has been highly unstable, which partly accounts

for the shift to MO targeting. In the U.S. M2 velocity is more stable

than that of Ml, though less stable than the velocity of 113.   On the

basis of the stability of its velocity and the Fed's success in hitting

that target, 112 currently would appear to be a useful target variable——

even though the collection of assets in 112 has little analytic

coherence, and it would remain to be seen whether a switch to 112

targeting would put Goodhart's Law into effect and destroy the relative

stability of 112 velocity.

Gradualism and Credibility.

        After a sharp change in money growth and a deep recession in

1974, the Bank of Japan succeeded in gradually reducing both money

growth and inflation over the succeeding decade, with an interruption

from the second oil shock. The short sharp shock worked for the Bank of

Japan. But it did not work for the Bundesbank. After bringing down

inflation in 1973—74, the Bundesbank faced generally rising inflation

until the second oil shock and then was only able to reduce inflation by

creating and maintaining high unemployment. Similarly, both the Fed and

t1Bak of England had to create massive recessions in the early

eie p get the Lnflatlon rate down, despite their successes at
                      the first oil shock

target variable, but an   practice predictability and variability are

                                   39



        It is easy to believe that the Bank of England lacked

credibility, and that the Fed lacked credibility until 1982. But why

should that have been true of the Bundesbank? Perhaps, though it is

unlikely, it had tolerated too high inflation in the late seventies.

Any analysis that stresses credibility has to explain why the inflation

rate came down in Japan with only one recession, while it took two or

three recessions for each of the other countries, and in two of them

prolonged high unemployment.

        The difference nay lie much more with the workforce than with

the policymakers. Whereas nominal wage increases rose in each of the

other three countries in the second oil shock, Japanese wage inflation

did not. If it had, the Bank of Japan would have created another

recession. That threat is not sufficient to stop wage increases——in

evidence, note that the Bundesbank's implicit threat had to be carried

out when wage inflation increased in Germany in 1981.

        U.S. policy after 1982 also suggests that credibility is not a

simple function of money growth performance (Blanchard,1987). Ml growth

in the U.S. has been higher in the period since 1982 than over any

comparable period. There has been no perceptible impact on sensitive

asset market variables, such as interest rates, let alone on wages or

prices. Obviously the markets believe that the Ml growth signifies

nothing about future inflation. They are probably right.

        The lesson is that someone with credibility can do and explain

sensible actions that at other times would be viewed with the greatest

suspicion. Further, I believe the lesson is also that credibility is
                                   40



earned by successful outcomes, rather than by holding rigorously to

intermediate targets. This is the case for not attempting to force

central banks to hold strictly to their money targets in the face of

shifts in velocity or other relevant circumstances.

Exchange Rates.

        Exchange rates and current account imbalances have received

little explicit attention in this paper. In the U.K. and Germany

monetary policy has at times been dominated by the behavior of the

exchange rate. That was true in the United States in 1978, and may be

about to happen in Japan now.

        However this does not suggest that the U.S., Japan and Germany

will anytime soon be willing to forego monetary independence in the

interests of stabilizing exchange rates. Bundesbank reports make it

clear time and time again that it views price stability as the

overriding goal. European countries that want to accept or attain the

German inflation rate can join the EMS, and Britain may do that soon.

The U.S. is less concerned with inflation relative to unemployment than

is Germany, which means that a newly fixed dollar—DN exchange rate would

suffer the same fate it did in the early seventies——particularly given

divergent fiscal policies. Since Japan's inflation preferences are

different from those of the U.S., and its trading patterns are different

from those of Europe, it is unlikely to fix exchange rates against

either the dollar or the D1.
