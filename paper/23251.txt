Abstract

The paper links Israel’s brain drain to skill-based immigration policies, prevailing in the
advanced economies.




Economic basic principles imply that both low-skill and high-skill immigration enrich the

workforce, thereby allow for a more finely graded specialization that raises average productivity,

and living standards. Diverse workforces are likely to be more productive, especially in

industries where success depends on specific knowledge, such as computing, health care and

finance. By easing labor bottlenecks, migrants help to keep down prices of goods and services.


However, in the confines of the generous welfare state, low skill immigrants impose fiscal

burden on the native born. In contrast, high-skill immigrants help in relieving the burden. This is

the economic rationale behind skill-based immigration policies. The other side of the skill bias in

immigration policy is that the international migration of skilled workers (the so-called brain

drain) deprives the origin country from its scarce resource—human capital. In setting up a

migration policy, one is certainly concerned by the skill composition of immigrants is a crucial

factor. Naturally, highly- skilled immigrants are more attractive to the destination countries than
low-skilled, immigrants for a variety of reasons are. For instance, highly- skilled immigrants are

expected to pay more in taxes to the Fisc in excess of what the Fisc provides them with. In

addition, these immigrants are also expected to boost the technological edge of their destination

countries. In contrast, low-skilled immigrants tend to depress the low-skill wages of the native-

born, and they are deemed to impose a burden on the fiscal system.


The skill composition of immigrants to OECD countries other than the US, Australia, Canada

and Ireland is skewed towards the low education group, thanks to the less rigorous screening of

immigration policies. Australia, Canada, and US high-skill biased policy is shown in Table 11.

 Razin and Sadka (2014) argue that the differences between the U.S. and the EU relate to the
degree of fiscal and migration coordination among the member states of the economic unions (
EU vs US) and the difference in the aging of the population between them.

1. Understanding the Essence of Skill-Based Immigration Policy



How does the size of the welfare state affect the skill composition of immigration? A more

generous welfare state is more attractive to low-skilled immigrants, known as the magnet effect

(Borjas 1999). This is a supply-side explanation for the different composition of immigrants in

the US and Europe. Europe, with its generous welfare states, is an attractive destination for low-

skilled immigrants, but far less so for high-skilled immigrants who are likely to be net fiscal

contributors. Indeed, the demand for immigrants, however, goes in the opposite direction. A

more generous welfare state (particularly with an aging population) has financing needs that




individuals for the F1 (student) or J1 (exchange visitor) visas (see Kerr et al (2016)). While these
visas do not offer long-term employment, US firms often recruit graduates of US schools using
visas like the H-1B. An advantage of employment-based immigration- policy regime compared
to a points-based approach is that the job-market search process is more efficient in the former
case. The employer-employee match is guaranteed to connect the immigrant talent with a
productive and adequate job.
immigrants could fill. With high-skilled immigrants more likely to pay in rather than draw on the

welfare state, more generous welfare states are more inclined to try to attract high skilled.3


To highlight skill-migration demand side forces I present a minimalist model that features two

migration regimes: free-migration and policy-controlled migration regimes. In summary, the

policy-controlled migration regime leads to a positive effect of the welfare benefits on the skill

composition of migration rates, because voters will internalize the fact that skilled migrants will

be net contributors to the system (i.e., the fiscal burden effect), whereas unskilled migrants will

be net beneficiaries (i.e., the social magnet effect). Under the free-migration regime, unskilled

migrants will gravitate to a generous welfare state, while skilled migrants will be deterred.


       I assume a Cobb–Douglas production function, with two labor inputs, skilled and

       unskilled:


                                                                (1)

Here, Y is the GDP, A denotes a Hicks-neutral productivity parameter, and       denotes the input of

labor of skill level i, where       e, u for skilled and unskilled, respectively. Wages,         , are

competitive and equal to the marginal productivity of .


Aggregate labor supply, for skilled and unskilled workers, respectively, is given by

 Why have European countries been unsuccessful in either encouraging high-skill immigration
or in limiting the size of their welfare state? Razin and Sadka (2014) take a page out of the vast
work on tax competition to provide insights. They argue that fiscal independence in a migration
union like Schengen leads to policy distortions. Schengen members do not fully internalize the
degree to which their generous welfare states attract immigrants, as the costs of immigration are
borne by the union as a whole. This the need for fiscal unity in a common immigration zone is
novel. See Ilzetzki (2016).
                                                               (2)
                                                                     (3)

Here, denotes the individual labor supply, e denotes the share of native-born skilled workers in

the total native-born labor supply, σ denotes the share of skilled migrants in the total number of

migrants, μ denotes the total number of migrants, and is the labor supply of an individual with

skill level i, . The total population (N) is comprised of native-born workers (which is normalized

to 1) and migrants (μ).


We specify a simple welfare-state system, which levies a proportional labor income tax at the

rate τ, with the revenues redistributed equally to all residents, N, as social benefit per capita, b.

The social benefit captures not only a cash transfer but also outlays on public services, such as

education, health, and other provisions, which benefit all workers, regardless of their

contribution to the tax revenues.


The government budget constraint is therefore


                                                         (4)

Assume that the utility function for skill type i,         , is



                                                                     (5)

Where    denotes consumption of an individual with skill level i, denotes the individual labor
supply, and      . The budget constraint of an individual with skill level i is

                                                               (6)

Individual utility-maximization yields the following labor supply equation:
                                                              (7)

The general equilibrium wages for skilled and unskilled workers are

                                                                    (8)
                                                                    (9)

Where,

                                                          , and

                                                                       .

The host-country migration policy is to be determined by the median voter in the host country.

Let us assume that the policy decisions on the tax rate τ and the total volume of migration μ are

exogenous. We do this in order to focus the analysis on a single endogenous policy variable,

which is the skill composition of migrants (i.e., σ). Note that once σ, μ, and τ are determined,

then the social benefit per capita, b, is given by the government budget constraint. Thus, we

denote the social benefit per capita, b, as       , where the exogenous variable μ is suppressed.


The indirect utility of an individual with skill level i is given by



                                                                           (10)

Differentiating the equation with respect to σ, and employing the envelope theorem, yields



                                                                           (11)

Thus, a policy-induced change in the share of skilled migrants in the total number of migrants, σ,

affects the utility level through two channels. First, an increase in σ raises average labor

productivity and thereby tax revenues. This, in turn, raises the social benefit per capita, b.
Second, an increase in σ, which raises the supply of skilled labor relative to the supply of

unskilled labor, depresses the skill premium in the labor market. If the decisive voter is unskilled,

both of the above effects increase his utility. Thus, an unskilled voter would like to set the skill

composition of migrants at the maximal limit,              . This means that the share of skilled

migrants preferred by the decisive skilled voter is typically lower than that preferred by the

decisive unskilled voter. The decisive skilled voter would like to set σ below 1 (which is

equivalent to assuming that the first-order condition is met before σ reaches 1).


Let superscript i denote the choice of the skill mix of immigrants by a decisive voter i ; i = u, e.

Define     as the share of skilled immigrants most preferred by an individual with skill level

         in the host country, we obtain




Recall that the purpose is to find the effect of the change in the generosity of the welfare state on
the migration policy concerning σ. The generosity of the welfare state, captured by the
magnitude of the social benefit per capita, b, depends positively on the tax rate, τ (we assume
that the economy is on the “correct side” of the Laffer curve). Thus, we examine the effect of an
increase in τ on the change in the skill composition of the migrants, σ. It can be shown that


                                                                (12)

 d u           d e
       0, sign       ?.
  dA             dA

This means that, if the decisive voter were an unskilled worker, an increase in the tax rate τ

would leave the skill migration policy unchanged, because it is always set at the maximum

possible limit. However, if the decisive voter is a skilled worker, an increase in the tax rate τ will

change the policy concerning the skill composition of migrants in the direction towards a larger
share of skilled migrants. The reason for this is that when the tax rate is higher, the redistribution

burden upon a skilled decisive voter increases. Allowing an additional skilled migrant can ease

this rise in the fiscal burden. Note also that the result applies to the skill mix of migration rates.


Under skill native-born control, the effect of domestic productivity increase on the skill mix of

                                          d e
immigration is to improve the mix, ( sign       ? ). On one hand, the increase in the wage
                                           dA

premium also raises tax revenues and eases the fiscal burden. This force makes unskilled

migrants less burdensome to the Fisc. At the same time the increase in productivity also raises

the efficiency gains, and mitigate the of the skill-labor wage, which makes the influx of skilled

migrants desirable.


2. Skill Composition of Immigration: Empirical Analysis

While immigration from poor countries often invokes images of large masses of unskilled

laborers, in reality it has been quite skill-intensive. The composition of immigrants into high-

income countries, even if they originate from countries with lower income per person, tends to

be more concentrated among highly educated than among less educated, relative to the

population of the country of destination (see Peri (2016)).


The explanation for the concentration of rich-country immigrants among the highly educated is

the screening and selection migration policies by the destination countries.


In this context, Razin and Wahba (2015) researched two hypotheses associated with migration

skill mix: The fiscal burden hypothesis and the magnet hypothesis. The former asserts that under

host-country migration policy, the rise in the generosity of the welfare state will skew the skill

mix towards skilled migrants because they can ease fiscal burden. The second hypothesis asserts
that under free migration, would be low skilled migrants will be more attracted to the welfare

state so that a more generous welfare state will have its skill mix skewed towards the low skilled

migrants. Accordingly, they investigate the effect of welfare state generosity on the difference

between skilled and unskilled migration rates, and the role of mobility restriction in shaping this

effect. They utilize the free labor movement within the European Union plus Norway and

Switzerland (EUROPE) and the restricted movement from outside the EUROPE in order to

compare the free-migration regime to the controlled-migration regime. Using bilateral migration

movements, and splitting the sample among flows within EUROPE, and flows from outside

EUROPE, they identify the migration regime effect. In Table 2 the dependent variable is the

share of skilled migrants in the migrant population, and the main explanatory variable is

"benefits per capita" –a measure of the generosity of the welfare state. The hypothesis is that

under free migration the coefficient of this variable is negative whereas under controlled

migration coefficient of "benefits per capita multiplied by R" is positive. The indicator X is a

dummy variable: R=1, if migration is controlled, whereas R=0, if migration is free. Recall the bi

lateral migration flows within EUROPE are referred to as free migration, whereas bi lateral

migration flows where the SOURCE is outside and the DESTINATION is inside EUROPE are

referred to as controlled migration. Appendix 10A includes some robustness tests of the model.

In the regression analysis (see also the Appendix) Razin and Wahba (2015) control for

differences in educational quality and returns to skills in source and host countries, and for

endogeneity bias (by using instrumental variables). Overall, the fiscal burden and the magnet

hypotheses, tested with the coefficient of social benefit in the regressions, are statistically

significant.4 Therefore, regression findings yield support for the magnet hypothesis under the

free-migration regime, and to the fiscal burden hypothesis, under the restricted-migration regime.

    3. Brain Drain: international comparison


Kerr et al (2016) observe that the number of migrants with a tertiary degree rose by nearly 130

percent from 1990 to 2010, while low-skill (primary educated) migrants increased by only 40

percent during that time. High-skilled migrants are departing from a broader range of countries

and heading to a narrower range of countries—in particular, to the United States, the United

Kingdom, Canada, and Australia.5 At the policy level, they compare the points-based skilled

migration regimes as historically implemented by Canada and Australia with the employment-

based policies used in the United States through visa-control mechanisms, like the H-1B visa

program. Because of the links of global migration flows to employment and higher education

opportunities, firms and universities also act as important conduits, making employment and

admission decisions that deeply affect the patterns of high-skilled mobility.




Gould and Moav (2007) focus on 28 countries, which represent the largest exporters of

immigrants to the United States. The sample includes mostly advanced economies. Table 2

shows that the average index of emigration, (i.e., the number of emigres per 10,000 residents) is

33.36, with the index for Israel being nearly three times as high: 95.51. Only two countries have

a higher index––Ireland (143.9) and Portugal (99.21). When examining the index for educated

émigrés, i.e., those with a college degree, the average index is 12.41 and Israel's index is more

than three times higher, 41.45. Using this index, Israel is now higher than Portugal and the gap

between Israel and Ireland (49.09) narrows considerably. (See Table 8.2).

 Kerr et al (2015) give suggestive examples showing how global migration may be most pronounced for those at the
very outer tail of the talent distribution.
Table 3 presents international indicators selective indicators of Emigration to the US by

Education Attainment. Israel is ranked at the very top for college graduate emigres per 10000

residents to the US; with number of about 41; only Ireland with a number 49 is ranked above

Israel. South Korea, suffering also from brain drain, has only about 25 college graduate emigres

per 10000 of its residents.

4. Israel’s Brain Drain




US serves as a magnet for top scientific immigrants. US immigrants hold a disproportionate

share of jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) occupations in the United

States (see Hanson and Slaughter (2016)). Top talent drain from Israel is disproportionately high

among the high-end immigrants.


In general, the ratio of foreign scholars in America to scholars in the home country ranged from

1.3% in Spain to 4.3% in the Netherlands (Figure 1). At 12.2%, Canada was an outlier, though

this is much more of a two-way street than in any of the other cases. While Canada is an outlier,

Israeli scholars in America are in a class by themselves. The Israeli academics residing in the

States in 2003-2004 represented 24.9% of the entire senior staff in Israel’s academic institutions

that year – twice the Canadian ratio and over five times the ratio in the other developed

countries.


Figure 1 describes the percentage of home country academic scholars who have academic

position in US universities. Figure 2 similarly describes Israel scholars in percentage of Israel

Universities’ senior faculty) in in the top US universities.

Israel supply of high skill workers is unique. Today, Israel ranks third in the world in the number

of university graduates per capita, after the United States and the Netherlands. It possesses the

highest per capita number of scientists in the world, with 135 for every 10,000 citizens

(compared to 85 per 10,000 in the United States), and publishes the highest number of scientific

papers per capita. However, brain drain in academia is exceptionally high. Ban David (2008)

demonstrates how differences between universities are inducing a massive academic migration

from Israel to the United States. The magnitude of this scholarly brain drain is unparalleled in the

western world. (See Figures 1 and 2). European Commission (2003) reported that 73% of the

15,000 Europeans who studied for their PhD in the States between 1991 and 2000 plan to remain
in America. If Europeans are concerned about the migration of their academics to the States, then

Israelis should be nothing less than alarmed.

4. Conclusion


Even though the overall education attainment level of Israel (native born) labor force is highly

ranked currently, schooling gaps develop. Israel, currently, has below average school gap among

advanced economies. A test score of 4.686 compared to the group average 4.939. See Table 9.1.

Appendix A: Immigrant Skill Composition: Robustness Tests


Razin and Wahba (2015) utilize the free labor movement within the European Union plus

Norway and Switzerland (EUROPE) and the restricted movement from outside the EUROPE in

order to compare the free-migration regime to the controlled-migration regime. Using bilateral

migration movements, and splitting the sample among flows within EUROPE, and flows from

outside EUROPE, they identify in Table 1 the migration regime effect. Robustness tests are

shown in Tables A2-A4. The dependent variable is the share of skilled migrants in the migrant

population, and the main explanatory variable is "benefits per capita" –a measure of the

generosity of the welfare state. The hypothesis is that under free migration the coefficient of this

variable is negative whereas under controlled migration coefficient of "benefits per capita

multiplied by R" is positive. The indicator X is a dummy variable: R=1,             if migration is

controlled, whereas R=0, if migration is free. Recall the bi lateral migration flows within

EUROPE are referred to as free migration, whereas bilateral migration flows where the

SOURCE is outside and the DESTINATION is inside EUROPE are referred to as controlled

migration.

Notes: All the migration rates are adjusted for the quality of education by relative quality in
source to host, i.e. REQ = (EQs/EQh) , F=Free migration; R=Restricted migration. Instrumented
using legal origin dummies, and the interaction of legal origin dummies and R. Regressions
include real GDP per capita growth rate in host, log distance, dummy for same language in host
and source, strong dummy between host and source, and real GDP per capita in host and in
source countries. Robust standard errors in parentheses; * significant at 10%; ** significant at
5%; *** significant at 1%.



Table A2-A4 describe the skill mix-benefit correlations under various econometric

specifications. Overall, the fiscal burden and the magnet hypotheses, tested with the coefficient

of social benefit in the regressions, are statistically significant. Therefore, regression findings

yield support for the magnet hypothesis under the free-migration regime, and to the fiscal burden

hypothesis, under the restricted-migration regime. In the regression analysis Razin and Wahba

(2015) control for differences in educational quality and returns to skills in source and host

countries, and for endogeneity bias (by using instrumental variables).
