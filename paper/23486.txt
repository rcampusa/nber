Maimonides Rule Redux

                                          ABSTRACT

We use the discontinuous function of enrollment known as Maimonides Rule as an instrument for
class size in large Israeli samples from 2002-2011. As in the 1991 data analyzed by Angrist and
Lavy (1999), Maimonides Rule still has a strong first stage. In contrast with the earlier Israeli
estimates, however, Maimonides-based instrumental variables estimates using more recent data
show no effect of class size on achievement. The new data also reveal substantial enrollment
sorting near Maimonides cutoffs, with too many schools having enrollment values that just barely
produce an extra class. A modified rule that uses data on students’ birthdays to compute statutory
enrollment in the absence of enrollment manipulation also generates a precisely estimated zero.
In older data, the original Maimonides Rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics, while
in more recent data, the original rule is unrelated to socioeconomic characteristics conditional on
a few controls. Enrollment manipulation therefore appears to be innocuous: neither the original
negative effects nor the recent data zeros seem likely to be manipulation artifacts.

1     Introduction
The Maimonides Rule research design for estimation of class size effects exploits statutory
limits on class size as a source of quasi-experimental variation. As first noted by Angrist
and Lavy (1999), Israeli schools face a maximum class size of 40, so that, in principle, grade
cohorts of 41 are split into two classes, while slightly smaller cohorts of 39 may be taught
in one large class. This produces a distinctive sawtooth pattern in average class size as a
function of total grade level enrollment, a pattern seen in Israeli data on enrollment and class
size as well in data from school districts around the world.
    Analyzing data on class average scores for the population of Israeli 4th and 5th graders
tested in June 1991, Angrist and Lavy (1999) found a substantial return to class size reduc-
tions – on the order of that found in a randomized evaluation of class size for US elementary
grades (discussed by Krueger 1999). Many applications of the Maimonides Rule research
design in other settings also report statistically significant learning gains in smaller classes
(see, e.g, the Urquiola 2006 results for Bolivia). Other studies exploiting Maimonides Rule,
however, find little evidence of achievement gains from Rule-induced class size reductions (as
in the Angrist, Battistin and Vuri 2016 study of Italian schools).
    This paper revisits the class size question for Israel with more recent data and a larger
sample than that used in Angrist and Lavy (1999). Specifically, we look at a large elementary
school sample drawn from national exams taken by Israeli 5th graders between the school year
ending spring 2002 and the school year ending spring 2011. Our empirical update uncovers
two clear findings. First, an econometric analysis paralleling that in Angrist and Lavy (1999)
generates robust, precisely estimated zeros. Second, the new data reveal substantial sorting
at Maimonides enrollment cutoffs: there are too many schools with enrollment values that
produce an additional class. This juxtaposition of findings raise the possibility that the lack
of an enrollment effect since 2002 is an artifact of systematic enrollment manipulation.
    Our investigation of enrollment patterns suggests a simple explanation for enrollment
manipulation, and allows a straightforward remedy. A recent memo from Israeli Ministry
of Education (MOE) officials to school leaders admonishes headmasters against attempts to
increase staffing ratios through enrollment manipulation. In particular, schools are warned
not to move students between grades or to enroll those who are overseas so as to produce



                                               1
an additional class. This reflects Ministry concerns that school staff adjust enrollment (or
enrollment statistics) when these values are close to cutoffs so as to produce smaller classes
(e.g., by driving enrollment in first grade from 40 to 41, and thereby opening a second first-
grade class). School leaders might care to do this because educators and parents prefer
smaller classes. The tendency to favor smaller classes is also accentuated by MOE rules that
set school budgets as an increasing function of the number of classes.
      School leaders appear to manipulate enrollment by flexibly applying age-at-entry rules
and moving students between grades. We therefore resolve the problem of enrollment manip-
ulation by constructing an alternative version of Maimonides Rule that is largely unaffected
by manipulation. The alternative rule pools data on students in 4th-6th grade and uses
information on their birthdays to construct a new enrollment variable, which we refer to as
“birthday-based imputed enrollment,” or just “imputed enrollment.” This variable is com-
puted by applying the official (Chanukah-based) birthday cutoff for 5th grade enrollment to
a sample that includes all students in 4th-6th grade with birth dates that make them eligi-
ble for 5th grade. Imputed enrollment also generates a strong first stage for class size, but
with no evidence of sorting around birthday-based Maimonides cutoffs. Importantly, class
size effects estimated using the statutory rule are also small, precisely estimated, and not
significantly different from zero. Consistent with the absence of evidence of imputed enroll-
ment manipulation, Maimonides Rule constructed from imputed enrollment is unrelated to
socioeconomic status.
      Finally, we return to the 1991 data analyzed by Angrist and Lavy (1999). As first noted
by Otsu, Xu and Matsushita (2013), these data show evidence of sorting around the first
Maimonides cutoff.1 As in the more recent data, however, enrollment sorting in the original
Maimonides sample does not appear to be highly consequential for class size effects. In
particular, we show that the original formulation of the rule (constructed using November
enrollment) is unrelated to students’ socioeconomic status. More recent data generate small
estimated effects of Maimonides Rule on socioeconomic status, but these effects disappear
(while becoming more precise) when estimated with a few school-level controls.
      The birthday-based imputation used to eliminate sorting in recent data cannot be applied
  1
    Figure 2 in Otsu, Xu and Matsushita (2013) appears to exaggerate this; we report corrected estimates
of the 1991 sorting pattern, below.



                                                   2
in the older data because birthdays and individual test scores are unavailable for the earlier
period. But other simple corrections, such as “donut” estimation strategy that discards
observations near the first cutoff, leave the original results substantively unchanged.2 The
discrepancy between the old and new class size effects therefore seems more likely to be due
to a change in the Israeli education production function rather than a sorting artifact. In
light of the 2002-2011 results, the evidence for a large, externally valid class size effect in
Angrist and Lavy (1999) also seems weaker in hindsight.
   It also now seems more relevant that estimates for a 1992 sample of 3rd graders reported
in Angrist and Lavy (1999) likewise show no evidence of achievement gains in smaller classes.
The 1999 paper argued that the tests given in 1992 may have been compromised. In par-
ticular, the score distribution in 1992 appears to reflect a nationwide test preparation effort
focused on weaker performers in 1991. This effort, which appears to have continued in later
years to one degree or another, may have reduced the information the test scores contain
about learning and causal effects. On the other hand, though the test preparation effort has
varied in intensity and mostly focused on weaker schools, our results are consistent in showing
no causal effects of class size over time and when interacted with school SES. Finally, use of a
more modern cluster adjustment in place of the parametric Moulton correction for clustering
used in the original Maimonides Rule study also increases the uncertainty associated with
the original estimates.
   The next section reviews institutional background on the Israeli school system. We
then document the Maimonides first stage in our more recent sample, explain how our
birthday-based Maimonides instrument is constructed, and show that birthday-based impu-
tation shows no evidence of running variable manipulation. Section 4 reports two-stage least
squares (2SLS) estimates using the two alternative Maimonides’ instruments and Section 5
looks again at the 1991 and 1992 samples. We conclude by discussing possible explanations
for changes in class size effects.

     Barreca et al. (2011) appears to be the first to use the donut strategy to examine the consequences of
sorting near regression discontinuity cutoffs.

2    Background and Context
Israeli Schools

Schooling in Israel is compulsory beginning in first grade, starting around age 6. Israeli
students attend neighborhood schools, which serve catchment areas determined by a student’s
home address. Israel runs three public school systems: Jewish secular, Jewish public religious,
and Arab (roughly 20% of Israel’s population is Arab). There is also a smaller publicly
funded but essentially independent ultra-orthodox system. Our analysis focus on secular
and religious students in Jewish public schools, the group that constitutes the bulk of public
school enrollment.
    Public schools are administered by local authorities, but funded centrally by the MOE.
Maimonides Rule, which caps class sizes at 40, has determined official practice for purposes
of class assignment and school budgeting since 1969. The rule is well-known among school
administrators and teachers. Other than through switching sectors, unappealing to most
families, most parents have few options by way of school choice other than to move. We
therefore expect any manipulation of enrollment to reflect the behavior of educators and
school administrators rather than parents.


Related Work

Maimonides-style empirical strategies have been used to identify class size effects in many
countries, including the US (Hoxby 2000), France (Piketty 2004 and Gary-Bobo and Mahjoub
2006), Norway (Bonesronning 2003 and Leuven, Oosterbeek and Ronning 2008), Bolivia
(Urquiola 2006), and the Netherlands (Dobbelsteen, Levin and Oosterbeek 2002). On bal-
ance, these results point to modest returns to class size reductions, though mostly smaller
than those reported by Angrist and Lavy (1999) for Israel. A natural explanation for this dif-
ference in findings is the relatively large size of Israeli elementary school classes. In line with
this view, Woessmann (2005) finds a weak association between class size and achievement
in a cross-country panel covering Western European school systems in which classes tend to
be small. Recently published regression estimates for Israeli using 2006 and 2009 data show
no evidence of a class size effect; this study documents the vigorous debate over class size in



                                                4
Israel and policies meant to bring about a reduction (Shafrir, Shavit and Blank, 2016).3
        A number of studies look at data manipulation and how this might compromise attempts
to estimate causal class size effects. Urquiola and Verhoogen (2009) uncover evidence of
sorting around Maimonides cutoffs in a sample from Chilean private schools. Angrist, Bat-
tistin and Vuri (2016) show that estimates from Maimonides style experiments in southern
Italy probably reflect increased manipulation of test scores by teachers in small classes. As
noted above, Otsu, Xu, and Matsushita (2013) report evidence of sorting around the first
Maimonides cutoff in the Angrist and Lavy (1999) sample; we return to this finding below. In
related literature, Jacob and Levitt (2003) document manipulation of test scores in Chicago
public schools.
        Methodological investigations of sorting in a regression discontinuity (RD) running vari-
able originate with McCrary (2008), who introduced the statistical test for sorting used here.
Barreca, Lindo and Waddell (2016) show that manipulation and nonrandom heaping of the
running variable can bias regression discontinuity estimates. Barreca et al. (2011) explore
manipulation of the birthweight data used by Almond et al. (2010) to identify the causal
effects of neonatal health care. Gerard, Rokkanen and Rothe (2016) derive bounds on causal
effects estimated using regression discontinuity designs that are built on running variables
which have been compromised by sorting.



3         Data and First Stage
Data and Descriptive Statistics

The test scores used in this study come from a national testing program known as Growth
and Effectiveness Measures for Schools, or GEMS. Starting in 2002, fifth graders in half of
Israeli schools have been sampled for participation in GEMS.4 Tests are given in math, native
language skills (Hebrew or Arabic), science and English. We standardized GEMS test scores
to have zero mean and unit variance in each subject and year. The appendix describes the
raw GEMS data and our standardization process further.
        Data on test scores were matched to administrative information describing schools, classes,
    3
      Results in Sims (2008) suggest class size reductions obtained through combination classes have a negative
effect on students’ achievement.
    4
      GEMS also tests eighth graders.

                                                      5
and students. The unit of observation for most of our statistical analyses is the student.
School records include information on the enrollment figures reported by headmasters to the
ministry of education each November. This enrollment variable, henceforth called “November
enrollment”, is used by the MOE to determine school budgets. We also have data on class size
collected at the end of the school year, in June. We refer to the end-of-year class size variable
as “June class size”. Individual student characteristics in the file include gender, parents’
education, number of siblings, and ethnicity. Schools in the GEMS samples are identified
as secular or religious. Each school is also associated with an index of socioeconomic status
(SES index).5
       Our statistical analysis looks at fifth grade pupils in the Jewish public school system,
including both secular and religious schools. Our analysis excludes students in the special
education system, since these students do not take GEMS tests. Special education students
attend regular schools but mostly receive instruction in separate classes.
       Our analysis covers data from 2002 through 2011. We start with 2002 since this was
the first year of the GEMS tests. In 2012, the MOE began implementing a national plan
to reduce class size, rendering Maimonides’ Rule less relevant (Vurgan 2011). We focus on
math and (Hebrew) language; results for other subjects are reported in Appendix Tables A1
and A2.
       The matched analysis file includes 243,213 fifth grade students from 8,944 classes. The
data structure is a repeated cross-section; the sample of GEMS schools changes from year to
year. As can be seen in Table 1, which reports descriptive statistics for classes, students, and
schools in the estimation sample, the average elementary school class in our data has about
28 pupils, and there are roughly 59 pupils per grade with roughly two classes on average.
Ten percent of classes have more than 35 pupils, and 10 percent have fewer than 21 pupils.
Median class size is also 28. Demographic data show that 89 percent of students are Israeli-
born. Many in the sample are the children of immigrants; 16 percent are the children of
immigrants from the former Soviet Union, for example (this variable is labeled “former USSR
ethnicity”). Although our statistical analyses use standardized scores, Panel C shows the

    The school SES index is an average of the index for its students. Student SES is a weighted average of
values assigned to parents’ schooling and income, economic status, immigrant status and former nationality,
and the school’s location (urban or peripheral). The index ranges from 1-10, with 1 representing the highest
socioeconomic level. Schools with more disadvantaged students (high SES index) receive more funding per
student. We observe only the school average SES.

The Maimonides First Stage

Maimonides’ Rule reflects MOE regulations requiring that classes be split when they reach
the statutory maximum of 40. Strict application of the rule produces class sizes that are a
non-linear and discontinuous function of enrollment. Writing fjt for the predicted 5th grade
class size at school j in year t, we can write rule-based enrollment as
                                                         rjt
                                     fjt =                             ,                             (1)
                                             [int ((rjt − 1) /40) + 1]
where rjt is November grade enrollment at school j in year t, and int(x ) is the largest integer
less than or equal to x .
       Figure 1 plots actual average June class size and rule-based predictions, fjt , against
November enrollment. Plotted points show the average June class size at each level of enroll-
ment. The fit here looks similar to that reported using 1991 data in Angrist and Lavy (1999).
Maimonides Rule fits actual class size better for enrollments below 100 that at larger values,
a pattern that reflects more deviations from the rule at large values and few schools with
such large enrollments. Predicted discontinuities in the class size/enrollment relationship are
also rounded by the fact that many classes are split before reaching the theoretical maximum
of 40.
       The first-stage effect of fjt on class size is estimated by fitting

                                sijt = πfjt + ρ1 rjt + δ1 Xijt + γt + εijt                           (2)

where sijt is the June class size experienced by student i enrolled in school j and year t; Xijt
is a time-varying vector of student and school characteristics, fjt is as defined above, and
εijt is a regression error term. The student characteristics in this model include a gender
dummy, both parents’ years of schooling, number of siblings, a born-in-Israel indicator and
ethnic-origin indicators. School characteristics include an indicator for religious schools, the
school SES index, and interactions of the SES index with year dummies.6 We also include
year fixed effects (γ t ) and control for alternative functions of the running variable, rjt , as
   6
    The interactions of the SES index with year dummies control for changes in the weights and the compo-
nents of the index implemented in 2004 and 2008.

described below.
      Estimates of π in Equation (2) are remarkably stable at around .62. This can be seen
in Table 2, which reports first stage estimates using a variety of running variable controls,
including linear and quadratic functions of enrollment and the piecewise linear trend used by
Angrist and Lavy (1999). This trend function picks up the slope on the linear segments of
the rule. Specifically, the trend is defined on the interval [0,200] as follows:

                                             rjt       rjt ∈ [0, 40]

                                     20 + rjt /2       rjt ∈ [41, 80]

                                 100/3 + rjt /3        rjt ∈ [81, 120]

                                 130/3 + rjt /4        rjt ∈ [121, 160]

                                 154/3 + rjt /5        rjt ∈ [161, 200]

The constants here join the Maimonides linear segments at the cutoffs.7


Sorting Out Enrollment Sorting

The budget for Israeli primary schools comes from local municipal authorities and the national
MOE. The local authority funds administrative costs, while the MOE funds teaching and
other educational activities. The MOE’s budget for instruction time is based on the predicted
number of classes determined by the November enrollment figures reported to the MOE
(Ministry of Education 2015a). This generates an incentive to manipulate enrollment, either
directly by moving students between grades or through false reporting.8
      As first noted by McCrary (2008), running variable manipulation should be evident in
the running variable distribution. Figure 2 shows the histogram of November enrollment in
our 2002-11 sample, tabulated using a 1-student bin size. Vertical lines indicate Maimonides
cutoffs. The figure shows a clear spike in enrollment just to the right of the cutoffs at 40 and
80, with apparent holes in the distribution to the left.
      The forces producing these spikes are hinted at in MOE memoranda on enrollment re-
porting distributed at the end of the school year. These memoranda remind headmasters of
  7
    For example, a3 + 80          80             100
                       3 = a2 + 2 implies a3 = 3 .
  8
    Funding rules for 2004-7 were revised so as to make total enrollment the major funding determinant
rather than the number of classes. This reform was never fully implemented. In 2007, the MOE returned to
the class-based funding rule (see Lavy 2012 and Vurgan 2007 for details).


                                                   8
the need for appropriate enrollment reporting for funding determination the following year.
The 2015 circular cautioned headmasters against enrollment manipulation. In particular,
schools were warned not to move students between grades, to enroll a student in more than
one school, or to enroll students residing overseas so as to produce an additional class. Since
2016, the MOE has been auditing enrollment data in an effort to prevent this type of manip-
ulation, though it’s not clear how or whether schools submitting bad data will be sanctioned
(Ministry of Education, 2015b).
   Interestingly, Figure 2 offers further evidence of financially-motivated enrollment manip-
ulation in the spike at a class size of 20. While budgetary rules set funding as a function of
the number of classes, classes with enrollments below 20 are generated allotted half as much
funding as any larger class.
   Although the incentive for headmasters to artificially push enrollment across Maimonides
cutoffs seems clear, the question of whether this produces misreporting or actual movement
between grades is less easily addressed. Real enrollment changes can be accomplished by
skipping students a grade ahead or through grade retention at any grade. A further especially
likely channel is flexible age at entry in first grade. Although the official start age policy
specifies a Chanukah-based birthday cutoff (detailed below), in practice, school headmasters
have some discretion as to when children may start school.
   Appendix Figure A1 suggests that at least some of the enrollment changes resulting from
manipulation are real and persistent, rather than purely on paper. This figure reports the
histogram of the number of 5th graders present for the GEMS tests in our sample. The
evidence here is strongest for bunching around the first Maimonides cutoff, with somewhat
weaker evidence of missing mass to the left of 80. Missing data in the number tested for
values below the second cutoff might be explained by the fact that roughly 10% of students
enrolled miss the test.
   Our primary concern is with possible selection bias resulting from enrollment manipu-
lation, rather than with the nature of the manipulation. We might expect, for example,
that more sophisticated school leaders understand the value of moving enrollment from just
below to just beyond Maimonides cutoffs. And sophisticated school leaders may also teach
higher-SES students, on average, producing a spurious achievement increase at the point
where rule-based predicted class size drops.


                                               9
       We mitigate selection bias from enrollment manipulation by constructing a version of
Maimonides Rule from birthday-based imputed enrollment. Most manipulation appears to
result from single-grade retention or advancement relative to birthday-based enrollment, ei-
ther as a result of delayed or accelerated school entry or a shift since first grade. Data on
a sample of 4th, 5th, and 6th graders therefore includes all or almost students who should
be in 5th grade. In particular, Israel’s compulsory attendance laws specify rules for student
enrollment in first grade according to whether a child’s 6th Hebrew birthday falls before or
after the last day of Chanukah (the 8-day Jewish holiday that typically comes in December).
Students born after the last day of Chanukah are too young for first grade and must wait an
additional year to start school.
       Figure 3 extrapolates Chanukah-based school entry into fifth-grade, showing the grade
enrollment determined by application of this rule to birth dates 11 years earlier. For example,
students born between December 18, 1990 (the last day of Chanukah in the Fall of 1990) and
December 8, 1991 (the last day of Chanukah in the Fall of 1991) should have been enrolled
in first grade in the school year ending Spring 1998 and, assuming no grade repetition or
skipping, been seen in 5th grade in the school year ending Spring 2002. Students born after
December 8, 1991 should have had to wait for first grade until the school year ending in 1999
and therefore been in 5th grade one year later, in the school year ending Spring 2003.
       Applying the Chanukah-based birthday rule to June enrollment data for the sample of
4th-6th graders in each school, we construct an imputed enrollment variable for 5th graders
that is unlikely to reflect manipulation by school officials. The birthday imputation uses
enrollment data for all students seen in June in the relevant grades in sampled schools, not
just the 5th graders who took GEMS tests.9 Specifically, imputed enrollment is computed
using data on enrollment and birth dates for all 4th-6th graders in each school in the same
year we observe that school’s 5th graders taking GEMS tests. Figure 4, which plots the
imputed enrollment histogram, suggests that enrollment imputed in this manner is indeed
unmanipulated. The figure shows a reasonably smooth distribution, with no evidence of
spikes to the right of Maimonides cutoffs. Likewise, the imputed enrollment distribution
shows no evidence of a spike at 20.
   9
    The extrapolation uses June enrollment data as only these are available at the student level, showing
individual students’ dates of birth.



                                                   10
         The McCrary (2008) style density plots in Figure 5 are also consistent with the view that
imputed birthday-based rule eliminates sorting in the November enrollment data. The upper
panel of the figure plots empirical and fitted densities for November enrollment, allowing for
a discontinuity at the the first and the second Maimonides cutoffs. Here, the jumps at 41 and
81 seem clear enough. By contrast, Panel B, which shows the same sort of plot for imputed
enrollment, suggests the imputed enrollment distribution is smooth through these cutoffs.10
         First stage estimates computed using imputed enrollment instruments are a little over
half the size of those constructed using November enrollment. This can be seen in Table 3,
which reports estimates of the first stage regression on Maimonides rule using the birthday-
based enrollment figures. As when estimating November data, key first stage parameters are
precisely estimated and largely insensitive to the nature of the running variable control.



4          Class Size Effects: 2002-2011
Our two-stage least squares (2SLS) framework models yijt , the standardized GEMS score of
student i enrolled in 5th grade at school j in year t, as a function of 5th grade class size,
running variable controls, year effects (µt ), and additional controls, Xijt . Second-stage models
with a linear running variable control can be written:

                                 yijt = βsijt + ρ2 rjt + δ2 Xijt + µt + ηijt ,                            (3)

where β is the causal effect of interest and ηijt is the random part of potential achievement.
The first stage for 2SLS estimation of equation (3) is equation (2).
         2SLS estimates of β in equation (3) suggest class size has no causal effect on achievement.
Estimates of effects on language, reported in cols 2-4 of Table 4, are zero to 3 digits (with
an estimated standard error a little under 0.002). The corresponding 2SLS estimates of class
size effects on math scores, reported in columns 6-8, are are also remarkably close to zero.
Interestingly, OLS estimates of a version of equation (3), reported in columns 1 and 5 on the
table, are also small, though positive and marginally significant.
         It seems fair to say that the estimated education production function identified by Mai-
    10
    These plots were constructed using DCdensity (http://eml.berkeley.edu//~jmccrary/DCdensity/),
which generates a graph of estimated densities with standard error bands, allowing for a single discontinuity,
as described in McCrary (2008). Dots in the figure are histograms in an one-unit binwidth.


                                                      11
monides Rule in more recent data differs from the estimated using similar specifications for
1991. The 1991 results are replicated in Table 5, with the modification that the replica-
tion reports standard errors computed using a cluster adjustment rather than the Moulton
formula used by Angrist and Lavy (1999).11 In contrast with the small effects found for 2002-
2011, use of Maimonides Rule instruments in the 1991 sample with linear running variable
controls generates an estimated effect of -.277 for 5th grade language (with a standard error
of .076) and an estimated effect of -.231 for 5th grade math (with a standard error of -.099).12
The estimates for 4th graders are smaller and only that for language with linear enrollment
controls is (marginally) significantly different from zero.
       Perhaps the new findings showing zero class size effects are an artifact of running variable
manipulation. This question is explored in Table 6, which reports a set of 2SLS estimates
paralleling those in 4, but computed in this case using a version of Maimonides rule derived
from birthday-based imputed enrollment. Like Table 4, the results here show little evidence
of achievement gains in smaller classes. In the 2002-2011 data, therefore, the lack of a class
size effect appears unrelated to school leaders’ efforts to open an additional class by pushing
enrollment across Maimonides Rule cutoffs.
       In an investigation of possible treatment effect heterogeneity that might be hiding behind
an overall zero effect on average, we also estimated models where the effect of class size on
test scores is interacted with SES index. The instruments in this case are fjt , and fjt ∗ SESjt ,
where SESj is the SES index for school j at year t. These results likewise show no evidence
of class size effects or SES interactions. An analysis of class size effects by year also generates
null effects. This weighs against the hypothesis that the absence of a class size effect reflects
extensive test preparation, since the extent of preparation varied from year to year.
       Gerard, Rokkanen and Rothe (2016) note that sorting around RD cutoffs is innocuous
when manipulated units are similar to those unaffected by sorting. To check for possible dis-
continuities in school characteristics induced by sorting, we regressed the school-by-year SES
index (increasing from 1 to 10 as SES declines) on Maimonides rule in a version of equation
(2) fit to school-year averages. As can be seen in Panel A of Table 7, when Maimonides Rule
is constructed from November enrollment data, schools with larger predicted class size have
  11
    Standard errors are clustered on school.
  12
    As in Angrist and Lavy (1999), 1991 test scores are measured as a composite percentile, ranging from
0-100, with means around 70 and standard deviations around 8-10.


                                                  12
somewhat higher SES. For example, the estimates in column 2 suggest that a 10 student
increase in predicted class size is associated with a reduced disadvantaged index (that is,
higher SES) of about 0.2. That seems like a modest relationship, amounting to less than
one-tenth of a standard deviation of the index. Importantly, the estimates in columns 4-6 of
Table 7 show that this relationship disappears when Maimonides Rule is constructed using
birthday-based imputed enrollment.
         Although encouraging for the thesis that imputed enrollment is uncompromised by sort-
ing, the results in Panel A of Table 7 suggest we should worry about non-random enrollment
manipulation when working with November data. But Panel B of the table shows that the
association between November-based Maimonides Rule and SES disappears in models that
control for a pair of school average covariates (fathers’ schooling and family size), while these
zeros are estimated at comparable levels of precision. Moreover, Maimonides Rule computed
using imputed enrollment is unrelated to SES with or without these controls. Since the find-
ings on class size are consistent using both sources of enrollment data and when estimated
with and without covariates, it seems unlikely that non-random sorting across Maimonides
cutoffs in the November enrollment data is an important source of bias.13



5         Earlier Estimates Explored
The evidence of running variable manipulation apparent in 2002-2011 data naturally raises
questions about manipulation in the older data used to compute the estimates in Angrist and
Lavy (1999). Figure 6 plots estimated enrollment histograms and densities for the Angrist
and Lavy samples of 4th and 5th graders tested in 1991. This figure shows evidence of a
gap in the enrollment distribution below the first Maimonides cutoff of 41. The figure also
reports estimates of the associated densities, allowing for a discontinuity at 41. Here too,
we see evidence of a jump.14 Appendix Figure A2 presents the enrollment histogram for the
sample of 3rd graders tested in 1992; this figure shows a somewhat more modest enrollment
jump to the right of the first cutoff.15
    13
     2SLS estimates of class size effects from models without covariates other than running variable controls
are, like those in reported those in Tables 4 and 6, insignificant and zero to two decimal places.
  14
     The discontinuity at 81 (the split from 2 to 3 classes) in the 1991 data is not statistically significant
  15
     The discontinuity at 41 in the 1992 data is statistically significant; the discontinuity at 81 is not.



                                                     13
       Otsu, Xu and Matsushita (2013) includes figures similar to our Figure 6. These earlier
plots, however, appear to count the 1991 enrollment distribution in terms of classes rather
than schools. Because many grade cohorts are indeed split into additional classes at or near
40, the number of classes in schools with enrollments just above 40 jumps with or without
sorting. The Otsu, Xu and Matsushita (2013) discontinuity check therefore confounds the
density discontinuity induced by sorting with the causal effect of Maimonides Rule on the
number of classes. This concern notwithstanding, however, Figure 6 shows evidence of sorting
around the first Maimonides cutoff in 1991.
       Additional analyses of the older data (not shown here) suggest sorting is less pervasive
in 1991 and 1992 data, with little evidence of enrollment discontinuities beyond the first
Maimonides cutoff. Even so, in view of the discontinuity in the 1991 enrollment distribution
seen in Figure 6, it’s worth asking whether enrollment manipulation is likely to be a source
of omitted variables bias. Table 8 reports estimates from a regression of school-level SES
on Maimonides Rule using 1991 data, similar to the estimates reported in Table 7. As
in the more recent data (with covariates), we see little evidence of a relationship between
Maimonides Rule and school-level SES. The negative associations estimated for 5th graders
are not significantly different from zero, while the sign flips to (insignificant) positive for 4th
and 3rd graders.16
       The additional enrollment data required for a birthday-based imputation of 1991 enroll-
ment are unavailable. We turn therefore to an alternative check on the replicated results
that omits observations near the first Maimonides cutoff.17 The results of this further explo-
ration of the consequences of sorting in 1991 data are reported in Table 9. For example, the
estimated class size effect of −0.234 in column 1 of Table 9 was computed using a sample
omitting schools with 5th grade enrollments between 39 and 41. This can be compared with
the full-sample estimate of −.277. Although somewhat less precise, the donut estimates in
Table 9 differ little from those for the full sample estimates reported in Table 5.
  16
     The 1991 SES index is scaled as “percent disadvantaged.”
  17
     Barecca et al. (2011) appear to be the first to propose this simple adjustment for sorting, sometimes
referred to as an RD “donut”.

6    Summary and Conclusion
Application of the Maimonides Rule identification strategy for class size effects produces
precisely estimated zeros in large Israeli samples pooling test scores from 2002-2011. These
samples also show clear evidence of manipulation of November enrollment around Maimonides
class size cutoffs, likely reflecting the desire of school leaders to open an additional class
when enrollment is close to a cutoff. But enrollment imputed using all students with grade-
eligible birthdates looks to be unaffected by manipulation, while 2SLS estimation based on
imputed enrollment produces similarly small class size effects. Maimonides Rule constructed
using birthday-based imputed enrollment is also unrelated to a school-level measure of SES.
This constellation of findings suggests the more recent results are unaffected by enrollment
manipulation.
    We find only weak evidence of systematic enrollment sorting: more recent data generate
small estimated effects of the November-based Rule on socioeconomic status, but these ef-
fects disappear after conditioning on a few covariates. Since the November estimates of class
size effects are also estimated to be zero with or without controls, these results reinforce our
conclusion that the finding of a null class size effect in recent data is not a manipulation arti-
fact. The estimates of zero class size effect in more recent data contrast with the substantial
negative class size effects reported byAngrist and Lavy (1999). We also see some evidence
of manipulation around the first Maimonides cutoff in the older data analyzed byAngrist
and Lavy (1999). But the absence of a relationship between Maimonides’ Rule and school
average SES, and results from a donut strategy that omits data near the cutoff, suggest these
estimates too are unaffected by enrollment manipulation near cutoffs.
    The contrast between the old and new class size effects may be due to a change in the
Israeli education production function. The fact that Israeli class size has fallen (from a median
of 31 in 1991 to 28 in the more recent sample) may have contributed to this. At the same
time, given that the 1991 results are not very precise, the earlier findings may also have been
a chance finding. The original estimates are strongest for 5th graders, but less impressive
for 4th graders, for whom only estimates for language are significantly different from zero,
and only in one specification. The original Angrist and Lavy study also failed to find class
effects in a sample of 3rd graders from 1992, a result attributed in the original write-up



                                               15
to (documented) extensive test preparation and changes in testing protocols. These forces may
still be at work, especially in weaker schools. But our analysis uncovers no evidence of
significant class size/SES interactions or changes in class size effects over time that might be
linked to changes in preparation. From today's vantage point, it seems fair to say that the 1991
results are unusual in showing strong class size effects, while the null effects in 1992 have
emerged as more representative of the causal relationship between class size and learning in
Israel.

Notes: This table reports 2SLS estimates using 1991 data. These results use fjt as an instru-
ment for class size. Standard errors have been updated to use the Stata cluster command,
and are clustered by school. The piecewise linear control in columns (3) and (6) in each
panel omit enrollments over 160, to match Angrist and Lavy 1999. Both panels include
controls for the school level index of socioeconomic status.

     Notes: This table reports OLS estimates of the effect of Maimonides Rule on a school-level index of socioeconomic status. The
     unit of analysis is the school. The third grade sample is limited to those schools which appear in the fourth and fifth grade sample,
     to create the religious school indicator and limit the sample to non-Arab schools. The piecewise linear control in columns (4), (8),
     and (12) omits enrollments above 160, to match Angrist and Lavy 1999.

     Note: This sketch shows birthday cutoffs for school entry, and their implications for 5th grade enrollment in a pure birthday-based world with no grade repetition or skipping. For example, students born between Dec 18 1990 and
     December 7 1991 should be enrolled in 5th grade in Spring 2002. Our predicted enrollment variables for 2002-2011 applies these rules to the birthday distribution of children observed enrolled in 4-6th grade in Spring of each year.
    Figure 4: 5th Grade Birthday-based Imputed Enrollment Distribution (2002-2011)




Notes: This figure plots the distribution of our 5th grade birthday-based imputed enrollment values by
school. Birthday-based imputed enrollment is based on the birthday distribution of students observed in
4- 6th grade in June of each year. The birthday rule counts 4-6th graders born from Chanukah 11 years
to Chanukah 10 years before the current school year. Reference lines indicate Maimonides Rule cutoffs at
which an additional class is added.

Data Appendix
       The data used here are from the 2002–2011 Growth and Effectiveness Measures for Schools
(GEMS) testing program. GEMS is administered by the National Authority for Measurement
and Evaluation in Education. GEMS scores are used to assess school progress. Individual
GEMS scores are not released to students or schools administrators.18
       GEMS tests are usually given some time between mid-March and mid-June (with the
exception of the 2004-2006 school years, when the tests were given in October-November).
The GEMS test-takers are drawn from a representative 1-in-2 sample of all elementary and
middle schools in Israel, so that each school participates in GEMS once every two years.
GEMS tests fifth-graders (primary school) and eighth-graders (middle school) in math, sci-
ence, native language skills, and English. In principle, all students except those in special
education classes are tested; in practice, the proportion of students tested is above 90 percent.
       We focus on math and language tests given in Jewish elementary schools, as in Angrist
and Lavy (1999). GEMS scores are reported on a 1-to-100 scale that we standardized by
year and subject. Between 2002 and 2006, participating schools were tested in four subjects.
Since 2007, only two subjects at a time are tested, either math and language or science and
English. Our ten year sample includes the math and language scores of 243,213 fifth graders.
Between 2002-2006, this sample covers an annual average of 570 Jewish public (secular and
religious) schools and 1180 classes per year. Between 2007-2001, the sample covers an annual
average of 290 Jewish public schools and 600 classes per year.
       We linked the GEMS data to MOE administrative records covering all Israeli 5th graders.
Student records include gender, parents’ education, number of siblings, country of birth, and
parents’ country of origin. We also collected MOE data on dates of birth for the population
of 4th-6th graders (not just those who participated in the math and language GEMS).
       The school-level data used in this study are derived from MOE records reporting enroll-
ment, school sector (religious etc), and a school’s index of socioeconomic status (SES). We
obtained two enrollment variables: November enrollment, reported by school headmasters to
the MOE; a June enrollment variables computed by summing Spring class sizes. The Novem-
ber and birthday based imputation generate our instruments, while the June data provide
