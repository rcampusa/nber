                                              ABSTRACT

Tariffs on agricultural products fell sharply in China both prior to, and as a consequence of, China's
accession to the WTO. The paper examines the nature of agricultural trade reform in China since 1981,
and finds that protection was quite strongly negative for most commodities, and particularly for exported
goods, at the beginning of the reforms. Since then, the taxation of agriculture has declined sharply,
with the abolition of production quotas and procurement pricing, and reductions in trade distortions
for both imported and exported goods. Rural well-being has improved partly because of these reforms,
and also because of strengthening of markets, public investment in infrastructure, research and development,
health and education, and reductions in barriers to mobility of labor out of agriculture. Many challenges
remain in improving rural incomes and reducing rural poverty.

                  Agricultural Trade Reform and Rural Prosperity:
                                Lessons from China

China’s agriculture has grown rapidly in recent years, despite radical reductions in

agricultural tariffs (Huang and Chen, 1999; and Huang et al., 2004). China’s agriculture

has moved from a focus on self sufficiency and industry-first growth, through the Open

Door Policy of the 1980s, to a much more market-oriented regime. Accession to the

World Trade Organization was allowed only after China promised major institutional

reforms and a virtually unprecedented degree of tariff reduction, the abolition of export

subsidies, and introduction of constraints on domestic support (Lardy, 2001; Bhattasali,

Li and Martin 2004).

       In response to the committment to reform trade as well as domestic markets, there

were fears that such sharp liberalization would have dire consequences for the rural

population. In poor countries, government officials know that agricultural price shifts can

have important effects on domestic food production, farm household incomes, national

poverty rates and overall rural stability. Many voices focused on the cuts in agricultural

tariffs and warned that poverty in China would be exacerbated and rural incomes would

fall if the nation were to follow through with their ambitious domestic market and trade

liberalization policies (Carter and Estrin 2001; Li et al. 1999; Schmidhuber 2001, Ni

2007). Even in light of these concerns, policy makers have pushed ahead.

       By the mid-2000s, the concerns about rural incomes of critics of trade policies had

not been realized. Even scholars who have long worried about poor income growth in the

rural areas are admitting the incomes and rural welfare are rising as never before.

Although the gap in incomes between urban and rural people remains large, conventional

measures of this gap are overstated by neglecting the lower costs of living in rural areas
and by the exclusion of rural migrants living in urban areas when calculating average

urban incomes (Sicular, Ximing, Gustaffson and Li 2006; Chen and Ravallion 2007,

NBSC 2007).

       Although there has long been an interest in the agricultural economy (e.g., Lardy,

1983; Sicular, 1988b; Lin, 1992; Rosen et al., 2004), it is quite surprising to many that

the agricultural sector of China actually has a very impressive record. Growth rates of

gross domestic product, agricultural value added and food per capita increased

dramatically between the early 1980s and the mid-2000s. Indeed, China's performance in

agriculture over the past two decades was more impressive than any other country in

Asia. Markets have boomed. The structure of agriculture has fundamentally shifted.

Despite having the largest population in the world and high income growth (which has

radically changed consumption patterns), China has remained a net exporter of

agricultural products until very recently, with a recent switch to net import status due

largely to increased cotton imports needed for burgeoning exports of textiles and

clothing. A new report by the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC, 2006)

demonstrates that rural incomes grew robustly between 2002 and 2005 and did so in all

income deciles and all provinces (see Table 1).

       The overall goal of this paper is to address these questions using two specific

approaches. The first is to present estimates of indicators of direct and indirect

interventions of China’s government in agriculture from 1981, when it first became

possible to assess the stance of trade policies, to 2005, when almost all of China’s WTO

commitments had been phased in. To achieve this objective, we examine the differences

in prices between international prices and domestic prices at the border (Nominal Rates




                                              2
of Assistance or NRA at the market level and NRAf at the farm level). Because input-

related policies were relatively small over most of our sample period, we focus on the

transfers associated with changes in commodity prices, although we include the effects of

input measures in our estimates of support to farmers. In the most general terms, we find

that China shifted from an economy that was highly distorted with a generally taxed

agricultural sector, to one that was highly integrated with the world economy.

       In the second part of the paper, we seek to understand what allowed the rural

economy to do as well as it has in the face of falling prices for some products. To do so,

we examine four factors: investments in agricultural technology; the policy responses

aimed at deregulating agricultural markets and promoting structural adjustment; the new

set of programs that has redirect resources towards rural infrastructure and services as

well as relatively non-distorting transfer programs and tax cuts; and policies aimed at

facilitating the movement of labor from agriculture to industry and from rural to urban.

       The wide scope of our goals and objectives necessitate certain limitations. First,

the absence of data precludes our examining the entire agricultural sector. Instead, we

examine commodities that account for two-thirds or more of gross output value over our

study period. Second, although we are able to judge from the price trends and our

understanding of domestic marketing and trade policy reforms the broad sources of the

shifts in the distortions of the agricultural economy, we can not identify the exact source

of changes and must rely on earlier work by the authors and others examining these

causal linkages in more detail (Huang and Rozelle, 1996; deBrauw et al., 2004). Thirdly,

because of the complexity of agricultural trade instruments during the period—including

state trading, quotas, licenses, tariffs and exchange rate distortions—we were forced to




                                             3
use price comparison approaches even though exchange rates were distorted by a two-tier

exchange rate system up to 1994. During this period, we used an exchange rate adjusted

for the two-tier exchange rate system to compare international prices with prices in

China’s domestic economy, an approach used in (Martin et al., 2006).

       Before showing these results in the following section, we discuss our quantitative

approach and sources of data. The results of the distortion analysis are presented and

discussed in the next section. The following section discusses three policy responses that

are likely part of the reason for the robust performance of China’s rural sector. The final

section concludes.



                              Methodology and data sources

       In this paper, we have utilized the approach specified in Anderson, Martin, Sandri

and Valenzuela (henceforth, Anderson et al., 2008). The approach is primarily based on

comparisons between domestic and international prices. During the reform era these price

comparisons provide indicators of the incentives for production, consumption and trade,

and of the income transfers associated with interventions.

       Our approach essentially creates two main measures of distortions for each

commodity. The basic measure in our analysis is the Nominal Rate of Assistance (NRA),

used to compare the prices of commodities in the domestic economy (at the port) with the

international prices of commodities at the border (that is, cif in the port for importables;

fob in the port for exportables).

       Because of barriers within the domestic economy, the extent of protection (or dis-

protection) provided by trade policies may not be the same as the protection to farmers.




                                              4
Since we have independent observations on the prices obtained by farmers in local

markets we are able to estimate the nominal rate of assistance at the farm level taking

into account both border distortions and domestic distortions affecting farmer returns

(NRAf’s). NRAf‘s are calculated after allowing for quality adjustment, taxes or subsidies,

and transport, storage and handling costs in moving commodities from the farm to the

wholesale level. Differences between NRAs and NRAf’s can arise from subsidy or

transfer payments that cause the prices received by farmers to differ from what they

would receive under competitive internal market conditions.1



The data

       In compiling our data we necessarily had to make choices on commodity

coverage. We included 11 commodities: rice, wheat, maize, soybeans, cotton, pork, milk,

poultry, fruit (using apples as a representative product), vegetables (using tomatoes as a

representative product) and sugar (both sugarbeet and sugarcane). Over the study period,

these commodities accounted for roughly 75 percent (in the late 1980s) and 60 percent

(during the early 2000s) of the value of agricultural output in China. Because production

and consumption decisions were only gradually being allowed to respond to domestic

prices, and because we do not have access to reliable data on secondary market exchange

rates prior to 1981, we focus on the period from 1981.

       Much of the data on margins, transportation costs and other transaction costs are

from an extensive set of surveys by Huang and Rozelle during the 1990s and the early

2000s, surveys which also served to establish which commodity price series provided

appropriate bases for price comparisons. Some of this was previously reported in Rozelle




                                             5
et al. (2000) and Huang et al. (2004), which provided information on substantial quality

differences between some imported and domestic commodities and resulting

methodologies for ensuring valid price comparisons. For more recent years, survey teams

from the Center for Chinese Agricultural Policy interviewed traders in 10 cities around

China in 2006. The complete data series are in the appendices of Huang et al. (2007).

       When calculating the rate of support to farmers, we took into account direct

support measures using data from the Price Department of the National Development and

Reform Commission. These measures included three applying since 2002—direct grain

supports, the seed subsidy program, and agricultural machinery subsidies. We also took

into account the negative assistance imposed by agricultural taxes on production of

specific commodities. We did not take into account the input subsidy program that pays

subsidies to state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) producing fertilizers, fertilizers and

mulching film on the grounds that all or part of this may be a subsidy to the SOEs, rather

than to the farmers. Nor did we include the “grain for green” payments made to convert

fragile agricultural land to forest or pasture (see OECD 2008 for details of both of these

measures).



                                          Results

The role of domestic price and marketing policy

Before examining the role of distortions at the border, it is useful (and necessary) to

examine the relationship between the available domestic price series for farm and retail

prices for two major grain crops (Figure 1, Panels A and B). The importance (and role) of

China’s domestic price and marketing policy for rice and wheat (the two largest crops in




                                              6
China—one an exportable and the other an importable) can be seen by comparing the

state-set urban retail price and the state-set farm-gate procurement price with the rural

retail price, a free market price. Until 1992 the urban retail price for rice was generally

well below the free-market price in rural areas, despite the costs associated with

transferring rice to urban areas. Only urban residents could buy rice at these low prices

and only with ration coupons that were available in limited quantities.

       The relatively low selling price of grain at the farm gate by farmers shows that

China’s food system in the 1980s was set up to transfer income from rural to urban

people (Figure 1, Panels A and B). The amount that farmers received for their mandatory

deliveries was far below the free market price although, in the case of rice, it was above

the urban retail price, suggesting urban prices were held down by a subsidy as well as by

taxation of farmers. However, there is some question about the effects of the depressed

rural prices on farmers’ incentives given the infra-marginal nature of many of these

transfers (Sicular 1988a). This is because from the mid-1980s farmers were able to sell

additional amounts at higher market prices once they had met their obligation to deliver a

quota at the low purchasing price. As shown by Sicular (1988a), the higher out-of-quota

price is the relevant incentive for production at the margin. However, as shown by Wang

et al. (1999), even such policies may not be fully decoupled from incentives, with

seemingly infra-marginal transfers giving rural household members an incentive to move

out of agriculture.

       After 1992, however, changes to China’s domestic marketing and procurement

system appear to have eliminated this additional layer of taxation and regulation for

producers of rice, and wheat (Figure 1, Panels A and B). In the early 1990s the urban




                                              7
price began to rise above the farm gate price; urban and rural retail prices also came

much closer together. The gap between urban and rural retail prices essentially

disappeared. And the gap between the rural retail price and the farm price declined,

possibly suggesting an improvement in marketing efficiency (Park et al. 2002).



Nominal rates of assistance for China’s main agricultural commodities

       In this section we focus on the distortions faced by farmers in China between

1981 and 2005. To do so, we examine plots of NRAs and NRAf’s over time for an

illustrative subsample of our 11 commodities. A more comprehensive analysis is

contained in Huang et al. (2007).

       Distortions to the grain economy before 1995. The distortions to the rice

economy of China in the 1980s and early 1990s are characterized by two important

features (Figure 2, Panel A). First, the NRA of rice, an exportable commodity, is negative

in every year between 1980 and 1995. Ranging between -40 and -10, the negative NRAs

show that China was highly competitive in international rice markets during these years.

Trade policy, and particularly the state trading monopoly, kept exporters from shipping

large quantities of rice onto world markets and kept market prices of rice in China’s port

cities below world prices.

       The second feature demonstrates how domestic marketing and procurement

placed a greater tax on farmers and insulated the domestic price of rice from the world

market price even if trade policy had been liberalized (Figure 2, Panel A). The state’s

artificially low procurement price kept the price received by farmers systematically

below the free market price of rice as seen by the NRAf’s. Because of this the total tax on




                                             8
rice ranged from -70 in the early 1980s to -30 in the early 1990s. Rice producers were

among the most heavily taxed farmers in China—given the large share of the crop’s sown

area and large negative rates of disprotection.

       Unlike rice, the NRA measures show that trade policy offered high rates of

protection for wheat in China between 1981 and the mid-1990s (Figure 2, Panel B). In

most years after 1980 the free market price of wheat in China’s port cities was about 60

percent above international prices (cif, China’s port cities). Unlike rice farmers, wheat

producers—who have been shown to produce at a higher cost than producers in many

other countries (Huang and Ma, 2000)—benefited from high market prices for their

marginal output. ‘By keeping out imports and keeping domestic prices high, trade policy

appears to have been focused on food self-sufficiency, rather than on providing

inexpensive food to urban consumers.

       The differences between rice and wheat illustrate that trade liberalization in China

should not have been expected to hurt everyone and emphasize the importance of looking

at distortions on a commodity by commodity basis. Trade liberalization clearly had the

potential to help rice producers, in particular. By contrast, the removal of the high

protection rates for wheat observed in the 1980s and early 1990s, would have had the

potential to hurt wheat producers. Our analysis of why trade policy reform has been

accompanied by rural income rises seems most relevant for the case of crops, such as

wheat, that were receiving positive protection in the 1980s and 1990s.

       Domestic marketing policies, however, were working in the opposite direction.

The trends in NRAf’s show how the forced deliveries under wheat quotas largely

insulated farmers from much of the benefit of protection (Figure 2, Panel B). Although




                                              9
there was still positive protection for wheat in most years between 1980 and 1995, the

average rates were lower (all below 50 percent except for in 1994 and 1995) and were

zero and even slightly negative in 5 of the 16 years (1981; 1982; 1990; 1992; 1993).

These figures suggest that policy for wheat was trying to increase production through the

higher market prices, but to transfer income from producers to consumers through the

infra-marginal transfers captured in the NRAf. Huang et al. (2007) show that the story for

maize is similar to that of wheat.

       Distortions to the grain economy after 1995. After 1995 our distortions analysis

shows that China’s international trade and domestic marketing policies have changed

strikingly (Figures 2—right hand sides of panels). That China’s reformers were able to

eliminate the procurement policies that had been taxing rice and wheat (and maize)

farmers is apparent from the way the differences between NRAs and NRAf’s narrow and

disappear. In other work, Huang et al. (2004) show that elimination of the procurement

quota system contributed significantly to a reduction in the tax burden on farmers. In part,

then, procurement policy reform itself was one of the ways that help increase rural

incomes to farmers during the 1990s.

       The liberalization of domestic policies in the mid-1990s was accompanied by

liberalization of trade policy, at least in the case of China’s major food grains. After 1995

the taxation and subsidization of rice and wheat were being phased out as the NRAs for

rice steadily rose (became less negative) and the NRAs for wheat fell. Likely in part in

preparation for its accession to the WTO, China’s leaders liberalized trade for its main

food grains to such an extent that between 1995 and 2001 most of the protection for these




                                             10
crops was eliminated. Since 2001, the NRAs for both rice and wheat have been almost

zero.

        Edible oils, milk and sugar. Outside the grain economy, marketing and trade

reform, as in the case of wheat, removed positive protection from a number of key

commodities. The biggest difference between the analysis of distortions for grain crops

and cash crops (in our case, for soybeans) is that domestic marketing policy has

historically played less of a role for cash crops. Although some counties had procurement

delivery quotas for soybean producers, this was not as widespread as for grain and the

implicit taxes on soybeans in counties with quotas were generally lower than for staple

grains. There was, as a consequence, little difference between the graphs for NRAs and

NRAf’s. The same applies for the remaining commodities (livestock; horticulture and

milk and sugar), because there was no state-mandated procurement for these

commodities, As a result, the discussion in the rest of this section focuses on trade policy.

        Before 1995, our analysis shows that soybeans fluctuated between being taxed

and protected (Figure 3). Although the average level of protection was roughly zero, it

varied from -20 percent up to 30 percent. A paper by Rozelle and Huang (2004) shows

that much of this fluctuation was due to domestic policy cycles that switched between

encouraging and discouraging production, while allowing little trade.

        The trends in NRAs after 1995 show the strong commitment to trade

liberalization for soybeans (Figure 3, right hand side of the graph). Beginning in the late

1990s and continuing through 2005 protection for soybeans fell from around 30 percent

to almost zero. This falling protection, in fact, should not be a surprise given the

integration of China into world soybean markets and the monotonic rise in imports




                                             11
(which exceeded 25 million tons in 2005). The story of soybeans after 1995 parallels that

of wheat. In fact, because of the high level of imports, the case of soybean producers

often raised in discussions about the adverse effects of trade policies on farmers (see

Rozelle and Huang, 2004 for a complete description). In fact, Rozelle and Huang (2004)

empirically show using CAPSiM (an agricultural simulation model developed by the

authors) that soybean prices and the incomes of soybean producers would have been

higher in the absence of trade reform. Therefore, in the case of soybeans the government

carried through with its commitment to trade reform.

       Protection of milk and sugar began earlier and remained higher than for soybeans.

During the 1980s the NRAs for milk and sugar were large and positive (Figure 4, Panels

A and B), with milk ranging between 50 and over 200 percent between 1980 and 1987,

and sugar above 40 percent through the late 1990s. NRAs for milk fell dramatically in the

late 1980s, and subsequently fluctuated between zero and 50 percent. Protection for sugar

also fell in the late 1980s, but subsequently rose, with the average NRA fluctuating

around 40 percent.

       Livestock and horticultural commodities. The case of livestock (Figure 5 for pork)

and horticulture (not shown here—see Huang et al., 2007) show that trade liberalization

directly helped raise farm incomes in certain regions and sectors. During the early reform

era there was heavy implicit taxation of livestock and horticultural commodities.

Although China can competitively produce labor-intensive livestock and horticultural

products, producers were not encouraged to produce or export these commodities on a

large scale. Part of the resistance to exports was from China’s own barriers, such as

quotas on exports to Hong Kong. Another part of the price gap shown in these figures




                                             12
reflects trade barriers facing China in export markets. While there quite possibly were

grounds for some of these barriers (for example, foot and mouth disease is widespread in

China), even blatantly false claims could not be contested since China was not a WTO

member. As a consequence, China’s livestock and horticultural producers produced

commodities far below the world market price yet were unable to increase exports into

global markets.

       Aggregate impacts. We separated the commodities in our study into importable

and exportable groups, and used production weights at undistorted prices to aggregate

them. Assuming that our study commodities largely reflect the distortions to all

commodities, there is a striking pattern (Figure 6—left hand side of figure) that reinforces

the positive relationship between trade liberalization and rural incomes. In the 1980s and

through the mid-1990s, importables (such as wheat, soybeans, milk and sugar) were

protected. On average, their protection rates were between 15 and 35 percent. The same

was true for exportables, except the distortions show that commodities such as rice,

livestock commodities and horticultural commodities were taxed at rates ranged from 40

to 50 percent. With exportable agricultural products accounting for a larger share of

output than importables, China’s average agricultural distortions were negative. In other

words, China was taxing its agriculture—with both its international trade and domestic

marketing policies.

       One of the main findings of this study is evident from the right hand side of

Figure 6. After 1995, the NRAs of importables fell from around 20 percent to less than 10

percent. During this period, the NRAs of exportables rose, or the implicit taxes on them

fell, from about 40 percent to around 15 percent. When taken together, the distortions in




                                            13
China’s agriculture fell to less than 10 percent. In many years overall protection was

between 0 and -5 percent. The combination of domestic marketing reforms and

international trade liberalization has created an economy that is one of the least distorted

in the world. It also helped China enjoy rising incomes (in the aggregate) at the same

time that it was reforming trade policies. One key to this was the removal of agricultural

taxation. Another was allowing farmers to produce the goods that would generate the

greatest benefit at international prices.

        When considering the impact of trade reform on the agricultural sector, it is not

sufficient to consider only the instruments directly affecting the sector. The pathbreaking

study of distortions to agricultural incentives in developing countries (Krueger, Schiff

and Valdés 1991) showed that the indirect taxation of agriculture resulting from

protection to other sectors was generally more important than direct agricultural

distortions.

        In the case of China, this question requires particular attention since there have

been enormous reductions in non-agricultural barriers, including tariffs, exchange rate

overvaluation, quotas and licensing. We have combined estimates of these distortions

into a composite measure of non-agricultural distortions depicted as an NRA for non-

agricultural tradeables in Figure 7. In a simplified two-sector model what matters is the

relative rate of assistance (RRA) also shown in this figure. This figure shows that the

agricultural sector benefited from a rapid reduction in both direct and indirect taxation

between the early 1980s and 1995. In the period since 1995, the RRA has become

positive and continued to rise, albeit at a much slower rate than in the 1981-1995 period.

The reduction in taxation of the agricultural sector evident in this diagram is consistent




                                             14
with the improvement in the terms of trade for agriculture relative to non-agriculture

within China observed by Zhu and Hong (2007) using data on relative prices for

agricultural and non-agricultural goods.

       Distinguishing the impacts of WTO accession. One final issue that needs to be

recognized when considering the impacts of reforms associated with WTO accession is

the nature of commitments in the WTO. China’s main WTO accession commitments on

agriculture were commitments that tariffs would not rise above the bound levels agreed in

China’s WTO accession schedule. These commitments were negotiated through an

intensive process that took into account the market access interests of existing members,

and the previously prevailing applied tariff rates. Given the nature of China’s trade

regime, however, the relationship between these tariff rates and China’s actual protection

was weak. For many products, the relationship between domestic and world prices was

determined more by state trading, quotas and licenses than by tariffs.

       Table 4 shows the relationship estimated by Ianchovichina and Martin (2004)

between applied protection prior to accession, the applied tariff, and the bound tariff

associated with WTO accession. From the Table, it is clear that the applied tariffs for

many commodities were strikingly above the protection actually provided. For rice, the

applied tariff of 114 percent was quite irrelevant, with the actual protection applied being

negative. Similarly, the applied rates of protection on wheat and maize were far below the

applied rates of 114 percent. For only a few commodities, such as soybeans, did the

bound rate agreed at the WTO require reductions in the protection previously applied.

This distinction between reductions in applied rates and reductions in actual agricultural

protection is extremely important. Much of the concern about potential adverse impacts




                                             15
of WTO commitments expressed either in prospect by authors such as Schmidhuber

(2001) or Carter and Estrin (2001) or retrospectively by authors such as Ni (2007) is

based on the reductions in tariff rates required by WTO accession.



Policies to Support Market and Trade Liberalization

Our analysis that documents reductions in the distortions to China’s agriculture helps us

meet our first objective. China’s policy makers have successfully carried out their

promises to liberalize markets and trade. In some sense the analysis also helps explain the

second puzzle. Because of the rising share of livestock and horticulture in China’s

agricultural economy, and because trade liberalization actually eliminated negative

protection in these sectors, the average level of protection (combining the net effects of

commodities that were having their positive protection removed and the commodities that

were being less taxed) moved towards zero. In this way, trade policy was helping to

increase farm incomes. In the period since 1995, liberalization elsewhere in the economy

reduced the taxation of the agricultural sector leading to the rise in the relative rate of

assistance noted in Figure 7. In this way trade policy changes can contribute, in part, to

the explanation of how rural China avoided declining during trade liberalizations.

        However, the story needs more explanation. In part, the additional explanation is

needed because rural incomes not only rose on average, but rose in all provinces (Table

1). The rise in income occurred in all provinces, including those in northern, northeastern

and northwestern China. In these regions of China, farmers produce many crops (wheat,

maize, soybeans and cotton) that were still receiving positive protection during the late

1990s and early 2000s. With this set of crops accounting for a large share of the crop area




                                              16
in northern, northeast and northwestern China, there remains a puzzle to explain. Why

did incomes rise in those areas even though we know that incomes of some producers

would have suffered from trade liberalization-induced cuts in protection. Part of the

explanation is presumably the reduction in the cost structure resulting from rapid

liberalization in the rest of the economy. In the rest of this section we discuss several key

policy reforms that we believe contributed to rural incomes rising even while agricultural

protection fell.



Development and Dissemination of Agricultural Technology

The importance of agricultural research and extension in increasing agricultural

productivity in developing countries is now widely recognized. Successful development

has been shown to be tied closely to productivity growth in the agricultural sector (World

Bank 2008). In a country like China, where agriculture is dominated by small, poor

farms, it is even more important.

        During the reform era, it was not always clear whether China would be able to

maintain the pace of technological advance needed to maintain farm incomes in a

dynamic economy. While decollectivization played the key role in boosting productivity

(Lin, 1992) in the early stages of reform, this provided only a one-off boost to

productivity. After 1985, the evidence suggests that technological advance has been the

main engine of productivity growth (Huang and Rozelle, 1996). China was one of the

first countries to develop and extend Green Revolution technology in the 1960s, 1970s

and 1980s. Hybrid rice was developed by China’s scientists in the late 1970s and, until




                                             17
the mid-1990s, it was the only country in the world to have commercialized this new

technology.

       Despite these and other successes, China’s system of agricultural research faced

great challenges by the late 1980s (Pray et al., 1997). Research investment, almost totally

publicly funded, was declining. Incentives were poor and funding was being allocated in

ways that did not always reward excellence. The system was not responding to many

demands for new technologies and, the extension system was in shambles.

       A nationwide reform in research was launched in the mid-1980s (Pray et al.,

1997). The reforms attempted to increase research productivity by shifting funding from

institutional support to competitive grants, supporting research useful for economic

development, and encouraging applied research institutes to support themselves by

selling the technology they produced. In addition, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, new

horticultural seeds, improved breeding livestock (Rae et al., 2006) and new technologies

for dairy were all imported (Ma et al., 2006).

       After declining between the early 1980s and the mid-1990s (Pray et al., 1997),

investment in R&D also began to rise. Funding was greatly increased for plant

biotechnology, although only only Bt cotton has been commercialized in a major way to

date (Huang et al., 2002). China now ranks among the global leaders in agricultural

biotechnology. In the late 1990s China invested more in agricultural biotechnology

research than all other developing countries combined. Its public spending on agricultural

biotechnology was second only to the US and, according to some projections, it will soon

outspend the US government on plant biotechnology research. Investment in

government-sponsored R&D increased by 5.5 percent annually between 1995 and 2000




                                            18
and by over 15 percent per year after 2000 (Hu et al., 2007). During the past decade, the

increase in investment in rural research and development has been the most rapid of any

large nation.

       The investment in R&D has been paying off. During China’s early reform period

the yields of major food crops rose steadily (Table 2, column 1). Although some of that

yield increase came from greater efficiency in input use, technological improvements

appear to have accounted for some of this growth, since indices of aggregated inputs (that

is, measures of land, labor and material inputs) for rice, wheat, and maize actually fell for

all the crops during the early 1980s (column 2).

       Although there was concern about the effect of the slowdown in R&D spending

during the 1980s and early 1990s, the analysis shows that the growth of output continued

to outpace that for inputs (Table 2, columns 3 and 4). And, productivity trends continued

to rise (Table 3, column 2). During this time—and during the early reform period—

China’s TFP has been rising at the healthy rate of about 2 percent per year. Such rises,

which occurred in all provinces and with all crops, could not have helped but increase

incomes—of all farmers—regardless of whether the crop was being protected or taxed.



Policies to Encourage Market Integration and Efficiency

Price and marketing reforms have been key components of China’s transition strategy

from a centrally-planned to a market-oriented economy. These policies were

implemented in a gradual way (Sicular, 1995). In the initial years there was little effort to

move the economy to one in which most all resources and factors were allocated

according market price signals. Over time the government’s position on market reform




                                             19
has gradually evolved. As officials in charge of the overall economic reforms began to be

committed to use markets as the primary means to allocate resources for the economy,

the commitment to allowing markets in agriculture also deepened (Sicular, 1995).

       As markets began to emerge, China’s leaders took steps to encourage the

efficiency of markets and, perhaps more importantly, stepped aside and allowed them to

expand in an environment with minimal distortions. Above all national and regional

governments invested in the hardware—roads, landline telephones and cellular

technology—that reduced transaction costs and accelerated the flow of information and

goods (Park et al., 2002). Many regional and local governments invested in marketing

sites and tried to attract commercial interests to set up businesses. Finally, except for a

short period in the late 1990s, government officials have stepped back and allowed the

entry of private traders and private transport and done little to interfere with markets.

Licensing fees and taxes are low or non-existent. Markets were encouraged for both

agricultural outputs and inputs.

       In assessing the health of the rural economy, it is important to understand how

China’s markets are functioning. Markets—whether classic competitive ones or some

workable substitute—increase efficiency by facilitating transactions among agents to

allow specialization and trade and by providing information through a pricing mechanism

to producers and consumers about the relative scarcity of resources. With better markets,

producers can begin to specialize, become more efficient and increase their incomes.

       According to price data from private reporting stations and information firms, it

appears that China’s markets function relatively well. For example, maize prices in for

different cities in Northeast China track each other closely (Rozelle and Huang, 2003).




                                              20
Soybean prices in markets in different regions of the country move almost in perfect

concert with one another (Rozelle and Huang, 2004). Rice markets also have been shown

to function as well as or better than those in the United States in terms of the efficiency of

moving commodities around and between China’s producing and consuming regions

(Huang et al., 2004). Horticultural, dairy and livestock markets are all dominated by

millions of small traders who are operating in extremely competitive environments

(Wang et al., 2007; Wu et al., 2007; Bi et al., 2007).

       The improvement in markets has allowed individual producers to specialize as

never before. According to one national survey, the number of villages that have become

specialized producers of a single commodity rose from less than 20 percent in 1995 to

nearly 40 percent in 2004 (Rosen et al., 2004). Such integration has allowed relatively

small and poor farmers to participate in emerging markets and to accrue the substantial

income gains associated with moving from subsistence to a market orientatin (Wang et al.,

2007; Bi et al., 2007; Balat and Porto 2006). In fact, in a recent survey of the greater

metropolitan Beijing area, it was found that poor farmers living in poor villages were the

main beneficiaries of new demands for horticultural commodities.

       Most importantly, according to deBrauw et al. (2004), when markets in China

have begun to become more competitive and efficient, they have led to rising

productivity and efficiency. The link between improved markets and rising incomes is

important because it is consistent with our puzzle. Even where market and trade

liberalization has reduced protection and necessarily adversely affected income, the rising

productivity and efficiency effects have at least partly offset these negative impacts. This

interpretation is supported by the modeling work in Huang et al. (2005) which finds when




                                             21
trade policy positively affects some prices (e.g., horticultural crops), but negatively

affects others (e.g., wheat), farmers mitigate the downside effects by transferring

production into the commodities with rising prices.



Public Investment, Services and Subsidies

       Any visitor to most parts of rural China is struck by one thing: Agriculture is still

being carried out in many environments that can only be described as backward. Except

in a few suburban and coastal regions, the infrastructure in rural China is extremely poor.

Roads and bridges, irrigation and drainage, drinking water, schools and health facilities

are far from modern and decades behind the infrastructure in China’s cities. Yet

development economists know that for a country to modernize, its infrastructure has to be

able to support the production and marketing activities of a complex economy.

       Although the stock of infrastructure is poor there have been improvements in

recent years. Research has shown that on average each village in China had about one

infrastructure project during the late 1990s (Luo et al. 2007). This is far higher than in

most other developing nations in Asia. In recent years, the level of investment activity

has risen sharply (to almost one project per year). Most of these projects are public goods

(and not activities, such as orchards, in which governments frequently invested during the

1980s). In addition, research suggests that this investment is being targeted fairly well,

with increasing amounts going to poor, minority and remote parts of China.

       Although the level of public goods investment per capita has risen from about 40

to 100 US dollars (in PPP terms), it is still far below the levels that were enjoyed by rural

residents in Japan during the 1950s and South Korea during the 1970s (Luo et al., 2007).




                                             22
Quality, while rising, is still low in many villages (Liu et al., 2007). China is just

beginning the process of narrowing the gap between rural and urban infrastructure and it

will take an enormous and sustained effort to transform the rural economy.



Education and Health Programs

Rural services—in particular education and health—are perhaps the weakest part of the

rural economy, despite the recognition by development economists of their importance.

Rural education by any metric is abysmal. Fees—until recently—were high, even for

elementary school. Buildings and equipment are outdated and poor. Teaching quality is

poor. Because of poor education, there is evidence that even as the nation accelerates its

drive towards industrialization and urbanization—and agriculture is becoming more

complex and demanding—retention rates for farm children remain very low beyond the

compulsory nine years of schooling. Partly because tuition and associated fees are so

high—an estimated one-quarter of total expenditure for many poor households—

participation rates in high school (grades 10-12) are less than 15 percent for the rural

population. A national survey found that nearly half of rural residents believe education

has not improved in recent years (Liu et al., 2007).

       There has been a new surge of interest by the government in improving rural

education and reducing the cost of education—especially in poor, rural areas. In 2005,

fees for elementary schools were eliminated in poor areas. In 2006, this was expanded to

the entire rural economy. By 2007 all compulsory education (grades 1-9) was supposed to

be free. The income effects of such policies are potentially enormous. Huang et al. (2004)




                                              23
show that the elimination of government tuition fees provided a benefit more than twice

as large as the losses resulting from tariff reductions for China’s protected crops.

       The national and regional governments have also begun to build a rural health

care program. In its initial years, while funding was scarce, it is in high demand. By 2007

the government was investing up to 30 yuan per capita into the program.



Farm Subsidies and Taxes

The government launched a massive program of direct subsidies in 2004 and this

program is projected to expand further in the coming years. Designed in part to boost

production of grain (for national food self-sufficiency) and in part as a rural income

transfer, the national Grain Subsidy and the national new technology program have in a

very short time become fixtures in the rural economy. Nearly 80 percent of farm

households receive subsidies. Participation in the program is as high in poor areas as is it

is in higher-income areas (Tan et al., 2006). Although they were relatively small in the

first year of the program, by the second year, between the two programs, many farmers

were receiving about 10 to 15 yuan per mu, which is more than 70 yuan per acre.

       While farmers were obviously predisposed to favoring the program (who does not

like direct subsidies), there are several issues that China must weigh in considering the

long term benefit and sustainability of the program. First, is whether or not payments

under the Grain Subsidies should be counted towards the nation’s Aggregate Measure of

Support (AMS) at the WTO. In its accession to WTO, China agreed to keep its distorting

payments in agriculture below 8.5 percent of Agricultural Gross Domestic Product.

Obviously, if these payments were counted against the AMS, China could rapidly




                                             24
approach its maximum level of payments. But there is a question about whether these

payments are “distorting or not.” In 2004, a survey by RCRE found that more than 70

percent of the payments were decoupled, with farmers receiving the payment whether

they planted grain or any other crop. If this were the case, then such payments arguably

could be counted as pure, unlinked transfers and not counted. However, during the

second year of the program there was more of an effort to target households that

produced grain. If the payment is linked to the type of crop planted, it is likely to be

classified as a distorting subsidy with careful accounting needed to ensure it does not

violate the restriction on distorting subsidies under China’s WTO commitments.

         In addition to subsidies, the national government has eliminated almost all taxes

and fees in rural villages. In 2001 and 2002, all fees were converted to a single

agricultural tax that was not to exceed 8.5 percent of a household’s (village’s) gross value

of agricultural output. However, no sooner had this been implemented than the tax was

eliminated altogether. By 2007, surveys showed that farmers were paying almost no

taxes.

         When added together, the recent policy innovations in rural infrastructure, free

rural school tuition, grain and other agricultural subsidies, tax reductions and health

insurance subsidies are substantial. These government programs have likely injected

enough funds to contribute importantly to the observed improvements in household

incomes in rural areas.




                                             25
Improving Mobility of Labor out of Agriculture

China began the period under study with around half of its workforce in agriculture and

will reduce this fraction to just a few percent by the time she reaches high income status.

The rate of migration out of agriculture consistent with China’s growth path is one of the

most rapid ever observed. In almost all rapidly-growing economies, the resistance to this

adjustment, particularly due to sector and region-specific investments in human capital, is

frequently seen as the source of a “farm problem” in which farm incomes fall below

incomes in the rest of the economy.

       The usual resistances to labor out-migration are compounded by a number of

China-specific factors. One is the hukou residence permit system, which has restricted

mobility of labor into urban areas (see Sicular and Zhao 2004). Another is the land tenure

system, where households leaving the agricultural sector completely must relinquish their

land without compensation (Zhao 1999). Other China-specific resistances have come

from factors such as the low quality of educational opportunities in rural areas discussed

above. Unless these structural rigidities to mobility of labor out of agriculture are

reduced, the effectiveness of other reforms, such as tax cuts or price supports, is likely to

be diminished greatly, as excess labor remains bottled up in agriculture, earning low

returns. Where out-migration is feasible, de Brauw and Giles (2008) show that it

increases the living standards of the family members remaining, and tends to increase

their land holdings, although not necessarily their investment in other assets.

       During the period we consider, the hukou system has been relaxed considerably,

to the point where it is regarded by some, but not all, labor economists as a relatively

minor source of resistance to overall labor mobility out of agriculture. Relatively little




                                             26
appears, so far, to have been done to change the land tenure system to reduce this barrier

to mobility. The improvements in rural education discussed above seem likely to play a

key role in enhancing mobility, both by increasing returns from work outside agriculture,

and by lowering the costs of adjusting (Fan and Hertel 2004).



                              Conclusions and Implications

The main finding of this paper is that the nature of policy intervention in China’s

agriculture has changed dramatically over the past 25 years, transforming the agricultural

sector from one characterized by high and variable distortions to one that is relatively

liberal. In the 1980s and early 1990s (or the early reform period) there were distortions in

both external and domestic policies that isolated domestic producers and consumers from

international markets.

       During the early reform period domestic marketing and pricing policies actually

served to make the prices that domestic producers and consumers faced almost

independent from the effects of trade policy. In the case of rice and other exportable

commodities, heavy border distortions that reduced domestic prices were compounded by

a domestic procurement system that depressed farm prices and the prices paid by urban

consumers.. Similar dynamics characterized importable commodities such as wheat and

soybeans where, despite fairly high rates of protection from trade policies, producer

prices were relatively low.

       In contrast, since the late 1980s and early 1990s (the late reform period), the

liberalization of domestic markets has reduced the distortions from domestic policies (as

the market gradually has replaced the state as the primary mechanism for allocating




                                             27
resources and has became the basis for farmers’ production and marketing decisions). At

the same time, especially in the case of importable commodities, trade policy has been

liberalized, with distortions from border measures falling substantially. As a result, we

find that in recent years (that is, by the end of the late reform period), China’s agriculture

is much less distorted in two ways. First, the differences between international and

domestic market prices have narrowed considerably for many commodities due to trade

policy liberalization. Second, the elimination of domestic policy distortions increased

farm prices for many commodities. Reductions in protection to non-agricultural

tradables—a major element of the WTO accession negotiations—also appear to have

reduced the costs imposed on the agricultural sector.

       The main question, once the trade liberalization is established, then, shifts gear

and the focus of our analysis begins to try to understand how it could be—when there are

many places in China that have experienced large falls in protection to the agricultural

tariffs that they produce—that rural incomes still rose almost nationwide. In trying to

explain this puzzle, we examine three sources of income increases that might help offset

the fall in income brought on by trade liberalization. We explored the role of agricultural

technology, the rise of markets and the emergence of new subsidy and support policies.

       In our analysis we find that at the same time that trade liberalization policy was

reducing returns to some products that had been receiving positive protection, a number

of other elements were working to offset these effects. One was the reductions in taxation

of other important commodities, such as rice. At the same time, investments in R&D, the

fostering of markets and the new investment and subsidy programs appear to have

generated wide-ranging, positive income effects in rural China.




                                              28
       The implications of these findings are that, although trade policies may have had

negative effects on incomes in certain parts of the agricultural community, the magnitude

of these adverse impacts appears to have been widely overstated. This is partly because

the usual way of assessing the impact of WTO commitments—comparisons of bound

tariffs with prior applied tariffs—widely overstates the extent of liberalization required in

China. Another reason that these adverse impacts have frequently been overstated is that

the agricultural sector as a whole was negatively protected at the beginning of the period,

and most of this taxation has been eliminated. Another important source of gains was the

reduction in protection to some less-efficient import-competing sectors, which allowed

farmers to increase the value of their output. There were also important dynamic benefits

as new export activities emerged, and the cost to burden on agriculture of protection to

nonagricultural sectors was reduced.

       The reforms undertaken in China have included both trade policy reforms and

complementary domestic reforms that have helped to create greater opportunities for

rural people—a combination of policies widely seen as necessary if the greatest benefits

are to be achieved. China’s experience over the past quarter century appears to provide

some important lessons both for the future, and for policy makers grappling with similar

challenges in other countries.

Note: These measures are calculated in the same way as NRAs and NRAfs reported for
other commodities. However, the true NRAs for these commodities become zero after
1994 because China has no policies holding their prices below world levels.

  While NRAs only measure differences in output prices, there may also be distortions on
the input side, our NRAf measures include a number of budget support and tax measures..
The assumption and methods that were used to generate our exchange rate series are in
Martin et al. (2006).
