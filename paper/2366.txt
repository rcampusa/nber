    Firm Characteristics, Unanticipated Inflation, and Stock Returns




                                   ABSTRACT



      This   paper re-examines the effects of nominal contracts on the relationship
between unanticipated inflation and individual stock's rate of return. This study
differs in three main ways from previous research. First, announced inflation data
are used to examine the effects of unanticipated inflation. Second, a different
specification is used to obtain more efficient estimates. Third, additional nominal
contracts are considered.    The empirical results indicate that time-varying firm
characteristics related to inflation predominately determine the effect of
unanticipated inflation on a stock's rate of return. A firms debt-equity ratio
appears to be particularly important in determining the response.

       The behavior of the stock market during the high and volatile inflation of
the 1970s rekindled interest in the relationship between stock returns and inflation.
The subsequent resurgence of stock prices from 1982 to mid-1986, coinciding with a
marked reduction in inflation, is consistent with the experience of the 1970s. This
casual evidence suggests a negative relationship between stock returns and inflation,
contrary to the traditional view that long positions in stocks can be used as hedges
against inflation.
       A variety of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the observed
inflation-stock return relationship.    One hypothesis, advanced by Fama (1981),
Nelson (1979), and Geske and Roll (1983), argues that the observed effects of either
anticipated or unanticipated inflation on stock returns reflect other economic
factors. In particular, given the apparent negative correlation between inflation and
future economic output in historical data, the observed negative relationship
between inflation and stock returns is actually due to a positive relationship
between future economic activity and stock returns. Under this hypothesis, then,
causality cannot be attributed to the observed inflation-stock return relationship.
Moreover, this hypothesis implies that the effects of firm characteristics related to
inflation and nominal contracting are not important in determining an individual
stock's response to unanticipated inflation.
       A second hypothesis is based on investor irrationality during periods of
inflation. The principal advocates of this view are Modigliani and Cohn (1979).
They argue that investors do not correctly take into account the effects of
unanticipated inflation on a firm's outstanding debt. That is, the market does not
correctly value the implicit gain in shareholder wealth due to the fall in the real
value of a firm's outstanding debt. In addition to this effect, Modigliani and Cohn
hypothesize that investors mistakenly compare real rates of return on common
stock to the nominal interest rates on debt. These latter rates, of course, tend to
reflect any change in expeced inflation. As a consequence, the perceived rates of
return on equity fall relative to nominal debt yields during periods of increasing
inflation, thereby causing investors to bid down share prices. This hypothesis also
implies that a firm's leverage does not matter in determining an individual stock's
response to unanticipated inflation.
       A third main hypothesis about the relationship between inflation and stock
returns is based on the effects of a firm's nominal contracts. Several types of
nominal contracting effects have been proposed. First, increases in inflation further
erode the depreciation tax shield due to historical cost depreciation.     Feldstein
(1980) and Feldstein and Summers (1979), for example, estimate such effects to be a
significant determinant of aggregate equity values.     Second, spurious inventory
profits due to inflation increase a firm's real tax burden. Moreover, Summers (1981)
presents evidence that the effects of inflation on firms using the FIFO accounting
method for inventories are much more pronounced than on those using the LIFO
method. Third, a firm's nominal debt contracts potentially offset these negative
effects when inflation unexpectedly increases. As Kessel (1956) discussed in an
early contribution, as long as firms are net debtors unanticipated inflation should
benefit stockholders.    So, for at least some firms, the effects of unanticipated
inflation may be minimal.
      Recent empirical studies on the effects of nominal contracts on the response
of a firm's share price to unanticipated inflation do not lend much support to the
nominal contracting hypothesis.' French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983) suggest that
their evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of Fama (1981), Nelson (1979), and
Geske and Roll (1983). That is, the negative response of individual stock returns to
positive unanticipated inflation reflects a downward revision in expected future
economic activity. Bernard (1986) finds some support for the nominal contracting
hypothesis, but most of the estimated response of stock returns simply depends on
                                          3

a stock's systematic risk. This again is interpreted as providing support for the
future economic activity - stock return link. As noted in both of these studies,
however, a number of potentially important nominal contracts are excluded in the
empirical investigations. These include the nominal contracts associated with labor,
materials, and products, as well as the implicit nominal contracts associated with
taxable inventory profits and many pension plans.
       The purpose of this paper is to re-examine the effects of nominal contracts
on the relationship between unanticipated inflation and an individual stocks rate of
return. This study differs in three main ways from previous research. First, a
different measure of unanticipated inflation is used.      Previous research uses
empirical proxies to measure unanticipated inflation over a month, quarter, or year.
Moreover, the inflation data as currently revised are usually employed.           In

contrast, unanticipated announced changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are
used here. This approach allows news associated with inflation to be isolated, along
with any effect on stock returns. Second, the effects of nominal contracts are
examined in a somewhat different specification. The specification implies both a
more restrictive null hypothesis and more efficient estimates than those used
previously. Third, additional nominal contracts are considered in comparison to the
studies by French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983) and Bernard (1986). In particular, the
differential effects of unanticipated inflation on stock returns due to LIFO and
FIFO inventory accounting are considered.     In addition, the effects of a firm's
pension plan are investigated.
      In the first section, the model of the response of individual stock returns to
unanticipated inflation is presented. The data used in estimating the model also are
discussed. The estimation and test results are presented in the second section.
The tests focus on the effects of firm-specific characteristics. In the third
section, the implications of firm characteristics in determining the response of a
firms stock to unanticipated inflation are further analyzed. The main conclusions
are summarized in the final section.
                                 SPECIFICATION AND DATA

        The specification used to estimate the response of individual stock returns
to unanticipated inflation is similar to those of French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983)
and Bernard (1986). The model allows the response to depend both on general or
economy wide effects and individual firm characteristics. Under the null hypothesis
of no firm characteristic effects, however, the specification takes a somewhat
different form.
        To motivate the specification used here, consider the response of the rate of
return on stock i, R, to unanticipated inflation announced during day t:
                  =        + (YZ + 5X1)          INF' +                                (1)
                      Rt                                  e1t

where
              R1 =      expected      rate of return on stock i during day t as of time t-1,
                      = time-independent     firm i characteristic, normalized such that

                                N
                                          = 1,
                        (1/N)         Z
                                i=1


              N       = number   of firms in the market portfolio,
                      = time-varying firm i characteristic,

              INF' = INFt - INF, unanticipated inflation,
              INFt      announced inflation,
              INF =     expected value of announced inflation as of time t-1,

              et = random error term,
                      = fixed coefficients.

In this specification, the actual rate of return differs from what was expected by
two random errors.         The first corresponds to movements due to unanticipated
                                                5

inflation, depending on both fixed and time-varying firm characteristics.               The
second is the remaining component of the unanticipated movement in the stock's rate
of return. The expectation of both of these errors equals zero as of time t-1,
when the expectation of the rate of return was formed.
        Equation (1) is analogous to the specification presented by French, Ruback,
and Schwert (1983).     In particular, their specification includes both firm-specific
fixed Y(= YZ) and time-varying effects. The constant term in their specification
corresponds to Rt in equation (I). The null hypothesis tested by French, Ruback,
and Schwert (1983) is 6=0. Thus, the firm-specific fixed effects            are implicitly
associated with the economic activity hypothesis of Fama (1981), Nelson (1979), and
Geske and Roll (1983). However, two types of fixed effects may be embedded in
One is in fact the individual firm's stock response to economy-wide effects. The
other is firm-specific fixed effects apart from these economy-wide effects. If these
two types of fixed effects exist, the null hypothesis that 6=0 is not restrictive
enough to capture only the economic activity hypothesis.
        To consider both Bernard's (1986) specification and that estimated here, it is
useful to examine the response of the market. Given that the rate of return on an
individual stock is described by (1), the response of the market can be represented
as
              Rmt =   Rt + ') + 6Xt)         INF' +   emt,                            (2)

where                         N
              Rmt =   (1/N)E R1, market  rate of return for an equally weighted
                                  portfolio
                              i=1
                               N
              Rt =    (1/N)          R, expected market rate of return,
                              i= 1

                               N
              X=      (1/N)          X1, cross-section average of time-varying firm
                                          characteristics
                                                 b


                 emt     (1/N)     e, random error term

The estimated aggregate stock responses in previous studies [e.g., Nelson (1976),
Fama (1981), and Pearce and Roley (1985)] therefore reflect the averages of the
individual firm characteristics.
          Now assume that the single-factor market model describes the rates of return
on individual stocks:

                 R1t i + i3 Rmt + u1
where
                         = fixed coefficients,

                           random error term.
Combining (2) and (3), and using the fact that

                  it i 'i+ amt'
                 Re =        Re                                                     (3')

implies
                 R1t =   R+          INF' + j3 emt + u,t.
                                    + oX1)                                  (4)

Under the null hypothesis, u1 in equations (3) and (4) is independent of any firm-
specific fixed or time-varying effects, implying Z1 =           and   6=0 in equation (1).
That is, a stock's response is assumed to depend on its beta and the market's
response to unanticipated inflation. It seems plausible to associate this effect with
the economic activity hypothesis of Fama (1981), Nelson (1979), and Geske and Roll
(1983).

          To test the null hypothesis that Z1 =           and   6=0, equation (1) can be
rewritten as
             =
                 R + $1(y + 6X1)'1NF + [(Z - $) + 5(X11 - $Xt)1INF + et,
which is obtained by adding and subtracting 131(Y + 6X)          INF on the right-hand
side of equation (1). Equation (5) is analogous to Bernard's (1986) specification,
where R1 is again replaced by a time-invariant intercept and firm-specific fixed
effects are represented by y[= y(Z - i3)).           Bernards preferred specification,
                                            7


however, includes the constraint that y     equals   the same constant across firms. It
is difficult to motivate this constraint from the model. Bernard further estimates
   from an auxiliary sample, implying that the estimated coefficient on J3INF' is 'Y
in his specification.2
       The variance of the error term in equation (5) can be reduced with one
further substitution. In particular, using equations (2), (3), and (3'), equation (5) can
be expressed as

       Rit x +            [Y(Z -
                          +           + 6(X1 - $X)] INF1j' + e1 -         $ e1.      ')
Under the null hypothesis, the error term (eit - j3 emt) reduces to             In contrast,
the error term in equation (5) under the null hypothesis is i3 emt        +   uit, which has
an unambiguously larger variance than u1 since u and emt are uncorrelated. For
the same reasons, the variance of the error term in equation (5') also is smaller than
that in equation (1). As before, the null hypothesis is      =     and 6=0.

       In sum, several advantages are apparent in specification (5'). First, the null
hypothesis involves a test of both firm-specific fixed (apart from i3) and time-
varying responses of individual stocks to unanticipated inflation.              Second, the
variance of the error term is smaller than those in previous specifications. Third,
the intercept corresponds to      instead of Rt, where the latter may be expected to
vary over time.
Firm Characteristics and Inflation
      In the specification examined empirically, several different time-varying firm
characteristic variables corresponding to X1. in (5') are included. The specific model
estimated is
      Rt =      + i Rmt + O INF +         + 5i(INVt -


               + 62(LjtINVjt -   $ LINVt) + 63(DEBTt -           DEBT1)
                                             S


                                                   -
                 + 64(DEPRt        DEPR) + 6S(PENSt fi PENSt)1'INF' + u1.         (6)

As before, Rt is the daily rate of return on stock i during inflation announcement
day t, Rmt is the daily rate of return on the market portfolio, and u1. is the
random error term. The daily rate of return data are taken from the Center for
Research in Security Prices (CRSP), and Rmt is the rate of return on the value-
weighted CRSP index. The coefficients to be estimated are , O 'Yr, and
(j=l,2,...,S). The firm-specific fixed response coefficient       corresponds   to 1(Z -
   in equation (5'). As a result, the testable constraint that Z1 $ translates to
= 0.

          The inflation variables represent anticipated inflation, INF, and unanticipated
inflation, INF'. In both cases, the variables pertain to announcements of the
previous month's inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). For the
portion of the sample before March 198, CPI announcements were made at 9:00 a.m.,
eastern time. For the latter portion of the sample, these announcements were made
at 8:30 a.m., eastern time.
          The anticipated value of the CPI announcement, INF, is from the survey
conducted by Money Market Services, Inc. In all cases, the survey was taken less
than two weeks before each month's CPI announcement. Previous research indicates
that the median of this survey generally has desirable characteristics in that it is
an unbiased forecast of the announcement, it fully reflects past information on
inflation, and it outperforms simple forecasting models [Pearce and Roley (1985) and
Pearce (1987)]. When this variable is included in the estimation, its effects are
allowed to vary across firms, as indicated by the coefficient O. Under the efficient
markets hypothesis, however, this information already should be reflected in share
prices.      This estimated coefficient is therefore expected to be insignificantly
different from zero.
          Unanticipated inflation, INF' is calculated by subtracting the survey measure
                                              9


of expected inflation from the actual announced percentage change in the CPI. This
measure of unanticipated inflation corresponds to the error in predicting the
previous month's inflation.     This error is nevertheless a statistically significant
determinant of the survey measure of expected announced inflation in the
subsequent month. In particular, a one percentage point increase in unanticipated
announced inflation causes an upward revision in the subsequent month's expectation
of announced inflation of 0.3 percentage points [Pearce (1987)].        This evidence
indicates that the new information provided by an inflation announcement has value
in predicting current and future inflation.
       The remaining terms in equation (6), with coefficients 61(i=l,2,...,5), represent
time-varying firm characteristics X1 adjusted by a firm's             and the average
characteristics of the market       The firm characteristic variables are taken from
COMPUSTAT, and the previous year's values are used. Moreover, all of these
variables are deflated by the market value of the firm's outstanding equity as of
the end of the previous year. The average characteristics of the market are
calculated using about 500 COMPUSTAT firms which are comparable to those used
to estimate equation (6).
       The first firm characteristic variable, lNVt, is the value of a firm's
inventories.   This same variable multiplied by L1t takes different inventory
accounting methods into account. L1t is a dummy variable with value of unity if
firm i predominately uses LIFO and zero if' it predominately uses FIFO. The next
variable, DEBTt, is the book value of firm i's long-term debt.4 The variable
measuring a firm's depreciation tax shield, DEPRt, is defined following French,
Ruback, and Schwert (l983).
      Finally, the effects of a firm's pension plan is represented by PENSt. This
variable is defined as pension expense, and it reflects the average annual future
pension expense of a firm. This variable is included to measure the size of a firm's
                                          10

pension plan. While other variables may seem as revant in evaluating the effects
of inflation, especially a firm's unfunded pension liability [e.g., Feldstein and
Seligman (1981)1, this measure appears to be more closely related to share prices.6
In examining the effects of pensions fully, a number of additional characteristics
also should be considered. Of particular importance is whether a pension is a
defined benefit plan or a defined contribution plan. If a pension is a defined benefit
plan, it may be potentially important to consider the composition of the pension
firm's assets, as well as the value of the unfunded pension liability. Based on the
data reported by Kotlikoff and Smith (1983), it appears that asset composition is
related to the size of a pension plan.' As a result, the PENSt variable may
capture some asset composition effects. Additional factors include the wage policy
of the firm and the degree to which pension benefits are indexed [e.g., Pesando
(1987)1. For an unanticipated increase in inflation, the value of the pensions assets
most likely falls, but the real value of the firm's liability also may fall [e.g., Bulow
(1982) and Bodie, Marcus and Merton (1985)].       Thus, the net effect is uncertain.
The pension expense variable is included as a preliminary attempt to examine the
net effect.
       In sum, a variety of variables are included to capture the response of
individual stocks to unanticipated inflation. For a set of representative stocks as a
group, previous research indicates that the effect of positive unanticipated inflation
by itself should be negative. The effect of the FIFO inventory accounting 5i
should contribute to this negative impact.        LIFO inventory accounting should
substantially offset the negative effect associated with       implying an anticipated
positive sign for 6.,. The coefficient 53 is expected to be positive, reflecting the
gains to shareholders due to an unanticipated decline in the real value of a firm's
outstanding debt.     The larger a firm's depreciation expenses, the more it is
adversely affected by positive inflation surprises.        So, 54 is expected to be
                                            11

negative. Finally, the net effect of a firm's pension expense depends on a variety
of factors, implying that the sign of      is unknown a priori.
       The sample period used in estimating equation (6) begins in November 1977
and ends in December 1982. The starting point coincides with the availability of
the survey data for inflation announcements.             This sample has a total of 62
observations, corresponding to one inflation announcement day during each month of
the sample.
       A total of 84 firms are considered over this sample period. This limited
number of firms is considered because of the estimation techniques used, which are
discussed in the next section. To limit the size of the sample, and to ensure an
adequate representation of firms to test the null hypothesis that all inflation
effects are incorporated in the single-factor market model, the sample was initially
selected according to the values of Value Line betas. Firms were selected that had
betas of exactly 0.8, 1.0 and 1.2 as of the end of the sample period. Further firms
were deleted depending on the availability of data from COMPUSTAT, and whether
the firm used the same inventory accounting procedure over the 1977-1982 period.
The sample used by Bernard (1986) consists of 136 firms. French, Ruback, and
Schwert (1983) examine 158 firms with data in each quarter of their sample. In each
of these studies, portfolios of stocks are considered, thereby eliminating some of
the advantages of larger cross-sectional samples.
      Because of the relatively small size of this sample, at least in comparison to
the universe of stocks available on the CRSP tapes, it is important to determine
whether the sample is representative of the stock market as a whole. In this
respect, two equations were estimated to compare the aggregate response of the
sample with that of the CRSP index:

              Rmt b0 + b1INF +       b-,INF' + et,
              R. =
               1
                     b.1   + b INFe + b-INF' + u     ,                          (8)
                                         12


where the b's are coefficients, et and Ut are random error terms, and the other
variables are as defined previously.
       The estimation results of equations (7) and (8) are reported in Table 1. The
equations are estimated using ordinary least squares over the entire sample period.
For the rate of return on the CRSP market index on inflation announcement days, a
positive one percentage point inflation surprise is associated with an average decline
of 0.87 percent in this rate of return.8 The effect of anticipated inflation is
estimated to be insignificantly different from zero at the 10 percent level.9 For
the rates of return on the sample of 84 stocks, the estimation results are
comparable. For these stocks, the estimated negative effect of a positive inflation
surprise is somewhat larger, but the effect of anticipated inflation again is
insignificantly different from zero. As a whole, the results suggest that the   sample

stocks selected are representative of the much broader CRSP market index.


                               ESTIMATION RESULTS

       The response of the 84 stocks to unanticipated inflation is estimated using
the seemingly unrelated regression technique (SUR). Because the number of stocks
exceeds the number of inflation announcements, it was not possible to consider the
entire set of 84 stocks together. As a consequence, two subsamples of 42 stocks
were formed. These two subsamples were arbitrarily selected except that roughly
equal numbers of firms using LIFO and FIFO inventory accounting were placed in
each sample. As is apparent in the reported estimation results, no effort was made
to make the results of the two subsamples the same. Moreover, the first subsample
has somewhat more desirable characteristics in that the explanatory variables
exhibit more variability.
      Two different versions of equation (6) are estimated for each of the
subsamples of stocks. The most general version corresponds exactly to equation
                                            13


(6).     The other version excludes the pension variable because of its uncertain
• theoretical effect.   Equation (1), corresponding to the specification adopted by
French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983), also is estimated. In this case, firm-specific
intercepts replace Rt in equation (1), and expected inflation is included in a manner
analogous to equation (6).10      This specification is considered to determine the
relative importance of using unanticipated announced inflation versus the usual
empirical proxies.
          The estimation results for both subsamples of stocks estimated over the
November 1977 -      December   1982 period are reported in Table 2. For the first
subsample of stocks, the results for the most general model are reported in the first
row. Again, this specification includes four firm-specific coefficients, oj,   Y, and
       not reported in the table. Also, each of the time-varying firm characteristic
variables are adjusted by f3 X as indicated in equation (6). The results indicate
that four coefficients on time-varying firm characteristics are statistically
significant at the 10 percent level. The coefficient on the inventory variable is
negative, as expected. The coefficient on the LIFO term, however, is insignificantly
different from zero. The coefficient on the debt variable is positive, reflecting the
gains to shareholders due to a decrease in the real value of a firms outstanding
debt in the presence of a positive inflation shock. For a ratio of long-term debt to
equity of one half, for example, a one percentage point inflation shock increases a
stock's rate of return by about 4.6 percentage points. The depreciation variable
has the anticipated negative coefficient and is statistically significant at the 10
percent level, reflecting a reduction in the tax shield due to an increase in
unanticipated inflation. The final variable, pension expense, has a positive and
statistically significant coefficient in this particular specification.
         In the various specifications estimated for the first subsample of firms, two
robust firm-specific effects are evident.        In particular, in all cases the FIFO
inventory and debt variables have statisially significant effects, with the
anticipated signs.U     In some specifications, the remaining firm characteristic
variables also have statistically significant effects. Moreover, the hypothesis that
both firm-specific fixed and time-varying characteristics have no effect on the
response to unanticipated inflation (y = 6   =
                                                 2   =
                                                         63     64 =   65
                                                                            = 0)   can be rejected
in both versions of equation (6). In this case, all effects are assumed to operate
through a stock's beta under the null hypothesis. The weaker hypothesis that only
time-varying firm characteristics have no effect              = 62            64 = 65 = 0) also
                                                                       63
can be rejected. Finally, the results also suggest that the use of unanticipated
announced inflation is largely responsible for the significant effects, and not the
lower variance of the error term implied by equations (5') and (6). In particular, the
results for equation (1) are comparable to those of equation (6). In turn, the main
difference in equation (1) from the specification estimated by French, Ruback, and
Schwert (1983) is the use of unanticipated announced inflation.
      The results for the second subsample of firms, reported in the last three
rows of Table 2, are similar to those of the first with one exception. The
exception is the coefficient on the pension variable, which is negative and
statistically significant. The effects of FIFO inventories and debt are qualitatively
the same.      Also, the hypothesis that both fixed and time-varying firm
characteristics have no effect on the response again can be rejected.
      As a whole, the results indicate that a stock's response to unanticipated
inflation depends on the characteristics of the firm. Moreover, each of the firm-
characteristic variables is significant in at least some specifications. The variable
with the most robust effects across subsamples and specifications is the long-term
debt variable. The results related to this variable suggest that firms with high
debt-equity ratios are less susceptible to any adverse effects from positive
unanticipated inflation.    This provides evidence against the Modigliani-Cohn
                                         15

hypothesis. The economic implications of firm characteristics are further examined
in the next section.


                       IMPLICATIONS OF FIRM CHARACTERISTICS

       The presence of statistically significant firm-characteristic effects suggests
that different stocks responses to unanticipated inflation may vary considerably
across firms. To consider this possibility initially, the responses of the individual
stocks are summarized in Chart 1. The chart represents the average responses of
all 84 firms to a 1 percentage point inflation surprise, using the average values of
each firm's characteristics over the estimation period and the estimated coefficients
of equation (6). These estimated coefficients are reported in the first and fourth
rows of Table 2. The response due to the market factor is calculated using a
stock's estimated beta in equation (6) and the estimated response of the market rate
of return as reported in Table 1.
       The chart indicates that the majority of the stocks register an average
response to a 1 percentage point increase in unanticipated inflation between -2.5 and
-.5 percent.'2 As is apparent, however, some stocks are affected both much more
and much less than this amount.      Indeed, some of the stocks record a positive
response.
       To investigate the determinants of the individual responses further, summary
measures of the time-varying firm characteristic variables and betas are reported in
Table 3. These measures correspond to averages of the highest third, middle third,
and lowest third of the values for the first subsample of firms. The average
characteristics of the sample of about 500 COMPUSTAT firms used to construct the
   variables in equation (6) also are included. As indicated in the table, both betas
and time-varying firm characteristics exhibited considerable cross-sectional
variation 13
                                            16

       In Table 4, the va]ies of betas and two time-varying firm-characteristic
variables in Table 3 --   FIFO   inventories and debt -- are formally combined with the
estimated coefficients from the first row of Table 2 to consider the relative
importance of these factors. In this table, high, medium, and low values of these
variables are combined in all possible combinations.         Other time-varying firm-
characteristics are assumed to take their market values in the fourth row of Table
3. Across the top of the table, different combinations of debt and FIFO inventories
are considered.      Each row similarly examines different values ofeta. The
reported figure in the first row and first column, for example, indicates that a firm
with a low beta, low debt, and low inventories with FIFO (L, L, L), has an average
rate of return of'
-0.59 percent on its stock in response to a 1 percentage point inflation surprise.
       The individual figures reported in the table suggest economically important
differences in rates of return in response to unanticipated inflation. The lowest
rate of return is -10.09 percent. In this case, a firm has a high beta, low debt, and
high inventories.      In contrast, the other extremes of all of these firm
characteristics yield a rate of return of 6.67 percent. That is, a low beta, high
debt, and low inventories actually imply a positive rate of' return larger than the 1
percentage point increase in unanticipated inflation.        In general, the debt and
inventory variables are particularly important in determining a stock's response. In
contrast, variation over the range of a stock's beta considered here does not
account for as much of the differences across the responses.
       Some of the values in Table 4 exceed the range of responses illustrated in
Chart 1. As a consequence, it is useful to consider an alternative approach of
evaluating the relative importance of a firm's beta versus its other characteristics.
In this respect, the estimated responses of all 84 firms are plotted against their
estimated betas in Chart 2.        Each point on the horizontal axis represents the
                                            17


response of an individual firm's stock to a one percent inflation surprise, using
sample averages of the firm's characteristic variables. Using these average values,
the responses are calculated using the first and fourth rows in Table 2, along with
estimates of firm-specific fixed effects . If the estimated betas account for all of
the responses of the individual stocks, the points in Chart 2 should lie on a line
with a slope equal to -0.87, the response of the market to a 1 percent inflation
surprise from Table 1. The chart instead indicates considerable dispersion in the
responses.    Indeed, the simple correlation between the estimated betas and the
estimated responses is only 0.18. Thus, most of the variation across the estimated
responses is due to factors other than beta.
       As a whole, the results indicate that time-varying firm characteristics related
to inflation play a major role in determining a stock's response to unanticipated
inflation.   Fixed economywide effects, which are assumed to operate through a
stock's beta, play much less of a role. As a consequence, these results support the
nominal contracting hypothesis, contrary to the results presented by French,
Ruback, and Schwert (1983) and Bernard (1986).


                           SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

       This paper re-examined the effects of unanticipated inflation on the rates of
return on individual stocks. This empirical research differed in several ways from
previous studies.     First, a different measure of unanticipated inflation was
employed.     The measure corresponded to the unanticipated component of the
monthly CPI announcement. Second, a larger set of firm-specific characteristics was
considered, including different inventory accounting methods and pensions. Finally,
the effects of firm characteristics were tested against a plausible null hypothesis
involving the single-factor market model.
       The empirical results indicated that time-varying firm characteristics related
                                          Lu


to inflation predominately determine the effect of unanticipated inflation on a
stock's rate of return.    Moreover, the net effect could be either positive or
negative. A firms debt-equity ratio and its inventories, when FIFO inventory
accounting is used, appear to be particularly important in determining the response.
A firm's market beta also is a significant factor, but the associated effect is smaller
in comparison. These results therefore offer support to the nominal contracting
hypothesis, in contrast to those of French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983) and Bernard
(1986). Given the significant role of debt-equity ratios in determining a stock's
response, the results also contradict the investor irrationality hypothesis presented
by Modigliani and Cohn (1979).
      The results also suggest several promising areas of future research. First,
to ensure the robustness of the results, additional sets of stocks could be
considered. Second, the estimation period could be extended beyond that covered
by the inflation announcement survey data. In this case, simple time-series models
of inflation might be appropriate. Finally, given the results concerning the effects
of a firms pension plan on the response to unanticipated inflation, it seems
worthwhile to isolate the various effects associated with pensions.

                                   FOOTNOTES

1.   Hong (1977) investigated the nominal contracting hypothesis but did not
     distinguish between expected and unexpected inflation.


2.   Equation (5) differs from Bernard's (1986) specification in that the two j3 5Xt
     terms   are excluded. Thus, the coefficient on     INF' is    and   time-varying
     firm characteristic effects are represented by 6XtiNF.


3.   The firms are comparable in that all the characteristics considered here are
     reported and the same fiscal years are used.


4.   Following French, Ruback, and Schwert (1983), this variable is defined as the
     sum of' bonds and preferred stock. A short-term debt variable is not included
     because its effects are likely to be small in comparison.


5.   This variable is calculated using plant and equipment (FE) data and deferred
     tax account (DT) data from COMPUSTAT. The tax shield is defined as PE-
     2DT, assuming a marginal tax rate of 50 percent.


6.   Daley (1984) compares a variety of different pension measures in terms of
     their empirical relationship with stock prices. Based on his research, the
     pension expense measure appears to be the most relevant.


7.   In Tables 5.6.3 and 5.6.4, Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) report the portfolio
     composition of private pension plans by size of the pension fund. The data
     suggest that the fraction of assets invested in equities increases with the
                                         2U


      size of the fund. Also, the fraction held in cash and deposits declines with
      size.


8.    This result is similar to that reported by Schwert (1981) except that he finds
      that the market return (measured by the S&P composite index) falls by .99
      percent the day prior to the announcement and about .52 percent on the day
      of the announcement for the period 1971-78. His measure of unexpected
      inflation is actual inflation minus the beginning of the month one-month
      Treasury bill rate plus the mean real rate over the period. Also, the
      response on inflation announcement days is only considered here, both for the
      market and individual stocks. Using inflation announcement and survey data,
      Pearce and Roley (1985) do not find any significant effects other than on the
      announcement day.


9.    Both of these results are comparable to those obtained by Pearce and Roley
      (1985) for the Standard and Poors 500 index except that the response was not
      significantly different from zero when the period was split into two
      subperiods. Also note that intercepts are not reported in Table 1, but they
      were included in estimating equations (7) and (8). As indicated in equation (8),
      the intercepts were allowed to vary over individual stocks. Finally, none of
      the percentage changes or rates of return are annualized.


10.   All specifications also were estimated excluding anticipated inflation. Because
      anticipated and unanticipated inflation are very close to being orthogonal, the
      estimates are virtually unchanged. In contrast to the results in Table 1,
      however, the hypothesis that the coefficients on expected inflation (Ok) equal
      zero can be rejected in all specifications at the 5 percent significance level.
                                             21



11.   Recent studies on the SUR estimation procedure suggests that the asymptotic
      standard errors used in forming t-ratios in Table 2 may be downward biased.
      See, for example, Marais (1986). However, doubling the standard errors for
      the first subsample of firms still implies statistically significant effects from
      the FIFO inventory and debt variables. Three-fold increases in the standard
      errors maintains the significance of the debt variable. The importance of
      these firm characteristic variables in determining a stock's response to
      unanticipated inflation is considered further in the next section.


12.   A one percent CPI surprise is very large since these are monthly inflation
      rates. The average absolute error for the survey median predictions was .17
      percent or about 2 percentage points when annualized. There were, however,
      several times when the error was .5 percent or higher (above 6 percentage
      points when annualized).


13.   Betas were allowed to take their estimated values, not the Value Line values
      used to form the sample. Also, in comparison to the medium values in Table
      3, the sample means --     equal   to the average of the high, medium, and low
      values -- are closer to the market values.

Notes: Constant terms, ci., coefficients on the market rate of return, ., and expected
        inflation, 0., ar allowed to vary for each stock. Equation (1) also is estimated
         with expected inflation. All estimates were done using the SYSNLIN procedure of
         SAS, version 5. Variables are defined in the text and in Table 1.


                     = x2 statistic with n degrees of freedom. This test statistic, analogous
                       to a likelihood ratio test, is discussed in Gallant and Jorgenson (1979).

Notes: High corresponds to the average of the highest one—third of the firms,
        Medium corresponds to the average of the middle one—third of the
        firms, and Low corresponds to the average of the lowest one-third of
        the firms for each characteristic separately. Market represents the
        average of about 500 COMPUSTAT firms, corresponding to the    vari-
        ables in equation (6). Also consistent with equation (6), the 1,
        DEBT, DEPR, and PENS variables are deflated by the market value of a
        firm's outstanding equity as of the end of the previous year.

Notes: High (H), Medium (M), and Low CL) values are taken from Table 3. The
        DEPR and PENS variables take their market values in Table 3 for all
        calculations. In calculating the effects of different betas, the esti-
        mated response of the market portfolio, R, in Table 1 is used. Other
        estimated coefficients used in the calculations are taken from the
        first row of Table 2.
