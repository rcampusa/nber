       To say that an agent has an eÔ¨Äective property right means that this agent controls the
allocation of some valuable resources and the distribution of the fruits of this allocation.1
Traditionally, general-equilibrium models have taken eÔ¨Äective property rights to be given
and have been concerned only with analysing the allocation of resources among productive
uses and the distribution of the resulting product.2 But, this formulation of the economic
problem is incomplete because it neglects that the appropriative activities by which agents
create the eÔ¨Äective property rights that inform allocation and distribution are themselves an
alternative use of scarce resources.
       This paper develops two general-equilibrium models of resource allocation and income
distribution in which agents allocate some of their scarce time and eÔ¨Äort to creating eÔ¨Äec-
tive property rights to valuable resources, rather than to production.3 To keep the analy-
   1
       EÔ¨Äective property rights are synonymous with what Dani Rodrik (2000) calls ‚Äúcontrol rights‚Äù. Rodrik
contrasts control rights with the formal property rights entailed in legal ownership. He stresses that control
rights are the operational concept for economic analysis. Rodrik writes (page 5), ‚ÄúThe key word is ‚Äòcontrol‚Äô
rather than ‚Äòownership‚Äô. Formal property rights do not count for much if they do not confer control rights.
By the same token, suÔ¨Éciently strong control rights may do the trick even in the absence of formal property
rights.‚Äù For present purposes the de√ûnition of eÔ¨Äective property rights is unambiguous. In the abstract
models analysed in this paper subtle issues about the multiple dimensions of property rights and the nature
of constraints, whether legal or social, on the exercise of property rights do not arise. See ThraÃÅinn Eggertsson
(1990) and Eirik Furubotn and Rudolf Richter (1997) for overviews of the extensive literature that addresses
these issues.
   2
       An extensive literature examines the eÔ¨Äects of property rights on resource allocation. This literature
also takes the security or insecurity of property rights as given. For a recent example and further references,
see Henning Bohn and Robert Deacon (2000).
   3
       In a brief and long neglected contribution Trygve Haavelmo (1954, pages 91-98) provided a canonical
general-equilibrium model of the allocation of resources between productive and appropriative activities.
Over the years a number of authors have reinvented Haavelmo‚Äôs formalization of this problem and have
extended the analysis in a variety of ways. The present paper builds most directly on the analysis of
Winston Bush and Lawrence Mayer (1974). Other related papers include Stergios Skaperdas (1992), Jack
Hirshleifer (1995), and Herschel Grossman and Minseong Kim(1995). In contrast to the present paper, the


                                                       1
sis simple, both of these models assume that the valuable resources are nondurable and
nonrenewable.4 The two models diÔ¨Äer in their speci√ûcations of the state of nature that
exists prior to the creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights.
       In one model the valuable resources are initially in a common pool. Examples include
wild animals, √ûsh, or plants that agents want to harvest, minerals that agents want to
extract, or land that agents want to cultivate or to use for grazing, but over which no agent
has claimed as yet to have an eÔ¨Äective property right. In this model agents create eÔ¨Äective
property rights by using time and eÔ¨Äort to appropriate resources from a common pool.
       In the other model agents initially have claims, which can be more or less secure, to the
valuable resources. We can think of these claims as being natural in the sense that they
arose in the process of discovery or creation of these resources. Examples include a person‚Äôs
claim to his own ideas or to things that he has produced with his own hands.5 In this
model agents create eÔ¨Äective property rights, or, more precisely, convert initial claims into
eÔ¨Äective property rights, by using time and eÔ¨Äort to defend their own initial claims and to
challenge the initial claims of others. Relative success in challenging and defending initial
claims determines the security of initial claims.
       In contrast to much of the literature on property rights, the models in this paper study the
models in these papers abstract from time and eÔ¨Äort and assume that agents use only a single resource both
to appropriate resources and to produce consumables.
   4
       Extending the analysis to allow for durable or renewable resources would require a dynamic model in
which agents anticipate having to maintain the eÔ¨Äective property rights that they create. The consideration
of durable or renewable resources also would require a distinction between the stock of resources and the
√üow of resources or resource services units that are withdrawn from the stock.
   5
       Claims to durable resources could be the result of prior appropriation of resources from a common pool.
Examples include claims that agents staked out to public lands, as in the California Gold Rush of 1849.
In this example the creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights would involve two stages. In allocating time and
eÔ¨Äort to the competition to stake out claims to resources in the √ûrst stage, agents would anticipate having to
defend these claims in the second stage. I leave the modeling of such a two-stage process for another time.

creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights in an anarchic environment that abstracts from the state
and the legal system. Although political theory typically views the state to be the enforcer
of cooperative action to protect property rights, actual states sometimes either shirk this
ostensible role or, even worse, act in such a way as to make property rights less secure rather
than more secure. In these cases we can think of the state as being just another agent in an
essentially anarchic environment.6
       In any event the existence of a state and a legal system is neither necessary nor suÔ¨Écient
for the existence of eÔ¨Äective property rights. In my view the existing literature on property
rights focuses too much on the state and the legal system and does not give adequate
attention to the appropriative activities of individual agents. The present paper redresses
this imbalance.

1. The Creation of Property Rights from a Common Pool of Resources
       Consider a group of n + 1 identical unitary agents, n ‚àà {1, 2, 3, ...}. These agents can
be individuals, or they can be groups, such as families or tribes or other coalitions, who act
as unitary agents. The agents can even be sovereign states, again as long as we can assume
that they act as unitary agents. Each agent is endowed with one unit of inalienable time
and eÔ¨Äort.
       Let there also be (n+1)E divisible units of valuable resources. As mentioned above, the
analysis assumes, for simplicity, that these resources are nondurable and nonrenewable. The
resources are initially in a common pool. The appropriation of resources from the common
pool requires time and eÔ¨Äort. Also, both time and eÔ¨Äort and resources are inputs into the
production of consumables. Thus, the economic problem in this model is that appropriation
   6
       Bush and Mayer (1974) augment their analysis of an anarchic equilibrium with a critical evaluation of
the possible role of the state in enforcing cooperative action to protect property rights. Grossman (2000)
derives conditions under which the existence of a state that protects property rights is or is not a Pareto
improvement over anarchy. Mendoza (1999) derives conditions under which the state chooses to free ride on
the eÔ¨Äorts of private agents to protect property rights.


                                                      3
and production are alternative uses of time and eÔ¨Äort. Each agent must choose how to
allocate its endowment of time and eÔ¨Äort between these activities.7
       To model the creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights by appropriation from a common pool,
let i, j = 1, 2, ..., n + 1, and assume that
                                                      ri
(1)                                     ei =          P              (n + 1)E,
                                               ri +        j6=i rj

where ei denotes the amount of resources that agent i appropriates from the common
pool, ri denotes the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that agent i allocates to the appropriative
competition, and rj denotes the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that agent j allocates to the
appropriative competition.8
       Equation (1) is a black box that does not specify the process of appropriation. The
appropriative competition modelled by equation (1) could involve such disparate processes
as a nonviolent scramble, a division under the threat of force, or a violent struggle. In this
respect equation (1) is like a standard generic production function, which does not specify
the process of production. Equation (1) does not tell us how agents appropriate from the
common pool any more than a production function tells us how to make cars.
       Equation (1) simply says the following:

         Agent i creates an eÔ¨Äective property right to a fraction of the resources in the
         common pool that equals the fraction that agent i contributes to the total time
         and eÔ¨Äort that the n + 1 agents allocate to the appropriative competition.9
   7
       We could generalize this model without changing the main implications by assuming that the appro-
priation of resources requires both time and eÔ¨Äort and weapons that are produced by combining time and
eÔ¨Äort with the resources.
   8
       Hirshleifer (1995) suggests a generalization of equation (1) in which each agent‚Äôs allocation of time and
eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative competition is raised to a positive power. Hirshleifer calls this exponent the
‚Äúdecisiveness parameter.‚Äù In this context equation (1) is a special case in which the decisiveness parameter
equals one. Grossman, Kim, and Juan Mendoza (2000) explore the importance of the decisiveness parameter.
   9
       We could easily extend the analysis to allow the appropriative competition to despoil some of the

                                                             4
Accordingly, equation (1) exhibits two critical properties.

   1. If, for all j 6= i, rj equals zero, and if ri is positive, then ei equals (n + 1)E.
         This property says that, if no other agent is allocating time and eÔ¨Äort to the appro-
         priative competition, then, by allocating any small amount of time and eÔ¨Äort to the
         appropriative competition, agent i can appropriate the entire amount of resources in
         the common pool.

   2. If, for any j 6= i,       rj is positive, then ei is positive if and only if ri is positive.
         This property says that, with at least one other agent allocating time and eÔ¨Äort to
         the appropriative competition, agent i appropriates a positive amount of resources
         from the common pool if and only if it allocates time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative
         competition.

       Taken together, these two properties imply that the dominant strategy of each agent,
taking as given the allocation decisions of other agents, is to allocate time and eÔ¨Äort to
the appropriative competition. Equation (1) precludes the possibility that the agents would
choose to allow the valuable resources to remain in the common pool.10
resources by assuming that the amount of resources that the agents appropriate from the common pool is
smaller than the amount of resources initially in the common pool by an amount of spoilage that depends
on the amounts of time and eÔ¨Äort that the agents allocate to the appropriative competition. Assuming
that each agent takes the amount of spoilage as given, allowing for spoilage would not change the main
implications of the analysis.
  10
       In contrast to equation (1), the models in David de Meza and J. R. Gould (1992) and Aaron Tornell
(1997) assume that appropriating resources from a common pool involves a √ûxed cost. These models also
assume that agents can exploit valuable resources under conditions of open access without appropriating
them from a common pool. Under these assumptions the agents might choose to allow resources to remain
in a common pool. Another theoretical and empirical literature explores the possibility that, if agents
interact repeatedly, then they can avoid appropriative competition by making credible commitments to
share resources that are in a common pool. See, for example, Elinor Ostrom (1990) and Ostrom, et al.



                                                    5
       Equation (1) also exhibits the following important properties.
‚Ä¢ If, for any j 6= i,           rj is positive, then the partial derivative, ‚àÇei /‚àÇri is positive.
This property says that, given the positive amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that other agents are
allocating to the appropriative competition, the amount of resources that agent i appropri-
ates from the common pool is larger the more time and eÔ¨Äort that agent i allocates to the
appropriative competition.
‚Ä¢ The partial derivative, ‚àÇei /‚àÇri , evaluated with ri equal to rj for all i and j, is larger
the larger is n. This property says that, if every agent is allocating the same amount of time
and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative competition, then the larger is the scale of the economy the
larger is the marginal eÔ¨Äect of allocating time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative competition
on the amount of resources that agent i appropriates from the common pool. This result
obtains because, the larger is n, the larger is the eÔ¨Äect of ri on the fraction that agent i
contributes to the total time and eÔ¨Äort that the n + 1 agents allocate to the appropriative
competition. Note that, given E, a larger value of n implies both a larger number of
agents and an equiproportionately larger endowment of resources.
       Turning to the technology of production, let `i denote the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort
that agent i allocates to the production of consumables, and let ci denote agent i0 s
consumption. Assume that ci depends on `i and on ei according to a standard Cobb-
Douglas technology,11

(2)                                      ci = eŒ±i `1‚àíŒ±
                                                   i   , 0 < Œ± < 1.

       The parameter Œ± in equation (2) measures the importance of resources relative to
(1994). Presumably, such cooperative agreements are the basis for forming the unitary agents in the present
model in cases in which these unitary agents comprise groups of people. We can regard the present analysis
of the creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights as complementary to the analysis of cooperation, with the present
analysis becoming relevant when agents have exhausted opportunities for amicable sharing of resources.
  11
       Grossman, Kim, and Mendoza (2000) extend this analysis to consider the class of constant-elasticity-of
substitution technologies, of which the Cobb-Douglas technology is a special case.


                                                       6
time and eÔ¨Äort for producing consumables. In the limit as Œ± approaches one, the resources
themselves are consumable, and the conversion of resources into consumables does not require
time and eÔ¨Äort. Smaller values of Œ± represent production technologies in which resources
are less important relative to the time and eÔ¨Äort allocated to fabrication.
       Agent i chooses ri and `i to maximize its consumption subject to ri + `i = 1. Assume
that in making these choices, agent i takes other agents‚Äô choices, rj for all j 6= i, as given.
Thus, the √ûrst-order condition for the solution to agent i0 s choice problem is

                                        dci   ‚àÇci ‚àÇei ‚àÇci
(3)                                         =        ‚àí    = 0.
                                        dri   ‚àÇei ‚àÇri ‚àÇ`i

Equation (3) says that agent i chooses ri such that the marginal bene√ût of ri in increasing
the amount of resources that agent i appropriates from the common pool equals the marginal
cost of ri in decreasing the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that agent i allocates to production.
       Equation (3) implies a unique, symmetrical equilibrium in which ri equals rj for all
pairs i and j. Using this equality and equations (1) and (2) to solve equation (3), we obtain
for the equilibrium allocation of time and eÔ¨Äort,

                                 ri     ri      n   Œ±
(4)                                 =        =                     for all i.
                                 `i   1 ‚àí ri   n+1 1‚àíŒ±

See the Appendix for the derivation of equation (4).
       Equation (4) con√ûrms that each agent allocates time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative
competition. Equation (4) also implies that the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that each agent
allocates to the appropriative competition is larger, and, hence, the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort
that each agent allocates to production is smaller, the larger is n, the scale of the economy,
and the larger is Œ±, the relative importance of resources for producing consumables.12 The
eÔ¨Äect of n obtains because, as we have seen, in a symmetrical equilibrium the marginal
  12
       We can view the positive relation between ri and n as consistent with the common observation that
life is more competitive in large cities than in small towns. I thank Harl Ryder for this observation.



                                                      7
eÔ¨Äect of an agent‚Äôs allocating more time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative competition on the
amount of resources that the agent appropriates from the common pool is increasing in n.
       Also, in equation (4) the allocation of time and eÔ¨Äort does not depend on E, the amount
of resources in the common pool. This result obtains because in this model agents allocate
time and eÔ¨Äort either to appropriation or to production, and the return to both activities
increases proportionately with the amount of resources in the common pool.13

2. The Conversion of Initial Claims to Resources into EÔ¨Äective Property Rights
       As an alternative to resources being initially in a common pool, assume now that each
agent has an initial nonoverlapping claim to E units of resources.14 Agents convert initial
claims into eÔ¨Äective property rights by using time and eÔ¨Äort both to challenge the initial
claims of other agents and to defend initial claims from challenges by other agents.
       Again each agent is endowed with one unit of inalienable time and eÔ¨Äort. The economic
problem in this model is that the defending of initial claims, the challenging of initial claims,
and the production of consumables are alternative uses of time and eÔ¨Äort. Each agent must
choose how to allocate its endowment of time and eÔ¨Äort among these activities.
       For simplicity, assume that there are only two agents, agent 1 and agent 2. To model the
challenging and defending of initial claims, let i, j = 1, 2, and let pi denote the fraction of
its initial claim that agent i successfully defends. Agent j, j 6= i, successfully challenges
the fraction 1 ‚àí pi of the initial claim of agent i.15
  13
       If the marginal product of time and eÔ¨Äort allocated to production were constant, rather than positively
related to the amount of resources as in equation (2), then agents would allocate more time and eÔ¨Äort to the
appropriative competition the larger the amount of resources in the common pool. In contrast, in Grossman
and Mendoza (2000) agents allocate more time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative competition the smaller the
amount of resources in the common pool. This result follows from the assumption that, if resources are scarce,
then consumption and, hence, appropriated resources have a large eÔ¨Äect on the probability of survival.
  14
       A more complete analysis would allow for diÔ¨Äerences among individuals in their initial claims. The
present analysis shows that interpersonal diÔ¨Äerences are not essential for rationalizing appropriative con√üict.
  15
       Generalizing the analysis to allow for many agents is not trivial because the appropriate speci√ûcation


                                                       8
       In this model pi measures the security of initial claims. If pi equals one, then initial
claims are perfectly secure. If pi is smaller than one, then initial claims are less than
perfectly secure.
       Using this notation, agent i creates an eÔ¨Äective property right to ei units of resources,
where

(5)                                 ei = pi E + (1 ‚àí pj ) E,          j 6= i.

Equation (5) says that ei equals the amount of its own initial claim that agent i successfully
defends plus the amount of the initial claim of agent j that agent i successfully challenges.16
       To determine the security of initial claims, assume that
                                    Ô£±
                                    Ô£¥

                                    Ô£≤               for gj > 0,        0<Œ∏<1
(6)                          pi =       1 + Œ∏gj /hi

                                    Ô£¥
                                    Ô£≥       1       for gj = 0,

where gj denotes the fraction of its time and eÔ¨Äort that agent j, j 6= i, allocates to
challenging the initial claim of agent i, and hi denotes the fraction of its time and eÔ¨Äort
that agent i allocates to defending its own initial claim. Equation (6) says that, if gj is
positive, then pi is smaller the larger is gj relative to hi .
       The parameter Œ∏ in equation (6) measures the eÔ¨Äectiveness of time and eÔ¨Äort allocated
to challenging initial claims relative to time and eÔ¨Äort allocated to defending initial claims.
This parameter quanti√ûes the environment for the challenging and defending of initial claims.
This environment can encompass technology as well as social arrangements that facilitate
depends on the nature of the matching process involved in agents‚Äô challenging the initial claims of other
agents. One possibility would have every agent challenging the initial claim of every other agent and defending
its initial claim from a challenge by every other agent. A more ambitious possibility would be introduce a
√ûxed cost of challenging the initial claim of another agent. In this setup each agent would have to choose
which subset of initial claims to challenge.
  16
       In Grossman and Kim (1995) we saw how the analysis could easily incorporate possible destruction of
resources as the result of the challenging and defending of claims.


                                                      9
either the challenging and or the defending of initial claims. The restriction that Œ∏ is smaller
than one insures that agent i could not increase the equilibrium value of ei by giving his
initial claim to agent j and then challenging that claim.
   Like equation (1), which described the creation of property rights from a common pool of
resources, equation (6) is a black box. It does not specify the processes by which claims are
challenged and defended. For example, the outcome modelled by equation (6) could involve
either a division under the threat of force or a violent struggle.
   Nevertheless, equations (5) and (6) exhibit the following important properties, which are
analogous to the properties of equation (1).
‚Ä¢ If both hj and gj equal zero, and if gi is positive, then ei equals 2E. This property
says that, if agent j were allocating no time and eÔ¨Äort either to defending its own initial
claim or to challenging the initial claim of agent i, then, by allocating a small amount of
time and eÔ¨Äort to challenging the initial claim of agent j, agent i would create an eÔ¨Äective
property right to the initial claims of both agents.
‚Ä¢ If gj is positive, then ei is positive if and only if either hi is positive or gi is
positive. This property says that, with agent j allocating time and eÔ¨Äort to challenging the
initial claim of agent i, agent i creates an eÔ¨Äective property right to a positive amount of
resources if and only if it allocates time and eÔ¨Äort either to defending its own initial claim
or to challenging the initial claim of agent j.
‚Ä¢ If hj and gj are positive, then the partial derivatives, ‚àÇei /‚àÇhi and ‚àÇei /‚àÇgi , are
positive. This property says that, with agent j allocating time and eÔ¨Äort both to defending
its own initial claim and to challenging the initial claim of agent i, the amount of resources
to which agent i creates an eÔ¨Äective property right is an increasing function both of the
amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that it allocates to defending its own initial claim and of the
amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that it allocates to challenging the initial claim of agent j.
   Assume again that agent i0 s consumption, ci , depends on ei and on the amount of



                                                  10
time and eÔ¨Äort that agent i allocates to production, `i , according to the Cobb-Douglas
technology speci√ûed in equation (2). Agent i chooses hi , gi , and `i to maximize its
consumption subject to hi + gi + `i = 1. Assume that in making these choices, agent i takes
agent j 0 s choices of gj and hj as given. Thus, the √ûrst-order conditions for the solution
to agent i0 s choice problem are

                                    ‚àÇgi   ‚àÇei ‚àÇgi ‚àÇ`i

      Equation (7) says that agent i chooses hi such that the marginal bene√ût of hi in
increasing the amount of its own initial claim that it successfully defends equals the marginal
cost of hi in decreasing the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that it allocates to production.
Equation (8) says that agent i chooses gi            such that the marginal bene√ût of gi    in
increasing the amount of the initial claim of agent j that agent i successfully challenges
equals the marginal cost of gi in decreasing the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that it allocates
to production.
      Equations (7) and (8) imply a unique, symmetrical equilibrium in which hi equals hj ,
and in which gi equals gj . Using these equalities and equations (2), (5), and (6) to solve
equations (7) and (8), we obtain for the equilibrium allocation of time of eÔ¨Äort,

                                           Œ±      Œ∏
(9)                          hi = gi =                  `i   for all i.
                                         1 ‚àí Œ± (1 + Œ∏)2

See the Appendix for the derivation of equation (9).
      Equation (9) has the following implications for the allocation of time and eÔ¨Äort:
‚Ä¢ Over the range 0 < Œ∏ < 1, the equilibrium values of hi and gi are larger the larger
is Œ∏. In other words, the agents allocate more time and eÔ¨Äort to challenging and defending
initial claims as time and eÔ¨Äort become equally eÔ¨Äective at challenging and defending initial

                                                11
claims.
‚Ä¢ The amount of time and eÔ¨Äort that each agent allocates to defending and challenging
initial claims is larger the larger is Œ±, the relative importance of resources for producing
consumables.
‚Ä¢ The allocation of time and eÔ¨Äort does not depend on E, the amount of resources to
which each agent has an initial claim.
These results about Œ± and E are analogous to results obtained in the preceding analysis
of appropriation from a common pool.
   Because gj is positive, we see from equation (6) that pi , the fraction of its initial
claim that agent i successfully defends, is smaller than one. In this model initial claims
to resources are less than perfectly secure. In addition, because hi equals gj , pi equals
1/(1 + Œ∏). In equilibrium the security of initial claims depends only on Œ∏, the eÔ¨Äectiveness
of time and eÔ¨Äort allocated to challenging initial claims relative to time and eÔ¨Äort allocated
to defending initial claims.

3. Secure Initial Claims
   Although the preceding analysis implies that initial claims to resources are less than
perfectly secure, casual observation suggests examples in which agents apparently do not
challenge the initial claims of other agents and in which, as a result, initial claims to resources
are perfectly secure. There are several ways to modify the model to allow the possibility of
such an equilibrium.

   1. A Fixed Cost of Challenging Initial Claims: An alternative to the speci√ûcation in
      equation (6) would be to assume that challenging the initial claim of the other agent
      involves a √ûxed cost. Formally, we can introduce such a √ûxed cost, denoted by Œ∫, by
      replacing gj in equation (6) with gj ‚àí Œ∫. If Œ∫ were suÔ¨Éciently large relative to E,
      then the dominant strategy of agent j, taking the allocation decisions of agent i as
      given, would be to set gj equal to zero. (Analogously, if defending an initial claim

                                                12
         involved a suÔ¨Éciently large √ûxed cost, then agents would surrender their initial claims
         without trying to defend them.) The main problem with appealing to a √ûxed cost to
         explain why initial claims sometimes are perfectly secure is that it is hard to imagine
         why this √ûxed cost is suÔ¨Éciently large in some cases but not in other cases.

   2. A Social Norm: Another alternative would be to assume that a social norm reinforces
         the ability of agents to defend their initial claims. Formally, we can introduce such a
         social norm, denoted by œÅ, by replacing hi in equation (6) with hi + œÅ. The analysis
         in Kai Konrad and Skaperdas (1998) shows that, if œÅ were suÔ¨Éciently large relative to
         E, then the dominant strategy of agent j, taking the allocation decisions of agent i as
         given, would be to set gj equal to zero. The main problem with appealing to a social
         norm to explain why initial claims sometimes are perfectly secure is that it is diÔ¨Écult,
         if not impossible, to observe social norms independently of their consequences.

   3. Repeated Interactions: The preceding analysis ignored the possibility that agents in-
         teract repeatedly. If the agents interact repeatedly, and if, among other things, agents
         are suÔ¨Éciently foresighted, then each agent might be able to make a credible commit-
         ment not to challenge the initial claim of the other agent. For a recent example of
         a model of credible commitments, see Abhinay Muthoo (2000).17 The main problem
         with appealing to credible commitments to explain why initial claims sometimes are
         perfectly secure is that examples in which initial claims are perfectly secure do not
         seem to be limited to cases in which agents interact repeatedly.

   4. Deterrence: In the preceding analysis agent i took agent j 0 s choice of gj as given.
         An alternative is to assume that agent i chooses hi before agent j chooses gj and
         that agent i0 s choice of hi is irreversible. Given these assumptions, agent i would
  17
       This approach to modeling secure initial claims is related to the literature noted above on amicable
sharing of resources in a common pool.



                                                     13
     take into account the eÔ¨Äect of hi on agent j 0 s choice of gj . For an example of
     such a model, see Grossman and Kim (1995). In this model, if the parameter Œ∏ is
     suÔ¨Éciently small, then each agent allocates enough resources to defending its initial
     claim to deter challenges to its initial claim. This model suggests that diÔ¨Äerences in Œ∏,
     which re√üect diÔ¨Äerences in the environment for challenging and defending initial claims,
     account for why initial claims are perfectly secure in some cases but not in others. The
     main attraction of this explanation, which admittedly is my personal favorite, is that
     environmental determinants of Œ∏ are potentially observable.


4. Summary
   This paper has developed two general-equilibrium models of resource allocation and in-
come distribution that allow for the allocation of time and eÔ¨Äort to the creation of eÔ¨Äective
property rights to valuable resources. In one model the valuable resources were initially
in a common pool. In the other model agents initially had nonoverlapping claims to the
valuable resources. For both models the analysis revealed how the amount of time and eÔ¨Äort
that agents allocate to the creation of eÔ¨Äective property rights, rather than to production,
depends on the environment for creating property rights, on the technology of production,
and on the scale of the economy. The paper also analysed the security of initial claims to
valuable resources and speculated about why initial claims sometimes are perfectly secure.

                                      Derivation of Equilibria
1. Derivation of Equation (4)
Equations (1) and (2) imply that we can expand equation (3) to

From equation (A1) we can easily show that the second order condition for a maximum,
d2 ci /dri2 < 0, is satis√ûed.
With each agent allocating the same amount of time and eÔ¨Äort to the appropriative com-
petition, equation (1) implies that ei equals E for all i. Furthermore, with rj , for all
                        P
j 6= i, equal to ri ,     j6=i rj   equals nri . Substituting these equalities into equation (A1),
equation (3) becomes
                                                                 ¬µ                        ¬∂

Solving equation (A2) we obtain equation (4). The expression for dci /dri in equation (A2)
implies that an equilibrium with ri equal to zero, and dci /dri ‚â§ 0, is not possible.

2. Derivation of Equation (9)
Equations (2), (5), and (6) imply that we can expand equations (7) and (8) to

and

Again we can easily show that the second order condition for a maximum is satis√ûed.
Given that hi equals hj and that gi equals gj , equations (5) and (6) imply that ei and

                                   i                ‚àí     = 0.
                        ‚àÇgi            (hi + Œ∏gi )2    `i

Solving equations (A5) and (A6) we obtain equation (9).
