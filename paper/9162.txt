                                           ABSTRACT

   This paper develops a model in which upstream network “insiders” conduct relationship specific
investment that induces the downstream firm to transact within networks. The scale of destination-
country production and part-specific measures of the importance of network relationships and
engineering costs are used to explain the pattern of U.S. auto parts exports. Our results support the
prediction that large scale promotes relationship-specific investment and reduces imports. Also, while
Japan is a large parts importer, the composition of its imports is shifted away from parts where
vertical keiretsu are prominent. Nations hosting U.S.-owned automakers import more U.S. parts.

1 Introduction

Despite decades of tariff reductions and infrequent use of contingent protection, many ob-

servers continue to regard the Japanese market as “closed” to foreigners. In support of this

claim, they point to persistent trade surpluses and a relatively low import to GDP ratio (7%

in 1999). Since formal trade barriers seem too small to explain the alleged lack of market ac-

cess, commentators point instead to special business practices. As noted by the World Trade

Organization’s 1998 Trade Policy Review, “Concern remains about the effects on foreign access

to Japan of horizontally and vertically integrated groups (kigyo-shudan and keiretsu).”

   Keiretsu are well-known and controversial but not the only business networks with the

potential to influence international trade. Rauch’s (2001) recent survey discusses the trade-

creating activities of networks comprising members of ethnic groups and affiliates of multi-

national corporations. Rauch describes how such networks promote trade by disseminating

information on market opportunities and the trustworthiness of potential trade partners.

An additional role seems relevant for vertical networks: the facilitation of investment by

upstream firms that generates benefits for downstream firms.

   This paper investigates the role of business networks in trade by examining the pat-

tern of U.S. auto parts exports to 26 countries from 1989 to 1994. We develop the model

of Spencer and Qiu (2001) that identifies vertical networks as arising from the decision of

suppliers to conduct relationship-specific investment. The theory contains implications for

trade by identifying the parts likely to be produced within the network and those likely to

be procured at arms-length from “outsiders.” We find evidence consistent with the model’s

proposition that a lager scale of local production reduces imports by encouraging local insid-

ers to conduct relationship-specific investment. Our results indicate that Japan’s imports of


                                              1
a part tend to be lower for parts where vertical keiretsu are prominent. On average, though,

Japan imports more parts from the U.S. than one would expect from its observed economic

characteristics. We also find higher imports by countries with a larger amount of production

by U.S. automobile affiliates—especially for parts with high engineering costs.

   Our study contributes to the debate on whether Japan’s imports are “too low” and whether

vertical keiretsu are exclusionary. Lawrence (1993) cites studies showing that Japanese manu-

facturing imports are lower than the levels predicted by trade models. Moreover, Lawrence

(1991) finds that import penetration decreases in Japan with increases in the share of both

horizontal and vertical keiretsu sales across industries. Fung (1991) reports a negative rela-

tionship between U.S. exports to Japan and the combined share of horizontal and vertical

keiretsu sales. Saxonhouse (1993) identifies problems in the papers supporting the Lawrence

position and presents his own evidence showing that Japan’s distinctive trade structure can

be explained by its pattern of factor endowments.

   Saxonhouse also points out that any import-reducing effects of keiretsu may to be due to

efficiency rather than collusion. The Spencer and Qiu (2001) model provides a theoretical

basis for networks as a vehicle for increasing efficiency. They argue that U.S. firms find

it difficult to sell intermediate goods in Japan because keiretsu suppliers make efficiency-

enhancing investments in parts that strongly benefit from relationship-specific investment.

   Miwa and Ramseyer (2000) review the theoretical and empirical work on the economic

role of relationship-specific investment and keiretsu in the automobile industry. Counter-

ing views to the contrary expressed by Asanuma (1989) and Aoki (1988), they argue that

relationship-specific investment and extra-contractual governance mechanisms do not ap-

pear to play important interrelated roles in Japan’s automobile industry. Further argu-



                                              2
ments downplaying the role of relationship-specific investment are provided by Casadesus-

Masanell and Spulber (2000) who find that General Motor’s acquisition of Fisher Body was

not an effort to avoid opportunism in the presence of asset specific investment. However,

other research provides empirical evidence showing that U.S. automakers tend to internalize

the production of parts for which relationship-specific investment is important. Monteverde

and Teece (1982), the source of some of the data used in this study, find that the likelihood

that General Motors and Ford produce a part in-house is positively associated with the engi-

neering costs of part development and a measure of model-specificity. Klier (1994) and Mas-

ten, Meehan, and Snyder (1989) also conclude that concerns about opportunism influence

the vertical integration decisions of U.S. automakers. We extend this literature by testing the

implications of our model linking the decision to conduct relationship-specific investment

to international trade.

   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 models how ex-post bargaining with an as-

sembler affects the incentive of a parts supplier to make relationship-specific investments.

It predicts that network firms will only produce parts for which the marginal product of

relationship-specific investment exceeds a critical level with “outsiders” supplying the re-

maining parts. Section 3 describes our data set on U.S. exports of 53 different vehicle parts

to 26 importing countries over the period 1989 to 1994. We present and interpret the econo-

metric results in section 4. Finally, section 5 summarizes the implications of these results for

our understanding business networks.




                                               3
2 A Model of Vertical Networks

The model is an adaptation of Spencer and Qiu (2001).1 An automaker chooses between

purchasing parts from a member of its “network” or from independent firms. We will refer

to the former as “insiders” and the latter as “outsiders.”

       Insider suppliers have an advantage because, based on long-term relationships, they can

make relationship-specific investments, referred to as RSI, so as to reduce the cost of as-

sembly for the maker. This cost reduction applies only to the maker for which the part is

designed and not for other makers. Membership of the network is necessary for these in-

vestments because of the need for a very high level of information concerning not only the

design of the part itself, but also with the way the part can be modified to better fit with

other connecting parts in the assembly process.2 In addition to insiders, there are a large

number of potential outsider suppliers that can not undertake RSI for the maker and hence

are able to supply “generic” parts at competitive prices based on their cost of production

plus transport costs. Despite the advantage of RSI conducted by insiders, the maker may

nevertheless select outsiders because of their potentially lower cost of production.

       For simplicity, we present the analysis for a representative maker with an exogenously

set output of cars, denoted . This will allow us to focus on the cost minimization prob-

lem associated with sourcing components without fully specifying the downstream product

market.3

       A large number,  , of parts is required to produce an auto, with parts and labour com-

Japanese market.

     Branstetter (2000) finds strong empirical evidence for the importance of the flow of technological informa-
tion within vertical keiretsu in enhancing efficiency.

     Spencer and Qiu’s (2001) specification of the product market for cars as a Cournot duopoly with segmented
markets reveals that the main insights of the model are robust to relaxing the single assembler assumption.

bined in fixed proportion in final assembly. Each assembled auto requires  units of part .

For each part , there is a single insider supplier also referred to with subscript  that poten-

tially makes a relationship-specific investment, denoted  . This investment creates a rent

for the maker in the form of a reduction in the assembly cost for each auto produced using

the part from supplier . Different parts have different potential for RSI. Letting             

denote a measure of the efficacy of RSI for part , we assume that the relationship between

the rent, denoted  , created per part used and the level of  is given by



                                                  
                                                                                                 (1)



This functional form implies that higher levels of RSI create more rent for the maker, but at

a decreasing rate.

   We exploit the fact that  is large by ordering the parts on a continuum              , with
the parts varying from low to high values of RSI efficacy,  . We assume that  is strictly

increasing in  and hence   ¼
                                         for all        .   The magnitude of  —but not the

ranking of parts—may vary internationally so as to capture country-specific differences in

the efficacy of RSI. For example, if the nature of institutions and culture in Japan would

better facilitate the kind of information transfer that enhances RSI, then  would be larger

there.

   Let       represent the constant unit cost of production of part  for insiders. Outsiders

supply a homogeneous version of the part in a competitive spot market at price             £
                                                                                               . Both

and   £
          include all relevant transport costs to the maker’s facility (as well as tariffs if the part




                                                      5
is imported). We define Æ as the cost advantage of sourcing from an outsider:



                                                Æ               £
                                                                     



Note that this cost advantage does not include the rent generated by RSI. We assume for

simplicity that Æ is constant across parts.4

        Although parts can be produced more cheaply by outsiders, the maker can gain from

the local purchase of part  from an insider supplier due to the effect of RSI in reducing

assembly costs. Supposing that part  is purchased at a price,                       , the rent,  , created

by RSI reduces the maker’s net cost to                . Consequently, it is possible that                    £
                                                                                                                     ,

reflecting an overall cost advantage to the maker from the use of insider-made parts. Since

       represents the demand for each part ( units of each part are required per auto), the

resulting profit for insider supplier  is given by:



                                                                                                         (2)



An important aspect of RSI is that the supplier cannot be guaranteed a return based on a

contract that is conditional on the amount,  , of investment. This is due to the difficulty of

actually observing  , which would include non-observable costs (or at least non-verifiable

by courts), such as the costs of obtaining the information and coordination with other sup-

pliers. Consequently, we assume that the investment,  , is sunk prior to bargaining between

each supplier and the maker as to the price,                 . The resulting price,   , can be based on  ,

but not on  .

    4
   Spencer and Qiu (2001) show that the theory can accommodate Æ ¼ ´ µ ¼ and small values of Æ ¼ ´     µ  ¼.   The
empirical specification could also accommodate Æ that varies across parts in the part fixed effects.


                                                         6
    The order of moves is as follows: At stage 1, each supplier  commits to its investment

    , and simultaneously the maker specifies its output,           . Since each firm sets its choice

variable to maximize own profit taking the other choice variables as given, this gives rise

to a Nash equilibrium in  and . In making these decisions, the maker and its suppliers

correctly anticipate the outcome of the stage 2 bargaining process determining the prices, ,

for parts. We assume the maker will at least break even, but suppliers have to consider the

possibility that, if the agreed upon price is too low, RSI at stage 1 could result in a loss. At

stage 2, the maker engages in Nash bargaining over the price,                 , simultaneously with each

remaining supplier. If an agreement is reached with the supplier of part , the maker orders

the    parts needed to produce output . Otherwise, the maker buys the same quantity of

part  from an outsider firm.

    The maker’s marginal cost due to part  is given by                     if it reaches an agreement

in its bargaining with supplier . It has a ‘threat point’ of buying the part from outsiders

at a price of   £
                    if bargaining breaks down. Thus, the maker’s net payoff from reaching

agreement is given by     £
                                      , i.e. the difference between the price of outsiders and

the net cost of parts procured from insiders multiplied by the quantity of parts produced.

Correspondingly, since investment,  , is sunk by stage 2, supplier ’s surplus from reaching

an agreement is its variable profit,              . The combined surplus from agreement is



                               £
                                                         Æ     



Letting    represent the bargaining power of the maker, the Nash bargaining solution
awards a share    of the combined surplus from agreement to the supplier. Taking into




                                                      7
account the cost of RSI, post-agreement supplier profit is



                                               Æ                                    (3)



If    Æ      , bargaining breaks down, the maker sources part  from outsiders, and the
insider’s profit would be           . Note from (3) that suppliers must have at least some
bargaining power, i.e.        , if they are to obtain a profit in stage 2.    And, since suppliers

would not do RSI without an expected profit, it is actually beneficial to the maker to have

less than complete bargaining power.

     At stage 1, supplier  determines the optimal value of  in the event that it would pro-

duce the part by maximizing        as in (3), taking    as given. Choosing  to maximize profit

using (1) leads to

                                   and                                     (4)


Even if        from (4), it is possible that revenue would not be sufficient to cover       and

hence would lead to a loss. In that case supplier  would set               and not produce the
part. Since parts are ordered on the basis of increasing efficacy of RSI (i.e. since     for
                                                                                         ¼




      ), it follows from (4) that  and  are strictly increasing in  for    We obtain
the closed form for local suppler profits by substituting the solutions for  and  from (4)

into equation (3), yielding



                                               Æ                              (5)




                                                 8
From this equation it is apparent that the greater is , the greater are potential insider profits:

Define part                 as the critical part for which                  . Parts are produced by insiders with
RSI for              and by outsiders for         . Expressing this idea in terms of  , it follows that

local production takes place if and only if                     . Solving for the level of  that sets

                                                                  9
thetical reduction in assembler costs if the supplier chose  according to equation (4). The

possible profit (or loss) of supplier  if it chooses to produce is shown by the solid line, de-

noted . For      Æ, profit is given by equation (3) which is increasing in . For          Æ , the

supplier anticipates that bargaining will break down and it will suffer a loss equal to the

amount of RSI ( ). Since the lines denoting  and Æ (the horizontal dashed line) cross at

   , the maker would prefer insiders for all parts        . However, supplier ’s share of
the return for parts        is not sufficient to cover the cost of RSI, with the outcome that
these parts are sourced from outsiders. Profit is zero (the     line cuts the X-axis) at part    ,

which is the lowest value of RSI importance at which insiders can expect to break even. Each

supplier  will commit to its RSI and choose to produce for        , but will set       and be
inactive for    .

    The implications of this model for trade depend on the locations of insiders and out-

siders. The basic hypothesis used to develop the empirical specification is that insiders

include local parts suppliers producing in the same country as the automaker. In particular,

members of vertical keiretsu in Japan are viewed as insiders with respect to the production

of auto parts for makers in Japan, but there may also be local vertical networks in other

countries. This insider categorization is based on the logic that the information needed to

design a part for a particular car model requires geographic proximity between upstream

and downstream firms. However, we also consider the possibility that the coordination re-

quired for RSI can occur over longer distances if mediated by a multinational enterprise.

Thus a supplier in the U.S. might be an insider when it transacts with a U.S. multinational

firm operating a foreign market. Taking into account these two possibilities, the U.S. parts

producers that export to non-U.S. car makers located abroad would be outsiders in these



                                                 10
transactions. The empirical section will provide a test of the validity of these views of the

boundaries of networks.

      Since, as currently specified, the model predicts either zero sourcing of part  from out-

siders or exactly          units, for the empirical specification, we adapt the model to reflect the

greater continuity in export levels that we observe in the trade data. This involves relaxing

our assumption of a representative maker so as to introduce heterogeneity across makers

within each country as to whether to use a local insider or an outsider as a source for each

part. Thus due to differences in characteristics, one maker might be using local insiders

for a given part , while another uses outsiders for the same part. Consequently each part

will have a probability of being sourced from a local insider, leading to non-zero import

probabilities for all parts.

      We introduce this heterogeneity by assuming that the cost advantage for outsiders, Æ

       £
            , varies randomly across the makers in each country. Since , the costs of insiders, and

 £
     , the delivered price charged by outsiders, are both likely to vary across countries, we add

 subscripts to identify the location of production. To determine the effect of variation in

Æ on the value of parts imported by country  , we first derive the probability, denoted                      ,

that a maker in country  sources part  from a local insider. From our model,                     equals the

probability that Æ is small enough to set                 . Using the expression for      shown in (5)

we obtain

where           and   now have  subscripts to reflect cross-country variation in output per maker

and the efficacy of RSI.

      The next step is to assume that Æ is drawn from the Pareto distribution with scale pa-

the Pareto distribution allows us to express the probability of selecting a local insider in the

following multiplicative form:

As can be seen from (9), the probability of using a local insider is a continuous function of

the parameters, .

     Since our data involves the value of U.S. exports of auto parts, we let                                                     represent the

probability that a maker in country  imports part  from the United States conditional on

not purchasing the part from a local insider. The overall probability that country  imports

part  from the United States is then given by (1 -                                       )          . Thus, evaluating U.S. exports at

                                                                 fob
their free-on-board (fob) prices, denoted                              , and letting  represent total car production in

country  , the expected value of U.S. exports of part  to country  is

3 Data

Grouping the data into four categories—exports, car production, measures of the efficacy

of relationship-specific investment and finally, concordance and description of parts,—we

document the sources and measurement of the variables used in this study.



3.1 Export Data

We downloaded highly disaggregated U.S. export data from the Center for International

Data maintained by Robert Feenstra at the University of California Davis. These data mea-

sure the fob value of parts exports, cover the 1989 to 1994 period, and are classified according

to the Harmonized System (HS). We searched the HS descriptions to locate every ten-digit

HS commodity category that involves automobile parts to obtain as complete a sample of ex-

ports as possible. Whenever possible, we confined the sample to parts specifically intended

for passenger cars. In some cases even the most disaggregated HS codes do not distinguish

between types of motor vehicles. A complete list of the HS codes that comprise our sample


                                                         13
and their descriptions is available from the authors.



3.2 Car Production

Letting  denote the number of makers in country j, our model requires passenger car

production,  , and output per maker,         , by country. We estimate 
                                                                                  based on a

measure of the number of equal-sized makers as generated by the inverse of a Herfindahl

index for each country. The Herfindahl index for country j, denoted  , is derived from

output data for each maker in country  . Since we consider the possibility that U.S. parts

exporters may be insiders in business relations with the foreign affiliates of U.S. makers, we

also require the share of passenger car production by country accounted for by subsidiaries

of the big three U.S.-based makers at that time (General Motors, Ford and Chrysler). We refer

to this measure as BIG 3. The Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association of the United States

provides annual car production data for 26 countries. We restrict our sample to that set of

export markets. The same publication also provides the annual number of cars produced by

each maker in each country, including production by the overseas subsidiaries of General

Motors, Ford and Chrysler.

   Table 1 lists the 26 countries with passenger car production together with an isocode

used to identify each country. Column (1) shows the average number of individual parts

imported by each of these countries across the six years of our sample. This average has an

upper bound of the number of parts, which is 53. In the data, the average ranges from 7.8

to 52.5 with more than half of the countries importing on average at least 40 different parts

each year. Column (2) lists each country’s share of U.S. exports (to the 26 countries) and

column (3) then provides each country’s share of world car production outside the United

   The relationship between each country’s share of car parts exports from the U.S. and its

share of non-U.S. car production (from columns (2) and (3) respectively of Table 1) is shown

in Figure 2. If each country imported U.S. parts in the same fixed proportion to output then

the points would line up on the 45-degree line. We code each country into three categories of

BIG 3,   namely “No Big 3 Production”, “Minority Big 3” (less that 50% of output produced by

Ford, GM, and Chrysler affiliates) and “Majority Big 3.” Canada and Mexico are well above

the 45-degree line, and therefore have import shares much greater than production shares.

On the other hand, the former communist nations, the C.I.S. (ru), Czech Republic (cz), China


                                                                                  16

3.3 Determinants of the efficacy of RSI

Our formal theory does not specify the criteria determining which parts have high efficacy

of RSI. One hypothesis is that vertical networks form to produce parts that have certain

technical characteristics associated with a greater need for RSI. This group would include

parts, such as engines, which involve costly investments in engineering and design that

are relevant mainly to a particular automaker. We implement this idea by using a rating

of the cost of engineering per part developed by Monteverde and Teece (1982) on the ba-

sis of information provided by a design engineer. This engineering cost rating, which we

refer to as   ECR,   rates the engineering cost of developing a given part for a new car model

on a 1 to 10 scale with 10 corresponding to the highest level. To the extent that these engi-

neering costs are specific to a maker, they would represent relationship-specific investments

and hence     ECR    can serve as a proxy for the efficacy of RSI. There are no doubt other pos-

sible technical characteristics that enhance the potential for RSI for a particular part. For

example, relationship-specific investments could be important for achieving “just-in-time”

delivery, with the nature and extent of these investments varying over parts due to differing

requirements for packaging and transport. Since the Japanese auto producers were pioneers

in developing just-in time delivery, this type of RSI could be relatively more important for

Japan. We do not consider this possibility due to lack of data. Spencer and Qiu (2001) pro-

pose a further possibility (also not considered) that a higher efficacy of RSI is associated with

parts that are more important part in the sense that they represent a greater share of the cost


                                                 17
of an auto.

   A second hypothesis of particular relevance for our analysis of keiretsu in Japan is that

a greater strength of network involvement in the production of a part may itself raise the

efficacy of RSI for that part. Two features of vertical networks could be significant here.

First, as detailed in our model, the formation of a vertical network ameliorates the hold-up

problem and hence raises the incentives for suppliers to engage in RSI. Secondly, the effect

of vertical networks in increasing the flow of information between suppliers could suggest

new possibilities for relationship-specific investments and generally improve the efficiency

with which these investments are made. For any particular part, we hypothesize that the

strength of these effects will vary with the strength of network involvement as measured by

the degree to which producers of that part participate in the network. Taking this approach,

we can include the possibility that the group of parts produced with RSI in a vertical net-

work may be determined by historical or cultural factors in a particular country, not just the

technical characteristics of parts. Thus, under this hypothesis, a vertical network such as

keiretsu, could potentially raise the efficacy of RSI for the parts they produce in Japan, but

these parts need not be the same as the parts produced by other vertical networks, such as in

the United States. Of course, there is also an alternative possibility, which we cannot address

with our data, namely that the vertical network is based on cronyism and does not generate

RSI. In this case, the preferential sourcing of parts from insiders would reduce rather than

raise the efficiency of production.

   We develop three measures for the strength of network participation by part. Two of

these measures,   INH - U   and INH - J, measure the extent to which a part is produced in house

in the U.S. and Japan respectively and the third, KEI measures keiretsu involvement by part in



                                                 18
Japan. Monteverde and Teece (1982) provide estimates of the share of in-house sourcing for

each part by General Motors and Ford.            INH - U   is then a single measure (by part) of in-house

production shares in the U.S., generated by taking a weighted average of the Monteverde

and Teece (1982) measures in which GM has two-thirds weight so as to roughly reflect its

production volume.

   Our measures,     INH - J   and   KEI,   are derived using data from The Structure of the Japanese

Auto Parts Industry, 1990, by Dodwell Marketing Consultants. This book lists the major

Japanese suppliers of individual auto parts for each automobile manufacturer in Japan.

It identifies whether the part is produced “in-house” and provides information as to the

“grouping” of each supplier. A supplier is considered to be in a particular maker’s group

based on the equity holdings of the maker, supplier reliance on the maker for 50% of its

sales, or other factors such as historical relationships or personnel ties. Following standard

terminology in the literature cited in the introduction, we refer to Dodwell’s “groupings” as

vertical keiretsu.

   Defining a “link” as a unique pairing of a maker and a major supplier, we count the

respective numbers of links involving in-house production and keiretsu for a given maker

and part. Dividing by the total links for each maker, we then obtain the share of in-house

links and keiretsu links per maker. Finally, to generate INH - J and KEI as single measures per

part, we calculate the weighted average across makers of the shares of in-house links and

keiretsu respectively using car production in 1996 as the weight. Since the links that form the

basis of our measures involve only suppliers located in Japan, our measures do not depend

directly on the level of imports of each part.

   Using the example of mufflers, which has a large keiretsu presence, Table 2 illustrates the

derivation of our   INH - J   and KEI variables. The table sets out the main suppliers of mufflers

(as defined by Dodwell) for the makers (Toyota, Nissan etc) in Japan. We illustrate supply

links by in-house production with
                                        , supply by a keiretsu member, with , and supply by
an outsider with
                    .   The first section lists the makers to show production in-house. For

the case of mufflers, Suzuki is the only maker to produce in-house. Since for Suzuki, there

are two other suppliers (Futaba and Sankei GK), its ratio of in-house links to total links is

1/3. Weighting by the fraction of output (8%) produced by Suzuki,          INH - J   (not shown) for

mufflers is 2.67%. The next group of suppliers, Sango to Hoei, represent firms that are part

of one of the makers’ keiretsu. However, it is interesting to note that some of these suppliers

also produce for makers outside their own keiretsu. Thus Futaba is part of the Toyota keiretsu,

but also produces for Honda, Mitsubishi and Suzuki. The final two suppliers, Comex and



                                                  20
Miyoshi, are outsiders that supply only Mazda. As can be seen from the table, there are only

two suppliers for Toyota (Sango and Futaba) and since they are both member of the Toyota

keiretsu, the number of keiretsu links relative to total links is 2/2 = 1. Weighting this fraction

by the share of output across the makers listed in the table (covering 92% of auto output),

we obtain KEI = 68.67/0.92 = 74.6%.5

      We employ four proxies for the efficacy of relationship-specific investment. None of

these measures vary across time. Table 3 defines the variables and displays their correla-

tions. Monteverde and Teece (1982) establish that the technical measure,              ECR,   is positively

related to GM and Ford’s decision to produce in house.6 We also observe this positive as-

sociation in our correlations: the weighted sum of the Ford and GM in-house production

share, INH - U, has a significant and positive correlation with ECR. Interestingly, Japanese in-

house production as measured by         INH - J   has even stronger positive relationship with       ECR.


These correlations indicate that parts with high engineering cost ratings tend to be produced

in-house. In contrast, the table shows that our other measure of the strength of network par-

ticipation, KEI, has virtually no correlation with ECR and a negative, but insignificant, corre-

lation with INH - J and INH - U. If all four proxies are driven by the same underlying reason for

RSI, then they should all be positively correlated. Leaving aside problems of measurement,

this suggests that parts produced with high keiretsu involvement are not associated with

high costs of engineering. Keiretsu-produced parts may be associated with some other tech-

nical characteristics, such as those involved with just-in-time delivery, but it is also possible

that they mainly reflect the outcome of historical and cultural factors in Japan.

    Accounting for links with the makers (Daihatsu, Fuji, Hino and Isuzu) not shown in the table, we obtain
KEI= 72.4% for mufflers. For concordance with the trade data, we combine mufflers with exhaust pipes. Since
KEI= 73.4% for exhaust pipes, we obtain KEI = 72.9% for the combined category.

3.4 Concordance and Description of Parts

The different sources have unique ways of categorizing parts. The export data is identified

according to the Harmonized System (HS), whereas the data from Dodwell (1990) and Mon-

teverde and Teece (1982) reflect the categorization of the authors. We created a concordance

to combine the information from the difference sources. Based on an examination of the

data, we formed the 53 parts categories shown in Tables 4 and 5. These categories reflect

a level of aggregation equalling or exceeding the aggregation level in the various sources.

Thus, each of the part categories used in the different sources of data mapped to one of the

categories we devised. In cases where multiple part categories mapped to a single category

of ours, we summed the HS-level exports and averaged the RSI proxies.

    Tables 4 and 5 portray some characteristics of the 53 parts. Column (1) shows the av-

erage number of countries that imported the part in the six years of our data. The column

probit regression analysis.

reveals that the majority of parts were shipped to most of the 26 countries that produce au-

tomobiles. The parts are ordered by their share of the value of U.S. parts exports, as shown

in column (2). Engines top the list at 15.4%, followed by transmissions (8.1%) then body

stampings (8.0%). Column (3) displays Japan’s share of U.S. parts exports for each part.

This column reveals high Japanese imports of catalytic converters (26.2%), tires (22.7%), and

starter motors (16.1%). In contrast, Japanese purchases account for less than 1.3% of engines,

transmissions, and body stampings exports from the United States. The last three columns

contain data on the share of in-house links in Japan (INH - J), keiretsu links in Japan (KEI) and

engineering cost ratings (ECR). Due to incomplete data for our measures of engineering cost

and network participation (indicated by blanks in the table), the regressions we estimate use

at most 50 parts categories.




4 Regression Analysis

Recall that the model generated the following equation for the ratio of the value of U.S.

exports of part  to country  to total production in country  :

where      is the number of vehicles produced per maker in country  ,                             represents the

probability that country  imports part  from the United States conditional on the part not

being purchased from a local insider and F                                       fob

   A central parameter in the analysis is the efficacy of RSI,   . Letting                     NET   take on the

values given by our measures,         KEI   or   INH - J,   of network intensity in Japan, we assume that

where      JPN    equals one for Japan and zero otherwise. The first term,                        , will be absorbed

into a fixed effect for each part in our regressions. If unique Japanese institutions raise the

efficacy of RSI for all parts, then ! is positive. The interaction term, ! , is positive if a greater

strength of network involvement in the production of a part is associated with an increase

in the Japanese advantage with respect to the efficacy of RSI. We interact                           ECR   with   JPN   to

test whether the engineering cost rating is associated with a higher efficacy of RSI in Japan

as would be indicated by a positive value of ! . The combination of the signs of ! and !

could be of interest. In particular, if !   and !                 , this is consistent with a direct role for
Japanese networks independent of the technical characteristics of parts.

       We now examine the elements of                 , which is the probability that a maker in country 

would import part  from the United States conditional on not purchasing part  from a local

insider.          reflects the comparative advantage of the U.S. in each part together with the

trade costs associated with shipment to country  . In addition, car makers may find it easier

to meet U.S. safety and environmental standards if they obtain the relevant components

from U.S. based suppliers. Hence, we hypothesize that the propensity to import U.S. made

parts is increasing in the share of national car output exported to the U.S., as denoted by

X - US.7


       We also include the possibility that U.S. parts exporters are insiders in business relations

with the foreign subsidiaries of U.S. makers. Since U.S. subsidiaries would then preferen-

       We thank Jerry Hausman for this suggestion.

tially import parts from the United States, we hypothesize that                       is increasing in the share

of output made by U.S. subsidiaries in country  (represented by                       BIG 3).   A further implica-

tion of the theory is that these subsidiaries would import relatively more RSI-intensive parts.

We test this proposition by interacting      BIG 3   with   ECR   as well as      INH - U.       If insiders produce

RSI-intensive parts and if U.S. parts suppliers are insiders when trading with U.S. foreign

affiliates, then we expect these interaction terms to be positive. Taking all these factors into

account we obtain

specific term representing the trade costs of U.S. shipments to country  , and                                NET   takes

on the value INH - U .

   We use a number of variables to capture trade costs, # . Following standard practice in

gravity equations, we calculate the log of great-circle distance in miles between country  ’s

major city and the population centroid of the U.S. (Kansas City: latitude 40N, longitude

95W). We also include indicator variables for countries that are English-speaking (Australia,

Canada, and the United Kingdom), communist in 1989 (China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary,

Poland, USSR/CIS, and Yugoslavia). We also add indicators for Canada and Mexico to

capture unique aspects such as trade arrangements (the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact and

maquiladora program launched by Mexico in the same year) and adjacency to the U.S. that

may explain their large volumes of imports as shown in Table 1. Finally we include the log of

per capita GDP (1989–94 World Bank data), another standard variable in gravity equations.

proxies for the efficacy of relationship-specific investment (reflected in                                               from (13)). Based

on the ideas outlined above that the coefficients on the Japan-specific terms (! , ! , ! ) in (13)

are positive, the coefficient on             JPN   and its interaction terms should be negative. Also, local

scale,       , enters negatively. The coefficient ($ ) on X - US and the coefficients on                                       BIG 3    and its

interaction terms ($ , $ , $ ) are hypothesized to be positive. Determinants of trade costs, # ,

include distance, per capita income, dummies identifying English speaking and communist

countries and Canada and Mexico.

      We estimate the model parameters using a panel of parts exports from 1989 to 1994 and

report the results in Table 6. All regressions include year-specific intercepts and we calculate

standards errors that are robust to the possibility of correlation across time for country-part

combinations.8 We begin with a “naive” specification that omits the local scale effect,                                                           ,

that each country imports parts from the U.S. in proportion to its production. As shown

in column (1), this specification indicates that Japanese imports are “too low.” Column (2),

portraying results when we add local scale,              , and   BIG 3,   reveals that the negative Japan

effect is a consequence of failing to control for local scale effects which enter negatively and

significantly. Once we add scale, Japan tends to import more than the model predicts (sig-

nificant at the 10% level). The & improves in this specification and the estimated distance

coefficient, perversely positive in column (1), now enters insignificantly. We also find that

a country’s imports of U.S. auto parts rises with the B IG 3 share of production. Columns

(3)–(6) in Table 6 show results when we add various interaction terms involving                  BIG 3   and

JPN.


       The result (from columns (2), (3), (5) and (6)) that Japan is a large importer of U.S. auto

parts does not support the hypothesis that Japanese institutions promote insider trade at the

expense of imports (from outsiders) for all parts. Japan’s larger than expected imports may

be explained by the fact that, relative to a number of the other countries which had high

tariffs and domestic content requirements, Japan has low formal trade barriers.9 Since tariffs

and other formal trade barriers are not used as controls in the model, it seems likely that

these omitted variables might help explain Japan’s high level of imports. Another possibility

is that Japan’s imports from the U.S. were unusually high due to pressure from the U.S.

government.10

       Most of the coefficients of the trade cost variables are sensible and significant across the

specifications. Higher per capita income leads to higher parts imports. Per capita income

may capture differences in transportation infrastructure. English language contributes to

   9
      For example, starting in 1984, Australia introduced an 85% domestic content requirement for autos and
tariffs on autos ranged from 45% in 1988 to 30% in 1994. See Truett and Truett (1997).
   10
      In response to President George Bush’s trip to Japan in January 1992, Japanese automakers announced a
“voluntary” plan to double their 1990 purchases of U.S. auto parts by 1994. Actual purchases rose 30% from
1992 to 1993. See McMillan (1996).

trade, whereas communist countries import fewer parts. Once we control for local scale in

columns (2)–(6), the distance coefficient always has a positive sign but is not significantly

different from zero. In regressions without the Canada and Mexico indicator variables, the

estimated coefficient on distance is negative and significant. Exports to the U.S., X - US, are

associated with greater imports of U.S. auto parts, a result consistent with the proposition

that nations import U.S. auto parts partly in order to comply with U.S. technical regulations.

It is also the case that Canada and Mexico import significantly more than average. This

reflects a combination of geographic and trade policy factors.11

   Column (3) displays results when we add                
                                                       KEI JPN.   It enters negatively but is not sig-

nificant. These results indicate that Japan’s “greater than expected” level of imports may

not hold for parts with high levels of keiretsu participation. We add interactions using the

Monteverde and Teece measures of engineering cost ratings and U.S. in-house production

in column (4). None enter significantly. In column (5) we exclude the Monteverde and Teece

variables that limit our sample (they are only available for 40 of our parts categories) and

instead use   INH - J,   a variable we found to be strongly correlated with the engineering cost

rating. Again, no interactions terms are significantly different than zero.

   Column (6) shows results utilizing the previous specification but estimated without the

parts category “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes”. From Table 4, “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” repre-

sents only 2% of the parts exported by the United States, but 13.9% of the parts imported by

Japan. This high level of imports may reflect the importance of U.S.-made exhaust systems

in ensuring that cars destined for the United States comply with U.S. emission standards.

Any such effect would not be fully captured by X - US, since it corrects only for the “aver-

     Note that our sample pre-dates NAFTA and that Canada and U.S. had essentially integrated markets in
autos and their parts due to the 1965 Canada-U.S. Auto Pact.

age” relationship between imports of parts and exports of cars to the United States. When

“Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” is excluded, we find that keiretsu participation has a negative and

significant impact on Japanese imports. The results do not indicate, however, that imports

of keiretsu-intensive parts are significantly lower in Japan than other counties. According to

Table 4, the second highest   KEI   after “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” is for “Flywheels+Pulleys”.

Summing the coefficient on    JPN,   1.075, and the coefficient on the interaction,    , multi-
plied by its value for KEI, 0.644, yields a small negative number -0.433.

   The specification used in Table 6 has the advantage that information from 40-50 parts is

combined to obtain the estimates of the responsiveness of U.S. exports to import-country

characteristics. It imposes the restriction that the only differences in coefficients across parts

lie in the fixed effect and the interactions with JPN and BIG 3. This leads to efficient estimation

if the assumption holds. However, there are plausible reasons to believe that coefficients on

other variables might also vary across parts. For instance, as mentioned above, the import

sensitivity to X - US may vary across parts. In addition, differences in transportability should,

in all likelihood, lead to differences in distance and adjacency (Canada and Mexico) effects.

This could change our results of interest if there were, for instance, a correlation between

transportability and the proxies for the efficacy of RSI.

   We investigate the robustness of our results by using the following two-step method that

relaxes restrictions on the estimated coefficients. In the first step, instead of stacking the

parts and estimating fixed effects, we estimate one equation per part. Thus all coefficients

(not just the intercept) are allowed to vary from part to part. Since there is no variation

in the RSI proxies for a given part, the interactions involving     NET   and   ECR   are omitted in

the first step. In the second step, we regress the estimated coefficients for         JPN   and   BIG 3




                                                 32
on our network and engineering cost rating measures of the efficacy of RSI. These second-

step regressions have only one observation per part. The             JPN   and   BIG 3   coefficients have

different standard errors that we use as (inverse) weights to correct for heteroskedasticity in

the second step regressions.12

   The intercepts of the second-step regressions correspond to the coefficients on                 JPN    and

BIG 3   shown in Table 6 and the slope coefficients on NET and ECR correspond to coefficients

on the various interaction terms. To see this, note that the terms, % JPN               % NET      JPN    
         
% ECR JPN  , from (15) can be re-expressed as %  % NET         % ECR JPN . Step one estimates
                                                                                  



the term inside the parentheses. The second-step regression of these estimated coefficients

on NET and ECR recovers % , % and % as the intercept and slope estimates.

   We evaluate the part-specific regressions in step one by examining the mean across parts

of the estimated coefficients. In all cases, the mean value corresponds very closely to the

estimates shown in Table 6 although we observe variation across parts in the estimates.

Interestingly, we find evidence that the relationship between exports of “Mufflers+Exhaust

Pipes” and the explanatory variables differs dramatically from the rest of the sample. Specif-

ically, the estimates for every coefficient for this part fall outside the 95% confidence interval

surrounding the mean of the estimates of the other part categories. As previously hypothe-

sized, “Mufflers+Exhaust Pipes” exports are particularly sensitive to X - US.

   Table 7 displays the results of second-step regressions that generate results correspond-

ing to the five columns ((2)–(6)) of Table 6. For each column, the estimates are derived from

two second-step regressions using estimated coefficients for JPN and BIG 3 from the step-one

regressions. The summary statistics ( , & , and RMSE) for each regression appear at the

tion that the   BIG 3   disproportionately import RSI-intensive parts but the these estimates are

not significant.




5 Conclusion

We find evidence that networks do matter for trade and that Japan is different. Far from

being a “closed” market, Japan imports more auto parts from the U.S. than its observable

characteristics (car production, scale, distance from U.S., etc.) would predict. We find that

greater scale of host-country auto production deters parts imports, a result supporting the

model’s prediction that local scale increases the returns to relationship-specific investment.

Two results suggest that vertical networks matter for trade. First, U.S. exports to Japan

decrease as the importance of keiretsu sourcing of a part rises. Second, countries where the

Big 3 U.S. automakers account for large shares of car production tend to import more parts

from the United States.

   A preference for insiders over outsiders results in our model from endogenous deci-

sions by insiders to conduct relationship-specific investment. Insider networks may reflect

technical characteristics of parts that give rise to a high efficacy of RSI or may themselves

generate greater efficacy of RSI. In this context, rather than being exclusionary, networks

                                                          35
can be a source of greater efficiency in production. Our results are consistent with this view

of networks but further evidence would be required to reject the hypothesis that particu-

lar networks, such as keiretsu in Japan, reflect cronyism. Since vertical keiretsu links are not

correlated with engineering cost ratings, they do not appear to reflect technical efficiency,

at least as far as we can measure it. Thus, the economic basis for cross-part variation in the

prominence of keiretsu remains a puzzle that merits further investigation.
