                              Introduction


     The labor force activity of women has changed dramatically during

the postwar period. Between 1940 and 1971 the labor force participa-

tion rates of women rose from 27.4 per cent to 42.5 per cent. Since

1960, over 60 per cent of the increase in the total labor force Is

acccrnnted for by women, and 72.3 per cent of that proportion by married

women. This rapid increase in labor force participation has brought

into sharp relief the different patterns of employment and compensa-

tion existing between men and women in the American labor market. The

greater part of the increase in women workers between 1960 and 1971

were absorbed into a single malor occupation group: clerical workers.

In 1971, more than one out of three female workers was in a clerical

occupation; more than 50 per cent were either clerical or service

workers. There is no comparable occupational concentration for male

workers.

     Hand—in—hand with the large disparity in occupational distribu-

tion between men and women is the existence of differential earnings.

In 1971 median weekly earnings for full—time wage and salary workers

were $162 for males, $100 for females. Much of this difference in

earnings can be accounted for by the different occupational distri—

butlons of men and women; women tend to be concentrated in lower

paying occupations. However, differential wages exist by detailed

occupational classification as well.
     The most commonly alleged forces behind sex differences in occupa-

tional distribution and compensation is discrimination, by employers,
                                    1
workers, and consumers. Legislation has been passed and government

agencies established to combat discrimination through the legal system.

     Economists have also focused much of their efforts in the area of

wage and employment differences by sex on identifying and measuring

discrimination. Henry Sanborn2 implicitly defined discrimination as

unequal pay for equal work in his paper investigating earnings dif-

ferentials. Standardizing male and female earnings by occupational

distribution and hours worked, he still found approximately a 24 per

cent differential between men and women, using 1950 Census data and

Bureau of Labor Statistics occupational surveys. However, he was able

to isolate employment within given plants for a subset of male and female

operatives, and found that within plant standardized earnings differen-

tials were less than 10 per cent on average. He concluded that his re—

suits were compatible with the existence of employee or consumer dis-

crimination hut not discrimination against women by employers.




     1For example:

         a. The Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires equal pay for
             equal. work.

         b. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which bars dis-
             crimination in employment on the basis of race, color,
             sex, or national origin.

        c. Executive Order 11246 of 1965, as amended by Executive
            Order 11375 of October, 1967, which bars discrimination
            by federal contractors.

and Labor Relations Review, Volume 17, July 1964.
     Victor Fuchs came to a similar conclusion in his work on hourly

wage differentials between males and females. He found that the rela-

tive hourly wage of females could be raised by only one percentage point,

from 60 to 61 per cent of the male hourly wage, by adjusting for color,

schooling, age, and city size, and by an additional five points to 66

per cent by adjusting further for marital status, class of worker, and

length of trip to work. This finding suggests that differences in labor

"quality" or ability play a very small role in determining differential

compensation. However, his work presents evidence counter—indicative

of employer discrimination. For example, he finds self—employment to

have a significant negative partial effect on the relative hourly earn-

ings of females, which is contrary to the implication of the employer

discrimination hypothesis. Nevertheless, Fuchs concludes that his re-

sults are compatible with the existence of discrimination by coworkers

or consumers.

     Ronald Oaxaca4 attempted to identify the effect of discrimination

on hourly earnings of women analysing data from the 1967 Survey of

Economic Opportunity. His assumption is that discrimination is mani-

fested through employers paying men and women differently for their

personal market characteristics. By estimating an hourly earnings func-

tion for individuals of four sex—race categories, he found that discrim-

ination accounted for more than 75 per cent of the average wage differential

Women," Monthly Labor Review, Volume 94, No. 5, May 1971.

the Conference on Discrimination in Labor Markets, October 1971.)

between white males and white females, and for at least 88 per cent of

the differential between black males and black females.

     The error in this effort is that at no time did Oaxaca attempt to

determine the behavioral causes of different coefficients for males and

females in the earnings function other than discrimination.

     More recent work by economists has focused on the fact that sini—

ficant differences in the labor market behavior of males and females

exist which could give rise to differentials even in the absence of dis—

crimination by employers, consumers, or coworkers. The unique roles of

men and women within marriage and the family imply different patterns of

participation in the market and different investment in market oriented

skills. Despite the rapid increase in labor force participation of

women, their participation rates remain much lower than those of men.5

     Fuchs also considers the effects of these forces in his paper. The

1960 Census One—in—One--Thousand Sample does not include direct data on

labor turnover of males and females. However, the sharp decrease in

relative   earnings with increasing age suggests to Fuchs that 'much of
the overall differential is related to the more casual attachment of worn—
men to the labor force and to sex differences in post—school investment."

     Solomon Polachek6 estimates the effect that anticipated intervals

behavior were made by Jacob Mincer in "Labor Force Participation of Mairied

 out of the labor force have on optimal post—school human capital invest-

 ments made by women, and therefore on their earnings. He employed educa—

 tion—, marital status—, age— and sex—specific labor force participation

 rates to estimate the optimal volume of human capital investment for

 married—once, spouse—present males and females, and single, never married

males and females. Using these expected capital measures as independent

variables in the earnings function in place of the usual exposure terms

results in the reduction of the discrimination coefficient, here defined

as the coefficient of a dummy regressor which takes the value one if the

individual is a female and zero for a male, by about 80 per cent for

married—once, spouse—present males and females, the group for which the

earnings differential is the largest.

     In an extension of Polachek's analysis, Mincer and Polachek7 measure

the depreciation effect that intermittent periods of labor force with-

drawal have on the woman's human capital stock, which is an additional

depressant to female earnings. They use data from the National

Longitudinal Survey of Work Experience for Women, 30—44, which permits

isolating periods of market activity and of market withdrawal for in-

dividual women. By estimating earnings functions for women, segmenting

their work histories into periods of market work and home work, they

find significant depreciation of earnings for married women caused by

periods out of the labor force. Mincer and Polachek estimate that the

segmented pattern of participation of women, through its implications

for both human capital investment and depreciation, accounts for about

50 per cent of the observed earnings differential between married men

and married women, the group for whom the earnings differential is the

largest.

     Differential labor force turnover patterns between males and females

affect not only self—financed human capital accumulation and depreciation,

hut also imply differential Incentives to the firm to invest in firm—speci-

fic training of males and females. Clearly, If females are expected to

have higher firm—leaving rates than males, they represent a less desirable

investment. Table 1 presents data on median year on current lob by sex

and major occupation group, for the years 1951, 1963, 1966, and 1968. Ve

can get some idea of the magnitude of these differences in terms of turn-

over rates by employing the assumption that the underlying turnover rates

are constant each year. These statistics are presented in Table 2. Tables

1 and 2 show a pattern of Increasing turnover rates for both men and women

in the period 1963—68, during the   upturn   of the business cycle. Because

of the expected pattern of quit and layoff rates8 over the business cycle,

this increase can be interpreted as being due solely to increasing quit

rates. Table 2 reveals that with the Increase in turnover of both males

and females In this period, the difference in turnover rates has increased

both absolutely and relatively. Part of this increase may be due to the

differential incidence of layoff during this period. Hen, as primary

workers, are embodied with more specific Investment than women, and so

their layoff rate will decline relative to females over the business

cycle. In the postwar period, a significant part of the increase in

lower skill requirements and therefore higher turnover rates.       Age—

specific tenure data is also available for the years 1951, 1963, 1966,

and 1968, and presented in Table 3. These data are then converted into

the turnover data presented in Table 4. Table 5 shows the absolute and

relative differences in turnover rates increasi.n during the period 1963

to 1968 within age—specific categories, for the prime labor force age

categories. The relationship is reversed for new entrants, aged 20—24,

where females have lowere job leaving rates than males, hut Increases

for older cohorts.

     This paper analyzes the effects of differential turnover patterns

and the existence of firm specific training, jointly financed by em-

ployer and employee, on male—female wage and employment differentials.

Chapter 2 presents a model of a firm that invests in the training of

its workers, where employee turnover represents depreciation on human

capital. Differences in the turnover rates of men and women is shown

to be an important determinant of the incentive to the employer to hire

and train women as well as men. The empirical implications of the model

for the relative wage and occupational distribution of women are con-

trasted with those derived from a model of general human capital invest-

ment. Chapter 3 outlines the problems involved in empirical formulation

of the model, the choice of the unit of observation for empirical, test-

ing, and data limitations, and presents the results of empirical testing

            A Model of Specific Human Capital Investment In Workers:
              Implications for the Relative Wage and Occupational
                             Distribution of Women


I. The Model

      The framework of analysis is a model of the firm which produces two

outputs: X, a final good to he marketed, and T*, skilled labor, an inter-

mediate     input into the production of             X.



                     x   = x(T*)                                                      (1)
                 T* =         q'T
                                    t
The output of X is defined by a production function for each neriod usin,

a   single input, T*, and subject to constant returns to scale. Skilled

labor, T, is produced by a Cobb—Douglas oroductior function involving two

inputs: T, which Is conventional labor, or bodies, and q, the number of

units of human           capital        investment embodied in each of the T workers. a is

a measure of the elasticity of the effectiveness' of labor with respect

to training. The only restriction on ct                    is   that it be non—negative; this

goes one step beyond the convention of defining skilled labor as the quan-

tity invested per conventional laborer multiplied by                      the   number of laborers

(i.e., a       1).

      The firm is sub-ject to labor turnover, sothat


                     T
                         t
                             =Pt T t—l +1t .                                            (2)


      the   stock of workers during a given period t in the firm's life, is

equal to the proportion of workers who remained on the lob from period

t—l, Ttj,                    T' workers hired and trained in period t.

       The firm can affect p, the proportion of workers rematning on the
job from one period to the next, by offering a wage rate somewhat higher

than the alternative wage of the employees. To the extent that the em-

ployer has financed the human capital investment in his workers, he will

seek to share the costs and returns of this investment in order to reduce

labor turnover to the firm.'° I.e.,

                                  t
                                                                     (3)
                                  t

where W is the per period compensation of the T workers, and WA is their

highest alternative wage.

     Human capital investment per worker, q, is produced at a cost to the

firm. We assume increasing marginal cost of investment per worker: marginal

costs increase with the intensity of investment. In addition, hiring of new

workers,     involves search costs to the firm. If costs of search in-

crease with the number of new workers to be hired, then the cost function

per worker of hiring and training new workers can be expressed as


            C = C(q,

where1 C . > 0    and c     ..   > 0.    C, as defined in expression (4) is
                          2 ]
essentially a price to the firm for each worker it hires and trains, which

increases with the number hired and the Intensity of training. Total cost

per period of hiring and training I workers Is equal to C(q,               1
     The present value of the firm's total return to investment and pro-

duction over time can be written as
                                        —          —
                E(')t [kX(qa     T)         WtTt       C(q,   t1 .    (5)

K is the market price of the firm's output X, assumed to be constant

over time, and r is the discount rate faced by the firm.11 The employer

seeks to maximize it    subject   to


                                                                             (6)

                Pt —    p(W;   WA)


with respect to the variables he controls: W, q, and

     In order to simplify the optimization problem, let us assume that

labor market conditions are not expected to change over firm life, so

that optimal values of W,              q, and therefore p are the same for all

t. Then

             T=—. I                                                              (7)



and output of X is constant for all t. Expression (5) can be rewritten as


               it   — E(_J.._-) fkX (q _.._I) — w
                        i+r
                                                    _i_   I — C(q,   I) I]   .   (8)
                                          i—p       1—p

The employer wishes to maximize IT, as expressed in (8), subject to the new

constraint


              p = p(W; WA) .                                                       (9)


First order conditions for a maximum are:


      c—i
                 1   (kMP         W) — C2(q, I) — C(q, I) <     0;     0 or I = 0
              r(l—p)      q




     11
       Infinite firm life is assumed in order to avoid explicit consideration
of the scrap value of the firm at the end of the firm's life. This assump-
tion is not unreasonable in that at the end of the employer's life he is
free to sell the firm. The sale price will depend on the path the firm is
on: the way to assure maximum sale price in this model is to assume an
infinite firm life.

A is the Lagrangian multiplier associated with a constrained maximum

of this type, and is equal to the shadow price of p in this problem.

NP =       , the    marginal product of skilled labor in the production of

x.

       Condition C—i simply states that in equilibrium, the increment in

present value of revenue from an additional person hired and trained

must equal the marginal cost of hiring and training him. C—2 states

that the increment in present value of revenue from investing an

additional unit of training in each worker must just equal the marginal

cost of investment. C—3 states that at the margin, the value of a de-

crease in turnover rates induced by an increase in wage rate must just

equal the additional wage cost required to induce it. These are the

marginal revenue must equal marginal cost conditions of profit maxi-

mization. C—4 simply requires that turnover rates may not be lower

than the firm "production function" of turnover rates permits.

       Let us now introduce the difference between male and female work—

wers into the model. Assuming men and women to be perfect substitutes

in production, there may still be differential returns to the employer

from training them because of differential turnover rates, i.e., it is

expected that over some range of wages Pf <                  Assume a cost curve

per worker of the form

                                    W0f + aqf + b/2qf2 + clf              (10)

Except for Wf and W, the training period wages for males and females,

the functional form of the curve for males and females is identical,

while the level attained depends on the number hired and the quantity

invested per worker. W  and W are assumed different, since it is
                     of       om
often presumed that women may buy their way into training by taking a

lower wage during the training period, thus compensating the firm for

their higher turnover rates. We assume that In searching for labor,

the employer is searching In two distinct pools, male and female, for

workers of a certain quality. There is some distribution of quality

among workers in each pool. If the cost of search per worker of given

quality increases with the intensity of search within each pooi, the

employer's least cost policy would be to search in both pools, i.e.,

hire both males and females. We assume that these costs will rise at

an equal rate in both pools. However, it would be possible to postulate

them rising at different rates, cf                             and introduce an additional

distinction between males and females into the model.

Table 6. Pf and p are affected by two kinds of job mobility: inter—

and intra—market. The compensated substitution elasticity of inter—

market mobility of market wage rates has been established to be great-

er for females than males.12 However, if the females themselves anti-

cipate a higher probability of leaving the labor force in a given period

of time, the wage elasticity of their intra—tnarket mobility should be

lower than that for males, since the same observed wage differential be-

tween firms or occupations represents a smaller net benefit from migration

to them.

     The relative responsiveness of Pf and                   to changes in wages is not

clear. However, the equilibrium conditions below reveal that even if

Pf < 1m for any wage, females could still be hired; they would simply re-

ceive less training than males, and fewer of them would he hired.

"Wage Comparisons — A Selectivity Bias" (National Bureau of Economic

than the observed "average acceptance wage."

It is clear from the equation that the existence of employer—financed

investment in human capital and differential turnover rates combine to

be a sufficient condition for wage differentials to exist, even in the

absence of any taste for discrimination by employers, co—workers, or

consumers.

      Differences in turnover imply different levels of investment in

male and female workers, and lesser hiring of women than men. Combining

equilibrium conditions C—la and C—lb differently, we find that

optimal qf

     The model formulated in Section I is in terms of a single firm demand-

ing a single kind of skill, q. Expression (15) shows that within a given

occupation women will undergo less firm specific training than men. An

additional interpretation of this result exists. If levels of investment

q, are positively correlated with occupational classification, smaller

optimal investment in women may imply occupational segregation within the

firm as well, i.e., it may be optiaal for employers to hire and train

females in the lower skill occupations, and to make more efficient use of

males by training them in the high skill occupations within the firm.

     The parameter a is the elasticity of the "effectiveness" of labor

with respect to training. If a is equal to 1.0, the employer is indif-

ferent between human capital and bodies: one person with two units of

training is equally as productive as two persons with one unit of train-

ing each. As a increases, human capital becomes more heavily weighted

in the production function. By differentiating the first order condi-

tions at the maximum, Ye find that

of investment per worker is quadratic in investment. With constant returns
to scale, a .? 2 would imply marginal revenue from investment rising at least
as fast as marginal cost. Quantity invested would be indefinite in the case
of a = 2, and infinite in the case of a > 2. a     0 implies qf — q    0, since
marginal revenue would be 0, and therefore everywhere below marginal cost.

if p < p   in equilibrium. As human capital becomes more important

in production, women will receive proportionately less human capital        S
investment than men. Women in the higher skill occupations would have

less training relative to their male counterparts than women in the

low skill occupations. Similarly, we expect the relative number of

women to men demanded will be lower in the higher skill occupations)5

     If we consider an increase in the importance of specific training

for the economy over time, then expressions (16) and (17) can be inter-

preted to state that the relative skills of women in the economy as a

whole would fall over time, and their occupational distribution would

deteriorate, given no change in their labor force behavior.

     A shift in demand for investment in human capital by firms away

from women and   toward     men also implies shifts in the relative wages

of women. For an increase in cz    although each firm does not desire to

increase wages for either males or females, as all fjrms attempt to

increase the hiring and training of workers. c1ely, since the shift

in demand is proportionately greater for men than women, the relative

wage of women will fall (disregarding supply elasticities).

     Similarly, the greater relative net profitability of men than

women in high skill occupations at a moment in time implies the relative

wage of women across occupations should be inversely related to the

skill level. This model does not explicitly consider the possibility

of female selection toward occupations on the basis of their own   labor

certain assumptions.
force characteristics, I.e., lower labor force turnover of women In high

investment occupations, because of the higher expected cost to them of

depreciation on self—financed human capital from leaving the firm or labor

force. To the extent that specific investment and general investment are

correlated across occupations, we iiight expect such a pattern of occupa-

tional selection to exist. This phenomenon would offset somewhat the

prediction of lower relative wages for women in occupations with higher

specific training requirements.

      The model as developed in Section I of this chapter is a partial

equilibrium model. It is a model of how firms react to differences in

turnover and different levels of specific human capital investment. One

implication of this model is that wage differentials between firms and be-

tween occupations may exist within sex eategories as well as across them.

In order for the market to tolerate such differentials in equilibrium, an

additional constraint must be imposed that within sex categories, train-

ing period wages are such that the rate of return to the worker from his

share of investment is equalized across all firms and all occupations.

III. A Simulation of the Model

      The magnitude of the effect of training and turnover on relative

wages can be determined empirically. For purposes of illustration, It

IV.   Implications of Ceneral Human Capital Investment

      It is interesting at this point to contrast the implications of

general human capital investment for relative wage and ouantitv of

training of females with those derived from the specific human capital

model. Selection by low turnover females to occupations involving

larger quantities of self—financed, or general, human capital implies

a higher relative quantity of training in these occupations than in

lower investment occupations. Let its employ the Ben—Porath16 model in

an extremely simplified form. Market wage is equal to a rental once,

a, per unit of general human capital multiplied by the number of units

of general human capital, H. If ie assume that women are employed in

the home as well as the market, the return to females from total employ—

ment is

                Jf =   E    —             pW    ÷

                                                                =   E(l/l+r)t.paflg f   ÷

                               (l+r)


P is the proportion of time spent in the market in any given period,

assumed for simplicity to be the same for all periods, W is the market

wage, equal to aHf and Wh is the home wage. No depreciation of market

skills is associated with spending less than full time in the market.

      If males are assumed to spend full time in the market, because of zero

home productivity, then the return to investment for males can be expressed

as
                 J =
                  in
                               (1/1+r)t   all

The marginal revenue of investment in general human capital for males is

                           =   aE(1/l+r)t       =     a/r   .                               (21)

ilRf.   marginal revenue curve of investment for females is             equal to the dis-

counted present value of the change in wage modified by the proportion of

time spent in the market plus the value of increased time in the market

less the loss in home product. Since men are assumed to always be in the

market full time, no increase.jn participation is associated with an in-

crease in wage. The marginal revenue curves for males and females are

illustrated in Figure II. We assume men and women to be equally able in

the production of human capital by giving them a common marginal cost

curve.

     If a zero correlation between home wage and proportion of time

spent in the market is postulated a riori, positive correlation between

proportion of time spent in the market and general investment undertaken

arises from two different sources: higher marginal revenue curves for

women who expect ex ante to be in the market a larger proportion of their

lifetime, and the responsiveness of labor force participation to higher

wage rates.   The women who do anticipate spending more time in the imrket

will select higher investment occupations. In addition, those women in

higher investment occupations will spend more time in the market because

of their higher wages. The net result is that these women have more

 masculine labor market characteristics, i.e., Pf/P is higher, implying

greater relative quantity of training and therefore a higher relative wage.

     A change in the rental price per unit of general human capital, caused

by increased demand for skilled labor, will shift the marginal revenue

curves upward for both males and females.

The marginal revenue curve for females is found to have a greater propor-

tional upward shift than that for males, leading to a greater proportional

increase in female investment relative to male investment, and therefore to

a higher relative wage.

     The implications of general training across occupations and over time

are different from those generated by the specific human capital model. The

women found in occupations requiring a greater volume of general investment

will be more umasculine in their characteristics, i.e., will expect to
spend a larger proportion of their time in the market and will invest more

in themselves relative to men than women with higher expected turnover.

The higher relative quantity of investment undertaken implies a higher

relative wage as well. Therefore, the relative wage and relative quantity

of general investment will vary directly with the volume of general invest-

ment across occupations. It will be helpful to keep in mind the distinctly

different implications of general and specific human capital investment for

relative wage of women when interpreting the results of the empirical test-

ing of the specific human capital model.

       Empirical Formulation and Testing of Implications of the
            Specific Htnnan Capital Model for Relative Wage
                and Occupational Distribution of Women


I. Problems of Empirical Formulation

     The theoretical model developed in Section I, Chapter 2, suggests

that the appropriate unit of observation in the empirical formulation

of the model would be the firm, since the term "specific training" im-

plies training specific to the firm. However, detailed firm data com-

pensation by sex are impossible to obtain. In addition, firms do not

provide training in only one skill, but employ and train workers in a

range of jobs. Carl N. Rahm17 argues that the natural embodiment of

skill is the occupation; a basic hypothesis of his work is that occu-

pational earnings reflect different investment levels. For the purpose

of testing the model presented in Chapter 2 of this paper, occupation

is the unit of analysis available from the data which best represents

a homogeneous range of skills. Aggregate occupational data represents

the "average" firm which produces the bundle of skills requisite for

that occupation. In Chapter 2, the behavior of firms predicted by the

model was aggregated to market predictions. Using aggregate occupa-

tional data for empirical estimation tests the validity of the firm

model against the behavior of the market.

     Additional problems of formulation arise from limitations of data.

No measure of the volume of on—the—job training acquired by individual

workers exists. Even continuous labor force experience cannot be ex—

actly measured from available bodies of data. Continuous time since




     17Carl M. Rahm, "Investment in Training and the Occupational Structure
of Earnings," (Unpublished Ph.D. thesis, Columbia University, 1971).
 completion of schooling, "exposure" to the labor market, is the estimate

 of labor force experience generally used. For prime age males whose high

 labor force attachment leads to almost continuous participation over the

 life cycle, this definition of experience has proved to be satisfactory.

 However, for females, whose participation is intermittent over the life

 cycle, exposure diverges widely from true labor force experience. Since

market experience has been shown in the human capital literature to he a

 strong determinant of wages, the lack of a direct measure18 presents a

severe problem for the explanation of female wages. One means of adjust-

ment to this problem is to include the number of children horn to the

average woman in an occupation as a proxy variable for average years out

of the labor force.

     Another problem for analysis of the wage differential between males

and females is the lack of information on turnover rates by occupation

and sex. From data on average job tenure by occupation and sex, we could

make rough estimates of turnover rates. Such data has been published for

major occupation groups by the Bureau of the Census for 1951, and by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics for the years 1963, 1966, and 1968, and are

presented in Table 1. Simple assumptions described in the footnote to

that table translate the -job tenure data into expected attrition data

presented in Table 2.

     The implications of the model with respect to training refer parti-

cularly to specific training. It is crucial to the analysis to properly




     18Mincer and Polachek, Ibid, find that when they use the segmented
work histories of women available in the National Longitudinal Survey of
Work Exper1e of Women, 30—44, the explanatory power of the earnings
function for women is greatly increased, and that children do not add any
information to the equation.
                                                                 36


define a variable corresponding to such on—the—lob training. From the

human capital literature, we know the effects of on—the—lob training on

the experience—earnings profile of individuals. Greater post—school in-

vestments in human capital imply steeper dollar earnings profiles with

peaks later in the life cycle than do smaller quantities of training.19

     Fuchs used a measure of steepness of the experience—earnings profile

as an indication of training in his paper on male—female differentials in

hourly earnings.20 However, the steepness of the profile basically re-

flects general training. In order to use such a measure for our analysis,

we must make the assumption that general and specific training are positively

correlated across occupations. This assumption does not seem unreasonable

in view of the positive correlation between schooling and post—school in-

vestment (in dollar terms) across individuals.2' Individuals with higher

education also undertake greater post—school investment; assume this cor-

relation is positive with respect to both general and specific invest-

ment. Then occupations in which workers of higher educational quality

are employed must involve more of both forms of training, and we should

observe a positive correlation between the dollar quantities of general

and post—school investment across occupations. There are two additional

problems with working with the experience—earnings profile in this con-

text. One is that simply because of the smaller average experience of

women than men, in occupations involving higher returns to experience,

National Bureau of Economic Research, 1974).

     2l Mincer, Ibid.
women will earn less than men. This effect will be somewhat counteracted

by the positive selection of women on the basis of their own labor force

characteristics to occupations involving self—financed human capital in-

vestment. The second problem arises from the fact that one is not observ-

ing the same individuals in cross section. Certain occupations may be

"stepping—stone" occupations, in which the payoff to early investment does

not come from within the occupation, hut from graduating to another, better

paying occupation. The individuals observed in the higher experience

classes of these occupations are the "losers", the ones who remained in

the occupations rather than graduating, and therefore received little pay—

of f to their earlier investment. However, this problem is of little im-

portance for demand considerations.

comprised of a national probability sample and a supplementary sample

of low income, primarily nonwhite households. One benefit of the supple-

mentary sample is that it provides data for blacks in sufficient quantity

to permit running regressions for blacks and whites separately. Because

of the higher observed relative wage and stronger labor force attachment

of black women compared to white women, we would expect, a priori, quite

different empirical results for the two groups.

     Regressions for the white and nonwhite samples are estimated separately

on data for employed civilian males and females with positive hourly earn-

ings, not currently enrolled in school. The data were grouped separately

by sex and race, and aggregated within detailed occupation groups.

     The 1967 SEO estimates hourly earnings of resnondents by dividing

weekly earnings during the survey week from all gainful activity by total

hours worked during the week. In individual data subsequently grouped by

primary occupation, this procedure of estimation introduces error into the

estimate of hourly wage rate associated with an occupation. In addition,

random variations in hours worked by individuals during the survey week

may cause an over— or Understatement of the hourly wage of wage and salary

workers.

     The large variance in the number of males and females across occupa-

tions suggests using weighted regressions. All regressions presented are

weighted by the square root of the number in the occupation.

     Following      the experience—earnings model developed by Jacob Mincer,

I have employed the log of wage as the dependent variable in the follow-

ing equations. Although the demand model developed in this paper does

not mandate this specification, empirically we will he estimating a re-

duced form rather than pure demand equation, and the literature (Mincer,

Rahn, Polachek) suggests that the proper reduced form specification is

log—linear.

     The experience and earnings variable included in the male and

female regressions serve a dual purpose: they provide estimates of

the rate of return across occupations, and, in addition, hold constant

quality of male and female workers. Becauee of the discontinuous nature

of labor force participation by women, the average number of children is

included in the female equation in order to modify female expetience.

The simplest assumption to make about the effect of children on experi-

ence is to interpret true experience to be equal to observed experience

minus c years per child times the number of children. Consider the post—

school investment model of earnings.22

During the period out of the labor force for women with children, assume

that no investment takes place. Then the investment profile for women

with children would be as in Figure 4. The existence of the profile

below the horizontal axis indicates that depreciation or disinvestment

may   be   taking place during the period out of the labor force.

This specification implies that the children variable should be entered

into the log linear equation in arithmetic form.

     In addition to serving as a proxy for length of time spent out of

the labor force, the average number of children variable may also serve

as a proxy for the number of "trips" in and out of the labor force women

have made on average. Inter—labor force turnover is a key variable for

explaining the effects of human capital on female wages. Although no

direct measure of such turnover exists in the data, there are several

proxy variables which can be constructed from the Survey of Economic

Opportunity. One   such   measure is the variance of weeks worked in 1966

by men and women in each occupation (FVAR, MVAR); large variance would

indicate greater inter—labor force mobility. We would expect such mo-

bility to be more costly for men than; for women because of the greater

investment in general human capital by men than women. Another turn-

over proxy provided by the SEO is the proportion of those who have left

the logest job they held in 1966 (FTR1, MTR1). This variable capture
both the inter— and intra—lahor force mobility of men and women. Be-

cause voluntary intra—lahor force mobility is a form of investment in

human capital, i.e., lob mobility induced by better opportunities, we

would expect to find this mobility less costly to men than women, for

whom such mobility might have a larger exogenous component. A third

variable, the percent of males and females who worked full time hours

when they worked in 1966, (FTF,FTM), is a measure of previous labor

force attachment. Log of hours worked during the survey week (LF}TRS,

LMHRS) serves the dual purpose of controlling for random fluctuations

in hours and of acting as a measure of present labor force attachment.

     FSO,MSO, variables which attempt to standardize for regional dis-

persion of the Individuals In the sample are also included in the re-

gression equations.

     The variable measuring the volume of investment associated with an

occupation (DWAGE) is constructed from the experience—wage profile of

white males within the occupations. DWAGE is the difference in average

hourly wage between white males with 10—20 years of experience and white

males with 0—10 years of experience. Most investment takes place during

the early years of labor force experience. DWAGE measures the difference

between the early training wage when investment Is being fittanced and the

later wage which Includes some return to investment.

     Regressions are run separately by sex and race; the dependent variable

is the log of average hourly wages of males and females for each occupation

(LFWAGE,LNWAGE). Table 8 summarizes the variables used in the regressions

and their definitions. All regressions are weighted by the square root

of cell size.

A. Empirical Results for White Males and Females: Wages

    The average wages of males and females within occunations are not in-

dependently determined; whatever market forces affect the demand for male

labor also affect the demand for female labor in an occunation or industry.

The model developed in this paper suggests how such effects may differ for

men and women across occupations. Because of the simultaneous determina-

tion of wages for males and females within occupations, the method of joint

generalized least squares estimation of seemingly unrelated equations,

developed by Zellner22, is employed to estimate the log wage equations for

males and females. This method is designed to estimate jointly a combina-

tion of equations which appear to be unrelated, hut are in fact related

because their residual disturbance terms are correlated. Theoretically,

such estimation results in more efficient estimates. The joint (LS re—

suits are presented in Tables 9 and 10. ()LS results are included in the

appendix. Surprisingly, the empirical correlation between the residuals

of the male and female equations is quite small, although stat{sticallv

significant. Therefore, the results of the two estimation procedures

do not differ much.

TURNOVER

     The first equations of Tables 9 and 10 do not include the traininR

proxy or its interaction terms. The turnover variables all behave in

the expected manner in the male and female equations, excent for the

log of hours variable (LFI-TRS,LMTIRS) which has an unexnected negative

coefficient   in all equations. This phenomenon can he partially explained

by the construction of the dependent variable. Hourly wage is constructed

by the SEO by dividing weekly earnings by weekly hours. The interviewers

did attempt   to get a "permanent"   measure of wage iw   excluding   overtime hours

and pay. This effort would reduce any expected positfve correlation between

hourly wage and hours worked. However, it is clear that there may still ex-

ist a negative correlation between hours and wage; individuals may receive

weekly or monthly salaries which are independent of any random fluctuations

in hours worked during the week irior to interview. Therefore, the bench-

mark value for testing the effect of hours worked on hourly wage should he

one rather than zero. In none of the male or female equations is the co-

efficient of log hours significantly different from unity in absolute value.

Interpreting log of hours as a turnover variable leads us to conclude that

it has no significant effect on wage. Hours worked during a specific week

is simply an observation at a point in time; wages, however, depend on long—

run patterns of turnover behavior. Therefore the statistical insignificance

of this variable is not surprising.

     The three other turnover variables employed in the equations involve

more than an observation at a point in time; they all capture turnover be-

havior in 1966, the year preceding the survey. Interestingly, the coef-

ficients of these three turnover variables differ between the male and fe-

male equations in a pattern consistent with the exnected underlying dif-

ferences in investment in human capital. While the effect of having left

the longest job of 1966 is insignificantly different from zero in all the

male equations, it is consistently negative and significant at at least

a 10¼ level of confidence in three of the five female equations. It is

insignificant only when its interaction with training is also included

in the equation. Intra—lahor force mobility may he interpreted as a form
 of human capital investment for men, who presumably change lobs in order

 to exploit better onportunitieg. Such mobility offers a smaller payoff

 to women than men, because of their own shorter expected duration of lobs.

 Therefore, we would expect a greater proportion of women than men who

have changed jobs to have done so for exogeneous reasons. Hence the

 stronger decrease in earnings associated with changing lobs in the female

equations. Of course, some proportion of males who changed lobs may also

have done so because they were fired or exnerienced some unemployment in

1966. For males, exogenous lob mobility is better cantured by the variance

in weeks worked during 1966. The negative effect of this turnover variable

is significant in all the male equationg, although the coefficient merely

borders on significance when the interaction of 4VAP with DWA(E is inclu-

ded in the equation. Because of the high labor force participation of

white males, the variance in weeks is quite probably a measure of involun-

tary turnover. For females, the variance in weeks worked during 1966 would

represent exogenous mobility to a lesser extent; periods of no work in the

market do not necessarily represent periods of unemployment for women, hut

of alternative employment in the home. Women may select occupations in

which intermittent participation is not costly in terms of wage reduction,

in which skills do not depreciate during periods out of the labor force,

or in which the loss in terms of foregone investment is small. Therefore

we expect and find a small, insignificant effect of variance of weeks worked

on female wage.

     The percent of males and females iho worked full time hours when they

worked in 1966 (FTF,MTN) is a measure of past attachment to the labor force.

Although positive and significant for both males and females, the effect of

previous attachment on present wage is almost twice   as   large for males.

This difference is consistent ith the hypothesis that men both invest
                                                                         50


more in themselves and have more invested in them by employers than

women, as is predicted by the model. The stronger the previous attach-

ment, as measured by FTM and inversely by MVAR,       the greater the previous
stock of human capital. We expect such a positive effect to be smaller

for females than males because they invest less in themselves and have

less invested in them by firms during emnloyment. While greater past

attachment implies greater stock of capital for women as well as men, the

implicit addition to stock is nonetheless smaller for women than that made

by men. If we were to accept the ratio of the female to male coefficients

as the ratio of their total average stocks of human capital, both snecific

and general, the total human capital investment of women relative to men

would be about 50%.

TRAINING

     The coefficients on the interaction terms between training and turn-

over are all negative, as expected, although insignificant for both males

and females. The partial effect of training on wage cannot he read from

the coefficient of DWAGE along, since interaction terms are present. Table

11 presents the effect of PWAGF     on log of male   and female wage when the

Uthbr variables are evaluated at the mean. A difference of $.Ol per

    1Pr    year in the slope of the earning profile, equivalent to $20.00
            per year in annual earnings, at 2000 full time hours per year,
            difference of approximately .877% in male wages and .2448% in
Jethte   wakes,   or a difference in relative wage of about .6322%. A dif—
ferte o     $.lO    per hour per year between two   occunations, equivalent to

          per   year per year in the experience enrnings slope, imnlies a dif—
          in relative wage of 6.3% between the two     occimations.

    The effectg of trainin and       turnover on relative wage at the mean is
           1ti Table 12. 1etween 13.3 nd 30.21 nercentage noints of the
 mean relative wage can he explained by the joint existence of sex dif-

 ferences in turnover rates and training, depending on whether the male    or
 female values of the turnover variables are used. Measured in terms of

 the relative wage differential, 29.49% at the mean, the combined effect

of training and turnover explains between 45.10% and 102.44% of the dif-

ferential, depending on whether the male or female turnover values are

employed in the calculations. Of course, levels of turnover and the co-

efficients on turnover are not unrelated in these equations. when the

female values of turnover are employed in the male equation, the nre—

dicted relative wage results in the higher estimate of the joint effect

of training and turnover. This result is due to the Fact that the male

eauation reflects the greater human capital investment undertaken by

men, and therefore the greater cost to them of a given change in turn-

over. Tn fact, as the labor force behavior of women approached that of

men over time, presumably the coefficients in the female wage equation

would approach those of the male equation. Therefore, the cross—section

estimate of the joint effect of training and turnover, when using the

male values and the female regression coefficients is an underestimate.

Both the estimates are, of course, point estimates, with no associated

confidence intervals. Nevertheless, they are quite large, at the ex-

treme explaining the entire wage differential, suggesting the empirical

importance of training and turnover for the relative wage of females.

     The measured effect of training and turnover on relative wage of

females within occupations cannot he ascribed entirely to specific

human capital alone. Polachek has demonstrateI the importance of dif—

ferentlal labor force behavior for investment in general human canital

and its consequences for the relative earnings of women. However, the

greater part of the difference in genera1human capital investment made

by mean and women may he captured in occupational selection itself.
Clearly, there is variation in the amount of general training acouired

by individuals within occupations; however, by investigating the rela-

tive wage within occupations, we are holding general investment constant

to some extent.

     In chapter 2, the implications of pure general training for the

relative wage were contrasted with those of specii.i.c training. Those

women who enter occupations involving large amounts of self—financed in-

vestment should have labor market characteristics more similar to those

of men than women on average; hence, their investment relative to men in

those occupations would he larger than for women on average. In addition,

their stronger labor force attachment would ead them to suffer less de-

preciation of their human capital from intermittent periods out of the

labor force. Therefore, the eouations in which the interactive effect

of training and turnover were not included would he expected to predict

a nositive effect of training on relative wage of women, on the basis of

general human capital alone, since only more "masculine" women would he

found in these occupations. However, the economic effect of DWAGE on

relative wage in these equations is negative, and statistically signifi—

cáttt Rs predicted by the specific human canital hynothesis. Therefore,

1thoph we cannot measure the senarate effects of general and specific

training on relative wage in these eauations, the negative effect of DWAGE

on relative wage supports interpreting the slope coefficient as capturing

the effect of the specific component of training on relative wage.

Marital Status and Children

     In none of the equations for log of female wage is marital status of

women included as an independent variable. The rationale for including

marital status of women in a female earnings function is as a proxy
variable for labor force attachment and turnover. However, early experi-

mentation with the percent of women never married as an additional in-

dependent variable resulted in an unexpected negative coefficient which

was never significant. The simple correlation between percent never

married and the other turnover variables was quite high, so that marital

status added no information on expected turnover to the equation. In addi-

tion, the other proxy variables for turnover and labor force attachment

were more straightforward and empirically more powerful than marital sta-

tus. Therefore, it was omitted in the final equations.

     Essentially the same factor can exnlain the consistently insinifi—

cant coefficient of the average number of children variable. The direct

information provided by the turnover proxies contain the information other-

wise provided by KIDS. Although, statistically insignificant in all equa-

tions, the coefficient of KIDS suggests that each additional child imnlies

about a 4% reduction in female wage.

Discrimination

     Differential labor force behavior of males and females has implica-

tions for relative wages apart from those that work through specific

human capital investment. In that most women work in the home as well

as the market, they may select occupations which offer lower wages in ex-

change for more flexible hours; the variance in average female hours rela-

tive to the mean was .996 against .373 for males in the sample. They may

choose occupations which offer easier exit and entry, so that intermittent

periods of withdrawal from the labor force incur minimal loss in wages. In

addition, part of the differential may he due to dIscrimination against

women by employers or consumers. Tf men and women were identical in all

respects——in their work, in home nroduction, in their labor force behavior——

the only variables affecting their relative wage would he years of schooling
and years of experience. since men and women are not identical, however,

we expect and find the coefficients on experience to differ between males

and females in the earnings functions we have estimated. One possible in-

dicator of discrimination against women would he a smaller proportionate

increase in earnings per unit of schooling capital for women than men.

Even in the absence of discrimination, women with eotial levels of school-

ing as men might choose lower paving occupations for the reasons mentioned

above; this factor is accounted for in the eiuations of Table 9 and 10,

because the observations are occupational averages. In addition, a unit

of schooling capital may not he the same to men and women in terms of its

market directed content. In none of the equations presented in Table 9

and 10 are the coefficients on schooling significantly different between

the male and female equations. T—values for these differences average

about .25. This evidence directly contradicts the common allegation of

increasing discrimination at higher education levels. Widening earnings

differentials between men and women with increasing education, to the

extent that they exist, must be attributed solely to differences in post-

school investment.

B. Regression Results: The Occupational Distribution

      The model developed in Chapter 2 implies that wages, turnover, and

quantity of training are optimally decided independently of the number

    t$iils   and females hired. Given these optimal values, the proportion

ö males and females hired is determined by relative turnover rates, by

,   the importance of training in production, and by the relative cost

of hiring them, specifically search costs. We have no a priori notion

of relative costs of searching for male and female labor; in the model

€kese tosts were assumed to rise at the same rate in both pools. For

the   empirical   analysis, turnover rates and the volume of investment
associated with an occupation are the relevant variables affecting the

desired number of males and females.

     Demand aalvsis leads us to expect a strong negative relationshin

between turnover and relative number of females employed, as well as be-

tween volume of specific investment and relative number of women in an

occupation. When we consider the interaction of the supniv of females

to occupations with the demand effect, the relationship between turnover

and relative number may be reversed. Women in high investment occupations,

where there are relatively few women employed, should he more "masculine"

in their labor force characteristics, i.e. have lower labor force turn-

over. This nhenomenon could lead to a nositive correlation between turn-

over and relative number of women.

     The partial effect of training, holding costant turnover, is also not

unambiguous in the occupational distribution equations. To the extent that

optimal wage differentials compensate firms for fighter losses due to hieher

turnover, the relative number of females to males may he unrelated to train-

ing across occupations. Firms that are fully compensated by differential

wages may determine the relative number of males and females solely on the

basis of relative cost of hiring them.

     Tables 13 and 14 Present the joint GLS estimates for the occupational

distribution regressions where the wage differential is not included in the

estimating equations. OLS est{ates are nresented in the Appendix.

     In the female equations, the turnover variables are of conflicting

sign. FVAR, the variance in weeks worked has a statistically significant,

positive effect In all equations; nresumahlv this variable is capturing

the supply resnonse of women to occupations permitting greater variation

in participation. The coefficient of FVAP in the efficient results im-

plies an elasticity of supply with respect to variation in weeks of about 2.
VR1 and KIDS have negative coefficients, indicating that holding constant

supply effects, greater turnover leads to fewer women employed. Although

DWAGE is not significant when entered into the equations alone, its effect

is stronger when entered In conlunction with interaction terms. The nega-

tive interaction terms are in accordance with those found in the wage

equations.

     The relative effect of training for males and females, evaluated at

the mean value of the turnover variables, is presented in Table 15. The

effect of training on relative number of females employed is never signi-

ficant and varies in sign depending upon the equation employed. The effect

is negative when the interaction between training and turnover characteris-

tics of women is not held constant, as would he expected. However, one

suspects that tFese equations are mis—specified since they do not control

for the wage differential.

     In order to enter the wage differential into the occupational distribu-

tion equations, Two Stage Least Souares estimation procedure was necessary,

since wage and number hired are both endogeneous to the system. In the

first stage, FRAT and MUAT, the log of female and male wage, respectively,

are predicted. The predicted log of relative wage, DIFF, is the difference

between FHAT and MHAT. Tables 16 and 17 present loint GLS results for the

regressions of log of numbers on turnover and training variables alone,

thte the wage differential, DIFF, is held constant in both the male and
female equations. Two   Stage   Least Squares results are presented in the

Appendix.

     The coefficient on 111FF behaves in the expected manner for both the

male and female equations; it is positive in the former and negative in

the latter. Holding constant T)TFF, the relative wage, an increase in

tIIAT or FRAT in the equation of the opp,site sex has a negative effect

on the number employed. At first this may seem surnrising. However,

a higher male wage, holding constant the relative wage and the turnover

characteristics of females, amy fmniy "better auaiitv" males in the

occupation and therefore a lower demand for women. im1.lar1y, a hieher

female wage, holding constant the relative wage of females, may imply

"better", i.e., lower turnover, females, and therefore reduced demand for

men.

       When the compensating sex differential in wages   is   included in the

equations explaining occupational distribution of r'en and women, the effect

of greater training on the relative nimber of women becomes consistently

negative. These calculations are presented in Table 18. The negative

effect becomes quite large when the interactive effect of training and

turnover are not held constant. A $.lO per hour per year difference

between two occupations in the slope of the experience wage profile of

white males in the occupation imolies a difference of 16.3% noints in

the relative number of females employed in the two occunations, if the

interactive effect between training and turnover is not held constant.

C. Summary

       The effect of training on relative wage of women and relative num-

ber of women hired, measured in Tables 11 and 18 of this chapter, suggests

the empirical importance of training for the relative position of women

itt th   labor   force, given sex differences in labor force behavior, snecif—

icallv in turnover behavior. In the cross—section of occupations, higher

training leads to reduced relative demand for women, reflected both in

lower relative wages and lower relative number emnioved.

 III. Regression_Pesultg for Nonwhite Males and Females

       Two   characteristic   differences exist between white and black females

 in the labor force: black women have higher earnings relative to their

male counterparts than white women and also higher labor force participa-

 tion rates. Bowen and Finegan found that after adjusting for many factors

such as education, husband's incoute and employment status, and number of

children, there was still a 6.8% average difference in participation rates

between black females and white females.

     The snecific human capital model developed in Chapter 2 suggests

three factors which could give rise to the observed differences in rela-

tive earnings.

     1. The expected lower investment in on—the—job training, both speci-

           fic and general, by blacks than whites.

     2. The smaller sex differences in turnover for blacks than whites.

           From Table 7 we find the average job tenure of black females to

           be higher relative to black males than for white females relative

           to white males in three of the reported years.

     3. The smaller discrepancy between observed and actual experience of

           black women than white women, because of their stronger labor force

           attachment, inmiving a smaller difference between male and female

           exierience than in the white popuiat4,n.

     A fourth factor may also he smaller differential discrimination against

black women. This is a point raised by Bowen and Finegan to explain the

remaining differences between the labor force narticipation rates of black

women and white women.

     As was expected, the mean value of flWMT, the measure of occupational

investment, is lower in the black samnie than the white, indicating the           S
smaller   investment in training by blacks. The stronger labor force
 attachment of black women, however, is not apparent in the SEO sample.

 Both the variance in weeks worked in 1966 and the nercent who left the

 longest lob of 1966 were higher for black than white women on averaee.

 The samnle of blacks in the SEO was substantially drawn hy oversarrnlinp

 low income areas. Women, as well as men, in low income areas may have

low incomes because of histories of intermittent or little particination

in the labor force. In addition, welfare may he a feasible alternative

form of "employment" for lower income blacks, leadinp to a ereater num-

ber of trips in and out of the market. Because of the nature of this

sample, we expect the model to he less useful in expiainin occupational

wages of nonwhites.

     Regressions identical in structure to those estimated on the white

sample were estimated for black males and females, over sixty occunations.

Toint GLS results are presented in Tables 19 and 20; OLS regression re—

suits are r,resented in the Appendix.

Turnover

     We exnect to find turnover a less important factor in exolaining the

wages of black males and females than white because of the smaller invest-

ment in human capital undertaken by blacks than whites. Tn fact, we find

the coefficients on both FTR1, FVAR and MTR1, MVAR to be similar to those

in the white female equation. The selection of occunations for the samle

is constrained by the requirement of finding both men and women in the

occupation. Because of the occupational concentration of women, the

sample is biased toward "feminine" occupations. The constraint was more

limiting in the case of blacks than whites, restricting the black samnle

to only 60 occupations. The "feminine" bias of the occunations, there-

fore, may he responsible for the close similarity of both the black male

and female equations to the white female -equations.

Training

     The nartial effect of training on female and male wage is presented

in Table 21. Higher levels of investment across occupations, as measured

by DWAGE, seem to imply lower wages for both black men and black women.

This result is contrary to the implications of the model and to the results

found for whites. However, blacks comprise a small fraction of the labor

force. The negative effect of PWAGE may, to some extent, canture substitu-

tion effects not between black men and women, hut between blacks as a groun

and whites as a group. Apparently, the fall in demand for blacks relative

to whites, because of higher training, has a stronger effect on black males

than black females, implying a rise in demand for black females relative to

black males.

     As was expected, the combined effect of training and turnover explains

a smaller proportion of the relative wage differential for blacks than whites.

Both point estimates of this effect are smaller in Table 22 than the comnara—

ble estimates for whites, presented in Table 12.

Discrimination

     In section II of this chapter, the nroportionate increase in earnings

due to education estimated in the regressions did not differ for white

males and females,    providing evidence to counter allegations of increas-

ing discrimination with increasing education. in the black sample, however,

the measured proportionate Increase in wage for additional years of schooling

is significantly higher for women than men, perhaps implying reverse sex

discrimination among blacks. More likely, it reflects the sharp difference

in occupational distribution between younger, more educated black women

and older-, less educated black women.

                  The Specific Human Capital Model:
               An Additional Test of Its Implications
        for Wages and Occupational flistrihution of Black Men
                         Relative to White M


    Although the specific human capital model developed in Chapter 2 Is
formulated in terms of males and females, it is clear that the model can

he applied to any two groups who differ tn labor force turnover behavior.

In this chapter, we emnlov the model. to explain tho wages and occupational

distribution of black men relative to white mon. The behavior of women is

characterized by their unique role in the household. This is not true of

black men; nevertheless, they do show higher turnover rates than white men
                                                      23
and somewhat lower labor force participation rates.

     ble 7 of Chapter 3 reveals that differences in job tenure are smaller

between black and white men than between white men and women.   Smaller dif—

ferences in labor force behavior necessarily imply smaller differences in

investment behavior, ceteris parihus. Therefore, although we expect re—

suits in this chapter qualitatively similar to those of chapter 3, the model

should explain a smaller proportion of the race—differential in wages than

the sex differential.

     Regressions were run on the log of wages of black and white males,

identical in structure to those run for white males and females in Chapter

      23The Statistical Abstract of the United States,1 2 shows the labor
 force participation rates of white males to he 80.47, 79.7%, and 79.2% for
                                               compared to 77.4%. 74.7%, and
 the years 1960, 1970, and 1971 respectively,
 73.2% for black males. These figures are taken from Table 341, Section 8,

Turnover

     The coefficients on the turnover variables in the black and white

male eauations of Tables 24 and 25 behave in the same manner as they did

in the white male—female equations. The coefficient of loeof hours does

not differ significantly from unity in any of the eauations for either

blacks or whites. Log of hours Is a measure at a particular point in time,

the week nrior to the interview. Therefore, Its insignificance as a turn-

over variable for wages, which reflect long—run patterns of behavior, is

not surprising.

     The disnarjty between the coefficients of the percent who left the

longest job of 1966 found in the male—female equations is   not   found in the

euatjons for blacks and whites. An Increase, of one percent in BTR.1 has

an effect on LBWA(E comparable in magnitude and statistical significance

to the effect of a one Percent increase in TR1 on L17JA(E. Although the

negative coefficinets are consistently stronger in the black enuations

than the white equations, the difference is not statistically sienificant.

The significant negative coefficient of TRi is surprising, since it was

not found in the smaller sample of occupations used for the white male—

female equations. Nevertheless, it is not ip'onsistent with interpreting

WTR1 and BTR1 as measures of voluntary intra—lahor force mohilit. Chang-

ing jobs may be a means of acquiring more training; individuals move from

jobs with smaller investment opportunities to jobs offering greater in-

vestment possibilities. The immediate effect on wage of entering a new

job may he negative, since the new worker bns entered,a training period

in which he is financing part of the investment through a iqwer wage.

     Variance of weeks worked by workers In an occupation reflects
exogenous mobility for males, who have characteristically hih labor

force narticination rates. Althoucxh neatfve and significant                  in   the

white   ecuations, the effect of variance of weeks worked on log of hiacir

wage is positive and non—significant. The difference in costliness of

exogenous mohilftv for black and white men imnifes different amounts of

investment, consistent with the results found for white males and females.

        Also consistent with results of the analysts o wares of white males

and females, is the difference between the coefficients of PTB and FTW.

The nercent of workers who worke.d full.time hours when they worked in l9E

is a measure of nast attachment to the labor force. Althouc'h nositive

and significant for both blacks and whites, the coefficient of FTB on

LBWAr,E is between .76 and .83 that of FW and LWPAr,E. This difference is

consistent with the hypothesis that because of their lower turnover,

white men both invest more in themselves and have more invested in them

by employers. The stronger the nrevious attachment of either blacks or

whites, as measured by TB and FTW, the greater the stock of nreviouslv

acauired human capital. We find this effect to he smaller for black men

than white men, lust as it was smaller for white women than white men;

the implicit addition to capital stock resulting from stronger nast attach-

ment to the labor force is smaller both for black men and for white women

than for white men. However, because of the smaller difference tn labor

Force behavior between black and white men than between white men and

women, the difference between these coefficients is also smaller for the

black—white samnie than for the male—female sarinie.                 If je were to accept

the ratio of the black to white coefficients as the ratio of their total

average stock of human capital, both snecific and general, the total human

capital. investment of black men relative to white men would be ahout .8.

This same ratio 'as found to he about .5 for females relative to males.

Training

      Table 26 presents the effect of DWAGE on log of black and whfte

wage when the turnover varil-'ies are evaluated at the mean. The values

in the third column of Table 26. measuring the affect of training on

relative wage of hacks to whites, are smaller than the comparable viues

for white females and males nresented in Table 11. This result is consis-

tent with the implications of the model, since smaller differences in turn-

over imnly a smaller di ferentinl effect on wages of diferences in trainin

across occunations. A difference of $.lO ner hour ner year in the exoerience—

wage slope implies a difference in relative wage of blacks to whites of about

4%.

      The combined effect of training and turnover on relative wage at the

mean is measured in Table 27. Between 7.73 and 10.83 percentage noints

of the mean relative wage can be explained by the joint existence of train-

ing and race differences in turnover rates, dependinp on whether the black

or white values of the turnover variables are used. Tn absolute terms,

training and turnover have a smaller effect on the relative wage of blacks

to whites than on the relative wage of females to males. In terms of the

wage differential, 15.31% at the mean for blacks, training and turnover

jointly exnlain between 50% and 70%. Although pronortionately smaller

than the explanatory effect of training and turnover for the relative

wage differential of females, this is not a small effect. These are again

point estimates with no associated confidence intervals. }1owever, they

attest the empirical importance of training and turnover for relative wage

of blacks.

white man, however, no household division of labor exists to provide

behavioral reasons for market differentials. Clearly, racial discriniina—

tion is one factor which may affect the relative wage differential of

black men. One indicator of discrimination against black men would he a

lower proportionate increase in earnings associated with education for

blacks than whites. This is not apparent from the regression results

presented in Tables 24 and 75.   Tn none ef these equations is the co-

efficient on education significantly higher for whites than blacks.

Therefore widening earnings differentials between black and white men

with increasing education, to the extent they exist,       must he Attn.—

buted to differences in post—school investment. Tn addition, there is

no evidence that blacks compensate for discriminat:fon by being better

educated than their white counterparts; the average education of blacks

is .5 years lower than whites across occupations.

II. TheOc cupatfonal Di stribut ion

     The specific human capital model developed in Chapter 2 implies that

relative wages, turnover, and investment are optimally decided independent—

lv of the number of blacks and whites hired. Civen these optimal values,

the proportion of blacks and whites hired would he determined by their

relative turnover rates and by   ,   the   importance of training in production.

We expect to find a negative relationship between volume of specific in-

vestment and relative number of blacks, across occupations. Joint GLS

estimates of the occupational distribution equations are presented in

Tables 28 and 29; OLS estimates appear in the appendix. Independent van'-

ables in the equations are identical to those of'the wage equations. The

turnover and training variables appear to have no effect on black employ—

tnent across occupations in the equations presented in Table 28, with the

exception   of VAR, which has a positive effect. Presumably the positive
coefficient on BTAR represents self—selection by black men to occupations

in which variation in participation is less costly. In the white e(lua—

tions, both current attachment to the labor force, measured by hours

worked, and nrevious attachment, measured by the nercent who worked full—

time hours in 1966, have a positive and sienificant effect on employment

across occupations. Variance in weeks worked, although insignificant in

its linear form, has a significant necative interactive effect with train—

ing. The economic effect of training on relative number of blacks to

whites across occupations is presented in Table 30.

     In equilibrium, optimal wage differentials set by firms compensate

employers for higher losses due to the higher turnover of blacks. Eecause

the occupational distribution equations of Tables 28 and 29 do not control

for the wage differential, we suspect that they are misspectfied. Tn

Tables 31 and 32, loint flLS estimates of an alterrative specification of

the occupational distribution equations are presented. Log of the number

hired is run as a function of training and turnover variables, of T)TFF, the

predicted relative wage, and of BHAT or AT, the predicted log of black

or white wage. Two State Least Squares estimates annear in the appendix.

     Including the compensating wage differential in the eouation strength-

ens the effect of training and turnover on the black wage, although only

BTB1 ever approaches statistical significance. The coefficient on DIFF,

the predicted relative wage of blacks is significant as exnected, negative

in the black equation and positive in the white equations. 1-Tolding constant

turnover and training, a one percent increase in relative wage of blacks

across occupations implies an increase in white employment of 2.14% and a

decrease in black employment of 1.5%, or a fall in relative number of

blacks employed of about 3.64%.

     The empirical results of this chanter show the impact of tra1.nin and

turnover on the relative wage of blacks and relative number employed to he

strong and significant. ecaue of the smaller differences in turnover be-

havior between black and white males than between white males and females,

the joint effect of training and differences in turnover was found to ex-

plain a smaller pronortion of the race differential in wages than the sex

differential. In addition, when the compensating wage differential was in-

cluded in the occupational ditributjon equations, the average effect of a

wage profile on the relative number of black men employed was l.93% as corn—

                           Suiinnary and Conclusions


       The dramatic change in labor force activity of women during the

post   war period has brought into sharp relief the different natterns
of emnlovment and compensation existing between men and women in the
American labor market. Tn the nast decade, economists have turned

their attention to this problem, focusing nrimarilv on identifying and

measuring discrimination as the dominant force behind these differences.

More recently, Jacob Mincer and Solomon Polachek have investigated the

relationship between Individual investments in human canttal and sex

differences in earnings, establishing a clear and strong argument that

more than fifty percent of the existing differences in earnings may he

caused by sex differences in self—investment.

       In this paner, I pursue the human capital argument by analyzing the

effect of differences in male and female labor force behavior on the firm's

incentive   to invest in workers. The model developed utilizes two assump-

tions: 1) The firm invests in the training of its workers: hence employee

turnover represents depreciation on human capital, and 2) the firm can affect

the turnover rate of its emnlovees by offering them a wage above the oppor-

tunity wage. Differences in exnected turnover behavior of men and women

are shown to he an important determinant of the incentive to the employer

to hire and train women as well as men. The major implications of the

model are the following:

       1. The joint existence of emnloyer financed training and sex dif-

           ferences in turnover is sufficient tonroduce wage differentials

          between men and women in the absence of any taste for discrimination.

       2. The relative wage of women and ouantitv of trainln invested in
                                                                   92


           them will vary inversely with the volume of specific human canital

          across occupations, holding constant relative turnover rates of

          men and women.

      3. The relative number of women employed will vary inversely with

          the volume of specific human capital investment across occupations,

          holding constant sex differences in turnover behavior.

      4. As the labor force characteristics of
                                                   women approach those of men,

          across occupations and over time, their relative wage and occupa-

          tional distribution will improve.

      Despite data limitations on crucial variahle.s such as true labor force

 experience for women and labor turnover rates for both males and females,

 empirical testing of the model on aggregate occupational data constructed

 from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity confirmed the theoretical

implications of the model. Several proxy variables to capture labor force

turnover behavior were constructed: variance in weeks worked in 1966 by

men and women in a given occupation, percent of males and females in an

occupation whose current lob is not the same as the longest lob held in

1966, and percent of males and females who worked 35 hours or more per

week when employed in 1966. A measure of the volume of on—the—lob training

across occupations was constructed from the exnerience—wage profile of

white males within occupations: the differen in average hourly wage

between those in each occupation with ten to twenty years of experience

and those with zero to ten years of experience.     Tnvestment in on—the—lob

training is presumed to he concentrated early in the experience history:

therefore this measure captures the difference between the average wage

earl.v in employment, when investment is rresnmah1y being financed, and a

later wage which includes returns to investment.    Malor emoirical findings

of the analysis are the- following:
     1. Holding constant turnover rates of males and females, a dif-

     ference between two occupations of .l0      per   hour per year in the

     slore of the experience—wage profile, equivalent to a difference

     of $200.00 per year per year in the exnerience—earnings profile,

     at 2000 full time hours per year, implies an inverse difference

     of 6.3 percent in the relative wage of women and 27.84 percent

     in the relative number of women employed.

    2. At the mean, training and sex differences in turnover combine

    to explain between 45.10 percent and 102.44 percent of the relative

    wage differential of women. Although these are noint estimates, with

    no associated confidence intervals, there is strong reason to susnect

    the lower number to he an underestimate: as the labor force behavior

    of women truly arproached that of men, the coefficients of the female

    earnings function would also approach those of the male earnings

    function. Given differences in behavior, women act in such a way

    that their own higher turnover is less costly to then. Therefore,

    in askin   the question: 'That   would the wage of females he at

    arbitrarily   lower turnover rates?', we   car   only obtain an   under-

    estimate. The greater the difference between the value of turnover

    we nroose and the mean value for females, the more severe is the

    underestimate.

    As an additional test, the model was emnloyed to explain the earnings

and employment of black males relative to white males. Although formulated

in terms of males and females, it is clear that the model should apply to

any two groups who differ in labor force turnover behavior. Because of the

smaller differences in turnover characteristics between black and white men

than between white men and women, we expect training to have a smaller effect

n relative wage of black men and relative number enrnloyed. The emnirical
                                                                         94


 findings of this analysis were:
           1.    Holding constant turnover rates of black and white men

          across occunations, a difference between two occunations of

          $.l0    ner   hour per year in the slope of the. experience—wage

          nrofile, eoulvalent to $200       ner year per year   in th.e experience—

          earnings      profile, implies   an Inverse difference of 3.98 percent

          in    the relative wage of black men and 16.93 percent in the rela-

          tive number o black men employed. oth these effects are smaller

          than those observed for white women.

          2. Training and differences in turnover behavior between black

          and white men combine to explain between fifty and seventy ner—

          cent of the relative wage differential of black men.

        In addition to measuring the effects of training and differences in

turnover on wages and employment, an attemnt was made to discern the

effect of discrimination on wages of white women relative to white men

and of black men relative to white men. One indicator of discrimination

against women, or against blacks, would he a lower proportionate increase

in earnings associated with increases in education for them than for

white men. However, in none of the eouations presented in Tables 8 and

9 for white men and women and in Tables 23 and 24 for black and white.

men, does the coefficient on education differ significantly between

sexes or races. Therefore, there is no evidence of increasing discrim-

ination against women or against blacks with increasing education.

Widening    earnings differentials with       increasing education, to the ex-

tent that they exist, must he attributed to differences in post school

investment. Tn addition, neither women nor black men appear to com—

nensate for discrimination by being better educated than white           men,
since   the average education of white men Is higher than that of black
men and not significantly different from that of white women, acros
