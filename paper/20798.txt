                                         ABSTRACT

We measure the persuasive effects of slanted news and tastes for like-minded news, exploiting
cable channel positions as exogenous shifters of cable news viewership. Channel positions do not
correlate with demographics that predict viewership and voting, nor with local satellite
viewership. We estimate that Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among
viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position. We then
estimate a model of voters who select into watching slanted news, and whose ideologies evolve
as a result. We quantitatively assess media-driven polarization, and simulate alternative
ideological slanting of news channels.

           We measure the persuasive effects of slanted news and tastes for like-minded news, exploit-
       ing cable channel positions as exogenous shifters of cable news viewership. Channel positions
       do not correlate with demographics that predict viewership and voting, nor with local satellite
       viewership. We estimate that Fox News increases Republican vote shares by 0.3 points among
       viewers induced into watching 2.5 additional minutes per week by variation in position. We
       then estimate a model of voters who select into watching slanted news, and whose ideologies
       evolve as a result. We quantitatively assess media-driven polarization, and simulate alternative
       ideological slanting of news channels.




       1     Introduction
       The 24-hour cable news channels - CNN, the Fox News Channel, and MSNBC - are frequent
       targets of allegations of media bias. In this paper, we address two questions about cable
       news. First, how much does consuming slanted news, like the Fox News Channel, alter the
       propensity of an individual to vote Republican in Presidential elections, if at all? Second, how

                                                       1
       intense are consumer preferences for cable news that is slanted towards their own ideology?
       After measuring these forces, we ask: how much could slanted news contribute to increases
       in polarization? And, what do these forces imply for the optimal positioning of channels that
       wish to maximize viewership, or alternatively to maximize influence?
          The answers to these questions are key inputs for designing optimal public policy, such
       as merger policy, for the media sector which has attracted blame for the rise in polarization
       in the US (Gentzkow, 2016). If consumers simply prefer news that resonates with their pre-
       existing ideology, as in Mullainathan and Shleifer (2005) and Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010),
       then the news media sector should be treated like any other consumer product. However, if
       consuming news with a slant also alters the consumer’s political behavior, as in DellaVigna
       and Kaplan (2007), then the existence of slanted news could lead to a polarizing feedback
       loop: an “echo chamber” where partisans can reinforce and strengthen their initial biases.1
       Furthermore, an interested party could influence the political process by controlling media
       outlets as in Prat (2014).2 Such concerns led the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
       to condition approval of the merger of Comcast Corporation and NBC Universal in 2010 on
       the requirement that Comcast take steps to promote independent news services.3
          We propose a new instrument for exposure to media bias to complement estimates based
       on availability such as DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007): the channel positions of news channels
       in cable television lineups. We estimate that watching the Fox News Channel for 2.5 additional
       minutes per week4 increases the vote share of the Republican presidential candidate by 0.3
       percentage points among voters induced into watching by variation in channel position. The
       corresponding effect of watching MSNBC for 2.5 additional minutes per week is an imprecise
       zero.
          As with any instrumental variables design, it is critical that the channel positions for
       Fox News and MSNBC are not chosen to accord with local political tastes. Empirically,
       we show that Fox News channel position does not predict pre-Fox News political outcomes,
   1
     Gentzkow and Shapiro (2008) detail the complexities in designing optimal regulatory policy for media markets.
Gentzkow and Shapiro (2011) indicate that media consumption tends to be balanced across slanted sources.
   2
     Existing evidence from Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) shows that owner partisanship is not an important deter-
minant of newspaper slant. The sample size is too small to test this hypothesis in the cable news case.

     The condition required that Comcast move “independent” news channels such as Bloomberg Television into
“news neighborhoods.” This effectively required Comcast to move Bloomberg next to channels such as MSNBC
and CNN in their channel lineups. The FCC justified the condition “in accordance with the special importance of
news programming to the public interest,” and did not place any such conditions on non-news programming. See
https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-11-4A1.pdf, paragraph 122.

     2.5 minutes per week is the approximate additional time spent watching Fox News associated with a one-standard-
deviation decrease in Fox News channel position.

including 1996 county level Republican voting and 1996 political contributions to Republican
candidates. Fox News cable positions are also not negatively correlated with the predictable-
from-demographics component of either Republican voting or Fox News viewership. In other
words, in areas where demographics would predict the Republican vote share to be high,
Fox News is not systematically in lower channel positions. And in areas where demographics
would predict Fox News viewership to be high, Fox News is not systematically in lower channel
positions. Furthermore, Fox News cable channel position does not predict local viewership of
Fox News by satellite subscribers in the same zip code who see a different, nationwide channel
lineup.
   Our approach to quantifying the preference for like-minded news adapts the method of
Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), who estimate this quantity in the context of newspapers. We
measure the relationship between changes in a text-based slant measure over time and the char-
acteristics of viewers of these channels. A key source of variation in this exercise is MSNBC’s
change in business strategy towards offering more liberal content. Our ideology estimates pick
up this format switch - MSNBC closely tracks CNN in the early 2000s, but then moves left
following the format switch in 2006. We estimate that Fox News’ ideology has been moving
further to the right in the most recent years.
   We combine the analysis of the influence of slanted news with the demand for slanted
news in a structural model that enables the quantification of polarization dynamics and media
power. The model features consumer-voters who choose how much time to spend watching the
cable news channels; whether to subscribe to cable, satellite or no pay television service; and
for whom to vote in presidential elections. Consumers’ allocation of time to television channels
is governed by their preferences for the channels (which are a function of their ideology, the
channels’ ideologies, and their demographics), and the availability of the channels (whether
the cable operator carries them and, if so, the positions they occupy on the channel lineup).
Consumers’ ideologies evolve from their initial position depending on how much time they
allocate to watching channels of different ideologies. This process culminates in a presidential
election in which consumers choose for whom to vote.
   We estimate the parameters of the model by simulated indirect inference. The criterion
function is the distance between two-stage least squares estimates of voting on demographics
and minutes watched of each channel, using channel positions as instrumental variables, in
the actual data and in data simulated from the model. In addition to matching the second
stage regression coefficients, we also match the first stage (viewership equation) regression
coefficients and the OLS regression coefficients.


                                                 3
          We use the estimated model to quantitatively assess the degree of ideological polarization
       induced by cable news, the effect of the entry of Fox News prior to the year 2000 election, and
       the level of “media power” (Prat, 2014) possessed by each of the news channels individually
       as well as a hypothetical conglomerate under unified ownership. We find that cable news does
       increase polarization among the viewing public, although the magnitude of this increase is
       modest. Furthermore, the increase in polarization depends critically on the existence of both
       a persuasive effect and a taste for like-minded news. We estimate that removing Fox News
       from cable television during the 2000 election cycle would have reduced the overall Republican
       presidential vote share by 0.46 percentage points. Finally, we find that the cable news channels’
       potential for influence on election outcomes is large, and would be substantially larger were
       ownership to become more concentrated.
          This paper contributes to the empirical literature on the relationship of news media to
       political outcomes.5 The closest papers to this study are by DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007)
       and Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010).
          DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) study the effects of Fox News by comparing vote shares in
       locations with and without cable access to Fox News by November 2000. Our contributions
       to this strand of the literature are to introduce a new identification strategy based on channel
       positions, and to update their availability based estimates using more accurate data from
       Nielsen on Fox News availability.6 Channel position variation allows a researcher to examine
       the effects of cable news in later years where there is negligible variation in availability of these
       channels, and could be useful for studying the effects of media consumption in other contexts.
       In terms of results, we estimate a Fox News effect that is statistically positive and quantitatively
       large as in the DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) analysis. Indeed, our estimated counterfactual
       effect of removing Fox News on the change in year 2000 election Republican vote share is 0.46
       percentage points, which resonates well with the DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007), updated with
       more accurate availability data, estimated range of 0.26 to 0.36 percentage points.
   5
      A number of papers have demonstrated that media usage or availability affects behavior. Amongst others,
Chiang and Knight (2011) find positive effects of unexpected newspaper endorsements on vote shares for the endorsed
candidate, Gentzkow (2006) finds decreased voter turnout from television access, Gerber et al. (2009) find positive
effects of newspaper exposure, regardless of slant, on Democratic vote shares in the 2005 Virginia gubernatorial
elections. Enikolopov et al. (2011) find that viewing an independent news channel in Russia increased vote shares for
the opposition parties and decreased overall turnout in 1999. Lim et al. (2014) find that media coverage can affect
criminal sentencing decisions for judges.
    6
      In Appendix C, we document that Fox News availability in DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) is measured with
error. Nearly 40% of the “control group,” the locations that they consider as not having cable access to Fox News
in 2000, did in fact have cable access to Fox News. 25% of the control group had Fox News availability since 1998.



                                                         4
           Our approach follows Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) in several dimensions, including the
       use of text analysis to measure media outlets’ slant. Like Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010), we
       treat ideological slant as a characteristic over which consumers have heterogeneous tastes when
       choosing media consumption levels. Our contribution is to model media consumption together
       with voting, to separately measure tastes for like-minded news and the influence of slanted
       media consumption on consumer ideology. The influence effect also interacts with the existence
       of tastes for like-minded news. Consumers for whom both effects are present can be induced
       into a feedback loop in which they consume slanted media, their ideologies then evolve in the
       direction of the slant, their taste for that slanted media increases, and so on. In this sense,
       this paper combines the literature on the persuasive effects of the media with the literature
       on self-selection into consumption of slanted media to explore media-driven polarization and
       to counterfactually simulate alternative ideological slant strategies by the cable news outlets.



       2      Institutional Overview
       During our study period of 1998-2008, most households had three options for television service:
       a wire-based cable package, a satellite package, or over-the-air broadcast signals.7 In 2000,
       most pay television subscribers were cable subscribers, but by 2008, satellite providers had a
       market share of about 30%. The set of channels on cable varies both across providers and
       within providers across locations. Each of the two nationwide satellite providers, DirecTV and
       the Dish Network, has their own packages and lineups that are common to all locations. Cable
       content is produced by media conglomerates such as Viacom, News Corporation, ABC-Disney,
       or NBC Universal. The cable and satellite providers contract with these firms to offer their
       content to subscribers.
           The foci of this study are the cable news channels. CNN began broadcasting in 1980 as
       one of the earliest cable channels of any genre. The Fox News Channel (FNC) and MSNBC
       both entered the market in the mid 1990’s. FNC’s business strategy from conception was to
       provide news with a more conservative slant. FNC is now one of the most highly rated cable
       channels across all genres. MSNBC began as a joint venture between NBC and Microsoft. At
       the outset, MSNBC did not have any explicit slant. MSNBC changed its business strategy in
   7
    Some households, for example households in remote rural areas, did not have a cable option. Some households
which did not have a direct line of sight due to physical obstructions like tall buildings, trees, or steep slopes, did not
have a satellite option. And some households, mostly in urban areas, had two wire-based cable operators. In 2004
about 85% of US zip codes, accounting for about 67% of the total population, were served by a single monopolist
wire-based cable operator.

       the mid-2000’s to provide news with a more liberal slant, as detailed in Sanneh (2013).
          The channel lineup, or the numerical ordering of channels, that cable subscribers encounter
       varies by local cable system. The first channel positions are generally allocated to over-the-
       air broadcast affiliates: for example, NBC4 occupies position four in the Washington D.C.
       area. After the over-the-air channels, the cable channels begin. We assert in this paper that
       the ordering of a channel in the lineup can have significant effects on the viewership of news
       channels (though the significant relationship between channel position and viewership holds
       for all genres, not just news).
          Figure 1 plots the relationship between the residual component of ratings - the portion
       that is not explained by viewer demographics and channel-specific state-year fixed effects -
       and channel position for a set of 34 channels, including both the news channels and other
       channels that tend to occupy similar positions in cable lineups. There is a clear negative, and
       very nearly linear, relationship between position and ratings over the range of positions which
       the news channels typically occupy. Table A28 in Appendix G documents the own-position
       coefficients on ratings for each of these channels; all are negative and almost all are statistically
       significant.
          The obvious empirical concern is that a channel might be placed in lower positions in
       localities with high tastes for the channel. We later examine and reject that concern empirically
       in a variety of ways. Describing the process by which channel positions were determined
       provides additional support for the claim that channel positions are valid instruments.
          The mid-1990’s, during which FNC and MSNBC were rolling out, was a tumultuous time
       for the cable industry. This period saw many systems upgrade from analog to digital equip-
       ment, expanding the number of channels cable operators were able to offer. Coincident with
       this technical advance, a wave of new channels entered cable lineups alongside first-generation
       channels like CNN, ESPN, and HBO. New channels were often allocated positions sequentially,
       in the order in which they joined a system.8 As a result, the channel positioning of FNC or
       MSNBC on a given local system depended on the timing of that system’s bilateral negoti-
       ations with multiple new channels as well as its decision of when to upgrade. On capacity
       constrained systems owned by the multiple-system operator TCI in 1996, FNC was reported
       to have replaced one of as many as twelve different channels (Dempsey (1996)). Combined
       with the desire to limit changes in positions so as to not confuse customers, these chaotic
   8
    In Appendix G, we show that channel positions correlate with the best available position in the year before a
channel was added.

Figure 1: The top panel shows the relationship between the residual component of minutes watched and channel
position, in a set of 34 comparable cable channels whose median positions across cable system-years are between 30
and 60 and thus typically occupy similar positions to FNC and MSNBC. Residuals are constructed by regressing
minutes watched per week (in the MediaMark individual-level dataset) on the full set of individual demographics plus
state-year fixed effects. The predicting regressions are estimated separately for each channel, such that demographic
effects and state-specific time trends are allowed to vary by channel. The points in the figure are averages of these
residual minutes across all channels located at a given ordinal position. The blue line is the least-squares fit. The
bottom panel shows the density of the three news channels’ ordinal positions across system-years for comparison.


                                    factors generated persistent cross-system variation in the positioning of FNC and MSNBC.9

                                    We use nine categories of data sets: (1) Nielsen FOCUS data on cable channel lineups by zip
                                    code by year, (2) precinct-level voting data from the 2008 Presidential election, (3) individual
                                    survey data on intent to vote Republican in 2000, 2004, and 2008 U.S. Presidential elections,
                                    (4) Nielsen viewership data at the zip code level for the cable news channels from 2005 to
                                    2008, (5) individual survey data on cable news viewership for 2000 to 2008, (6) County level
    9
      Some systems have shuffled positions over time as channels went out of business, as channel capacity expanded
and as new channels came online. Some local managers pursued a strategy of moving channels with similar content or
in the same genre together into “neighborhoods,” when possible. In general, however, the ordering of cable channels
is highly persistent from year to year: the autoregressive coefficient in a regression of channel position in year t on
channel position on the same system in year t − 1 ranges from 0.94 (MSNBC) to 0.97 (CNN).



                                                                                                                                                                  7
      presidential election vote share data, (7) U.S. Census demographics by zip code, 1996 political
      donation data by zip code from the Federal Elections Commissions, and the 2010 religious
      adherence data by county from the Religious Congregations and Membership Study (RCMS),
      (8) Broadcast transcripts of cable news from Lexis-Nexis, and (9) the Congressional Record.
      In Appendix A, we provide details on how we cleaned and joined the data sets.

      Cable Lineups: Nielsen FOCUS The Nielsen FOCUS database consists of yearly
      observations of cable systems. The key variables in this data set are, for each system and
      year, the availability of CNN, FNC, and MSNBC, the channel positions of CNN, FNC, and
      MSNBC, when available, and the zip codes served by the system. In Figure 2, we document
      the availability of each of these news channels by year. CNN was already near-universal by
      1998; FNC and MSNBC expanded over the early part of the sample period, reaching the vast
      majority of cable subscribers by 2002.




Figure 2: Availability of cable news channels by year. The solid lines represent the fraction of cable subscribers for
whom the news channel was carried on their system. The dashed lines represent the fraction of cable systems which
carry the news channels. By 2002, nearly all cable subscribers had access to FNC and MSNBC.



      Zip Code Level Voting Data and Demographics We use the “Precinct-Level Elec-
      tion Data” from Ansolabehere et al. (2014) which provides votes cast in the 2008 Presidential
      election for each party, by voting precinct. We aggregate these precinct-level totals up to the
      zip code level, and compute the two party vote share for each zip code. We combine these with
      demographic data from the US Census for 2010. These data are summarized in Appendix B,
      Table A1.


                                                          8
Individual Voting Data: NAES and CCES The National Annenberg Election Study
(NAES) is a large-scale phone survey conducted each presidential election cycle. We use data
from the 2000, 2004, and 2008 election cycles, including the confidential zip code field. The
key variables are demographic variables such as race, age, and income; zip code; and actual or
intent to vote in the current presidential election. These data are summarized in Appendix B,
Table A2. For 2008, we add data from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES)
on the same variables that we use from the NAES. In all years, NAES / CCES individuals
were matched to their corresponding news channel availability and positioning using their zip
code of residence to identify their local cable provider in the Nielsen FOCUS data.

Zip Level Viewership Data: Nielsen Nielsen measures television viewership from a
rotating panel of households. We acquired zip code level ratings for CNN, FNC, and MSNBC
from the Nielsen Local TV (NLTV) database for the years 2005 through 2008. The Nielsen
data also report viewership conditional on being a cable subscriber and conditional on being
a satellite subscriber. The measurements come in the units of rating points which indicate
what fraction of persons were tuned in to each channel in a given time period. We convert
to average hours per week by multiplying the rating by 168. These data are summarized in
Appendix B, Table A3.

Individual Viewership Data: Mediamark and Simmons Mediamark and Sim-
mons are two commercial data vendors who survey individuals on their usage of different
brands, including media usage. We use Mediamark for 2000 to 2007, and Simmons for 2008.
The key variables for our study are year, zip code, individual demographics, whether the re-
spondent subscribes to cable, satellite, or neither, and the reported number of hours watched
per week of CNN, FNC, and MSNBC. These data are summarized in Appendix B, Table A4.

County Level Vote Shares and Demographics We use county level presidential vote
shares for the Presidential election in 1996 from the Voting and Elections Collection Database
maintained by Congressional Quarterly. We also use zip code level demographic statistics from
the 2000 US Census. We construct county-level distributions of household income, age, race,
education, and initial ideology, for use in the model in section 5. We also use this data to
condition on the pre-Fox News county level Republican vote share in some of our regression
specifications.

       Broadcast Transcripts and Congressional Record To quantify the slant of each
       news channel in each year, we follow Groseclose and Milyo (2005) and Gentzkow and Shapiro
       (2010) in comparing the language that the channels use to language that Congresspeople use.
       This procedure does not recognize satire, sub-text, nor tone, and thus likely underestimates
       the dispersion in slant among the slanted outlets.10 We obtained broadcast transcripts for
       CNN, FNC, and MSNBC from the Lexis-Nexis database for the sample period 1998-2012 by
       downloading all transcripts per year for each identifiable cable news program from each of the
       three channels. Appendix E details the procedure we employ.
          Each Congressperson has a measure of their ideology, derived from roll-call votes: the DW-
       NOMINATE score of McCarty et al. (1997), which places each Congressperson on the interval
       [−1, 1]. More positive scores correspond to more conservative legislators. There are many more
       two word phrases than Congresspeople, and an ordinary least squares criterion is therefore
       useless. For each year, we run an Elastic Net (Zou and Hastie, 2005) regularized regression of
       DW-NOMINATE score of frequency of phrase usage where an observation is a Congressperson.
       Table 1 shows the most partisan phrases selected by the Elastic Net regression.
          We use the estimated coefficients to predict the DW-NOMINATE score for each cable
       news channel in each year. We then apply a three period moving average smoothing filter.
       The results are in Figure 3. FNC is consistently more conservative than the other two channels.
       However, these differences are small compared to differences between Congressmen during the
       early years. Groseclose and Milyo (2005) find that the difference between CNN and FNC
       in their sample is about 20% of the difference between the average Democrat and average
       Republican. MSNBC closely tracks CNN initially, and then becomes consistently more liberal
       - though by much less than the gap between CNN and FNC - in the mid-2000’s. The estimates
       also reveal increased polarization of cable news over time. The text based measures produce
       estimated ideologies for the channels that are more moderate than the median members of
       each party. In the modelling to come, we allow for consumers to perceive these news channels
       to be more or less ideologically differentiated, in proportion to these estimates. Indeed, our
       estimates for this scale factor put FNC very close to the median Republican Congress member.

    This is one reason why we exclude Comedy Central, which featured two prominent slanted cable news programs,
The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and The Colbert Report, from the analysis. Their slant relies heavily on satire
and is not as reasonably quantified based on phrase usage. As a separate matter, Comedy Central has other highly
viewed shows which are not explicitly political such as South Park, and our data are aggregated to the channel level.

channels based on phrase usage as described in the text. As we use an elastic net variable selection scheme, standard
errors are not available.

       4     Regression Analysis
       This sections presents the relationship between cable channel positions, watching FNC, and
       voting for Republican presidential candidates. These results underlie the model estimation
       and simulation in later sections. However, the results here do not depend on that model, and
       can be read as a stand-alone instrumental variables regression analysis.

       First Stage: Viewership and Channel Position The first stage describes how cable
       news viewers’ time watched vary with channel position. The idea is that lower channel positions
       induce more viewership for channels such as FNC because the more popular channels tend to
       be in lower positions, for historical reasons.11 Consider a viewer who just finished watching a
       television program, and begins to search for a new program. Their search will begin from the
       channel they were watching, which is likely to be in a low position. They are more likely to
       stop nearer to the original channel than further away.12
           Table 2 presents first stage estimates of Nielsen-measured FNC viewership on the position
       of FNC. This set of viewership data spans all states and the years 2005 to 2008. The estimating
       equations for a news channel c take the form:

                     hczt = δct + azct + αc xzt + ζc,F N C pFztN C + ζc,M SN BC pM
                                                                                 zt
                                                                                    SN BC
                                                                                          + H
                                                                                             zct              (1)

           where hczt is the average minutes watched per week of all Nielsen households13 in zip code
       z in year t; δct are channel fixed effects, which are allowed to vary by year, state-year, or
       county-year depending on the specification; pjzt is the cable channel position of channel j in zip
       code z in year t; xzt are average demographic characteristics of zip code z; and azct are dummy
       variables for cable availability of the cable news channels in zip code z in year t. We weight
       the observations by the number of Nielsen respondents in the zip code-year. This weighting
       improves efficiency as the variance of the left hand side ratings estimate is decreasing in the
  11
      In addition to the broadcast networks ABC, CBS, Fox, and NBC, the lower channel positions are generally
occupied by the earliest cable entrants (eg ESPN, MTV, TNT, and USA), which also have high viewership.
   12
      Bias to the top of a list or default option in search is documented in eye tracking studies for yellow pages (Lohse
(1997)) and survey response (Galesic et al. (2008)). There is a theoretical literature in economics modelling such
behavior (see Rubinstein and Salant (2006), Horan (2010), Masatlioglu and Nakajima (2013), and the literature on
status-quo bias more generally.)
   13
      We use time among all households, and not only wired cable subscribers, even though the instrument can only
affect cable subscribers. The reason for this is that the second stage dataset - vote totals - does not allow us to
discriminate between cable and satellite subscribers. The first stage is substantially stronger when estimated on
cable subscribers alone, which can be seen in table 7.



                                                           12
zip code-year sample size. In particular, a handful of zip codes have sample sizes of one and
ratings measurements that are six or more standard deviations from the mean whose relative
importance is reduced when weighting by sample size.
   Table 2 reports specifications with year fixed effects, state-year fixed effects, and county-
year fixed effects and different sets of conditioning variables. The primary covariate of interest
in these regressions - FNC channel position - varies at the level of the cable system, which
may span multiple zip codes. We therefore present cluster-robust standard errors in all spec-
ifications, using cable system as the cluster variable. Our preferred specification is column
(4), which includes state-year fixed effects and an extensive set of demographic covariates that
correlate with Republican voting and residential sorting, including measures of Republican
voting and donations from 1996, effectively before FNC.
   In Column (4), cable positions of both FNC and MSNBC significantly predict viewership of
FNC, in the expected directions. A one standard deviation increase in FNC channel position
predicts a decrease in average viewership of about two and one-half minutes per week. In
Column (6), we use county-year fixed effects and the extensive demographic set. Here, the
coefficient falls in magnitude by about 40%, however it remains significantly different from zero.
The more limited variation induced by the instrument within a county-year is one limitation
of this specifcation. The cluster-robust F statistic for the ordinal FNC position is 39.02 in
the specification with state-year fixed effects and extensive demographics. The effect of cable
access to FNC, as used in DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007), is a large and statistically precise
predictor of FNC viewership.
   Columns (5) and (7) of the table add the minutes per week of FNC viewership among
satellite subscribers in the same zip code. To the extent that satellite and cable subscribers in
the same zip code have similar tastes for the news channels, conditioning on satellite viewership
controls for unobserved variation in taste for FNC which, if it were correlated with channel
position, would bias the estimates of the position effects. Comparing columns (4) with (5) and
(6) with (7) reveals that the position coefficients are essentially unchanged with the addition
of conditioning on same-zip code satellite minutes.
   First stage results with MSNBC viewership on the left-hand side of equation (1) are very
similar, though the direction of coefficients on FNC and MSNBC positions are reversed. The
power of channel positions for predicting MSNBC viewership is also similar. For brevity, we
relegate these results to Appendix F, Table A16. Appendix D, Tables A11 and A17 document
that the same first-stage relationships are also evident in the independently sampled individual-
level viewership dataset.

 ages, and property tax rates; the fraction of the population receiving food stamps; median social security income;
 the fraction of veterans; the fractions of married, unmarried, and same-sex couples; the share of federal campaign
 contributions that went to Republican candidates in 1996; the Republican presidential share of the county in 1996;
 and the religious composition of the county. Observations are weighted by the number of survey individuals in the

Second Stage: Voting and Viewership We begin in Table 3 with the reduced form
for the zip level data. The regressions take the form:

                   yz = γg + az + βxz + ζF N C pFz N C + ζM SN BC pM
                                                                   z
                                                                     SN BC
                                                                           + R
                                                                              z                       (2)

     Where yz is Republican vote share in zip code z, γg are either state or county fixed effects,
az are indicators for availability of the channels, β are coefficients on zip code demographics
and cable system characteristics xz , and pC
                                           z are the ordinal cable channel positions of channel
C in zip code z.
     FNC position is significantly negatively correlated with zip code 2008 Republican vote
share in all specifications which include demographic covariates, although the relationship is
significant only at the 90% level in the specification with both county-year fixed effects and
the extensive demographics.
     The MSNBC position coefficient in the reduced form tables is generally positive but, un-
surprisingly given MSNBC’s substantially lower viewership, much less precise and less robust
across specifications compared to the FNC reduced form. In addition, the ideological estimates
in Figure 3 put MSNBC, even in 2008, at a relatively centrist position compared to FNC. Prior
to 2006, MSNBC is generally to the right of CNN.

     Next, we present zip code-level second stage regression results in Table 4. The regressions

       take the form:

                                                                    + ρf hfz + Vz                            (3)

            Where yz is Republican vote share in zip code z, γg are either state or county fixed effects,
       az are indicators for availability of the channels, and β are coefficients on zip code demographics
       and cable system characteristics xz . We are interested in the coefficient ρf on the zip code’s
       predicted average hours watched per week of FNC, hfz , produced by the first stage from Table
       2.
            We compute standard errors by a bootstrap, as deemed appropriate in two-sample IV
       settings by Inoue and Solon (2010). We use a cluster-robust block bootstrap at the level of
       cable systems to allow for correlation across zip codes and over time within cable systems.14
       Our estimates imply that being induced to watch an additional hour per week of FNC by
       the channel position instrument would lead to an approximately 7.2 point increase in the
       probability of voting Republican in presidential elections for those induced into watching by
       the instrument. However, the magnitude of the variation induced by the instrument is typically
       much less than one hour: a one standard deviation increase in channel position induces a
       roughly 2.5-minute-per-week increase in FNC viewing. The implied change in probability of
       voting for the Republican candidate from a one standard deviation increase in channel position
       is thus -0.3 points. With county fixed effects, the precision of the estimates goes down as the
       confidence intervals widen; however, the point estimates are of a similar magnitude as when
       using state fixed effects. Appendix D, Table A12 reports the second-stage results for the
       individual-level data, which are also very comparable in magnitude though somewhat less
       precise than the zip-level version.
            Within Table 4, the second-stage coefficient is essentially unaffected by the inclusion of the
       extensive demographic set. It declines slightly, but remains positive and significantly different
       from zero, when FNC hours among satellite subscribers in the same zip code are included as
       a covariate. Both of these facts lend some credence to the idea that channel position is not
       simply picking up local variation in unobserved political tastes.15
            The OLS coefficient on FNC hours in Table 5 is significant and positive, as expected, but
  14
      We resample with replacement from the set of cable systems in the data, with independent resamples drawn for
the viewership and the voting data.
   15
      In the specification with satellite hours, the coefficient on satellite hours is negative, a result that may seem
counter-intuitive. The reason for this is that predicted hours are predicted total hours, across both cable and satellite
subscribers. The negative coefficient on satellite hours implies that, holding total FNC hours watched constant, the
effect on vote shares is smaller, the more of those hours that come from satellite.

 The first stage is estimated using viewership data for all Nielsen TV households. See first stage tables for description of instruments and
 control variables. Observations in the first stage are weighted by the number of survey individuals in the zipcode according to Nielsen.
 Confidence intervals are generated from 1000 independent STID-block-bootstraps of the first and second stage datasets. Reported lower
 and upper bounds give the central 95 percent interval of the relevant bootstrapped statistic.



       it is much smaller in magnitude than the corresponding IV coefficients. This is due to at
       least two factors: first, the zip code level viewership levels are estimates based on samples
       leading to attenuated OLS coefficients. Second, as the behavioral model makes clear, we are
       estimating a single coefficient in a world of heterogeneous treatment effects. The IV coefficient
       measures the local average treatment effect on zip codes whose viewership levels are affected
       by channel position. The OLS estimate averages across all zip codes in the sample, weighting
       most heavily those with unusually high or low Republican vote share. It is reasonable to
       suspect that the complier zip codes are more centrist relative to the outlier zip codes, and thus
       subject to larger persuasion effects: those whose choice among ideological news channels is
       most susceptible to influence by channel position are also likely to be those whose pre-existing
       ideological attachments are relatively weak.
            In Appendix F, we include an analogous specification to Table 4 where MSNBC viewership
       is the endogenous variable, as well as a dual-instrument version where FNC and MSNBC
       viewership are both instrumented by FNC and MSNBC positions. The point estimate of
       the second-stage MSNBC hours coefficient is negative, though smaller in magnitude than the
       analogous FNC coefficient, in the single-instrument specification. However, the confidence
       intervals do not allow us to reject a zero effect of MSNBC in the analogue to our preferred
       FNC specification. We conclude that while there is some suggestive evidence of a MSNBC
       persuasive effect, it is weaker and less robust than the evidence for FNC. Accordingly, we fit
       the behavioral model in section 5 using only the information from the single-instrument second
       stage results for FNC.

      Instrument Validity Support In this section, we defend the quasi-experimental nature
      of the channel position. We ask: (1) In zip codes whose demographics predict that the Re-
      publican vote share should be high, is FNC systematically in lower channel positions? (2) In
      zip codes whose demographics predict that the viewership of FNC should be high, is FNC
      systematically in lower channel positions? (3) Is FNC in lower positions in zip codes which
      had higher measures of Republican-ness in 1996, before FNC? (4) Does the FNC position in
      the cable lineup predict viewership for satellite subscribers in the same zip code, who do not
      interface with the cable lineup? and (5) Do the coefficients on FNC position in both the first
      stage and the reduced form change appreciably when we add or remove covariates?16 The
      answers to questions (1)-(5) are all negative.
          The first two columns of Table 6 show the relationship of FNC cable position with observable
      variation in local taste for FNC. The left hand side here is predicted minutes watched of
      FNC per week, using only demographic information as covariates; predicted minutes per week
      are then regressed on FNC cable position. The relationship is positive and significant. For
      assessing the identifying assumption, positive estimates are re-assuring as they indicate that
      FNC positions are higher in locations with observable demographics which would predict more
      FNC viewing.
  16
     In Appendix G.3, we show additionally that FNC viewership does not correlate with FNC channel positions on
nearby systems, nor future FNC channel positions on the same system. Furthermore, the 2008 McCain vote share
does not correlate with FNC channel position on nearby systems.

 Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses (clustered by cable system). Columns 1-4 regress predicted hours of FNC and
 predicted Republican vote share, respectively, on FNC cable position. The predicting regressions exclude FNC position but
 include the indicated set of demographic controls. Columns 5-8 regress indicators of pre-treatment political attitudes (1996
 county-level Republican presidential vote share and 1996 zipcode-level Republican campaign contribution share) on FNC
 cable position.



           The next two columns of Table 6 regress the predicted voting outcome from a regression of
       vote preference that excludes position, on the FNC cable position. This predictable component
       of variation in political preference has a correlation with FNC position that is again positive,
       though not always significantly different from zero. I.e., FNC’s position in cable territories
       that are expected to be more Republican given observables is, if anything, slightly worse than
       average. These results together say that areas which are predicted, based on demographics,
       to be highly Republican or to have high FNC viewership do not have lower FNC channel
       positions.
           Columns (5) through (8) check whether FNC position is correlated with political variables
       that predate FNC’s arrival: the share of federal campaign contributions from the zip code that
       went to Republican candidates in 1996, and the (county-level) Republican presidential vote
       share in 1996. The idea is to test the conjecture that cable position proxies for pre-treatment
       variation in political tastes. Again, the majority of the correlations are positive (the opposite
       direction from the reduced form), and none differs significantly from zero.
           We next introduce a placebo test using satellite viewership in the same zip code. Satellite
       subscribers in the same zip code provide a useful placebo group because they do not interface
       with the local cable lineup; they see a different lineup which is set by the satellite provider
       at the national level, yet they look similar on observable demographic dimensions. To carry
       out the satellite placebo test in the zip code level data, we create a data set which has two
       observations for each zip code and year: the mean viewership amongst cable subscribers and
       the mean viewership amongst satellite subscribers. We then run the first stage regression, but



                                                                   19
      interacting the channel positions on their local cable system with an indicator for whether the
      observation represents viewership for cable or for satellite. If the channel positions on the local
      cable system are chosen in response to unobservable local characteristics, then these positions
      should also predict satellite subscribers’ viewership.
          Table 7 presents the results of the satellite placebo test. The Chow test p-value tests for
      equality between the FNC cable position coefficients. In all columns, we cannot reject that the
      FNC cable position interacted with satellite subscription is zero, while we reject zero strongly
      for FNC position interacted with cable subscription. Furthermore, we can always reject the
      hypothesis that these two coefficients are equal to each other.

          Finally, in Table 8, we show that the coefficients on FNC position in both the first stage
      viewership regression and the reduced form do not change substantially as we add or remove
      subsets of variables that are highly predictive of both voting Republican and watching FNC.
      For example, consider the zip code fraction of campaign contributions going to Republicans in

1996, before the arrival of FNC. This variable is an extremely strong predictor of Republican
voting, with t-statistics exceeding 8. It is also a significant predictor of FNC viewership in
2008. However, including this variable on the right-hand side does not appreciably change the
coefficients on FNC position in either the first stage or the reduced form.



5     Model
We now specify a behavioral model of viewership and voting. The purpose of the model is
two-fold: first, we can run counterfactual predictions, such as predicting the effect of removing
FNC or quantifying the role of cable news in polarization. Second, the model helps to interpret
the meaning of the IV results. Specifically, the heterogeneity in the model draws attention
to the role of the IV as measuring local average treatment effects among agents who are
heterogeneous in both their ideological malleability and in their viewership responsiveness to
channel position. These benefits come at the cost of functional forms assumptions on exactly
how consumers allocate their time watching cable news and how they change their ideology
after watching slanted news.
    The model has two stages. In the first stage, consumer-voters choose a television package,
and how much time to spend watching the cable news channels. In the second stage, consumer-
voters vote in the Presidential election. Between the first and second stage, consumer-voters’
ideologies evolve as a function of the ideologies of and time spent watching the news channels.

Voter Ideology and Presidential Vote Decision Consumer-voters have a latent
unidimensional political ideology which determines their vote choice in presidential elections.
We denote the left-right ideology of consumer-voter i in year t by rit .
    We specify voters’ initial ideologies as a function of their county of residence and demo-
graphic attributes. Specifically, we estimate a logit model of vote choice with county dummies
as explanatory variables, which matches county level vote shares from 1996. The county-level
intercepts from this model then determine the simulated consumers’ initial ideologies, along
with demographic effects and an iid logit error term:

                                     rij0 = δj + βV0 di + ij                                (4)

    Where δj is the estimated county intercept for county j, consumer i’s county of residence,
di is a vector of demographic characteristics associated with consumer i, and βV is a parameter


                                               22
       vector to be estimated. From this starting point, the consumer’s ideology evolves in response
       to both random shocks and the influence of the news channels he watches, according to a
       process described in detail later in this section.
           Each voter votes for the party whose candidate’s announced position is closest to her own.
       Each presidential election has a cutpoint parameter Pt , for t ∈ {2000, 2004, 2008}. All voters
       to the left of the cutpoint (with rit < Pt ) vote for the Democratic candidate, and those to the
       right vote for the Republican. We do not model the turnout decision.17

       Viewership and Subscription The viewership time allocation and subscription portion
       of the model follows Crawford and Yurukoglu (2012). Given access to the news channels Cjt
       in package j in year t, consumer-voter i allocates their time amongst watching those channels
       and other activities to maximize:
                                                   X
                                           vij =           γict log(1 + Tijc )                              (5)
                                                   c∈Cjt


           where γict is consumer-voter i’s preference parameter for news channel c in year t, subject
       to a budget constraint that the total time available to allocate is 168 hours per week. We
       normalize the outside option (doing anything other than watching cable news) such that γi0t =
       1 for all i, t, and parameterize the remaining vector of γict as

                        γit = χit ◦ νit
                       χict ∼ Bernoulli(α0ct + Π0c di + ζ0 posict − η((a + brct ) − rit )2 )                (6)
                        νict ∼ Exp(αct + Πc di + ζposict )                                                  (7)

           χict determines whether consumer-voter i has a non-zero preference for channel c. It is
       a random function of demographics di according to parameters Π0 , a channel-year specific
       fixed effect α0ct , the position of the channel in the lineup according to ζ0 , and the distance
       of consumer-voter i’s one dimensional political ideology rit from the channel’s text based
       estimated ideology rct according to η. This last term represents taste for like-minded news
       as in Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010). The parameters a and b scale the text based ideology
       measures to allow for consumers to perceive slant as a linear function of the text based slant
       measure. If η is positive, then increasing the ideological distance between consumer-voter i
       and channel c reduces the probability i watches c.
17
     In Table A27 of the Appendix, we are not able to pin down a precise effect of cable news on turnout.


                                                            23
          If the consumer-voter has a non-zero preference for a channel, the intensity of her preference
       is drawn from an exponential distribution whose parameter depends on αct , a channel-year
       specific fixed effect, demographics di according to parameters Π, and the channel position
       according to ζ. The exponential mixed with a mass at zero is inspired by the individual
       viewership data, which features a mass at zero and monotonically decreasing density.
          The constrained maximization problem defined by (5) has an analytic solution described
       in Appendix H. The indirect utility from solving this problem enters into the consumer-
       voter’s decision of whether to subscribe to cable, satellite, or no television package at all. The
       conditional indirect utility from subscribing to package j is

                                                         ∗
                                                  uij = vij + δ̃j + ˜ij

          where δ̃j is the mean utility of package j, ˜ij is an idiosyncratic logit error term and j
       corresponds to cable or satellite. We also allow consumers to subscribe to no package at all
       which yields corresponding ui0 = log(1 + B) + ˜i0 .

       Ideological Influence After watching cable news, consumer-voter i’s one-dimensional po-
       litical ideology evolves as a function of how much time i spends watching the news channels
       and the ideology of the news channels.18 We assume that i is attracted towards the ideologies
       of the news channels she watches, the more so the more time i spends watching. Specifically
                                                      P
                                           ri,t−1 + ρ c Tic,t−1 (a + brc,t−1 )
                                   rit =                 P                     + ξit                        (8)
                                                    1 + ρ c Tic,t−1

          where ri,t−1 is i’s ideology in the previous year, rit is i’s new ideology, and ρ is a parameter
       to be estimated which controls the magnitude of news channels’ influence on viewers’ ideology.
       The ξit ’s are mean-zero, normally distributed random shocks.19 This formulation implies that
       in the absence of watching cable news, viewers’ ideologies evolve according to a random walk
       with zero drift.
  18
     The channel’s ideology measure is the same function of the text based slant measure that enters the viewership
decision problem.
  19
     We calibrate the variance of the ideology shocks to match the yearly rate of party switching found in the American
National Election Study’s (ANES) 2008-2009 Panel Study. This study tracked and repeatedly interviewed the same
group of respondents over the course of a presidential campaign, allowing an estimate of the within-individual
propensity to change support from the Republican to the Democratic presidential candidate over time. Specifically,
we calibrated the standard deviation to 0.4654. This magnitude implies that, when such a shock is added to standard
logistic distribution, the mass which changes sign matches the observed fraction of switchers in ANES.



                                                           24
           One interpretation of ρ is as a (per-hour) rate at which viewers receive ideological signals
       while watching cable news. If voters treat signals from slanted outlets as true draws on the
       state of the world, and further, if they do not account for the correlation between repeated
       signals from the same source as in the model of DeMarzo et al. (2003),20 then equation (8)
       arises as the inverse-variance-weighted average of signals observed by viewer i in period t.21
           The functional form here implies that a consumer-voter’s attraction is governed by the
       same parameter (ρ), whether coming from the left or the right. This rules out that a voter
       might watch a slanted channel, become disgusted, and move in the opposite direction of the
       channel as in Arceneaux et al. (2012). Furthermore, consumer-voters are naive about the
       influence effect when choosing time watched.



       6     Estimation and Results
       We estimate the parameters of the model by indirect inference (Smith (1990); Gourieroux
       et al. (1993)). This implies choosing the model’s parameters to generate predictions for an
       auxiliary model which match the auxiliary model estimated from the data. In essence, we
       are choosing model parameters so that they generate regression results as close as possible to
       those in Section 4. The auxiliary model consists of thirteen linear regressions that fall into
       four categories, plus a set of unconditional moments: (1) regressions of individual-level and
       zipcode-level viewership of each cable news channel on demographics and channel positions,
       (six regressions), (2) a linear probability model of watching any positive amount of each cable
       news channel at the individual level on demographics and channel positions (three regressions),
       (3) regressions of individual level intent to vote Republican and zipcode level Republican vote
       share on demographics and predicted time spent watching FNC from (1) (two regressions),
       and (4) OLS regressions of intent to vote Republican and zipcode level Republican vote share
       on hours of FNC, MSNBC, or CNN watched (two regressions).22 (1) and (3) correspond to the
       two-stage least squares estimate of the effects of watching FNC on voting Republican, with the
       addition of analogous first-stage regressions for the other two channels. We introduce (2) to
  20
      Gentzkow and Shapiro (2006) explore media consumption and endogenous slant with fully Bayesian consumers.
  21
      For this interpretation to hold over a series of periods, we require that at the beginning of each period the
consumer gets an ideology shock which returns the variance of his ideology to 1.
   22
      The individual-level OLS regression uses, rather than hours watched, an indicator for whether FNC, MSNBC, or
CNN is an individual’s “most-watched” news source as the right-hand-side variable. The reason for this substitution
is, as described in Section 3, that we lack an individual-level data set with information on both hours watched and
voting preferences. The NAES survey asked respondents only to list which of the news channels, if any, they watched
the most.


                                                        25
identify the Bernoulli and exponential components of our utility specification. (4) corresponds
to the OLS regression of intent to vote Republican on viewership presented in Table 5. All
regressions include state-year fixed effects. Finally, we also match (5) the actual vote shares
in each presidential election, the year by year average hours watched for each channel, and
the year by year fraction of non-zero viewership for each channel. We choose the model’s
parameters so that estimating (1)-(5) on data simulated from the model produce coefficient
estimates with minimum distance to those in the data. We weight the distance metric in
proportion to the inverse of the variance in the estimated relationships in the real data.

Discussion of Variation in Data and Model Parameters An intuitive description
of what in the data helps drive estimates of the model’s parameters is relatively straightforward.
ρ, the parameter which determines the degree of influence, is sensitive to the coefficients on
projected time in the second stage regression. η, the parameter governing the degree of tastes
for like-minded news, is sensitive to coefficients in OLS regression relative to the coefficients on
viewership in the second stage regressions. The OLS coefficient estimates on FNC viewership
conflates tastes for like-minded news with any influence effect. We isolate the influence effect
by using channel positions as instrumental variables, and choose the level of tastes for like
minded news to explain the OLS coefficient conditional on the influence effect.
   ζ, the parameters determining the strength of channel positions in the time allocation prob-
lem, are sensitive to the first stage coefficients on channel positions. A similar straightforward
relationship applies to the demographic factors influencing time watched and the coefficients
on demographics in the first stage regressions.
   Pt , the parameters characterizing the three presidential elections in our sample period,
are sensitive to the unconditional aggregate vote share moments. These parameters allow the
model to capture national trends in party preference. βV are sensitive to the OLS and second
stage IV coefficients on demographics. They allow consumers with different demographics to
have different mean preferences over party.
   Separate identification of a and b, from ρ and η is possible because there are three channels
and thus seven moments to work with- the IV coefficient and three from each of the OLS
regressions. The asymmetries in the channels’ estimated effects relative to their text-based
ideological positioning provide variation to distinguish the scaling parameters from ρ and η.
The FNC OLS coefficient is more positive than the MSNBC coefficient is negative. Increasing
η intensifies the magnitude of both OLS coefficients in similar proportions. Increasing b at
a fixed η increases the magnitude of the FNC coefficient at a faster rate than the MSNBC


                                                26
       coefficient, because the text-based FNC ideology is more conservative than the text-based
       MSNBC ideology is liberal.

       Model Estimates Table 9 shows the main parameter estimates from the model.23 We
       estimate positive values for both ρ, the influence parameter, and η, the taste for like-minded
       news, implying a positive feedback process where voters watch slanted news, are influenced to
       move closer to the news’ channel’s ideology, and subsequently have even stronger preference
       for that channel, due to the decreased ideological distance.

Table 9: Key parameter estimates with standard errors clustered by cable system and computed by block bootstrap.

          The magnitude of the estimate of the taste for like minded news parameter η implies that an
       ideological distance of one unit between viewer and channel reduces that viewer’s probability
       of watching by about 2.5%. For reference, at our estimated scaling parameters, the ideological
       distance between FNC and MSNBC in 2008 is 4.3 units. Given the quadratic-loss specification
       of ideological tastes, this distance implies that an average demographic voter located at the
       ideological position of FNC in 2008 is about 45% more likely to watch FNC than she is to
       watch MSNBC.
          The magnitude of ρ implies that a voter watching an hour per week of a news channel for
       a year would be influenced to a new ideological position just over 5% of the distance to the
       channel’s ideology. Estimates of the channel position parameters, consistent with the data,
       imply that increasing channel position decreases both the probability of watching any of a
       channel, as well as the number of hours watched conditional on watching any. The effect on

     The full set of parameters additionally contains channel-year fixed effects and demographic terms, separately for
the amount watched and the probability of watching any. These are omitted here for brevity. The estimated model’s
fit on regression coefficients is available in Appendix I.

      the probability of watching any - row 4 in the table - implies increasing channel position by
      20 positions decreases the probability of a typical voter watching a channel by about 1%.
          The channel position effect on the number of hours watched is harder to interpret directly,
      as the hours-watched model is nonlinear and hence effects of changing these quantities depend
      on the values of all the other covariates. Tables 10 and 11 therefore show some interpretable
      quantities generated by the model for viewers with various demographic and ideological profiles.

Table 10: The semi-elasticity is the change in mean ratings (in minutes watched per week) following a one-standard-
deviation decrease in channel position, for selected demographic and ideological profiles.


          Table 10 shows computed elasticities of viewers’ expected minutes watched with respect to
      channel position. We compute the change in ratings (measured in minutes per week) resulting
      from a one-standard-deviation decrease in channel position. All are weakly positive, as ex-
      pected, although some are exactly zero because the average viewer of the given demographic
      and ideological profile does not watch any of the channel, regardless of position.
          Table 11 shows a different look at the relationship of viewer preference for channels to
      demographics and channel position. For the same ideological and demographic profiles as in
      the previous table, Table 11 lists that type of viewer’s average hours watched over each of the
      three cable channels, on a hypothetical system where all three are available and positioned at
      their median position in the data in 2008. The last column shows the modal “most-watched”
      channel among viewers of that type. Demographic effects play a large role in determining
      the average hours watched, particularly for FNC and MSNBC. Within demographic profiles,
      ideology drives differences in preferences: all Republican types watch more FNC than they do

      MSNBC, and most Democratic types watch more MSNBC than they do FNC.
           In both our raw data and in the simulations, cable news programs are consumed by agents
      who do not necessarily share the same ideology as the channel. This result is consistent
      with the analysis in Gentzkow and Shapiro (2011) who find that much of FNC’s audience is
      composed of people who do not self-identify as conservative, and related, that self-identified
      conservatives watch other cable news besides FNC. The model estimates match these facts.
      Furthermore, such a lack of ideological segregation is a necessary precursor in this model for
      cable news consumption to change voter intentions.
           We find that the perception of slant for the channels is a multiple of about 17 times the text
      based slant measure. The text based slant measures place FNC and MSNBC in 2008 closer
      to the center than the median Republican or median Democratic congressman, respectively.
      The scaled ideology estimates place FNC to the right of the median Republican voter in 2008.
      MSNBC’s position falls to the left of the median Democratic voter in 2008, although only
      slightly.
           Table 12 shows the change in the probability of voting Republican with respect to watching
      one hour per week of each of the cable channels, again for viewers with different initial ideo-
      logical types. For initially centrist voters, watching CNN has an influence on the probability
      of voting Republican that ranges from slightly positive to slightly negative depending on the
      election. The effect of MSNBC is small but positive (meaning watching MSNBC increases the

       likelihood of Republican voting) in 2000 and 2004, but becomes substantially negative (at 6.6
       percentage points) in 2008 after MSNBC’s format switch. The effect of Fox on centrist viewers
       is consistently positive, ranging from 5.3 points in 2000 to 12.6 points in 2008.
          The largest elasticity magnitudes are on individuals from the opposite ideology of the
       channel. Were a viewer initially at the ideology of the median Democratic voter in 2008 to
       watch an hour of Fox per week, her likelihood of voting Republican would increase by just over
       15 percentage points. Another pattern that emerges from the table is that Fox is substantially
       better at influencing Democrats than MSNBC is at influencing Republicans. This last feature
       is consistent with the regression result that the IV effect of Fox is greater and more consistent
       than the corresponding effect for MSNBC.
          Finally, Table 13 shows an estimate of DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007)’s concept of persua-
       sion rates: the success rate of the channels at converting votes from one party to the other.24
  24
    DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) use a measure of FNC cable availability in 2000 to generate variation in self-
reported viewership. In their case, the viewership measure is an indicator for whether the respondent reports
watching thirty minutes or more in a given week. Here, we use a continuous measure, condition on demographics,


                                                           30
      The numerator here is the number of, for example, FNC viewers who are initially Democrats
      but by the end of an election cycle change to supporting the Republican party. The denomi-
      nator is the number of FNC viewers who are initially Democrats.25 Again, Fox is consistently
      more effective at converting viewers than is MSNBC.



      7      Polarization and Media Power
      In this section, we perform several exercises to quantify the effects of cable news on election
      outcomes. First, we simulate the evolution of ideology for a group of voters over time to ask
      whether cable news can contribute to polarization. Second, we estimate the effect of the entry
      of FNC on the 2000 presidential election, as well as the effects of the post-2004 MSNBC format
      switch on the 2008 presidential election. Finally, we measure the “media power” (Prat, 2014)
      of the individual channels as well as a hypothetical combination of the three under unified
      ownership.

      Polarization A positive ρ and a positive η together create the potential for a polarizing
      feedback loop, as watching a channel attracts a viewer towards that channel’s ideology, which
      makes watching the channel more attractive, and so on. Figure 4 shows the results of a
      simulation of viewing and voting behavior to assess the degree of polarization that cable news
      viewing can generate.
          A sample of 10,000 viewers in an average cable system26 in a county with average demo-
      graphic characteristics are assigned ideologies from the initial ideology distribution, conditional
      on their simulated demographics. We run these simulated individuals through the model over
      ten years.
          The resulting distribution of ideologies becomes visibly more polarized as the process con-
      tinues, with new right and left modes emerging from the initially approximately unimodal
      distribution. In addition to plotting the distribution, we show the value of the axiomatic mea-
      sure of polarization of Esteban and Ray (1994) and Duclos et al. (2004) in each year.27 This

and account for satellite viewership.
  25
     As our model has no inherent notion of partisanship, only an ideological cutpoint between the parties, in Table
13 we consider two definitions of what constitutes a Democratic or Republican partisan.
  26
     For purposes of this simulation, all viewers are given access to all three cable channels, at the channels’ mean
positions in 2008. We hold channel positioning, channel fixed-effects, and each channel’s ideological slant constant
at their 2008 values.
  27
     There are four axioms which imply this measure. For example, the first axiom is “If a distribution is composed
of a single basic density, then a squeeze of that density cannot increase polarization.” We refer the reader to the


                                                         31
      value increases as time goes on, by a total of about 2.5% by the end of the 10-year period.
      The locations of the local maxima in the distribution correspond to FNC’ ideological location
      and an intermediate location between that of MSNBC and CNN.
          This increase in polarization requires a taste for like-minded news. Figure 4(b) shows the
      evolution of the ideology distribution when the taste for like-minded news is set to zero. Here,
      the distribution remains roughly unimodal throughout. Furthermore, the tails of the distri-
      bution thin out, as viewers from across the political spectrum are exposed to and persuaded
      by news from the other side. Additionally, the distribution shifts on the whole to the right,
      as FNC’s relatively more extreme location allows it to out-persuade its relatively moderate
      competition. Normally, this greater potential for influence is counterbalanced by the fact that
      the more extreme location dissuades many left-leaning viewers from watching. But with the
      taste for slant disabled, viewers from across the political spectrum are exposed to Fox.
          As a benchmark, we computed the polarization measure after an extreme “hollowing out”
      of the ideology distribution.28 The polarization measure in this scenario more than doubles to
      0.591. We conclude that while cable news can generate modest increases in polarization, the
      audiences are neither large nor selected enough to generate a dramatic polarization.

      Fox Entry in 2000, and MSNBC Format Switch Next, we estimate the effect of
      two counterfactual scenarios aimed at measuring the aggregate influence of the cable news
      channels on election outcomes. First, we estimate the effect of the entry of FNC on the 2000
      presidential election. We compare a base case where Fox was available to cable subscribers in
      the 1997-2000 period according to the observed rollout pattern to a scenario where Fox was
      available exclusively to satellite subscribers and not on any local cable system.
          The first column of Table 14 shows the effects of eliminating Fox from cable lineups prior to
      the 2000 election, as well as the effect on subsequent election cycles. The population-weighted
      average Republican vote share falls by .46 percentage points under the no-Fox scenario relative
      to the baseline. This prediction is in line with the estimate of 0.26 to 0.36 of DellaVigna and
      Kaplan (2007), when updated to use more accurate data.
          In subsequent cycles, the implied FNC effect increases due to two forces. First and most
      importantly, overall FNC viewership approximately doubles during the period from 2000 to
      2008, meaning nearly twice as many viewers are exposed to FNC in later cycles. Second,

     Specifically, we transformed the initial distribution of ideology by assigning all Democratic simulated voters to
the right of the median Democrat the median Democratic ideology, and assigning all Republican simulated voters to
the left of the median Republican the median Republican ideology.

Table 14: Effects of two counterfactual scenarios. In the first, Fox News is eliminated from cable lineups. Column 2
shows the change in the Republican vote share of the presidential popular vote in the no-Fox scenario relative to the
baseline. In the second, MSNBC’s ideological positioning matches that of CNN throughout the 2000-2008 period.
Column 3 shows the change in the Republican vote share of the presidential popular vote in the MSNBC-matching-
CNN scenario relative to the baseline.


      according to our ideological estimates, FNC moves well to the right over this period, increasing
      its persuasive effect enough to outweigh any loss in viewership due to the ideological drift.
          The second column of Table 14 estimates the effects of MSNBC’s switch to liberal slant.
      We simulated a condition where MSNBC’s ideology matched that of CNN. The estimated
      effect in the 2008 election cycle is to decrease the Republican share by just 0.09 percentage
      points, an effect two orders of magnitude smaller than the estimated effect of eliminating
      FNC in 2008. This minimal effect derives from two sources. One, MSNBC’s viewership is
      substantially smaller than that of FNC. Second, MSNBC’s estimted ideological position in the
      2008 cycle is not all that far to the left of CNN, whereas FNC is well to the right.

      Media Power and Optimal Positioning Prat’s (2014) notion of media power refers
      to the minimal quality candidate for whom a media owner could engineer an election victory
      through persuasive efforts. While our election model has no quality dimension, we can ask a
      similar question: how many presidential votes could the cable news channels swing from one
      party to the other, by changing the ideological orientation of their content? Table 15 shows
      the results of an exercise where we allow each channel to choose its ideological location in each
      year in order to maximize the vote share of the Republican candidate, and then do the same
      for the Democratic candidate, holding the positions of the other channels fixed. The table
      shows the difference in Republican aggregate vote share between these two scenarios. In the
      last column of the table, we show the potential influence of a combined cable news monopolist
      controlling all three channels.
          In this time period, CNN has the highest power to swing election outcomes, due to its
      relatively large viewership, favorable channel positioning, and broad demographic appeal. The
      potential to change election outcomes are large - the achievable vote share swing of a cable

Table 15: The maximum potential vote share swing that the channel could engineer, by election. The “monopolist”
column is the is the maximum vote share


       news monopolist exceeds 25% by 2008 - and increasing over time. The time trend is a result
       of the accumulation of influence over time, as the cumulative reach of the channels grow with
       each passing year.
          The preceding is a “worst-case” scenario, in the sense that it assumes cable news operators
       seek only to maximize the vote share of a favored party. In reality, the cable channels are
       businesses whose revenue derives from advertising and affiliate fees from cable providers,29
       which are generally increasing in audience size. The profit motive presumably provides some
       disincentive from choosing extreme ideological locations that would reduce ratings by turning
       off too many moderate viewers.
          We examined the extent to which this tradeoff constrains the channels’ persuasive power,
       by comparing the power-maximizing ideological position to the ratings-maximizing ideologi-
       cal position. Figure 7 compares each of the three channels’ actual, ratings-maximizing, and
       influence-maximizing30 ideological positioning in the 2000-2008 period.
          The optimal ideological location from a ratings perspective is quite centrist, and similar
       for all three of the channels. Comparison of the channel’s actual location with the vote-share
       maximizing choice, however, reveals an asymmetry: the two relatively liberal channels, and
       CNN in particular, are far from the location that would maximize the vote share of Democratic
       candidates. FNC, on the other hand, is close to, and by 2008 actually exceeds, the position
       that maximizes Republican vote share. Were Fox to move even further to the right, the loss
       of liberal viewers turned off by Fox’s extreme location would outweigh the gain in persuasive
       potential among liberal viewers who continued to watch, reducing FNC’s overall influence on
       election outcomes.
          Relatedly, the power figures presented in Table 15 do not represent symmetric swings
       around the actual vote share totals: FNC is already close to achieving the maximal Republican
  29
    According to SNL, the FNC received 64% of its revenue from affiliate fees in 2015.

    For MSNBC and CNN, we plot the choice that maximizes Democratic vote share; for FNC we plot the choice
that maximizes Republican vote share.

Figure 5: Channels’ ideological positioning from 2000-2008. The three lines are the observed position from the
text-based measure, the position that would maximize the channel’s ratings, and the position that maximizes the
vote share for a favored party. For FNC, we show the position that maximizes Republican vote share; for the other
two channels we show the position that maximizes Democratic vote share.


              vote share it can attain on its own, and its power consists almost entirely of the damage it
              could do to Republican candidates by moving to the left.
                   Several caveats to this exercise are in order. First, these are partial-equilibrium results
              holding the locations of the other channels fixed at their actual locations. Although an inter-
              esting question in its own right, modeling the strategic interaction between channels in this
              complex dynamic game is beyond the scope of this paper. Second, although ratings are related
              to profitability, they are not the same thing. Advertising rates vary with the demographics
              of the audience, and it is possible that a smaller audience is more valuable than a larger one
              if its composition is skewed in ways - towards higher income households, for example - that
              are attractive to advertisers. And cable providers’ willingness to pay affiliate fees is likely to
              be higher for differentiated news channels than for homogeneous ones. Hence, though FNC’s
              strategy appears to cost it some viewers relative to a more centrist positioning, we cannot
              conclude from this observation that the FNC ownership must therefore be willing to sacrifice
              profits for Republican votes.

       8      Conclusion
       This paper provides estimates of both the influence of slanted news on voting behavior and the
       taste for like-minded news in the context of cable television news in the U.S. The key ingredient
       in the analysis is the use of channel positions as instrumental variables to estimate a model
       of viewership, voting, and ideology evolution. We show instrumental variables estimates that
       watching FNC increases the probability of voting Republican in presidential elections. We
       probe the instrumental variables assumption by correlating channel positions with observables:
       demographics which predict FNC viewership, demographics which predict partisan vote shares,
       pre-FNC partisan vote shares, pre-FNC partisan donations, and local satellite viewership of
       FNC.
           We estimate a model of consumer-viewer-voters who choose cable subscriptions, allocate
       time to watching news channels, and vote in elections. The tastes for news channels are partly
       determined by the closeness of the news channels’ estimated ideology to the individuals. Indi-
       vidual ideology evolves towards the estimated ideologies of the news channels that a consumer
       watches. We use the estimated model to characterize the degree of polarization that one can
       attribute to slanted cable news consumption, to measure effects of cable news on elections,
       and to assess the positioning strategies of the cable news channels. Our estimates imply large
       effects of FNC on presidential elections. Furthermore, we estimate that cable news can increase
       polarization, and that this increase depends on both a persuasive effect of cable news and the
       existence of tastes for like-minded news. Finally, we find that an influence-maximizing owner
       of the cable news channels could have large effects on vote shares, but would have to sacrifice
       some levels of viewership to maximize influence.
           Future research could go in a number of directions. The use of channel positions as instru-
       mental variable could be useful in other studies of how media consumption affects behavior.
       One could also use channel position variation to study the cable news channels in more detail
       by examining specific programs, e.g. “The O’Reilly Factor,” and specific issues like abortion,
       gay marriage, or government spending. In a different direction, studying the causes and con-
       sequences of the divergence in estimated ideologies seems fruitful.31 It would also be useful to
       test, refine, or expand the specific model we employ for belief updating after media consump-
       tion. For example, one could allow for a joint distribution of influence parameters and tastes
       for like-minded news in the population.
31
     This includes improving these text based procedures to allow for sentiment analysis or other partisan indicators.

A      Data Construction
A.1     Nielsen FOCUS Lineups
The Nielsen FOCUS data set were provided in two formats. For the largest 55 DMA’s, we
were given yearly spreadsheets for each DMA. For the DMA’s ranked 56 to 210, we were
given a CSV file with all systems and years. We stacked all the 1-55 DMA spreadsheets
with the 56-210 CSV file. An observation in the main combined file is a cable system-year-
channel. A separate file links cable system-years to zip codes. We dropped any cable system
labeled “-ADS” or “APTS”. These system correspond to alternative delivery systems for single
apartment buildings. We synchronized cable channel names across years and system by manual
inspection.
    The three main challenges with these data are that some zip codes have more than one
cable system which serve it, and some cable systems have multiple “devices” whose lineups
sometimes, but not always, differ, and some cable system devices have multiple channels listed
in a channel position. To deal with the first issue, we first kept the cable system which reports
the highest number of total subscribers (across all zip codes). To break ties, we then considered
which cable system had the highest number of county subscribers, the most homes passed, and
the highest number of channels, and at random, in that order. 124252 ties are broken by total
subscribers, and a total of 222 further ties broken by the other criteria. In the case where a
device listed two channels in the same position, we kept the channel if it was a news channel,
and at random if no news channel was involved. If a channel showed up in two different
positions, we used the minimum channel position.
    We first dropped any device labeled “COMMUNITY SPECIFIC” or “UNIQUE SITUA-
TION.” These were always in systems which had other devices that were labelled “DIGITAL”
or “REGULAR.” In cases where two devices did not have any overlapping channel numbers,
we combined the two devices into one. For systems with multiple devices, we kept the device
with the most number of channels. This is often innocuous as the devices would be nested
and have the same channel positions for most of the basic channels. If multiple devices had
the same number of channels, we kept the device that was labelled “DIGITAL,” if possible. If
not, we kept the device labelled “REGULAR.” These conditions broke all ties.
    We dropped any system which did not report carrying any of the top 60 cable channels by
Mediamark viewership after the cleaning. These are likely due to error in the cleaning process
and correspond to 587 zip code-years out of 522,139 zip code-years (0.11%).
    The number of channels variable corresponds to the total number of non-empty channel

                                               41
positions in the cleaned cable lineup. We dropped any pay-per-view channels, channels labeled
“BLACKOUT,” program guide channels, split-channels (e.g. “Nick at Nite” which is the
evening version of Nickelodeon), and HD channels. The number of broadcast channels variable
corresponds to the total number of channels that have an associated over-the-air channel
number.


A.2       Nielsen Viewership Data
We use zip code-level viewership data from Nielsen Local Television View (NLTV) for the
years 2005 through 2008.

Sample selection We downloaded reports from the NLTV interface for zip code level rat-
ings aggregated for each year separately in any zip code where the estimated sample size in the
report interface was positive. We used the 5am-5am daypart, and all persons 18 and over. Each
zip code year had 9 observations: three for each of CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Within each channel, we had a rating for all television households, a rating for households who
subscribed to cable television, and a rating for households who subcribed to Alternative De-
livery Systems (ADS) which are defined as ”Satellite (C-band), DBS (KU-band), SMATV
(master antenna), MDS (includes multi-channel, multi-point and multi-point distribution
service) and Broadband Only.” (http://en-us.nielsen.com/sitelets/cls/documents/nltv/NLTV-
CharacteristicDefinitions-Diary.pdf). DirecTV and Dish Network are DBS providers.

Matching to lineup and availability data We match this data set to the Nielsen
FOCUS lineups by the zip code and year.


A.3       MRI-Simmons Viewership Data
We use individual-level viewership data from two sources: Mediamark Research’s Survey of the
American Consumer and Experian Simmons’ National Consumer Study. We use Mediamark
data from 2000 to 2007, and Experian Simmons data for 2008. In this section, we detail the
steps we took in cleaning and combining these data sets.

Sample selection We included in our sample any respondent who responded to all relevant
demographic characteristics: race, income, education, age, and gender. We also required the
respondent to have a valid zip code.


                                              42
       Demographics We make some simplifications to the demographic questions, as follows.
       First, racial categories are simplified to three dummy variables, for white, black, and hispanic
       respectively. The excluded category is all other racial categories. Education variables are
       reduced to a single dummy variable for having completed at least a bachelor’s degree.
           Household income comes in binned indicator form in the raw data. For example, there is an
       indicator for household income of “$15,000 to less than $25,000.” We convert these indicators
       to a continuous variable by computing the expected value of a log-normally-distributed random
       variable, conditional on the variable falling within the bin boundaries.32 The parameters of
       this distribution are calibrated to match the shares of the national population falling into each
       of the income bins collected by the US Census Bureau. All respondents in the same income
       bin are, therefore, assigned the same level of income.

       Viewership of Cable Channels Both surveys ask about the number of hours viewed in
       a given week for a variety of television channels. This study uses responses to CNN, the Fox
       News Channel, and MSNBC. Mediamark asks whether the respondent watched any amount,
       as well as a multiple choice question for each channel with the following options: 1 hour, 2
       hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6-9 hours, 10 hours, 11-15 hours, 16-20 hours, and 21+ hours.
       Experian Simmons also asks whether the respondent watched any amount, and a multiple
       choice question for each channel with the following options: Less than 1 hour, 1 hour to less
       than 3, 3 hours to less than 5, 5 hours to less than 7, 7 hours to less than 10, and 10 hours
       or more. We assigned the midpoint of each interval as the hours watched for that respondent
       when possible.33

       Cable or Satellite Subscription We also use whether the respondent subscribes to
       Cable, DirecTV, Dish Network, or none of the above. For the 5,386 respondents (2.5%) who
       indicate that they subscribe to both cable and one of the satellite providers, we assume they
       only subscribe to the satellite provider.

       Matching to lineup and availability data We match both data sets to the Nielsen
       FOCUS lineups by the respondent’s zip code and year.
32
     For the top-coded categories, we compute the expected value conditional on being above the top-coding threshold.
33
     For the highest bin, we used 25 hours for Mediamark and 12.84 hours for Simmons.




                                                         43
A.4     Construction of 2008 zip-level vote
Precinct-level voting data for the 2008 presidential election come from the Harvard Election
Data Archive (HEDA, Ansolabehere and Rodden, 2011). We matched each precinct to a
ZIP code (the level at which our cable position data is defined) using a spatial matching
procedure. For each precinct in the HEDA shapefile, we computed the coordinates of the
precinct’s centroid. We then overlaid the precinct centroids onto the polygon files defining
zip code tabulation area boundaries provided by the US Census Bureau’s TIGER/Line series,
generating a corresponding ZIP code for each precinct.
   There are a minority of cases for which the precinct centroid does not fall within the
boundaries of any ZIP code. This can happen, for instance, if the precinct centroid falls in a
lake or other body of water, which are excluded from the ZIP polygon boundaries. In these
cases, we match to ZIPs by computing the centroids for each ZIP, and finding the nearest
neighbor ZIP centroid (by geographic distance) for each precinct centroid.
   Once a ZIP code match for every precinct has been constructed in this fashion, we aggregate
voting totals across precincts up to the ZIP level. This ZIP level dataset is then used in our
reduced-form regression of 2008 Republican presidential vote share on position.


A.5     Construction of CCES and NAES datasets
For the 2000, 2004 and 2008 election cycles, we use individual-level political preference data
from the National Annenberg Election Survey (NAES). The NAES is a nationally represen-
tative telephone survey, conducted as a rolling cross-section between the December of the
preceding year and the January following the election year. Survey waves were timed roughly
to correspond with major campaign events such as the televised debates. Those interviewed
after the election date were asked for whom they actually had cast a ballot; those interviewed
before were asked for whom they intended to cast a ballot. The bulk of the interviews occur
in the three months prior to the election; 10-15% occur after the election.

Sample selection We included in our sample any respondent in the rolling cross-section
who indicated a preference for one of the two major-party presidential candidates, either in
the form of intention to vote or of actual vote, pooling together all survey waves. NAES also
asked pre-election voters to state how certain they were of their choice, on a scale ranging
from “Definitely will vote for candidate” to “Good chance will change mind.” We pool all
of these responses together as votes for the stated candidate. Voters who did not answer the


                                              44
       presidential preference question, or said they “Don’t know” or are “Uncertain” of their choice
       are excluded from the sample.

       Demographics We make some simplifications to the demographic questions in NAES, as
       follows. First, racial categories are simplified to three dummy variables, for white, black, and
       hispanic respectively. The excluded category is all other racial categories. Education variables
       are reduced to a single dummy variable for having completed at least a bachelor’s degree,
       which includes the NAES’ “Four-year college degree” and “Graduate or professional degree”
       categories.
           Household income comes in binned indicator form in the raw NAES data. For example,
       there is an indicator for household income of “$15,000 to less than $25,000.” We convert
       these indicators to a continuous variable by computing the expected value of a lognormally-
       distributed random variable, conditional on the variable falling within the bin boundaries.34
       The parameters of this distribution are calibrated to match the shares of the national popula-
       tion falling into each of the income bins collected by the US Census Bureau. All respondents
       in the same income bin are, therefore, assigned the same level of income.

       Most-watched cable channel The 2004 and 2008 editions of the NAES ask respondents
       to state the TV news source which they watch most. In 2004 this question is phrased in
       terms of channels (i.e. respondents can select CNN, MSNBC, FNC, or one of the networks)
       whereas in 2008 it is phrased in terms of programs (i.e, respondents can select The O’Reilly
       Factor, Anderson Cooper 360, and so forth.) We convert the 2008 response to channel level
       by aggregating across all responses that indicate a show affiliated with a particular channel,
       as well as responses that state the channel name but not a specific program. We then create
       three mutually exclusive dummy variables for selecting each of the three channels. It is possible
       (and, in fact, likely) that a respondent may have a 0 for all three of these variables, indicating
       either that the respondent does not consume any TV news or that she prefers a non-cable
       source.

       Matching to lineup and availability data NAES data is matched to the Nielsen
       FOCUS lineups by the respondent’s zip code and year. Because Nielsen’s lineups data are
       released at the end of December each year, we apply the following rule for temporal matching:
       any respondent interviewed in the first six months of a year is matched to his zip code’s lineup
34
     For the top-coded categories, we compute the expected value conditional on being above the top-coding threshold.


                                                         45
from the previous December 31. Any respondent interviewed in the last six months is matched
to his zip code’s lineup from the following December 31.

CCES For 2008, we supplement the NAES data with additional respondents from the Co-
operative Congressional Election Study (CCES), an online cross-section survey which began
operation in 2006. Our construction of the CCES data exactly parallels the discussion of NAES
data above. The only differences are that the CCES does not include the most-watched news
source question, and that the income bins differ from those used by NAES. The conversion of
income to a continuous variable discussed above allows the CCES data to be appended cleanly
to the NAES sample.

       C      Update of DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007)
       DellaVigna and Kaplan (2007) (henceforth DVK) compare changes in presidential vote shares
       in towns which had access to the Fox News Channel by the year 2000 compared to towns that
       did not conditional on a rich set of co-variates. In this section, we update the estimates from
       DVK using Nielsen data on availability of Fox News.


       C.1     Data Sources
       The data source in DVK is the Warren’s Cable and Television Factbook (henceforth Factbook).
       The Factbook updates only a minority of cable systems every year. The extent of non-updating
       has been documented by Crawford and Yurukoglu (2012). We reproduce the relevant years
       from their Appendix table below in Table A5. Updating is especially poor around DVK
       sample year. Between 1999 and 2000, only 22% of observations were updated. Between 1998
       and 1999, only 37% of observations were updated. Since Fox News was expanding across the
       country rapidly during these years, this infrequent updating is consequential: many towns in
       the Factbook were listed as not having cable access to Fox News, when in fact they did but
       the Factbook simply wasn’t updated yet. Nearly all systems in the Nielsen FOCUS data are
       updated every year.
           To audit the Factbook data against the Nielsen FOCUS data, we consulted a third data
       source: cable conversion charts that appeared in weekly TV Week additions of local news-
       papers. These tables listed channel numbers for local cable systems. Figure C.1 provides an
       example capture from the microfilms of such a chart. To conduct the audit, we sorted the set of
       communities where FOCUS and Factbook disagreed on Fox News availability in 2000 by pop-
       ulation size. We tried to find cable conversion charts for the largest two hundred communities.
       We were able to readily find conversion charts which reference the community name in the
       system name and provide information on Fox News Channel for 45 communities.35 For these
       45 communities, the Nielsen FOCUS data was correct on 42 (93.33%) whereas the Factbook
       was correct on 3. Second, we investigated the systems with a particular large discrepancy:
       those where Nielsen FOCUS indicated had Fox News availability in 1998 while the Factbook
  35
    The exact requirement is that the newspaper explicitly names the community in question. For example, we did
not match Greenwich, CT to Cablevision Southern Connecticut as the newspaper did not explicitly mention that
Greenwich was covered by this system. Furthermore, some conversion grids did not list all channels. For example,
the Boston Globe only provided numbers for 31 basic cable channels, omitting Fox News, even though it had listings
for 50 systems. The microfilm scans and spreadsheet with details on the audit are available on request from the
authors.

       indicated no availability by 2000. 353 of these systems were operated by Tele-Communcations
       Inc. (TCI) in 1998. Press reports from the time period indicate that Fox News would be
       available to over 90% of TCI customers by 1998 (Colman (1996)).
          Finally, the number of subscribers for Fox News implied by the Factbook data conflict
       with the amount of viewership Fox News had in 2000, including the viewership data used
       in DVK. According to DVK, “About half of the Fox News audience, therefore, watches Fox
       News in ways other than via cable, possibly via satellite. This finding could also be due to
       measurement error in our measure of availability via cable.” According to their data, 17%
       of households were watching Fox News in 2000. Therefore, 8.5% of all households must have
       been simultaneously satellite subscribers and watching Fox News. However, the market share
       of satellite in the year 2000 was 11.4%36 Therefore, a vast majority of satellite subscribers
       must have been watching Fox News in 2000 to be consistent with the Factbook availability
       measures. Our Mediamark data indicate that the fraction of satellite subscribers watching Fox
       News in 2000 is only 19%.37
          To correct this issue, we matched the voting and demographic data in DVK to Nielsen
       FOCUS. The identification numbers in the Factbook and Nielsen FOCUS do not match. We
       employed a matching procedure based on community names and firm names, using manual
       inspection when matches weren’t obvious. We were able to reliably match 8,013 observations
       out of 9,256 to Nielsen FOCUS. Tables A6 and A7 compare the availability of Fox News
       according to the two data sources.

          About 40 percent of the control group in DVK is mis-classified as not having cable access
       to Fox News. About 25 percent already had access in 1998 and hadn’t been updated for at

     The cable market share was 70.2% implying a 81.6% total market share. Thus, about 14% of cable or satellite
subscribers were satellite subscribers.

     Their viewership data and our Mediamark data agree on the aggregate 17% number. Our Mediamark data
indicate the conditional probability of watching Fox News conditional on satellite is only marginally higher at 19%.

     C.2     Estimates with Nielsen Data
     We now re-run the two benchmark specifications from DVK: the county level fixed effects
     regression and the US House district level fixed effects regression. These correspond to equation
     (2) in DVK. Table A8 compares the resulting estimates.
        The estimate in the county level fixed effects regression drops from a statistically significant
     at 1% 0.00694 (Column 7) to a significant at 10% 0.00256 (Column 9). The difference cannot be
     attributed to not matching all of DVK’s observations. Their estimated effect is stronger when
     using their Fox variable, but only on the subset of matching observations (Column 8). The
     estimate in the Congressional district fixed effects regression remains stable with the Nielsen
     data. The change in results could possibly reflect that availability in the Factbook indicates
     a longer period of availability and the effects of exposure accumulate over time, however the
     Nielsen availability data only goes back to 1998 so we can not empirically test this explanation.
        We now update the placebo result regarding Fox News availability in 2000. Table A9
     compares the placebo regression estimates using the original data and the Nielsen data. Using
     the more correct data in the district fixed effect specification, the placebo regression’s estimate
     for the effect of Fox News availability in 2000 on the change in vote shares from 1992 to 1996
     is 0.0028, nearly the same as the estimate for the change in 1996 to 2000, compared to -
     0.00386 using the Factbook data. The coefficient’s precision can not rule out a zero effect.
     The confidence interval for the Fox News availability in 2000 has shifted from (-0.0085, 0.0038)
     to (-0.0014, 0.0070).
        For the district fixed effects specification, when examining the correlation of Fox News
     availability in 2000 with the level of Republican vote share in 1996, the point estimate changes
     from -0.0343 to 0.150, though in both cases the estimates are noisy with standard errors of

0.095 and 0.124, respectively. The coefficient in the county fixed effects specification becomes
slightly more negative, which is reassuring, though again the estimate is noisy.
   To summarize, using the more correct Nielsen FOCUS data revises down the DVK estimates
from a range of 0.4-0.7 to 0.3-0.4. The 99% confidence intervals in the placebo regression of the
change in Republican vote share from 1992 to 1996 (before Fox News) on Fox News availability
in 2000 include the point estimate for the effect of Fox News availability in 2000 on the change
in Republican vote share from 1996 to 2000, in both the district and county fixed effects
specifications. The evidence on balance could be interpreted that in studying the effects of
Fox News, researchers should utilize the more accurate Nielsen data, and pay special attention
to the source of variation identifying the estimates and weigh the costs and benefits of using
availability in 2000 or channel positions as sources of variation in viewership of Fox News.
Both sources of variation are attractive on different dimensions.

          Again, the FNC channel position correlates negatively with viewership, with very similar
      magnitude as in the independently sampled zip code level data. Unfortunately, because the
      individual level data span only about one-half as many clusters (cable systems) as the zip-code
      level data, the cluster-robust F statistics fall below ten in most cases, and the first stage coef-
      ficient on the instrument falls to zero when county-year fixed effects are included. The sample
      in Table A11 includes all respondents, including satellite subscribers and those who subscribe
      to neither wired cable nor satellite television. We use the pooled-sample first stage because
      the second stage data set lacks information on individuals’ subscription choices. Section 4
      presents a first stage estimated among cable subscribers alone; among cable subscribers, the
      individual-level position effect is precise and consistently negative.
          In the individual level data, we can directly identify whether a respondent is a cable sub-
      scriber, a satellite subscriber, or neither.38 We therefore run the first stage individual-level
      regression restricted to only cable and satellite subscribers, and interact channel positions with
      an indicator for whether the viewer subscribes to satellite.


      D.2      Second Stage
      The individual-level regressions are directly analogous, with the exception that the outcome
      yizt is now an indicator for whether individual i states their intention to vote for the Republican
      presidential candidate in the election of year t:
  38
     Satellite subscribers make up about 18% of MediaMark respondents, and roughly 16% of MediaMark respondents
report subscribing to neither cable nor satellite television service.

 Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses (clustered by cable system). Instrument is the ordinal position of
 FNC on the local system. The omitted category for the availability dummies is systems where neither FNC nor
 MSNBC is available. Cable system controls include the total number of channels on the system and the number of
 broadcast channels on the system. “Individual” demographics are measured at the level of the individual respondent.
 “Extensive” demographics include all of the same individual-level measures plus all of the zip-code-level demographics
 included in the zip-code-level analysis.

            The first stage is estimated on all MediaMark/Simmons respondents. See first
            stage tables for description of instruments and control variables. Confidence inter-
            vals are generated from 500 independent STID-block-bootstraps of the first and
            second stage datasets. Reported lower and upper bounds give the central 95 per-
            cent interval of the relevant bootstrapped statistic. “Individual” demographics
            are measured at the level of the individual respondent. “Extensive” demograph-
            ics include all of the same individual-level measures plus all of the zip-code-level
            demographics included in the zip-code-level analysis.



   Comparing the two versions, the point estimate of the second-stage coefficient on FNC


                                                       63
viewing is higher in the individual-level regression. It is also much less precise, however; the
individual-level confidence interval entirely covers the zip code-level confidence interval. This
difference is reflective of both the greater power of the instrument in the zip code-level first
stage and the much greater predictability of zip code-level Republican vote shares as opposed
to individual vote intentions: R2 values in the zip code-level reduced form regression approach
0.85, as compared to 0.15 in the corresponding individual-level regression.
   There are two factors which temper the threat of misleading inference due to weak instru-
ments in the second stage. First, we are using a single instrument in the just-identified case.
Second, recalling the two-sample nature of the individual data, the intent-to-vote data span
many more clusters than the viewership data.


D.3      Reduced Form
With the individual level data, these correlations are only significant in the specifications with
state-year fixed effects; due to the relatively small number of clusters in this sample there is
insufficient within-county variation to estimate the position effects precisely.

       E      Construction of Channel Ideology Estimates
       Our estimates of each channel’s political ideology are generated by an adaptation of the method
       employed in Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010) to measure ideology of print newspapers. The
       method compares the use frequency of phrases in transcripts of the cable channel’s shows to
       the use frequency of the same phrases in floor speeches by members of Congress recorded in
       the Congressional Record.

       Text sources and transcript selection We downloaded all transcripts from any show
       appearing on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC during 2000-2013 that were available in the Lexis-
       Nexis database. Most of the highest-rated prime-time shows on all of the channels were
       available in Lexis, with one exception: Glenn Beck’s Fox News show, which aired from 2009-
       2011.39 We supplemented the Lexis transcripts by downloading transcripts of Glenn Beck’s
       Fox News show from historical versions of the Fox News website archived by the Internet
       Archive (archive.org). Table A15 lists the shows for which we were able to collect transcripts,
       by channel. For each show, we downloaded all available transcripts of episodes of that show.
           We also downloaded the 1998-2012 Congressional Record (CR) in its entirety from the
       US Government Publishing Office’s website (http://gpo.gov). From the raw HTML files we
       extracted every speech that could be attributed to an individual member of Congress.

       Pre-processing of text Both transcript and Congressional record text was pre-processed
       by removing a list of 184 common “stop words” such as “we,” “have,” “for,” and the like.
       The list of stop words matches that used by Gentzkow and Shapiro (2010). We then applied
       the Porter stemming algorithm to reduce variants of words to their common roots.40 For
       example, the words “beaches” and “beach” would both be stemmed to “beach.” Finally, a
       script counted the frequency of occurrence of every two word phrase that appears at least five
       times in total in the Congressional record in that year in the speech of every speaker.41 A
       two-word phrase is two stemmed words appearing next to each other (excluding stop words)
       in the same sentence.
  39
     The version of Mr. Beck’s show on CNN, which aired from 2006-2008, had transcripts available in the database.
  40
     We used an implementation of the Porter stemmer written in the Haskell language by Dmitry Antonyuk and
Mark Wotton: https://hackage.haskell.org/package/porter
  41
     A “speaker” in the TV transcripts is a show; in the Congressional record it is a member of Congress, either a
senator or representative.

       Choice of phrase set There are millions of two-word phrases which result from the phrase-
       counting algorithm described above. Most of these are of no value for distinguishing the
       partisanship of a a speaker. As a result, it is necessary to reduce the set of phrases considered
       to a manageable size, and to limit the number of “noise” phrases. We construct, for each phrase
       appearing in the Congressional Record, the Gentzkow-Shapiro partisanship statistic. We use
       the top 1000 “most partisan” phrases in each year according to this criterion, subject to the
       condition that the phrase must appear at least 20 times in total in the cable news transcripts
       in that year. We impose this criterion to weed out the (many) purely procedural phrases
       that appear in the Congressional Record, many of which appear highly partisan because they
       are spoken primarily by committee chairs, the House Speaker, and other members of the
       Congressional leadership, who by definition are all members of the majority party in the
       chamber.42 The result is a set of 1000 phrases for each year.

       Elastic-net regression For each speaker in both the CR and the transcripts, we compute
       the frequency of each phrase as the count of occurrences divided by the total number of
       two-word phrases (among all phrases, not just the set of 1000 selected in the previous set).
       We standardize all frequencies by subtracting the mean frequency (across all speakers) and
       dividing by the cross-speaker standard deviation of frequency of the phrase in that year. This
       scaling prevents phrases that are more common overall from being weighted more heavily in
       the elastic net objective.
          The standardized phrase frequencies of the set of 1000 phrases in each year for Congressional
       speakers are then input to an elastic-net regression (Zou and Hastie, 2005) where the dependent
       variable is the common-space DW-nominate first dimension score (McCarty et al., 1997) of
       the legislator. We restrict the sample for this regression to the set of legislators who use the
       phrases in the set of 1000 at least 100 times in total, which drops a few very infrequent speakers
       from the sample. We select the lasso parameter λ in each year by cross-validation, and set
       the parameter α to 0.01. Finally, the estimated coefficients from the fitted models are used to
       compute a predicted ideology for each show-year.

       Aggregation to channel-year level We aggregate the show-year-level predicted ideolo-
       gies to the channel-year level by a simple weighted average: shows in prime time get weight
       of two, and non-prime-time shows get weight of one. This weighting scheme approximately
  42
     Some examples of such phrases are “move (the) question,” “cloture motion,” “unanimous consent,” and “absence
(of a) quorum.”

reflects the cable news audience distribution across the two time slots. Finally, we apply a
moving-average smoothing filter to transform the resulting channel-year ideology estimates.
This filter has a window of three years; we assign weight of 1/2 to the current year’s estimate,
and 1/4 each to the previous and next year’s estimate.

F      Additional Regression Tables
F.1     MSNBC Analysis
This section contains analogous 2SLS results to those in section 4, where MSNBC viewership
is treated as the endogenous variable, either instead of or in addition to Fox News viewership.
Tables A16 and A17 show the first stage regression of MSNBC hours watched on cable channel
positions in the zip code level and individual level datasets, respectively.
    Tables A18 and A19 show single-instrument second-stage results with MSNBC viewership
instrumented by MSNBC position.
    Tables A20 and A21 show dual-instrument second-stage results with both FNC and MSNBC
viewership instrumented by FNC and MSNBC positions.
    Table A22 presents the analog to Table 7 for MSNBC. Here, the MSNBC cable effect is also
strongly negative. The effect on satellite subscribers is around one-tenth the size of the effect
on cable subscribers. We also present in Table A23 the analog of Table 6 but probing MSNBC
position instead of Fox News position. While most of the coefficients are re-assuring, MSNBC
position is significantly positively correlated with the predictable-by-demographics Republican
vote share. Taken alone, this would suggest some degree of endogenous positioning of MSNBC,
but an alternative explanation tempers this interpretation. The Fox News position displays a
coefficient of the same magnitude in Table 6. This suggests an alternative interpretation that
both news channel positions tend to be lower overall in less Republican areas, which would
bias the Fox News effect in the opposite direction of what we find.


F.2     Separate Specifications Year by Year
In Tables A24, A25, and A26, we run the reduced form and first stage separately by year,
as well as a pooled specification where all demographics interact with year dummy variables.
There is no zip-level reduced form year-by-year because those data only cover the 2008 election.
In the individual level reduced form (Table A24), the Fox News cable position coefficient is
negative in every specification, but only significant in the pooled specification and marginally
significant in 2004. Fox News position is negative and significant in every specification of the
year-by-year zip-level first stage (Table A25). In the individual level year-by-year first stage
(Table A26), the coefficient tends to be negative and noisy, though still negative and significant
in the pooled specification.

 Notes: Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses (clustered by cable system). Instrument is the ordinal position
 of MSNBC on the local system. The omitted category for the availability dummies is systems where neither FNC
 nor MSNBC is available. In Column (5), the specification conditions on the average MSNBC ratings among satellite
 subscribers in the same zip code. Cable system controls include the total number of channels on the system and
 the number of broadcast channels on the system, as well as an indicator for Nielsen collection mode (diary vs. set-
 top). “Basic” demographics include the racial, gender, age, income, educational, and urban/rural makeup of the zip
 code. “Extended” demographics adds information on the percentage of homeowners; median housing values, sizes,
 ages, and property tax rates; the fraction of the population receiving food stamps; median social security income;
 the fraction of veterans; the fractions of married, unmarried, and same-sex couples; the share of federal campaign
 contributions that went to Republican candidates in 1996; the Republican presidential share of the county in 1996;
 and the religious composition of the county. Observations are weighted by the number of survey individuals in the
 zipcode according to Nielsen.

 Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses (clustered by cable system). Instrument is the ordinal position of
 MSNBC on the local system. The omitted category for the availability dummies is systems where neither FNC nor
 MSNBC is available. Cable system controls include the total number of channels on the system and the number of
 broadcast channels on the system. “Individual” demographics are measured at the level of the individual respondent.
 “Extensive” demographics include all of the same individual-level measures plus all of the zip-code-level demographics
 included in the zip-code-level analysis.

 The first stage is estimated using viewership data for all Nielsen TV households. See first stage tables for description of instruments and
 control variables. Observations in the first stage are weighted by the number of survey individuals in the zipcode according to Nielsen.
 Confidence intervals are generated from 1000 independent STID-block-bootstraps of the first and second stage datasets. Reported lower
 and upper bounds give the central 95 percent interval of the relevant bootstrapped statistic.



         F.3      Turnout
         In Table A27, we check whether Fox News position correlates with a measure of turnout. We
         sum the zip code level votes cast across parties in the precinct level data, and divide this
         number by the age eighteen and over population from the Census at the zip code level.43 The
         coefficients on Fox News position tend to be small and noisy except with county fixed effects,
         where we see a significant negative coefficient on Fox News position. The results suggest that
         the persuasion estimates in our main specifications could be coming from both the conversion
         of swing voters and some additional turnout, though it is difficult to say with any precision.




  43
       We dropped any zip code whose implied turnout exceeded 1.

 The first stage is estimated using viewership data for all Nielsen TV households. See first stage tables for description of instruments and
 control variables. Observations in the first stage are weighted by the number of survey individuals in the zipcode according to Nielsen.
 Confidence intervals are generated from 1000 independent STID-block-bootstraps of the first and second stage datasets. Reported lower
 and upper bounds give the central 95 percent interval of the relevant bootstrapped statistic.



       G         More on Channel Positions
       Our main arguments for the validity of channel positions as instrumental variables for the
       effect of watching cable news on voting Republican consisted over correlating channel positions
       with observable variables: demographics (aggregated in the manner they predict voting and
       viewership), pre-Fox News political variables, and satellite viewership of Fox News, together
       with the institutional narrative of the period 1992-2000 as leading to effective randomness
       in channel position assignment. Most of these tests were reassuring, aside from the satellite
       placebo test on zip code level data, where we find a significant negative correlation with Fox
       News cable position, albeit one-third the size of the coefficient for cable subscribers, and no
       such effect on the individual level data. In this section, we further probe the validity for the
       instrumental variables assumption. First, we show the first stage and satellite placebo for a
       variety of similarly positioned channels. Second, we show support for the satellite placebo test,
       by showing that cable and satellite subscribers have similar demographics. Third, we examine
       whether Fox News viewership is correlated with nearby or future Fox News positions. Fourth,
       we show that Fox News and MSNBC channel positions are highly correlated with the best
       available position on the system at the time they were added.

      cent interval of the relevant bootstrapped statistic. “Individual” demographics
      are measured at the level of the individual respondent. “Extensive” demograph-
      ics include all of the same individual-level measures plus all of the zip-code-level
      demographics included in the zip-code-level analysis.

    the extensive demographic set is interacted with dummy variables for each year, allowing the
    demographic effects on voting to vary flexibly by year.


G.1      First Stage for other Cable Channels
In Table A28, we display the coefficients on own-channel position for a variety of other cable
channels. For each channel, we run a stacked regression where we interact cable channel
position with dummy variables for whether the individual subscribers to cable or to satellite.
As with the other checks on instrument validity, the results are mostly reassuring but not
perfect. 26 out of 32 channels have a significantly negative position effect on cable subscribers
at 99% confidence (2 more, for a total of 28 out of 32 at 95% confidence). 9 out of 32 have a
significantly negative cable channel position effect on satellite subscribers at 90% confidence
(only 2 at 99%), suggesting some degree of endogenous positioning for these channels.
   Figure A2 plots the growth in subscribers for a group of peer channels during this time pe-
riod. The top line shows ESPN, which was available on virtually every cable system. The other
channels in the graph all experienced substantial growth during this time period. Idiosyncra-
cies in the timing of contracts and system upgrades created variation in channel positions for a
given channel across locations. In some cases, if Fox News was being added to a system facing
capacity constraints, its channel position was determined by the position of the channel it was
replacing.

                                                                  83
      G.2      Cable and Satellite Subscriber Observable Correlations
      Across locations, satellite subscriber characteristics correlate strongly with cable subscriber
      characteristics. Table A29 shows the regression coefficients of mean satellite subscriber char-
      acteristics on mean cable subscriber characteristics in the same cable system territory, nearly
      all of which are positive and large. Since the means of these characteristics are measured with
      sampling error - as they are constructed from the television viewership survey samples - the
      OLS coefficients are attenuated. In the table, we address this measurement error problem in
      two ways.44 First, we progressively restrict the regression to markets with more and more sur-
      vey respondents as these markets will have less sampling error. Second, we instrument for the
      mean cable characteristic with lead and lagged mean cable characteristic. Survey respondents
      are sampled independently from year to year. Consistent with measurement error, the coeffi-
      cients generally tend upwards to one when we restrict to system-years with more respondents.
      Furthermore, the IV coefficients are generally very close to one.
          In the same vein, we can look directly at viewership patterns. Satellite viewers watch
      1.2 fewer minutes per week of Fox News Channel on average relative to cable viewers (on
      an overall mean of 90 minutes). At the bottom of Table A29, we regress predicted mean
      viewership of satellite subscribers (predicted from demographics) on that of cable subscribers.
      We also regress the cable system territory mean residual viewership of satellite subscribers (net
      of demographics) on the cable system territory mean residual viewership of cable subscribers.
      Across the board, cable and satellite subscribers within the same cable system territory display
      strong correlations of both demographics and viewing behavior.


      G.3      Future and Nearby Channel Positions
      We examine whether future cable news channel position predicts current viewership condi-
      tional on current position. If political tastes are shifting over time, and channel positions
      are endogenous but sticky, then future position should predict current viewership. A location
      which has become more Republican would watch more Fox News, but, if channel positions
      were endogenously tailored and sticky, their channel position may not have adjusted yet, so
      future position, after adjustment, would be informative about current ideology. The zip-level
      results for Fox News are in Table A30. Position in 2008 does not predict viewership in 2005
      conditional on position in 2005.
  44
     One could also dis-attenuate the coefficients as the variance induced by sampling is known. This exercise is
complicated because each cable system-year has different sampling variance.

         Note: The first column of coefficients uses all cable system territory-years. These coefficients
         are attenuated because the mean cable is constructed from samples of survey respondents
         which can be as few as 2 per cable system territory-year. The second column of coefficients
         restricts to those with more than ten surveyed respondents. The third column of coefficients
         restricts to those with more than fifty survey respondents. The fourth column of coefficients
         restricts to those with more than 100 survey respondents. The final column of coefficients
         are uses lead and lagged means of cable subscribers as instrumental variables, as respondents
         are sampled independently from year to year.

 Cluster-robust standard errors in parentheses (clustered by cable system). The outcome is Fox News minutes per
 week in 2005 among cable subscribers, all households, and satellite subscribers, respectively in columns (1)-(2), (3)-
 (4), and (5)-(6). We include only zip codes that had access to Fox News in 2005, and regress hours per week on both
 the actual position in 2005, and the future position in the same zip code in 2008. Observations are weighted by the
 number of survey individuals in the zipcode according to Nielsen.


          We also examine whether Fox News position in nearby systems predicts local viewership.
       If unobserved political tastes were uncorrelated with local positions, then they should also
       be uncorrelated with nearby positions even though ideology and demographics are correlated
       nearby. For each zip code-year in the data, we found the nearest zip code in the data for that
       year which wasn’t in the same cable system. The results are in Table A31. We do not see a
       significant correlation of nearby position on local viewership in our preferred specifications. In
       Table A32, we see that nearby positions also do not correlate with 2008 McCain vote share.


       G.4      Best Available Channel Position
       We demonstrate one example of this historical influence in Table A33. We regress the ordinal
       positions of Fox News and MSNBC on the system’s best available ordinal position in 1998,
       along with a control for the overall size of the system - its total number of channels.45 The
       best available position in 1998 is a strong predictor of the current position, even though the
       positioning data here extends through 2008. A system’s channel configuration prior to the
  45
     Our lineup data begins in 1998, and hence we restrict the sample for this regression to cable systems that did not
have Fox/MSNBC in 1998. “Best available” is defined as the lowest open slot (unoccupied by an existing channel)
in the region of the lineup dedicated to cable (i.e. non-network and non-local-access) channels. We define the cable
region by locating the positions of CNN, ESPN, TNT, and The Discovery Channel, and consider any open slot above
at least one of those channels to be available.

H       Solution Algorithm for Viewership Problem
Define ρict as the Lagrange multipliers associated with the non-negativity constraints on Tict .
By complementary slackness, if ρict > 0 then Tict = 0. From the first order condition, ρict =
λit − γict where λit is the Lagrange multiplier on consumer i’s budget constraint. Therefore,
Tict can be zero if and only if γict < λit .
    For all the channels with Tict > 0, λit = γict /(1 + Tict ). Additionally, each consumer faces
                           P
a time-budget constraint, c Tict = B, where B is the total time available (in our scaling, the
number of hours in a week: 168). This gives a system of equations with solution:

                                              1 + c+ γic+ t
                                        λit =
                                                 B + C+
    where c+ are the indices of the channels that i watches a positive amount, and C + is the
total number of such channels. Given this result, the iterative solution is to replace the γict ’s
                     P
below the cutoff (1 + c γc )/(B + C) with zero. If there were any γict ’s below this threshold,
we now have a new cutoff defined by the remaining positive γict ’s, and we repeat the process
again. There are at most C steps of this until we hit the final set of positive γict ’s, at which
point we compute the times watched as:

                                                 γict
                             Tict = (T + C + ) P          − 1(γict > 0)
