                                             ABSTRACT

This paper explores the effects of relative food prices on body weight and body fat over time in China.
We study a cohort of 15,000 adults from over 200 communities in China, using the longitudinal China
Health and Nutrition Survey (1991-2006). While we find that decreases in the price of energy-dense
foods have consistently led to elevated body fat, this price effect does not always hold for body weight.
These findings suggest that changes in food consumption patterns induced by varying food prices
can increase percentage body fat to risky levels even without substantial weight gain. In addition, food
prices and subsidies could be used to encourage healthier food consumption patterns and to curb obesity.

1    Background

Obesity is a condition under which the accumulation of body fat is high enough to adversely
affect health (World Health Organization, 2000). It is a risk factor for an array of non-
communicable diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, diabetes, and
certain types of cancer (World Health Organization, 2000).

In industrialized countries, obesity has already been a serious public health issue. In the United
States, two thirds of the adult population are overweight, and half of them are obese 1 in 2004
(Ogden et al., 2006). In fact, obesity and being overweight has become the second leading cause
of preventable death in the U. S., accounting for 400,000 deaths in 2000 (Mokdad et al., 2004).
Meanwhile in developing countries, an emerging nutrition transition is leading a rapid spread of
overweight and obese individuals. China is no exception: between 1992 and 2002, the fraction of
Chinese who are either overweight or obese had increased from 14.6% to 21.8% – a growth of
49% (Wang et al., 2007). What is even more worrisome is that, even without a BMI greater than
25 or 30, individuals can still be at risk for CVD and diabetes, if they have a high level of body
fat – a situation that applies to a considerable portion of the Asian populations (Deurenberg-Yap
et al., 2002; He et al., 2001; World Health Organization, 2004). Thus, the magnitude of obesity
as a public health threat might be underestimated if the BMI cut-off points of 25 and 30 are the
only standard applied to identify overweight and obese individuals.

This paper models the two main culprits of obesity, energy-dense diets and physical inactivity,
with the main focus on the former, and measures the magnitude of their effects on obesity.
Specifically, it explores whether variations in food prices can have any effects on obesity by
influencing individuals' diet patterns. Given that humans have innate preferences for fat
(Drewnowski et al., 1991), we hypothesize that when the price of cooking oil decreases relative
to other foods, individuals will consume more of it. And because cooking oil is the most energy-

dense 2 of all foods, such a food substitution can result in a much higher level of calorie intake,
which subsequently leads to more body fat when excess calories are stored in the body. Findings
in current literature support this hypothesis with empirical evidence. Lakdawalla and Philipson
(2002) studied US individuals from 1976 to 1994 and showed that falling food prices (as
compared to other commodities) due to technological innovation accounted for 40% of the
growth in BMI within that time period. And Chou et al. (2004) found that reductions in the real
and relative prices of fast foods (which are typically high-fat) and availability of fast-food
restaurants had a significant impact on obesity. However, there is little research on comparing
effects within food categories (such as oils, meats, grains, and vegetables) and there is a lack of
literature on effects of food prices on obesity in developing countries including China, where the
growth of obesity prevalence is new and fast-paced.




2     Theoretic framework: how relative prices affect diet choice

2.1    The optimal case

Consider an individual who tries to maximize her utility from food consumption. Suppose she
values the amount and taste of food, so high-fat food adds to the joy of eating, and the more
calories the better. However, she is also concerned with her physical image and health status.
Let's further assume that she is informed that both excess calorie intake and a high percentage of
calories from fat will increase her body fat and subsequently the likelihood of developing certain
diseases such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition, she understands that although she might
damage her physical image by gaining weight from consuming too many calories, she might not
gain any noticeable weight by consuming a high percentage of calories from fat, if she can limit

                                               𝑐𝑐 = 𝑐𝑐 𝑓𝑓 + 𝑐𝑐 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛                          (1.3)
                                                             𝑐𝑐 𝑓𝑓
                                                     𝑓𝑓 =                                    (1.4)
                                                              𝑐𝑐

In this model, 𝑉𝑉 is the utility from consuming calories, in which 𝑐𝑐 denotes the individual's calorie
intake. We assume the more calories she consumes, the happier she is, so 𝑉𝑉 ′ (∙) > 0. Here,
macro-nutrients such as carbohydrates, protein, and fat all contribute to calorie intake.

𝑓𝑓 denotes percentage calories from fat. Given humans’ innate preferences for fat, we assume the
higher 𝑓𝑓 is, the happier the individual will be. So 𝑌𝑌 ′ (∙) > 0, where 𝑌𝑌 is the utility from
consuming fat.

𝑊𝑊 is body weight and it is determined by the amount of excess calories the individual has, and
how physically active she is. The assumption is that a high body weight is undesirable and the
individual would aim at maintaining a normal weight by either limiting total calorie intake or
exercising adequately. 𝑐𝑐 denotes the minimum number of calories one needs to sustain life, so
𝑐𝑐 − 𝑐𝑐 is the difference between total calorie intake and minimum amount required. 𝑎𝑎 denotes
additional calories expended due to physical activity, so 𝑐𝑐 − 𝑐𝑐 − 𝑎𝑎 is the amount of excess
calorie intake. According to our assumption, 𝑊𝑊𝑐𝑐′ > 0, and 𝑊𝑊𝑎𝑎′ < 0.

𝐷𝐷 denotes obesity-induced diseases. It’s a function of both weight and body fat. Body fat, 𝐹𝐹, is a
                             ′
function of 𝑓𝑓, so we have 𝐷𝐷𝑊𝑊 > 0 and 𝐷𝐷𝐹𝐹′ > 0.

According to the assumptions we also have                        > 0,                     > 0, and              < 03. Further, if 𝐷𝐷(∙)

is addictively separable in 𝑊𝑊 and 𝐹𝐹, we also have                           < 0.

In the constraints, 𝐼𝐼 is the individual's total disposable income for food. Consumption of other
goods is not modeled here, given the assumption that utilities from consuming food and
consuming other goods are additively separable, and we focus only on utilities from food
consumption in this model. 𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓 is the relative price of fat per calorie. We set the per-calorie price
of non-fat food (𝑃𝑃𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 ) to be 1. We assume that fat is a normal good so when price is lower the
individual will consume more. Because 𝑐𝑐 𝑓𝑓 = 𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐, and 𝑐𝑐 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 = (1 − 𝑓𝑓)𝑐𝑐, we can rewrite the budget
constraint as 𝐼𝐼 = 𝑃𝑃𝑓𝑓 𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓 + (1 − 𝑓𝑓)𝑐𝑐. Then we have 𝑐𝑐 =                         𝐼𝐼
                                                                                              , and 𝑐𝑐 is then a function of 𝑓𝑓:

𝑐𝑐 = 𝛾𝛾(𝑓𝑓). Substitute this 𝛾𝛾(𝑓𝑓) into the utility function, we have


                        max 𝑈𝑈[𝑉𝑉�𝛾𝛾(𝑓𝑓) − 𝑐𝑐�, 𝑌𝑌(𝑓𝑓), 𝑊𝑊(𝛾𝛾(𝑓𝑓)), 𝐷𝐷(𝑊𝑊(𝛾𝛾(𝑓𝑓)), 𝐹𝐹(𝑓𝑓))]                                (1.6)

Let 𝑓𝑓 ∗ be the optimal value of 𝑓𝑓 that satisfies this FOC condition. Therefore, 𝑈𝑈(𝑓𝑓 ∗ ) is the
optimal level of utility for the individual achieved by consuming 𝑓𝑓 ∗ percent of calories from fat.
And ∀𝑓𝑓 ≠ 𝑓𝑓 ∗ : 𝑈𝑈(𝑓𝑓) < 𝑈𝑈(𝑓𝑓 ∗ ), given there are no multiple equilibria.

2.2     The suboptimal case

But, what would happen if the individual were to only observe weight, but not her body fat? This
is quite common because it is much easier to weigh oneself than to get a direct measure of body
fat. Thus, it is possible that the individual would not achieve the optimal level of utility, if she
did not either observe or care about her body fat. In this case, she is ignorant about the potential

3
  Here it assumes the individual has a normal weight at time 0, and that an increase in body weight lowers utility.
Granted, if the individual is underweight, the utility will instead rise when body weight increases. In either case, the
sign of the first order condition will not change the conclusion of the model.

                                                                                                                                   5 of 39

3    Data

We employ the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS), which is an on-going panel of
individuals from over 200 communities in 9 provinces. 4 CHNS collects longitudinal data on
demographics, anthropometric measurements, health indicators, and community-level
commodity prices. It began in 1989 and followed the participants subsequently in 1991, 1993,
1997, 2000, 2004, and 2006. we use data from all the waves except 1989 because most food
prices in 1989 were determined by the central government rather than market-driven and only a
limited sample of individuals were interviewed for health and nutrition information in that year.

For each wave, we limit the sample to adult individuals who are between 18 and 75 years old at
the time of interview. For women, we exclude the waves when they were pregnant, to avoid
irrelevant weight shocks. This results in 37,816 individual-year observations from 233

 The nine participating provinces include Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Shandong in the northeast, Jiangsu in the east,
Henan, Hubei, and Hunan in the middle, Guizhou in the southwest, and Guangxi in the south. Heilongjiang was not
surveyed in 1991 and 1993, and Liaoning was not surveyed in 1997. (Source:
http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/design/sample.html).

                                                                                                                 6 of 39
communities in total. It is an unbalanced dataset, and there are about 5,000 - 8,000 individuals in
each interview year, 5 and 15,649 individuals in total.

The key outcome is obesity, or adiposity. Obesity is defined as the condition of having an
abnormally high proportion of body fat (National Institutes of Health, 1998, p174). In order to
better capture effects on obesity, we adopt two measures to indicate the extent of body fat: body
mass index (BMI) and triceps skinfold thickness (TSF), both of which are commonly used for
measuring adiposity (Must et al., 1991).

BMI is traditionally used to classify obesity as a surrogate measure for percentage body fat,
mainly because it is convenient to obtain and easy to interpret. It is defined as weight in
kilograms divided by the square of height in meters: BMI = weight(kg)/height squared (m2). An
individual with a BMI ≥ 25 is classified as overweight and is further considered obese if the BMI
≥ 30 (National Institutes of Health, 1998). To construct BMI from the data, we use weight values
from all interview waves and the first normal, non-missing height. 6 BMI is easy to calculate and
widely used. However, because it is derived from only height and weight, it does not convey
information on body composition, which is defined as the ratio of lean body mass to body fat
mass. Thus, its accuracy in measuring body fat varies by muscularity, age, gender (Gallagher et
al., 1996), and ethnicity (Calle et al., 1999). Specifically, BMI tends to overestimate body fat in
muscular subjects and to underestimate percentage body fat of the elderly and of certain ethnicity
groups such as Asians (Deurenberg et al., 1998). Due to this limitation, BMI can be a weak
indicator for adiposity of certain population sub-groups (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008;
Deurenberg-Yap et al., 2002; Piers et al., 2000). In fact, overweight and mild obesity indicated
by BMI alone have shown to not be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases
(Romero-Corral et al., 2006).

Concerning the limitation of BMI as a proxy for obesity, we use a second measure for body fat -
TSF. TSF is a vertical skinfold measured at the posterior midpoint between the acromion and the


5
 Numbers of observations vary by year due to attrition and addition of participating individuals and provinces.

 Height is measured in every wave but we found there are more abnormal values in the latest waves of 2004 and
2006. Because the height of an adult is pretty stable (in this sample the decrease in height is about 0.003cm every
additional year of age), for each individual, we use the first non-missing height value that is within the normal range.
                                                                                                               7 of 39
olecranon. It directly measures subcutaneous body fat, and is widely used to measure body
composition in clinical studies. It is considered a more appropriate measure for obesity and body
fat than BMI (Rolland-Cachera et al., 1997). Moreover, unlike BMI, TSF, or the logarithm of
TSF, is consistently shown to be a linear function of body fat (Durnin and Womersley, 1974;
Lean et al., 1996). For example, Lean et al. (1996) showed that percent body fat increases by
0.76 percentage points for men and 0.67 percentage points for women, when there is a 1mm
increase in TSF, holding all else equal. The limitation of TSF is that it does not directly calibrate
visceral fat, and thus might underestimate the total body fat mass in obese individuals with high
visceral fat (Williams et al., 1992, p604). Therefore we discard the very few records where BMI
is higher than 35, and limit the analysis to non-morbidly obese individuals (with a BMI of 35 or
higher). In addition, we also refer to the Anthropometric Reference Data from NHANES III
(1988-1994) 7 and limit TSF values to a reasonable range of 3 – 40 mm.

The five key independent variables are food prices, in relative or absolute terms. They are: (1)
price of staple oil relative to staple food, (2) price of staple oil to lean pork, (3) price of staple oil
to commonly consumed vegetables, (4) price of staple oil by itself, and (5) price of staple oil to
government-recommended intake of protein and carbohydrate, respectively.

These price variables are mainly relative and absolute prices of cooking oil. We construct the
prices by taking into consideration how food is usually prepared and consumed. Grains (staple
food), meats, and vegetables are the main food sources, and they are usually prepared with a
certain amount of cooking oil. Because cooking oil is the most caloric of all foods, the fraction of
oil used in food preparation helps determine the sum of calories a meal contains. And because
the amount of oil to use in a dish is often discretionary, it allows variations in the portion of oil,
and therefore variations in percentage calories from oil intake.

We use the five oil price variables separately, each in a different regression model. When the key
regressor covers certain food categories, prices of other main food categories are also being
controlled for. For example, if the price of staple oil relative to staple food is the key regressor,

                                                                                                   8 of 39
then the price of lean pork and the price of commonly-consumed vegetables are being controlled
for. And if the price of staple oil by itself is the key regressor, then the price of staple food, the
price of lean pork, and the price of vegetables are being controlled for.

In these price effects models, oil and other foods are considered complementary to each other.
Our hypothesis is that consumption of foods corresponds to how expensive the foods are, and
when the relative price of oil decreases, people will choose to use more oil when preparing meals,
and vice versa. Subsequently, higher percentage of oil intake leads to more adiposity.

By analyzing five separate models, we can test whether the price effects are persistent and robust,
and can obtain more information on how the magnitude of price effects changes when the
comparison group is different. Below we describe in details how prices of each food category are
coded.

Out of all edible oils where price information is available, three (soybean, rapeseed, and peanut)
are identified as staple oils as they account for more than 80% of the edible oil consumption in a
certain region of China (Fang and Beghin, 2002). Accordingly, we assign each participating
province the price of its staple oil, depending on the region it belongs to. Namely, it is soybean
oil for the northeastern provinces, including Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong; rapeseed oil for
the provinces in the middle and west, including Jiangsu, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guizhou; peanut
oil for the southern province Guangxi.

The prices of staple food/grains are also region-specific, because the north and south have
different food staples. We use the average price of wheat and noodle for the northern region
(Liaoning, Heilongjiang, Shandong, Henan), and the average price of rice and noodle for the
south (Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou).




                                                                                                 9 of 39
We use lean pork to represent meats because it is the main source of animal protein in China. For
vegetables, we use the average price of all the vegetables available in the survey: cabbage, rape 8,
and “other commonly eaten vegetables".

The last price variable is the ratio of the price of staple oil relative to the price of a combination
of protein and carbohydrates intake. We construct this key variable by acknowledging protein
and carbohydrate as the main contributors of a typical meal in terms of calories. In theory, we
can either model intake with real consumption patterns or with ideal proportions. Real
consumption data change frequently and are hard to obtain, so we use ideal proportions by
referring to the Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents 2007 by the Chinese Nutrition Society,
in which the recommended daily intake of meats and gains in terms of calories for adults is about
1:2 to 1:3. In the analysis we use three patterns of intake combinations, 1:3, 1:2, and 1:1, mainly
to check robustness of the price effects. We will describe in more detail in the results section but
the three price ratios return similar and comparable coefficients on obesity. So due to space
limitation, we only show the price ratio of 1:2 in this paper.

                                                                                    𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜       𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜        𝑃𝑃𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜
To summarize, these five food price variables can be written as:                                            ,                           ,                            ,

For all food categories, we use free market prices by default, and substitute with either state store
market prices (from all interviews occurred in 1991, 1993, and 1997) or large store retail prices
(from interviews occurred in 2000, 2004, and 2006) wherever free market prices are missing. We
refer to the national food price data published by the Chinese Department of Agriculture, 9 in
order to identify and to exclude abnormal price values as a way of data quality control.

Besides the key variables, we include covariates such as gender, age, age squared, type of
residence (urban or rural), education attainment, income levels, physical activity levels, and year
dummies.

We construct five levels of education attainment: (1) no education, (2) elementary school, (3)
middle school, (4) high school diploma or equivalent (including technological and vocational
school education), and (5) bachelor’s degree and beyond.

There are two types of income variables in CHNS: personal income and household income. we
use household income divided by household size to calculate household income per person,
because (1) there are significantly fewer missing data points in the variable of household income
than in personal income; (2) food preparation and consumption often do not vary within the
household level in China, and per capita household income can better capture the level of
disposal income for food than personal income.

Physical activity levels are important factors to include because they directly affect obesity.
There are five levels of physical activity available in CHNS, based on how strenuous an
individual’s job is. We re-categorize them into three levels: light, moderate, and heavy, mainly to
avoid a potential lack of power due to a limited number of observations in certain activity levels.
“Light” includes very light activities such as sedentary office work, and light activities such as
jobs that have to be completed while standing, like those of a salesperson’s or of a teacher’s.
“Moderate” includes occupations such as student, electrician, and metal worker. “Heavy”
includes heavy and very heavy activities, covering occupations such as farmer, dancer, athlete,
miner, and logger.

Summary statistics are shown in Table 1, for the whole sample, and for the female and male
subsamples. As we can see, there are about equal numbers of men and women. Rural residents
constitute two-thirds of the sample, and urban residents one-third. Obesity-wise, both females
and males have an average of BMI around 22.5, while females have a slightly higher index. In
contrast, there is a much more distinctive difference between men and women in terms of
TSF/body fat. Females have a TSF of 15.91 mm, 37% higher than that of men. The difference in

                                                                                            11 of 39
body fat is nonetheless expected to a certain extent, due to biological differences between men
and women.

The food prices provide a basic idea on how much each food item costs (note that they are a
pooled average over a time period of 15 years). Lean pork is the most expensive of all, with the
mean at 7 yuan per 500g. The second most expensive is staple oil, which costs slightly more than
half of the price of lean pork. Staple food, representative of flour, rice, and noodles, cost about
1.2 yuan per 500g. The least expensive is vegetables, costing about half a yuan per 500g.

In terms of physical activities, almost half of all the individuals belong to the “heavy” category,
mainly because most of the interviewees are rural residents, and among them many are farmers.

Perhaps the most striking demographic is education attainment. Only about 23% of all
interviewees have an education attainment higher than or equivalent to a high school diploma,
and only one in twenty interviewees have a bachelor’s degree or higher. Males are more
educated than women. 85% of males have at least some years of education, but only two-thirds
of the females do.

Below we describe the time trend of the key regressors and obesity outcomes of interest, in
addition to the mean values for the whole time period presented in Table 1.

Figure 1 shows the percentage changes of three relative oil prices from 1991 to 2006, including
price of oil relative to staple food, price of oil relative to lean pork, and price of oil relative to
vegetables. All food prices in nominal terms are increasing every year (not shown in the figure),
due to inflation and economic growth, but the rate of increase in oil prices is much lower than in
the other three foods that the relative prices of oil unanimously decrease over time. If we use
1991 as the reference year, the percentage decrease in the relative prices of oil range from 24%
in the price of oil relative to lean pork to 58% in the price of oil relative to vegetables in 2006.
There is also a 35% decrease in the price of oil relative to staple food. The price ratio of oil to
vegetables has most prominent variation of all: staple cooking oil was more than 13 times more
expensive than commonly-consumed vegetables back in 1991, and that ratio has reduced to a
little over 6 in 2006 (numbers not shown in the figure).
                                                                                                 12 of 39
Within the same time period, the prevalence of overweight and obesity skyrocketed by the
definition of BMI cutoffs: the fraction of overweight (25≤BMI<30) individuals increased from
12.4% to 23.5%, and the fraction of obese (BMI ≥ 30) individuals rose from 1.1% to 3.2%.

However, in continuous terms, the trend does not look as prominent, because one unit change in
BMI often means a substantial change in body weight. In Figure 2, it shows the trend of BMI and
TSF from 1991 to 2006. (Note: the figure is not age-adjusted but the general increasing trend
holds true either way.) The left chart shows changes over time in absolute terms, in which the
mean BMI started at around 21.8 in 1991 and grew to 23.2 in 2006 (a1.4-point increase), and the
mean TSF increased from 11.4mm in 1991 to almost 16.7mm in 2006. The chart on the right is
the percentage changes over time. BMI is 6.5% higher in 2006 than in 1991. The increase in TSF
is more substantial: it was 46.7% higher in 2006 compared to the 1991 level. Could this mean the
growth of adiposity is faster-paced than that of body weight among Chinese individuals 1991-
2006?

Also, was there a connection between the decrease in relative oil prices and the rise in obesity
between 1991 and 2006? While the general time trend suggests that relative prices of energy-
dense foods are negatively associated with obesity, the correlation could well have been due to
chance. So Figure 3 further looks at how changes in BMI and TSF are associated with relative oil
prices at the community level. It tests whether the correlation between food prices and obesity
would still remain strong, with the assumption that communities are heterogeneous enough that
if “chance” had only occurred at the national level it would not have influenced on both prices
and obesity at a finer level.

Figure 3 shows two scatter plots with a common x-axis – percentage change in the price of oil
relative to recommended protein and carbohydrate intake (or recommended meal in short). The
plot on the left depicts the relationship of price with percentage change in BMI on the y-axis.
Every plus sign in the plot represents one community. The plot on the right shows the correlation
between percentage change in TSF and percentage change in the relative price of oil. Similarly,
every circle represents one community. The majority of the communities experienced a decrease
in the relative oil price and a rise in BMI and TSF, resembling the general trend. However a few

                                                                                           13 of 39
of them witnessed an increase in the relative oil price and a drop in BMI and TSF, which is the
opposite of the bigger picture, suggesting heterogeneity at the community level. In both scatter
plots, the relationship between the relative oil price and obesity is negative and statistically
significant, but the downward slope is steeper for TSF, or body fat, than for body weight.




4    Methods

In this section, we will describe the analyses we employed to explore a causal relationship
between food prices and obesity, which involve a series of food price effects regressions at the
individual person level. To test whether the effects are persistent and robust, we use all the
possible model specifications including pooled ordinary least squares regressions (OLS), random
effects (RE) models, and fixed effects (FE) models. For all the regression models, obesity is a
function of community-level relative oil prices, and individual person-level characteristics that
can be time-invariant or time-varying, such as age, gender, education attainment, type of
residence, physical activity levels, and year fixed effects.

“Obesity” as the outcome is measured separately by continuous variables BMI and TSF, in levels
and logs, for each individual 𝑖𝑖 in community 𝑗𝑗 at time 𝑡𝑡. Taking the FE model as an example,
“price” is the price of oil relative to staple food, to lean pork, to vegetables, to recommended
meal, or by itself, respectively. 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the set of individual characteristics. 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 is the time fixed
effect. 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 is the individual fixed effect, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the error term. Notation-wise, please see
Equation (1.9) with BMI being the outcome of interest.

                             𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1.9)
When TSF is used as the outcome of obesity, for each model specification we estimate two
regressions, one with BMI being a covariate, and one without. Please see Equations (1.10) and
(1.11). This is because in the data, although BMI and TSF are both measures for obesity, they are
not perfect substitutes for each other. In fact, the correlation between the two is only 0.45.



                                                                                                              14 of 39
Therefore, by controlling for BMI when the outcome is TSF, we are able to see whether body fat
would still be affected by food prices when body weight is held constant.

                               𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖            (1.10)
                     𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽𝑘𝑘 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽3 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜏𝜏𝑡𝑡 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   (1.11)
In all models we estimate the coefficients with heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors clustered
at the community level. This is the strictest assumption one can make with the dataset. Bertrand
et al. (2004) suggested that even in differences-in-differences models (FE models with time fixed
effects in this case), the standard deviation of the estimated treatment effects might be
underestimated in the presence of serial correlation, when conventional standard errors are used.
To be most cautious in interpreting the price effects, we use heteroscedasticity-robust standard
errors clustered at the community level. Compared to the conventional standard errors, these
clustered robust standard errors do not change point estimates of the coefficients, but often
produce much larger standard errors and therefore decrease the likelihood for a coefficient to be
statistically significant. However, this is necessary for correcting heteroscedasticity and serial
correlation in at the community level where variation in the key regressors – food prices occurs.




5   Results

Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, and Table 5 show the effects on BMI and TSF by the price of staple
oil relative to staple food, price of staple oil relative to lean pork, price of staple oil relative to
vegetables, price of staple oil, and price of staple oil relative to recommended meal, respectively.
All the regressions shown are log-log models, partly because it is easier to interpret the
coefficients as price elasticities. In each table, there are six regressions. They are listed side by
side for easy comparisons between treatment effects on body weight and that on body fat. The
first three on the left are on the outcome of BMI, and the other three are on the outcome of TSF
with BMI being controlled for. Regressions with the outcome of TSF without BMI being
included are analyzed but not included in the tables because (1) the price effects on body fat do
not differ significantly when BMI is added as a control variable, and (2) space is limited.

                                                                                                                         15 of 39
For each outcome, an OLS, a RE, and a FE model is shown. Regression models in levels are also
analyzed. The coefficients estimated have the same expected sign and the statistical significance
is comparable to that in the log-log models. Those results are not shown due to space limitation,
but are available upon request.

Across all model specifications, relative oil prices are generally shown to be negatively
associated with TSF, and thus body fat, except in the FE model of oil price relative to vegetables.
This confirms the hypothesis that when oil prices are lower, body fat will increase. We deduce
that consumption of staple oil and energy-dense foods goes up as a response to changes in oil
prices. This middle step, changes in food consumption, is not demonstrated in the reduced-form
regressions, but it is reasonable to assume so because it is well documented elsewhere. Ng et al.
(2008) found that increased consumption of cooking oil at the individual-person level was
associated with decreasing prices – empirical evidence from the same CHNS dataset but with a
shorter panel, from 1991 to 2000.

In contrast, the expected negative treatment effects on BMI only appear in some model
specifications, all of which OLS regressions. Those effects vanish in the RE and FE regressions.
However, the key regressor, price of oil relative to vegetables, appears to be an outlier with a
positive and significant effect on body weight, which we will discuss in more detail when we
describe results from Table 4.

In Table 2, there are six log-log models with one key regressor: the relative price of staple oil to
staple food. In the three models on the left with BMI being the outcome, we see that the key
regressor does not appear to have any treatment effects on body weight. The sign is negative in
the OLS model, which is expected, but it flips in RE and FE models, and is never statistically
significant. However, the effects of non-food price control variables are reasonably in
accordance with common beliefs. A moderate or heavy physical activity level is associated with
less body weight as compared to light. Age and age squared are strong predictors for body
weight, suggesting non-linear, quadratic age effects. Income is also positively associated with
body weight, except the effects fade away in the FE model. In the OLS and RE model we are
also able to see the effects of individual-specific, time-invariant variables such as type of

                                                                                                16 of 39
residence, and gender. Both being an urban resident and a female are positively associated with
body weight. Education attainment levels are included in the regressions but the coefficients are
not shown here because most times they do not appear to be statistically significant, or
interesting. Year fixed effects are considerable and statistically significant in all regressions.
They are not shown here either because without further efforts we are not able to isolate and
specify effects of individual events happened in those years that had an influence on obesity.

Still in Table 2, the three regressions on the right are on the outcome of TSF, or body fat. There
appears to be significant price effects on body fat in all three models, although the magnitude
wanes when model specifications make more stringent assumptions about the data. The price
coefficient is -0.15 in OLS, -0.13 in RE, and -.08 in FE. But what do price effects imply?

Suppose in one community, the price of staple food is 4 per 500 gram, and the unit price of
staple oil is 8. The relative price of staple oil to staple food is 8÷4= 2. Then, if the price of staple
oil increases from 8 to 9, while the price of staple food increases from 4 to 5, the price of staple
oil to staple food will change to 9÷5= 1.8. And that is a (1.8-2) ÷ 2 = -10% change from the
original relative price. In the OLS model, holding all else equal, a 10% decrease in the price of
staple oil relative to staple food leads to a 1.5% increase in TSF. With the same scenario, the
treatment effect is reduced to a 1.3% increase in TSF in the RE model, and a 0.8% increase in the
FE model.

Although the treatment effects are smaller in the FE model than in the OLS and RE models, they
are in general much more reliable point estimates. There are a few reasons for that. First, in order
for OLS estimators to be consistent, the error term has to be i.i.d. (independent and identically
distributed), or in other words, random, and uncorrelated with the control variables, which is an
ideal case that often does not exist in the real world. Second, RE models a composite error term
(𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) instead of identifying each individual effect like FE model does, assuming
orthogonality between individual effect 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 and control variables 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .


However, unobservable individual characteristics absorbed by 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 can be correlated with observed
variables and can lead to biased point estimates. There are at least two ways to test whether a RE

                                                                                                17 of 39
model produces consistent results. One is to run a FE model where 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 will be estimated, and
check the correlation between 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 and 𝑋𝑋𝑋𝑋. If the correlation is strong, it means that the
orthogonality assumption a RE model makes is invalid, and therefore the RE estimator is
inconsistent. If the correlation is weak or close to zero, then both the FE and the RE estimators
are consistent, while the RE model is more efficient. The other way is to run both RE and FE
models and conduct a Hausman test to see whether we can reject the null hypothesis that the RE
estimator is consistent. We use the first method to evaluate whether the RE estimator is
appropriate, because the statistic is automatically calculated for the regression model by Stata
when a FE model is being estimated. In this specific FE model with price of staple oil relative to
staple food being the key regressor, the correlation between individual fixed effects and control
variables is -0.9988. The absolute value is very close to 1, suggesting the orthogonality
assumption is invalid, and that the FE model should be more appropriate in estimating the price
effects. In fact, the correlation between 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 and control variables 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in all the other FE models
estimated is much close to 1 in absolute value, similar to the current example, so from now on,
we will focus mainly on interpreting the FE estimators for all key regressors.

In the last column of Table 2 where TSF is the outcome of interest in a FE model, the price of
lean pork is negatively associated with body fat, while the price of vegetables has little, if any,
effects on body fat at all. BMI is found to be a strong predictor for body fat, as expected. The
estimated coefficient says that when BMI increases by 10%, body fat will increase by 12.6%,
holding all else equal. Because the point estimate/elasticity is greater than one, it suggests that
within individuals, body fat may be growing at a faster rate than is body weight, holding all else
equal. Interestingly, within the same individual, changes in physical activity levels do not seem
to affect body fat significantly, holding all else equal.

Lastly, by comparing the FE estimators between the two obesity outcomes, we find that effects
of staple oil price relative to staple food on obesity are manifested in TSF, a more direct measure
of body fat, but are not captured by BMI, an equivalent to body weight.

Table 3 shows treatment effects of oil price relative to lean pork. The six regressions here
explore to what extent individuals would substitute animal protein with cooking oil when price

                                                                                                  18 of 39
differences are noticeable, and how this would affect their body weight and body fat. The first
three models model prices effects on the outcome of BMI. The relative oil price appears to be
negatively associated with BMI, suggesting that when the relative price of oil becomes lower
than that of lean pork, there would be a higher percentage of calories from oil consumption and a
higher calorie intake in total, which eventually lead to a higher body weight. However, the price
effect loses its statistical significance in the FE model.

In contrast, when TSF is the outcome of interest, all three regression models indicate negative
and significant treatment effects: the estimation of price effects varies from -0.16 in OLS to -0.14
in RE to -0.08 in FE. If we take the FE estimation at face value, holding all else equal, a 10%
decrease in the price of staple oil relative to lean pork will result in a 0.8% increase in TSF, or
body fat. The effects are comparable to that from Table 2.

Results represented in Table 4 are six regression models with the price of staple oil relative to
vegetables as the key regressor. In the third model, the FE model on BMI, holding all else equal,
a 10% decrease in the price of staple oil relative to vegetables results in a 0.04% decrease in BMI
(p<0.01). Such a positive yet very small price effect is perplexing because it is contradictory to
the common belief that lower oil price induces more oil consumption, and obesity. This effect is
also quite different from what is presented in Table 2 and Table 3, where little or no relative oil
price effects are shown on BMI. This positive effect is also contradictory to the general trend of
food prices and BMI. The price of oil relative to vegetables has gone down between 1991 and
2006, as shown before, and at the same time BMI has increased, suggesting a negative
correlation.

One possible explanation for this is that vegetables are a Giffen good, and when they are priced
higher there will be more consumption. But there is little literature supporting this point.
Alternatively, it could be price endogeneity – healthier, light-weighted individuals have a strong
preference for vegetables, driving both prices and consumption up. A third possibility is that it is
a type we error. None of these hypotheses can be tested here, however. But it would be easier to
at least explore the first hypothesis, when prices of each food category are being controlled for



                                                                                               19 of 39
individually, as presented in Table 5. we will discuss this further after we describe the TSF part
of Table 5.

Results on the outcome of TSF are also different from that of earlier model specifications. The
price effects are negative and significant in OLS and RE but that statistical significance is lost in
the FE model, suggesting that we cannot reject the null hypothesis the price of oil relative to
vegetables has no effects on body fat.

Table 5 shows results from six regressions with the key regressor being the absolute price of
staple oil. Prices of staple food, lean pork, and vegetables are also being controlled for
individually.

When BMI is the outcome of interest, in the FE model, it appears that the price of staple oil has
no treatment effects on BMI. Actually, the only statistically significant price effect (p<0.05) here
is from lean pork. When the price of staple oil and everything else is held constant, a higher price
of lean pork predicts a higher body weight. The effect is small (point estimate 0.006), but
significant. The price of vegetables is negative but only border-line significant (p<0.1),
suggesting little to no effects on BMI, when other food prices are being held constant.

The results suggesting little price effects of vegetables are more reasonable than assuming
negative effects or in other words a Giffen-good phenomenon. One good reason is that
vegetables contain very few calories. In fact, there is only 0.25 calories per gram of vegetables
on average. So even if the consumption of vegetables doubled within the same time period, it
wouldn’t add enough calories to significant increase calorie intake, or increase body weight, not
to mention the fact that many fiber-rich vegetables are filling, so by consuming more of them
people might eat less in general.

Also there is empirical evidence that consumption of vegetables do not increase when their
prices go up. Aggregate-level data provided in the 2007 Agricultural Development Report by the
Ministry of Agriculture in China show that annual consumption of vegetables per capita has been




                                                                                             20 of 39
decreasing over time: from 127kg in 1991 to 101kg in 2006 for urban residents, and from 132kg
in 1991 to 118kg in 2006 for rural residents. 10 Within the same time frame, prices of vegetables
have increased. Connecting the two, we exclude the possibility that vegetables are a Giffen good.
Price endogeneity or type we error are more plausible candidates.

Still in the same table, when TSF is the outcome of interest, prices effects are all statistically
significant with an expected sign. The point estimate for oil price effect is -0.09 in the FE model
(p<0.01), the magnitude quite comparable to that of the relate oil prices compared to staple food,
or to lean pork. The price effects of staple food and lean pork on TSF are positive, when the
pricing of oil is being held constant, which is in accordance with my hypothesis. The price of
vegetables does not appear to have any treatment effects on TSF, or body fat.

Table 6 is the last table displaying price effects regressions for the whole sample. The key
regressor shown here is the price of oil relative to recommended meal. Again, in the FE models,
the relative oil price appears to have no effects on body weight, and is shown to have a negative
and significant (p<0.01) effect on body fat (TSF), even when BMI is being controlled for. The
magnitude of the effect is even greater than earlier models: a 10% decrease in the price of oil
relative to recommended meal will increase TSF by 1.2%, holding all else equal.

By look at results from all model specifications, it suggests that effects of both relative and
absolute oil prices on TSF, or body fat, are persistent and robust. However, BMI does not seem
to capture these price effects. The only exception to the generalization is the price of staple oil
relative to vegetables.

This implies that individuals consume more edible oils when the prices are lower, and additional
oil consumption subsequently leads to a higher level of body fat. At the same time, individuals
are likely to keep total calories consumed per day to a certain number, and reduce the
consumption of other foods, such as rice, flour, meats, and vegetables, to compensate for more

calories will come from fat.




5.1    Extended Results by Gender

Although FE models are shown to be superior to RE in this paper (because observable individual
characteristic are highly correlated with the control variables), the limitation of FE models
remains – FE models do not estimate effects of individual characteristics that are invariant over
time because those effects are modeled as part of individual fixed effects by definition. One way
to overcome that limitation is to analyze fully-interacted models, or in other words, to run
regressions using subsamples divided by a variable of interest. We employ this technique and
estimate price effects within subsamples by gender to see if and how treatment effects differ
between females and males.

Table 7 shows the subsample results (log-log models only). The first column of results shows the
regression on the outcome of BMI, and the second is on TSF. Each block of a coefficient and a
standard error represents one regression. There are altogether 20 regressions in the table. They
are all FE models with robust standard errors clustered at the community level.

When BMI is the outcome, all the price effects are not statistically significant except the price of
oil relative to vegetables in the male subsample. When TSF is the outcome, mostly the price
effects are comparable between females and males, except for the price of staple oil by itself. In
the male subsample, the absolute oil price effect is not statistically significant, but in the female
subsample, the p-value is less than 0.01.




6     Endogeneity

Price effects shown earlier cannot be considered causal if there is price endogeneity. In a free
and competitive market, prices are co-determined by supply and demand. Self selection from the
                                                                                       22 of 39
demand side and reverse causality are two legitimate concerns regarding the estimated price
effects from earlier regression models. Therefore we use instrumental variables (IV) to test if
price endogeneity is present and to further estimate causal price effects on obesity.

An instrument is considered valid and relevant in this particular case if (1) the instrument is
associated with food prices from the supply side, such as a production cost, or a transportation
cost, and (2) the instrument itself does not in any other way affect body weight or body fat
except through food prices. The price of gasoline is available from the CHNS community survey
and meets the two above requirements. First, gasoline is directly used for vehicles that transport
and distribute food, so it is part of the transportation cost of food, from the supply side. The
relationship between the price of gasoline and the price of food prices can be tested in the first
stage of IV. Second, gasoline is unlikely to be directly linked with body weight and body fat.
This condition might be violated in developed countries where car ownership is so common that
when the price of gasoline is lower, individuals might choose to substitute walking with driving,
and store more calories and fat in the body. But in China, very few people have a car at their
disposal, and most people commute by foot, bike, or bus. So, changes in gasoline prices
supposedly would not change individuals’ physical activity levels, or other behaviors related to
obesity.

For all the IV estimates, only FE-IV models are shown in Table 8 and Table 9 due to space
limitation. There are altogether ten shown regressions, five on the outcome of BMI, five on TSF.

The first stage of these IV regressions is not shown, but for each regression we run a weak
identification test and an under-identification test on the validity of the instrument. The weak
identification test uses Kleibergen-Paap rk Wald F statistic and the under-identification test uses
Kleibergen-Paap rk LM statistic (Baum et al., 2007). The statistics are shown near the bottom of
the tables. In all models these statistics are large enough to reject the null hypothesis that
instrument is not valid. WE also perform endogeneity tests of the price variables in OLS-IV
models, which suggest that the price of staple oil is endogenous.




                                                                                                 23 of 39
We find that in the FE-IV models, prices effects remain all negative and statistically significant
on TSF, echoing what we find from earlier FE models. Even the price of oil relative to
vegetables is shown to influence TSF. And the magnitude of effects is now larger. For example,
the effect of staple oil price relative to staple food has risen from -0.08 in FE to -0.214 in the FE-
IV model. The coefficient of -0.214 implies if the price of oil relative to staple food decreases by
10%, TSF will increase by about 2.1%, holding all else equal. However, does this instrumented
point estimate sound too large to be reasonable? From 1991 to 2006, the price of oil relative to
staple food decreased by 35%. Applying the instrumented point estimate, this price change led to
a 35%×0.214 ≈ 7.5% increase in TSF. Within the same time period, TSF increased by 46.7%. So,
the price of staple oil relative to staple food explains 7.5%÷46.7%=16% of the total increase in
TSF. Given that excess food intake and physical inactivity are the two main contributors of high
body fat, a point estimate indicating that food price accounts for 16% of the changes in TSF
hardly sounds absurd.

On the other hand, the price effects on BMI are all shown to be negative and statistically
significant as well, which is aligned with the findings on the outcome of TSF, but different from
what we find in the FE models on BMI earlier. In the same example of the price of staple oil
relative to staple food, the earlier FE model gives us a coefficient of -0.005 which is negative yet
insignificant, but once instrumented, the coefficient is changed to -0.039 and is statistically
significant (p < 0.01). It says, holding all else equal, if the price of staple oil relative to staple
food increases by 10%, an average person's BMI will decrease by about 0.4%. If we take the
results at face value, it implies that when relative oil prices are lower, individuals are likely to
gain body weight and increase percentage body fat. However, price effects are much larger on
body fat than body weight, suggesting body fat might have been growing at a faster rate than
body weight.

We do not have enough information to conclude whether regression results from one model are
definitively more reliable than those from another, but at least the IV method reconfirms the
hypothesis that relative oil prices have negative treatment effects on body weight and body fat.
Oil prices are demonstrated to have a greater impact on body fat than on body weight. And the
results are consistently shown to be robust.

7    Conclusion

Results from the reduced-form price effects models suggest that food prices affect individuals'
body fat levels, probably by changing the composition of meals they consume – when the
relative price of staple oil is lower, obesity increases, captured by changes in TSF. In addition, by
using any constructed relative oil price, across all model specifications, price effects on body fat
are significant and persistent. However, such price effects appear to be more subtle on BMI and
cannot always be captured, especially in the FE models (though reflected in FE-IV models). This
is partly because BMI is not a perfect measure of body fat. It is by definition the height-adjusted
body weight and does not convey information on body composition such as percentage body fat
and muscularity.

To summarize, all regressions results show that oil consumption can correspond to relative oil
prices and it is shown to subsequently increase individuals' body fat at a faster rate than it affects
body weight. The policy implications are two-fold. First, by using different pricing policies, it is
possible to effectively induce healthier food consumption patterns and thus to control the growth
of obesity. Second, BMI contains limited information on body fat and is a less accurate measure
for obesity especially when it applies to certain populations, such as Asians. 11 It is important to
raise public awareness that individuals need to be cautious when interpreting their degree of
adiposity by using BMI alone, and that it goes beyond maintaining a normal body weight to
ensure a healthy level of percentage body fat. If more direct measures of body fat such as TSF
are too costly or simply unavailable, it would still help to watch and control daily oil
consumption levels.
