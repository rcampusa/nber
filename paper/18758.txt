Place Based Policies with Unemployment

                                            ABSTRACT

Many countries have policies aimed at creating jobs in depressed areas with high unemployment rates.
In standard spatial equilibrium models with perfectly competitive labor and land markets, local job
creation efforts are distortionary. We develop a stylized model of frictional local labor markets with
the goal of studying the efficiency of unemployment differences across areas and the potential for
place based policies to correct local market failures. Our model builds on the heavily studied Diamond
- Mortensen - Pissarides framework, adapted to a local labor market setting with a competitive housing
market. The result is a simple search analogue of the classic Roback (1982) model that provides a
tractable environment for studying the effects of local job creation efforts. In the model, workers are
perfectly mobile and the productivity of worker-firm matches may vary across metropolitan areas.
In equilibrium, higher local productivity results in higher nominal wages, higher housing costs, and
lower unemployment rates. Although workers can move freely to arbitrage away differences in expected
utility across metropolitan areas, equilibrium unemployment rates are not equalized across space. We
find that if hiring costs are excessive, firms may post too few vacancies. This problem may be offset
via local hiring subsidies of the sort found in many place based policies. The optimal hiring subsidy
is city specific in the sense that it depends upon the local productivity level.

1       Introduction
Unemployment rates vary enormously across cities and regions. In most countries, variation
in unemployment rates across labor markets at a moment in time rivals that of variation
over the business cycle. For example, column 1 of Table 1 reports unemployment rates in US
metropolitan areas with the highest and lowest unemployment rates in 2008 according to the
American Community Survey. In that year, the unemployment rate in Flint – the city at the
top of the list – was almost 15 percent, while the unemployment rate in Iowa City – located
less than 500 miles from Flint – was only 2.6 percent. The 12 percentage point diﬀerence
between these two cities is more than double the change in national unemployment rates
observed over the course of the Great Recession and even larger compared to the typical
business cycle.1 Notably, these spatial diﬀerences in unemployment rates are not simply an
artifact of diﬀerences in the average characteristics of residents. Estimates of city-speciﬁc
unemployment rates that condition on individual characteristics also exhibit a remarkable
degree of variability.
    Perhaps even more surprising is the fact that these staggering geographical diﬀerences
are not transitory, but last decades. Figure 1 shows unemployment rates in 1990 and 2008
across 239 metropolitan areas. The ﬁgure shows a remarkable degree of persistence, with a
regression coeﬃcient of 0.509 (.045) and R2 of 0.35.2 European labor markets also exhibit
marked and long lasting diﬀerences in regional unemployment rates (Overman and Puga,
2002; Elhorst, 2003). If anything, diﬀerences in Europe can be even more long lasting.
For example, the unemployment rate in Southern Italy has been three to four times higher
than the unemployment rate in Northern Italy for the past three decades. In 2008, the
unemployment rate in Sicily was above 16 percent, while the rate in Veneto (in the Italian
North-East) was only 4 percent. Similar regional diﬀerences, albeit somewhat smaller, are
observed in Spain, France and Germany.
    Given the persistence of these vast cross-sectional diﬀerences in unemployment rates, it
is not surprising that an increasing number of countries have adopted place based policies
transferring resources towards particular geographical areas. Most developed countries have
some form of placed based policy. Such policies are typically targeted towards areas with
weak demand for labor and high unemployment rates, often with the explicit goal of reducing
unemployment.
    Economists have long pointed out two important limitations with such policies. First,
    1
     The national unemployment rate at the peak of the Great Recession was only 4.7 points higher than the
rate in 2006, at the bottom of the cycle.
   2
     A weighted regression that uses the 1990 city population as weights yields very similar estimates: The
regression coeﬃcient is 0.515 (.044) and R2 = 0.36.



                                                    2
standard spatial equilibrium models (e.g. Roback, 1982) suggest that it may be diﬃcult for
place-based policies to improve the utility levels of area residents, as increases in labor de-
mand in a region may be oﬀset by increases in local costs of living. Second, such policies may
be highly ineﬃcient. Under the standard modeling assumptions of static market clearing,
the absence of agglomeration and crowding eﬀects, and the absence of prior distortions due
to taxes, place based policies may generate large deadweight losses by creating incentives to
invest, work, and live in less productive or hospitable areas.
    Recently, a variety of authors have sought to relax some of these assumptions. For
example, Glaeser and Gottleib (2008), Kline (2010), and Kline and Moretti (2012) study
the implications of agglomeration externalities for the eﬃciency of place based policies from
the point of view of local and national governments. In a diﬀerent vein, Albouy (2009)
indicates that the federal tax code already distorts locational incentives, which may provide
a rationale for oﬀsetting policies.
    Thus far, however, not much work has been devoted to studying the implications of
labor market frictions for the eﬃciency of place based policies. Given the large geographical
diﬀerences in the prevalence of unemployment observed in the real world, understanding
spatial equilibrium when the labor market does not instantly clear would appear to be of
primary importance.3 The absence of a theoretical framework to understand the eﬃciency
of place based policies in the presence of unemployment is particularly notable in light of
the fact that most such programs usually state job creation as a primary goal, often with an
explicit emphasis on reducing local unemployment.
    In this paper, we develop a stylized model of frictional local labor markets with the goal
of studying the eﬃciency of unemployment diﬀerences across areas and the potential for
place based policies to correct local market failures. Our model builds on the heavily studied
Diamond (1982) - Mortensen (1982) - Pissarides (1985) framework, adapted to a local labor
market setting with a competitive housing market. The result is a simple search analogue
of the classic Roback (1982) model that provides a tractable environment for studying the
eﬀects of local job creation eﬀorts.
    In the model, workers are perfectly mobile and the productivity of a worker-ﬁrm match
may vary across metropolitan areas. In equilibrium, higher local productivity results in
  3
     Beaudry, Green, and Sand (2012) develop and estimate a multi-sector model of frictional local labor
markets where industrial policies can have complex equilibrium eﬀects on wages and population. However,
they do not study the welfare properties of their model. A recent paper by Lutgena and Van der Linden
(2012) makes progress in developing a tractable search-matching equilibrium in which searching for a job
in another region is possible without migrating. Wrede (2012) uses a search and matching framework to
understand the equilibrium relationship between local amenities, wages, rents and unemployment. See also
earlier work by Francis (2009), Molho (2001), and Epifani and Gancia (2005). Boadway et al. (2004) study
policies that should be implemented to restore eﬃciency when there is an ineﬃcient distribution of ﬁrms.



                                                   3
higher nominal wages, higher housing costs, and lower unemployment rates. Although work-
ers can move freely to arbitrage away diﬀerences in expected utility across metropolitan
areas, equilibrium unemployment rates are not equalized across space. In addition to search
frictions, we allow for the presence of hiring costs, which have been shown to be empirically
important for hiring behavior (Hamermesh, 1989; Bloom, 2009). As in Pissarides (1999,
2009) these costs are not sunk at the time that matches are formed and can therefore inﬂu-
ence the wage bargain. We show that if hiring costs are excessive, ﬁrms may post too few
vacancies. This problem may be oﬀset via hiring subsidies of the sort found in many place
based policies. The optimal hiring subsidy is city speciﬁc in the sense that it depends upon
the local productivity level.
    Thus, in our simple setting, excessive hiring costs provide a theoretical rationale for place
based hiring subsidies even when workers are perfectly mobile.4 These subsidies ought to be
targeted to less productive areas with lower wages. Relative to a neoclassical environment,
the underlying motivation for such subsidies is that workers are not perfectly mobile between
unemployment and employment. Search frictions yield rents, which, if split incorrectly, yield
ineﬃcient job creation behavior.
    We stress that our discussion is meant to stimulate further work on eﬃciency consid-
erations in the local labor market literature rather than to assess the desirability of any
particular policy. Local hiring subsidies of the sort studied in our model are likely to face
signiﬁcant implementation problems as authorities cannot easily infer which matches are
new.


2     Spatial Variation in Unemployment Rates and Pub-
      lic Policy
We begin by documenting more carefully the vast cross-sectional diﬀerences in unemployment
rates across cities. Figure 2 shows a histogram of unemployment rates across US metropolitan
areas in 1990, 2000 and 2008. To create the ﬁgures, we used data from the 1990 and 2000
Census of Population and the 2008 American Community Survey.5 National labor market
   4
     There are of course several other possible sources of ineﬃciency in frictional labor markets, many of which
can yield a role for policy. Gibbons and Katz (1991), for example, propose a simple model of equilibrium
unemployment that arises due to adverse selection in the labor market. Acemoglu (2001) develops a two-
sector search model with holdup where too few “good” capital intensive jobs are provided in equilibrium,
while Acemoglu and Shimer (1999) discuss implications of holdup for eﬃciency of the mix of jobs under a
host of diﬀerent modeling assumptions.
   5
     The Censuses of Population and the American Community Survey have nearly identical deﬁnitions of
unemployment. Both ask a household respondent to report on whether household members who didn’t work
in the previous week have been actively searching for work over the previous four weeks.


                                                       4
conditions vary substantially across the dates of these three samples. While the 1990 and
2008 samples occurred at the onset of what turned out to be deep recessions, the 2000 Census
was collected at the peak of the strongest labor market expansion since World War Two.6
    Despite being situated at diﬀerent points of the business cycle, all three samples yield
a similar picture – one in which U.S. local labor markets display wide heterogeneity in
unemployment rates. In each year, the unemployment rates in the metro areas at the top
of the distribution are several times higher than the unemployment rates in metro areas
at the bottom of the distribution. For example, the unemployment rates in cities at the
top of the 2008 distribution are three to ﬁve times higher than the unemployment rates in
cities at the bottom (column 1 of Table 1). Earlier years are characterized by even an wider
range of variation. The standard deviations across metropolitan areas in 1990, 2000 and
20008 are, respectively, .018, .018 and .016, while the diﬀerences between the ﬁrst and the
99th percentiles are 6.1, 5.9 and 5.1 percentage points; well above the diﬀerences in national
unemployment rates observed over the business cycle.
    Of course, unemployment rates are known to depend upon worker skills and demograph-
ics, which may vary signiﬁcantly across metropolitan areas. However, spatial diﬀerences in
unemployment rates across labor markets are diﬃcult to explain by diﬀerences in resident
characteristics. Estimates of city-speciﬁc unemployment rates that condition on individual
characteristics continue to exhibit a remarkable degree of variability. Column 2 of Table 1
shows metropolitan area-speciﬁc unemployment rates for 2008, adjusted for education, age,
gender, and race. These estimates are obtained from an individual level linear probability
regression of an indicator for unemployment on metropolitan area indicators and indicators
for education, age, gender, and race.7 A comparison of columns 1 and 2 indicates that
controlling for individual characteristics reduces spatial variation in unemployment rates
only marginally. For example, covariate adjustments reduce the gap in the probability of
unemployment between Flint and Iowa City from 12.0 to 10.8 percentage points.
    For a broader assessment, Figure 3 shows the distribution of unemployment rates across
US metropolitan areas in 1990, 2000 and 2008 after controlling for education, age, gender, and
race. A comparison of Figure 3 and Figure 2 conﬁrms that the dispersion of the conditional
unemployment rates does not diﬀer substantially from the dispersion of the unconditional
rates. Indeed, the standard deviations of the conditional distributions in 1990, 2000 and
2008 are, respectively, .018, .017 and .016; virtually unchanged relative to the unconditional
distributions.
    Spatial diﬀerences in unemployment rates are often used by policy makers to justify the

adoption of policies that transfer resources towards areas with weak demand for labor and
high unemployment rates. For example, the European Union Regional Development Fund
explicitly targets regions with high unemployment and low (nominal) income for generous
business subsidies and public investment. Remarkably, the European Union legislation gen-
erally prohibits state aid, but makes explicit exceptions for place based policies that target
“deprived” regions with low per capita GDP and high unemployment.
    National governments have embraced these policies. Since the 1970’s, the main business
support scheme in the UK – the Regional Selective Assistance – has provided discretionary
grants to ﬁrms in disadvantaged regions, deﬁned as regions with high unemployment and low
levels of per capita GDP (Crisculo et al. 2012). Italy has long provided regional transfers
that single out high unemployment regions, especially in the South, for special infrastructure
investments and, more recently, for hiring incentives and other labor market subsidies (See
for example Deidda et al, 2012). Sweden, France and Germany have similar programs (Marx,
2001). In the US, the federal urban Empowerment Zone (EZ) program was explicitly designed
to beneﬁt neighborhoods with high unemployment rates (Busso, Gregory, and Kline, 2012).
    A growing empirical literature assesses the local job creation eﬀects of place based policies
(e.g., Ham et al, 2011; Neumark and Kolko, 2010; Crisculo et al., 2012). Consistent with the
stated goals of many such programs, the implicit assumption in the literature has been that
the desirability of these policies should be assessed based upon their ability to create jobs
in weak labor markets. Yet, in standard spatial equilibrium models with complete markets,
such job creation eﬀorts tend to be highly ineﬃcient as they divert economic activity to
less productive areas. Indeed, in standard models, such as that of Busso, Gregory, and
Kline (2012), successful job creation resulting from targeted incentives is actually a suﬃcient
statistic for the size of a program’s deadweight losses. The ideal place based subsidy would
simply raise wages (or change other prices) in a way that raises the real income of the
targeted group without changing behavior.
    We now turn to the development of a simple spatial equilibrium model with frictional
unemployment that explicitly acknowledges the possibility of ineﬃciencies in local labor
markets. We then discuss a possible economic rationale for place based policies in settings
where equilibrium unemployment is above its eﬃcient level.


3     Model Setup
Consider a small representative city to which homogeneous workers may freely migrate and
search for a job. Jobs are ﬁlled probabilistically via a constant returns to scale matching
function M (U, V ) which takes the number of unemployed workers U and job vacancies V as

                                               6
arguments. Letting θ ≡ VU denote market tightness, the constant returns to scale assumption
implies we can write the job ﬁlling rate as q (θ) ≡ M (U,V
                                                       V
                                                           )
                                                             = M (θ, 1) which we assume obeys
 ′
q (θ) < 0, lim q (θ) = ∞, and lim q (θ) = 0. Likewise, the job ﬁnding rate is θq (θ) = M (U,V
                                                                                          U
                                                                                              )
           θ→0                 θ→∞
which obeys lim θq (θ) = 0, and lim θq (θ) = ∞.
              θ→0                 θ→∞
   Whether searching or employed, workers inelastically demand a unit of housing which
they rent at rate c. Housing is supplied on a spot market according to marginal cost so that:

                                            c = g ′ (N )                                         (1)

where the function g (.) represents the total cost of producing housing for the local workforce
of size N and is assumed to be twice diﬀerentiable and convex.
    The steady state value of searching for a job is given by:
                                                       (          )
                              rJ U = b + A − c + θq (θ) J E − J U                                (2)

where r is the interest rate. The ﬂow utility of unemployment b captures the generosity of
the local safety net and the value of leisure. The term A gives the consumption value of the
local mix of amenities in the city. The term J E gives the (steady state) value of employment
which obeys the recursion:
                                                    (          )
                                rJ E = w + A − c + s J U − J E                                   (3)

with w representing the wage and s an exogenous separation probability.
    We depart from the standard general equilibrium assumption of a ﬁxed workforce by
assuming that workers may freely exit the city and obtain ﬂow utility z. Thus we have the
restriction that in an interior equilibrium:

                                             rJ U = z.                                           (4)

This condition is analogous to the standard free-mobility assumption of Roback (1982) who
requires that agents everywhere have equal utility. Here they need only have equal values of
search across communities.8 The value of employment may vary across communities if it is
oﬀset by diﬀerences in the local cost of living or the probability of ﬁnding a job. Condition
(4) in conjunction with the housing supply function (1) will pin down a unique steady state
city size N .
    Firms may post vacancies which entail ﬂow cost k. Following Pissarides (1999, 2009)
  8
   In this respect, the model bears a similarity to the Harris and Todaro (1970) model of rural-urban
migration.


                                                 7
we assume the ﬁrm must pay a ﬁxed hiring cost H before hiring a worker with whom it
is matched.9 Note that k and H are distinguished by the fact that the vacancy costs are
already sunk by the time the ﬁrm is matched with the worker, while the hiring costs are not.
The value J V of posting an unﬁlled vacancy is given by:
                                                   (              )
                                  rJ V = −k + q (θ) J F − J V − H                                        (5)

       The value J F of a ﬁlled vacancy obeys:
                                                     (          )
                                     rJ F = p − w + s J V − J F                                          (6)

where p is the productivity of the match which we assume is city speciﬁc and common to
all matches in the city. This parameter is important because it governs the strength of the
local labor market. We are interested in understanding how the optimal policy depends on
p.
    Free entry of ﬁrms drives the value of an unﬁlled vacancy to zero:

                                                 rJ V = 0.                                               (7)

In a steady state, there will be no migration and the local unemployment rate u ≡                    U
                                                                                                     N
                                                                                                         will
be determined by the usual function of inﬂow and outﬂow rates:

                                                       s
                                             u=               .                                          (8)
                                                   s + θq (θ)

Finally, we assume wages are set via Nash bargaining over the match surplus, so that:
                                      (         )   (              )
                               (1 − β) J E − J U = β J F − J V − H                                       (9)

where the parameter β gives the worker’s share of the match surplus. Note that the surplus
being bargained over is net of the hiring cost. A model with holdup would bargain over the
surplus ignoring some portion of the hiring cost.10
   9
      See Hamermesh (1989), Caballero, Engel, and Haltiwanger (1997), and Bloom (2009) for evidence on
hiring costs.
   10
      Note that this equation pins down the worker’s entry wage which is key to the job creation decisions of
ﬁrms. As Pissarides (1999) notes, workers may try to force a renegotiation of the wage after the ﬁrm has
already paid the hiring cost. This could lead to a diﬀerent “inside” wage. We ignore this possibility in what
follows. Evidence on the importance of such holdup problems is mixed (see Card, Devicienti, and Maida,
2010).

4      Equilibrium
We show in the appendix that the nine equations of our model can be reduced to the following
three relationships which characterize the behavior of the endogenous variables θ, c, and w:

                              r+s     1−β
                                    =     (p − b − (r + s) H) − βθ                                   (10)
                              q (θ)    k



                                                                  k r+s
                            c = p + A − z − (r + s) H −                                              (11)
                                                                1 − β q (θ)
                                                     β
                               = b+A−z+k                θ
                                                    1−β


                           w = β (p − (r + s) H) + (1 − β) (c + z − A)                               (12)

    Condition (10) is standard and can be graphed as the intersection of a modiﬁed job
creation curve and a Beveridge curve (Pissarides, 1999). Not surprisingly, equilibrium market
tightness is an increasing function of local productivity p and a decreasing function of hiring
costs H. It is also straightforward to verify that equilibrium market tightness is a decreasing
function of worker’s bargaining power β, and the costs k of posting a vacancy. An interesting
feature of this equation is that it does not depend on the local amenity level A or the outside
option z. This is an artifact of our (somewhat artiﬁcial) assumption that ﬁrms do not use
land to produce goods, which conveniently blocks one channel of feedback from the housing
market to the labor market.
    The local cost of living c is an increasing function of market tightness and therefore match
productivity p. It also varies one for one with the amenity level A and the outside option z
(which can be thought of as the amenity value of the outside world) in order to keep workers
indiﬀerent.
    Finally, the wage is a bargaining power weighted average of output net of hiring costs
and the cash ﬂow required for workers to obtain utility level z which is z plus the local
cost of living c. Wages are increasing in local market tightness and hence in productivity.11
Because ﬁrms do not use land, wages are invariant to the local amenity level A. Relaxing this
restriction, would make wages a decreasing function of the amenity level as in Roback (1982).
The remaining key endogenous variables: population (N ) and equilibrium unemployment (u)
can be inferred directly from (1) and (8).
  11
    Note that the positive relationship between tightness and wages is at odds with the older compensating
diﬀerential intuition of Hall (1972).


                                                    9
5    Eﬃciency
The social planner seeks to maximize the total surplus in the economy relative to the outside
option which is given by:

                  S = [(p − sH) (1 − u) + (b − kθ) u + A − z] N − g (N ) .

Total surplus S consists of the output of productive matches net of the steady state costs
of hiring replacements plus the leisure associated with unemployment minus the ﬂow cost of
maintaining unﬁlled vacancies. This must then be netted out relative to the outside option
which oﬀers workers utility level z. The planner also deducts from the surplus the real costs
of housing the local workforce.
    Because we are not concerned with transitional dynamics, we now limit our analysis
to the case where agents have discount rates of zero which allows us to compare steady
states without considering the convergent paths between steady states. The static planner’s
problem is to simply:
                                                       s
                                 max S s.t. u =               .
                                  θ,N              s + θq (θ)
This problem can be thought of as choosing the equilibrium the agent faces before entering
the economy. The ﬁrst order conditions of this problem are:

                      g ′ (N ) = (p − sH) (1 − u) + (b − kθ) u + A − z                   (13)

                                            ∂u           ∂u
                             (p − b − sH)      + ku + kθ    =0                           (14)
                                            ∂θ           ∂θ
              ′
where α ≡ − q θ(θ) is the (negative) elasticity of the matching function. The ﬁrst condition
determines optimal city size and, given our competitive housing market assumption, can be
restated as:
                          c = (p − sH) (1 − u) + (b − kθ) u + A − z.

For this to coincide with (11) when agents have discount rates of zero, we need the following
to hold:

                                                                           k     s
          (p − sH) (1 − u) + (b − kθ) u + A − z = p + A − z − sH −                   .
                                                                         1 − β q (θ)

This can be restated as:
                               s     1−β
                                   =     (p − b − sH) − βθ,
                             q (θ)    k
which coincides with (10) when r = 0. Thus, city size is always eﬃcient. This is unsurprising

                                              10
since workers are free to move and we have assumed a perfectly competitive housing market
with no externalities.
    The planner’s second condition, given in (14) , governs eﬃciency of the job creation
process which determines the local unemployment rate. Note that:

                                      ∂u    1−α
                                         =−     q (θ) u2
                                      ∂θ     s
               ′
where α ≡ − qq(θ)
               (θ)
                   is the (negative) elasticity of the job ﬁlling rate. With this convention,
(14) can be rewritten:
                                    s             1−α
                                        = (p − b)       − αθ
                                  q (θ)             k
For this to coincide with (10), we need

                          1−β                             1−α
                              (p − b − sH) − βθ = (p − b)     − αθ.                          (15)
                           k                               k

    Note that in the absence of hiring costs (H = 0) this condition is satisﬁed whenever
α = β, which is often referred to as the Hosios (1990) condition. There is, in general, no
reason to expect this condition to be satisﬁed. Rearranging (15), we have that the optimal
hiring cost obeys:
                                        α−β
                               H∗ =             (p − b + kθ) .
                                      s (1 − β)
when β < α, the optimal hiring cost is positive while when β > α the optimal cost is negative
(i.e. a hiring subsidy). It is possible to derive an alternative expression for the optimal hiring
cost in terms of observed prices by noting that (10) and (11) imply:

                                          1−β
                                   kθ =       (c − b + z − A) .
                                           β

Thus,
                                      (                            )
                          ∗     α−β       p      c+z−A       b
                      H       =              +         −
                                  s     1−β        β     β (1 − β)
                                 1 α−β
                              =          (w − b)                                             (16)
                                sβ 1 − α

We have then that the ideal hiring cost is proportional to the local wage level w net of the
value of the leisure b. Presumably, b does not vary substantially across communities (at least
relative to w). From (12) the wage is higher in more productive areas.




                                                11
6      Place Based Hiring Subsidies
The policy implications of condition (16) depend on the relative magnitude of the parameters
β and α. When β > α, equilibrium unemployment is above its social optimum. This occurs
because high bargaining power on the part of workers leads to excessive wages and therefore
too little job creation, with job seekers ineﬃciently crowding each other out. Eﬃciency can
be restored in such cases by imposing a hiring subsidy.
     By contrast, when β < α, equilibrium unemployment is below its social optimum. In
this case, low bargaining power on the part of workers leads to low wages and excessive job
creation, with vacancies ineﬃciently crowding each other out. Eﬃciency can be restored in
such cases via hiring costs, which, if too low can be bolstered by taxing new hires.
     Most estimates of α place it at or above one half, with Shimer (2005) settling on a value
of α = 0.72. By contrast, labor economists examining the wage impact of shocks to ﬁrm
proﬁtability have repeatedly found estimates of β well below one half. Abowd and Lemieux
(1993), for example, ﬁnd in a sample of unionized plants in Canada that β is no greater
than 0.4. Unsurprisingly, researchers studying environments where workers are less formally
organized typically ﬁnd much lower bargaining shares (Barth et al., 2011; Card, Devicienti,
and Maida, 2010; Carlsson, Messina, and Skans, 2011; Guiso, Pistaferri, and Schivardi,
2005).
     The empirical ﬁnding that β < α has the rather counter-intuitive implication that positive
hiring costs are optimal. If actual hiring costs are below the optimum, a hiring tax could
be welfare improving. Despite being politically unpalatable, this possibility illustrates the
point that labor market failures are not always remediable with subsidies.
     However a ﬁnding that β < α does not itself imply that existing hiring costs are too low
or that hiring should be taxed. Although a calibration is beyond the scope of this paper,
empirical estimates suggest that actual hiring costs are in fact very large (Bloom, 2009).
One justiﬁcation for place based subsidies then could be that hiring costs are too high – that
is, that hiring costs take the value H > H ∗ . In such cases eﬃciency can be restored via an
oﬀsetting hiring subsidy.
     If one ignores the costs of raising the necessary funds, the optimal subsidy B ∗ takes the
form:12
                                               1 α−β
                                  B∗ = H −             (w − b) .
                                              sβ 1 − α
This subsidy is decreasing in w, providing a rationale for intervening more heavily in areas
  12
    Raising the funds with taxes on labor will induce additional distortions, hence reducing the size of the
optimal subsidy.




                                                    12
with lower wages. Indirectly, this suggests subsidizing areas with lower productivity.13 Of
course, H and b may themselves vary across cities due to diﬀerences in regulations and
variation in the generosity of the social safety net. Areas with greater hiring costs require a
larger subsidy for obvious reasons. Interestingly, areas with a more generous safety net also
require a larger hiring subsidy.


7     Conclusion
In this paper, we studied some conditions under which local job creation could have an
eﬃciency rationale. We found that, depending on the magnitude of hiring costs, ﬁrms may
post too few vacancies, particularly in cities where the productivity of a match is low. In
principle, this problem may be oﬀset via place based hiring subsidies that vary with local
productivity levels.
    Hiring costs are not the only example of frictions that may plausibly depress local job
creation. Another example is the presence of ﬁring costs (Lazear, 1990; Bertola, 1990;
Kugler and Saint-Paul, 2004; Hafstead, 2012). Although ﬁring costs can be substantial in
many European and developing countries, they have been understudied empirically. Their
implications for place based policies are an important area for future research.
    We stress that the goal of our exercise has not been to propose a speciﬁc policy but
to stimulate further research on the welfare implications of cross-market variation in local
unemployment rates. An important limitation of our steady state analysis is that it neglects
trends in productivity which may be important for understanding empirical diﬀerences be-
tween declining Rust Belt cities and growing labor markets in the South (Blanchard and
Katz, 1992). We also caution that in practice hiring subsidies may be prone to manipulation
since oﬃcials cannot easily ensure that subsidies are not claimed on inframarginal workers
whose hiring costs are already sunk from the perspective of the ﬁrm. Additional evidence
on implementation of hiring subsidies and on the relation between hiring costs and local job
creation rates is an important area for future work.




  13
     In a more general model where ﬁrms use land, wages would also depend negatively on the local amenity
level. In such a case, areas with a more attractive mix of amenities ought to receive larger hiring subsidies.

Appendix
From (5) and (7)
                                                          k
                                            JF =              +H
                                                        q (θ)
While from (6), we have that
                                              p−w
                                                 JF =
                                              r+s
Thus, the job creation side of the model requires

                                           p−w     k
                                               =       +H
                                           r+s   q (θ)

which we rewrite:
                                                     k (r + s)
                                      q (θ) =                      .                          (17)
                                                 p − w − (r + s) H



   Free mobility of workers and (2) imply that:

                                          b + A − c + θq (θ) J E  z
                                JU =                             = .
                                               r + θq (θ)         r

While solving (3) yields,
                                                  s
                                                    z   +w+A−c
                                          JE =    r
                                                               .
                                                         r+s
Thus, workers require that
                                           (s                      )
                                                 z+w+A−c                   z
                    b + A − c + θq (θ)       r
                                                                       =     (r + θq (θ)) .
                                                   r+s                     r

Which we rewrite:
                                                  z+c−b−A
                                          θ=          (        ).                             (18)
                                                 q (θ) w+A−c−z
                                                         r+s


   From (9), we have:
                                      (                      )
                                          w+A−c−z                     p−w
                            (1 − β)                              =β       − βH
                                            r+s                       r+s

which can be directly rearranged to yield equation (12) in the text.




                                                        18
   Plugging (17) into (18) and using (12) we have:

                  p − w − (r + s) H z + c − b − A
             θ =
                          k         w+A−c−z
                  1 − β p + A − c − z − (r + s) H       z+c−b−A
                =
                    β               k             p + A − c − z − (r + s) H
                  1−βz+c−b−A
                =                                                                      (19)
                    β         k

We also have from (18) that

                                     r+s      z+c−b−A
                          θq (θ) =                                                     (20)
                                      β p + A − c − z − (r + s) H

Plugging this into (19), we get:

                 1−βz+c−b−A         r+s      z+c−b−A
                            q (θ) =
                  β    k             β p + A − c − z − (r + s) H

which can be rearranged to yield equation (11) of the text. Finally, plugging (11) into (20)
and rearranging yields (10).
