                                          ABSTRACT

We analyze different disability policy strategies using policy scores developed by the OECD for
the period 1990 to 2007. Applying model-based and hierarchical agglomerative clustering, we
investigate the existence of distinct country clusters, characterized by particular policy
combinations. In spite of common trends in policy re-orientation, our results indicate that the
reforms of the last two decades led to more, not less, heterogeneity between country groups in
terms of sickness and disability policy. A set of Northern and Continental European countries
emerges as a distinct cluster characterized by its particular combination of strong employment-
oriented policies and comparatively high protection levels. A qualitative review of policy changes
in the most recent years suggests that the gap between these countries and the rest might have
further increased. We embed our empirical analysis in a theoretical framework to identify the
objectives and the main components of a comprehensive disability policy strategy. The objectives
of such a strategy can be subsumed under three headings, representing strategy pillars: prevention
and treatment; protection and insurance; and activation and re-integration. Not all these
dimensions are covered equally well by the OECD policy scores and will have to be further
investigated.

1. Introduction

The protection and integration of disabled person into the labor market is a key issue for
social protection systems in advanced industrialized countries. The last decades saw intense
reforms of disability policies in the majority of OECD countries, with the aim to support
workers with health impairments, to ensure adequate labor supply, and to guarantee the long-
term financial sustainability of social insurance systems.
The OECD has been investigating and documenting changes in sickness and disability
policies, and noticed a certain degree of policy convergence across countries. This
convergence consisted in a shift of the policies’ focus from passive income maintenance to
employment incentives and re-integration policies (OECD 2003, 2010; Prinz and Thompson
2009; Scharle et al. 2015). Other studies highlight substantial cross-country heterogeneity in
policy design and reform strategies (Milligan and Wise 2011; Burkhauser et al. 2014; Vossen
and van Gestel 2015).
           We revisit the question of policy convergence, expanding on previous work by the
OECD based on indicator scores to classify disability policies, with the aim to contribute to
the understanding of disability policy settings and reform trajectories. 1 We use the scores for
the period 1990 to 2007 and investigate clusters of countries, based on their disability policy
strategies and their evolution over time. To achieve this objective, we apply both hierarchical
agglomerative clustering, which had already been used by the OECD (2010, ch. 3), and
model-based clustering, which provides more robust and statistically grounded results.
           Our results indicate that, in spite of a common trend, the reforms led to more diversity
across OECD countries over time. The substantial reforms resulted in the emergence of a
separate policy cluster, formed by Northern and Continental European countries, which is
characterized by a particular combination of strong employment-orientated policies and
comparatively high protection levels. Although virtually all countries strengthened the
activation and labor market integration components of their systems, some countries, among
them the United States, implemented only minor changes in this area. Qualitative evidence on

the reforms since 2007 indicates that the gap between these countries and the cluster formed
by countries with a high reform profile and intensive integration efforts has increased further.
       We embed our empirical analysis in a theoretical framework which identifies the
objectives and the main components of a comprehensive disability policy strategy. This
analytical grid, which is presented in the next section (Section 2), serves to identify those
aspects of disability policy which are not (fully) covered in the OECD scores — and therefore
require further research to evaluated their efficacy in supporting the policies’ aims.

2. An analytical framework of disability policy

Traditionally, social policy has been associated primarily with protective and redistributive
functions, what Barr (2001) called the “piggy bank” and “Robin Hood” dimensions of the
welfare state. In recent years, new functions, with a focus on the prevention of social risks and
on supporting employment through activation, have been assigned to social policy (Bonoli
2012; Morel et al. 2012). With respect to sickness and disability, we can identify three
separate policy objectives: promoting and improving the health status of the workforce to
prevent health impairments; activating and re-integrating in employment those with health
problems; providing benefits and other protective measures to cushion income and welfare
losses due to sickness and disability.
Figure 1 proposes a stylized visualization of a strategy to prevent disability and to support
workers with health impairments to stay in employment. This overview is structured as a
matrix where the main policy objectives are on the horizontal axis. The policy objectives are
summarized under the three headings prevention and treatment; activation and re-integration;
and protection and insurance. The vertical axis represents a person’s health status, ranging
from good health to (full) disability. This axis can also be thought of as a timeline which
represents phases of a health trajectory.
       This framework acknowledges that disability is not a state which is determined solely
by health but rather by the interaction between an individual’s health, workplace conditions,
the welfare system, and the labor market situation. According to Burkhauser et al. (2014),
disability can be viewed as “the product of an interactive process between an individual’s
health conditions and the social and physical environment” (p. 23). A comprehensive




                                                    4
disability strategy thus has to rely on multiple pillars for successfully addressing the policy’s
aims. Depending on their health situation, workers need to be provided with a balanced mix
of prevention, benefits, incentives, and support. Program and stakeholder coordination as well
as the interaction with other policy fields are crucial aspects of any strategy, regardless of
which components are put in place and how they are designed.
       The analytical grid also highlights that sickness absences and disability have to be
understood as one common area for policy. Empirical studies document the strong correlation
between prolonged sickness absences and subsequent disability (e. g., Wallman et al. 2009),
but in most countries sickness absences and disability are still separate policy areas. They are
typically governed by different insurance systems with separate funding, managed by
different agencies and stakeholders, and are addressed by disconnected policies.

3. Disability policies and their reforms in the OECD

3.1 Data

In our analysis of disability policies and their reforms, we rely on data provided by the OECD
who developed a set of indicators to classify disability policies. The OECD classifies
disability policies on the basis of two policy indicators, each of them consisting of ten sub-
dimensions. The first indicator provides an overall assessment of policy features related to the
benefit system, i.e., the compensation dimension, whereas the second captures the intensity of
measures for activation and employment integration, i.e., the integration dimension (OECD,
2010). 2 Each of the 20 sub-components is measured according to a predefined scale which
ranges from zero to five points.
          The compensation dimension includes aspects such as the coverage and level of
disability benefits, the minimum degree of incapacity needed for benefit and full benefit
entitlement, the type of medical and vocational assessment, as well as information on sickness
benefits. The integration dimension considers, among others, the complexity and consistency
of benefits and support systems, the degree of employer obligations towards their employees,
the timing and extent of vocational rehabilitation, and the existence of work incentives for
beneficiaries. Both indicators have a maximum of 50 points. A higher score on the
compensation indicator means greater generosity, whereas an increase in the integration
dimension signals a more active and employment-oriented approach.
          A comparison of the indicators and our analytical framework in Figure 1 shows that
the indicators cover the majority of components of a comprehensive disability policy strategy.
The compensation dimension includes detailed information on the benefit design and contains
a link between sickness and disability, including sickness monitoring. With the exception of
employment protection legislation in case of sickness, all salient aspects of the insurance and
protection pillar are thus taken into account in the score index.

                                                            7
       With respect to the activation and re-integration pillar of disability policy, the OECD
scores are however slightly less exhaustive. Specific policies to support employment and
integration, such as the existence of case management, of workplace accommodation or of
return-to-work practices, are covered only indirectly by the scores. Whereas work incentives
for disability benefit recipients are included in one indicator (Y10), partial sick-leave
schemes, which have proven to be an option to increase activation and labor market
attachment for workers who receive sickness benefits (Markussen, Mykletun and Røed 2012;
Viikari-Juntura et al. 2012), are not part of the OECD indicator set.
       Of the three policy pillars that we identify in our analytical framework, the prevention
and treatment dimension is covered least by the indicators. Policy fields such as occupational
safety and health regulations and workplace health promotion remain unaddressed or are
addressed only indirectly. The same is true for the role of medical professionals, and the
health system in general.
       Overall, the indicators developed by the OECD are comprehensive and well-suited to
provide a detailed picture of policy differences and developments across countries and over
time. However, the index does not account for all facets of disability policy. This opens up
scope for future research and it also cautions us not to equate a lack of change in policy scores
with an overall lack of reform activity.

3.2 Methods

In order to classify OECD countries based on their disability policies, we use two different
clustering approaches. Cluster analysis is based on the idea that observations can be grouped
by their distance from each other. Ideally, the clusters should exhibit high internal
homogeneity, i.e., groups should contain similar observations, as well as high external
heterogeneity, i.e., observations which are dissimilar should be in different groups (Danforth
2014). One widely used method to identify these clusters is agglomerative hierarchical
clustering. This is an iterative process whereby the sample is first divided into singletons and
in subsequent stages singletons or groups are merged into clusters. This merging is based on
some distance criterion, for example, the shortest distance between groups. Agglomerative
hierarchical clustering can be represented graphically in form of a dendrogram. This method




                                                    8
permits to separate observations into clusters without predetermining the number of clusters
beforehand. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is largely heuristic and therefore not
suited for strong inferences.
       In contrast, model-based clustering is well-grounded in probability theory and
statistically rigorous in the identification of clusters which permits the use of information-
based model selection tools. In this approach, the problems of determining the number of
clusters and of choosing an appropriate clustering method is recast as a statistical problem of
model choice (Fraley and Raftery 2002). The central assumption of a model-based cluster
analysis is that the observations are generated by a finite mixture of probability distributions
where each component distribution represents a different group or cluster (Danforth 2014).
Clusters can then be defined as groups of objects that belong to the same probability
distribution. In addition, agglomerative hierarchical clustering tends to suggest a larger
number of tentative clusters than model-based clustering, which is typically more
conservative in the identification of groups being based on statistical tests of differences
between the observations.
       Following recent examples in the literature (Beblavy et al. 2013; Danforth 2014), we
employ both approaches to provide a broader picture of tentative clusters. When we estimate
agglomerative hierarchical clusters, we use Ward’s method, which is based on the sum of
squared errors, and the Euclidean metric as measures of distance between clusters. In Ward’s
approach, two clusters (observations) are merged into the same cluster, if this particular
merger increases the sum of squared errors the least among all possible mergers. This is the
clustering technique most frequently used in the social sciences. It is well suited to settings
where we expect somewhat equally sized clusters and the dataset does not include outliers.
Although it is not possible to evaluate the validity of clusters with a statistical test, bootstrap
resampling techniques can be used to estimate the probability that the clusters are supported
by the data. To gauge the reliability of our hierarchical clustering results, we calculate
approximately unbiased (AU) p-values for each section of the dendrograms that we display.




                                                      9
These p-values are computed using a multi-scale bootstrap resampling routine which was
developed by Suzuki and Shimodaira (2006) 3.
         With respect to model-based clustering, we follow the approach proposed by Fraley
and Raftery (1998, 2002) and set the maximum number of clusters at 9 and choose a finite
mixture model. After performing hierarchical agglomeration to approximately maximize the
likelihood of classification for each model, we apply the expectation-maximization (EM)
algorithm for each model and each number of clusters. We then select the optimal model and
number of clusters based on a comparison of Bayesian information criteria.
         We apply both clustering approaches to data for 1990 (the first year in the OECD
database) and 2007 (the last year). The OECD data comprise 23 countries for which
information is available for both 1990 and 2007. 4 This balanced panel represents the main
target of our analyses. In addition, we will investigate the full OECD dataset for 2007, which
comprises 28 countries. In this way, we aim to identify meaningful groupings as well as
reform trajectories and strategy changes of single countries over time. Before carrying out the
cluster analyzes, we provide descriptive evidence of policy changes over time.

  This approach is more frequently used in the natural sciences than in the social sciences. See, for instance,
Wang et al. (2011).

  For France, Italy, and Mexico, no policy indicators are available for 1990 and we use those from 1985.

4. Empirical results

4.1 Overall trends and developments

In general, the reforms carried out by OECD countries since the early 1990s can be grouped
along four major strands (OECD 2010; Kautto and Bach-Othman 2010): reforms which
tightened benefits and increased their employment-orientation; reforms which expanded
employment integration measures for persons with health impairments; reforms which
increased the involvement of employers and medical professionals; and reforms that
improved the institutional set-up to improve the match-efficiency between services and the
disabled. Some countries also introduced changes to create stronger links in the management
and prevention of sickness and disability. For example, in the Netherlands and in Switzerland,
disability benefit applications are now assessed with respect to steps taken during the
antecedent sickness periods.
Figure 2 shows how the two disability policy dimensions captured by the OECD indicators
developed over time. We observe a marked increase in the integration component over this
period and a moderate, but steady decrease in the compensation component. The decrease in
the compensation dimension (-4.1 points on average between 1990 and 2007) was not as
strong as the increase in the integration dimension (+9.4 points). Table 1 indicates that the
change in orientation, with a shift from the compensation to the integration dimension, was
supported by corresponding changes in almost all sub-components of the two policy
indicators.

measures.

yearly information on scores for the period 1990 to 2007.


       Among the compensation indicators, the only indicator which on average increased
was population coverage (X1). This finding is in line with other indicators for welfare state
generosity and reflects that several countries, in particular Southern European countries,
extended the coverage of their social protection systems in recent decades. (This happened in
spite of overall retrenchment trends, see, for instance, Nullmeier and Kaufmann 2010). Of the
remaining compensation indicators, those that declined most refer to medical assessment
criteria (X5) and sickness absence certification (X10). Medical assessment became stricter in
a number of countries, notably in Austria, Italy, Germany, Finland, and the Netherlands.
Sickness absence certifications were also placed under stricter regulation, including
monitoring, risk profiling, and sanctions in some countries. The Netherlands and Denmark are
prominent examples for major reforms in this area. The compensation indicators for the

medical assessment criteria (X6) and the vocational assessment criteria (X7) document other
marked changes.

        Taken together, the changes indicate that countries decreased the compensation
dimension of their disability policy (and thus the generosity of the social protection pillar of
their disability policy strategy) primarily by tightening the inflow into benefit programs. The
benefit levels, which are covered by the compensation indicators for disability benefits (X3
and X4), as well as sickness benefits (X8 and X9), indicate that only comparatively small
reforms were implemented. The evolution of the policy scores indicates convergence across
countries in compensation policies and divergence in integration policies. This is visible in
Figure 3 where we plot the standard deviations of the policy scores over time.

yearly information on scores for the period 1990 to 2007.



       Among the integration dimensions of disability policy, the strongest reforms touched
employer obligations (Y3), where the average score increased by 1.7 points, from 1.25 to
almost 3 points on average. Only four out of all 23 countries did not undertake any reform of
their disability policies in this dimension. In most cases, the change was however minor. The
strongest changes can be observed for the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Sweden,
where this integration dimension increased by 3 points.
       Programs and benefit complexity (Y2) were also significantly reformed. Co-ordination
of all—or, at least, most of— the programs and benefits was achieved in all Scandinavian
countries (particularly in Norway), as well as in Australia, and in the United Kingdom.
       Other sub-components of integration policy which increased strongly document the
introduction of supported employment programs (Y4), the timing of vocational rehabilitation




                                                  14
(Y8), and the option for disability benefit suspension (Y9). Together with measures extending
other forms of employment programs and work incentives for disability benefits recipients,
these reforms share the goal to increase the labor market attachment of workers with health
impairments.
       Figure 4 plots individual countries’ changes in the two aggregate dimensions. Almost
all countries reduced the compensation dimension. The only exceptions are Ireland and
Canada, where no changes for compensation components are recorded, and Korea and
Portugal, which implemented (very minor) changes that increased compensation. All
countries strengthened the integration component of their disability policies, albeit in some
countries (Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, Ireland, and the United States) the
reforms changed the scores only very lightly.

           Looking at the overall reform intensity, we find that the Netherlands are the country
which underwent by far the largest changes in disability policy (scores). 5 High reform
intensity can also be observed in most Northern European countries, in the United Kingdom
and Australia, as well as in Italy, Poland, Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. The
United States can be singled out as one of the countries where the policy indicators changed
very little, followed by Belgium, Ireland, Portugal, Korea, and Mexico. As we pointed out in
Section 3.1, a lack of change in policy scores is not necessarily equal to a complete absence of
reforms, because some aspects of disability policy are not fully captured by the index scores.
           In the next steps, we aim to reduce the complexity represented by the manifold
combinations in disability policy and to extract from these data clusters of countries with
similar policies and policy trajectories.

4.2 Model-based clustering

Table 2 presents the central results from our model-based clustering analyzes for the balanced
panel of countries of the years 1990 and 2007. In the second and third columns (fifth and
sixth columns for 2007), we display country classifications based on separate calculations for
the two main policy dimensions (i.e., aggregate compensation and integration indicators with
their respective sub-components). Our main results are displayed in the first and fourth
columns and describe a classification based on the full data for all 20 sub-dimensions.
           In 1990, we detect only two, strongly identified, clusters. The first cluster consists of
the Anglo-Saxon countries in the OECD plus Korea, and the other cluster consists of all
European countries without the United Kingdom and Ireland, plus Mexico. These clusters are
robustly identified and all countries are classified with a low uncertainty level (< 0.001). The
exactly same clusters emerge when only the compensation dimension alone is used. When we
use the integration dimensions separately to identify clusters, we detect four different clusters,
which indicate greater heterogeneity across countries. The structure of the clusters is however
more fragile when we use only the integration than when we consider only the compensation


5
    See also Table A1 in the Appendix.




                                                       16
dimension or both dimensions together. This can be verified with the uncertainty levels which
are displayed in Table 2. To sum up, in 1990 we can distinguish two clusters: One consisting
of Anglo-Saxon countries, characterized by low compensation and low integration levels, and
one with the remaining OECD countries, with higher compensation and more diverse
integration policies. 6
        By 2007, the number of clusters according to the comprehensive classification based
on both policy dimensions increased to three. The Anglo-Saxon countries are joined by South
Korea and still form a distinct cluster. Ireland has shifted to a new cluster and is grouped
together with a number of Continental European countries and Mexico. The third cluster is
formed by the Scandinavian countries plus Finland, Germany, Switzerland, and the
Netherlands. Austria is also part of this cluster, but the reliability of its classification is lower
than for the other members of the cluster. Using Esping-Andersen’s (1990) terminology, this
is a cluster that is dominated by Social-democratic (Nordic) and Conservative (Continental)
European welfare states. This group of countries (cluster 2 in Table 2) has by some length the
highest scores on the integration sub-component as well as the highest scores on the majority
of compensation indicators (see Table A3 in the Appendix). The Anglo-Saxon countries
(cluster 1) have on average the lowest scores in most indicators of the compensation
dimension. The remaining (Southern, Eastern and Continental) European countries, together
with Mexico, have compensation indicators that are between the first two clusters.
        In terms of the integration dimension, the means of the indicators reveal a similar
pattern, however, with a reversed position between the Anglo-Saxon cluster and the
“residual” European cluster. Broadly speaking, in 2007 we can thus speak of one cluster,
formed by countries with high integration and high compensation scores; one where countries
with intermediate integration and low compensation levels cluster; and one cluster which is
formed by countries with intermediate compensation and low integration levels.

 Details on cluster means for the policy dimensions and single sub-components can be found in Table A2 in the
Appendix.




                                                          17
         Table A4 in the Appendix compares the clustering results for 2007 from the balanced
panel (i.e., the output as in Table 2) with the classification that emerges when we apply the
same methodology to the full OECD sample for 2007, which contains 28 instead of 23
countries. 7 In this larger sample, Austria is still part of the Northern European cluster, but the
reliability of this classification has dropped below conventional statistical significance levels.
With respect to the remaining countries, the specification with the full sample shows a high
level of consistency with the smaller sample. All countries which are part of the smaller
sample are classified in the same clusters in the version based on the full sample. Japan is
added to the Anglo-Saxon cluster, whereas the other four additional countries are all classified
in the third cluster. 8
         These findings correspond to calculations by the OECD based on agglomerative
hierarchical clustering. OECD (2010) identifies the same three main clusters as well as some
sub-groups within these. As our results indicate, however, these three groups emerge from the
reform processes and were not identifiable at the beginning of our observation period. In the
next step, we augment this picture with more nuanced information on single countries and
country groups.

  The full sample additionally includes information on Hungary, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Greece, and Japan.
8
  Analogously to the clustering based on all 20 sub-components, clustering on the 10 compensation indicators
return exactly the same country ordering when we use either the small or the large 2007 sample (with the
inclusion of the additional five countries in the second cluster). With respect to the integration dimension alone,
there are some re-classifications if we use the larger sample. These re-classifications, however, concern countries
whose memberships in clusters are characterized by comparatively high levels of uncertainty.

4.3 Hierarchical agglomerative clustering

       Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide additional insights, visualizing the results from
agglomerative hierarchical clustering in form of dendrograms. In the dendrograms, the y-axis
marks the distance, based on all 20 sub-components of the indices, at which the countries and
clusters merge. The red numbers on each cluster edge are approximately unbiased (AU) p-
values. The red rectangles highlight clusters which are supported by the data at least at a 90%
statistical significance level (AU p-values ≤ 0.1). The dendrograms for 1990 and 2007
indicate patterns that correspond to the results from the model-based clustering.
       The Anglo-Saxon countries (with the exception of Ireland) show a high degree of
similarity both at the beginning and at the end of our observation period. The Scandinavian
countries are consistently classified as a comparatively homogenous group. In 1990, these
countries were somewhat similar to the European countries, which, by 2007, is no longer true.
The dendrogram suggests stronger policy heterogeneity in European countries by 2007. In
2007, the cluster of Scandinavian countries is joined by Finland and Germany and merges
only at much greater distance with the remaining European countries.
       The agglomerative clustering highlights similarities between single countries. As we
can see in all versions of the dendrogram, for instance, Australia and the United Kingdom
reveal a high degree of similarity. The same can be said for the three Scandinavian countries
as well as for United States, Canada, and Korea. In addition, in 1990, we find high similarity
levels among sub-sets of Continental European countries, such as Italy and Portugal or
Austria and Belgium.
       Switzerland, Finland, Germany, and the Netherlands are the countries which
experience the strongest re-classification over time. By 2007, Germany is clustered with
Finland and has become part of the Scandinavian cluster. Switzerland constitutes a pair with
the Netherlands. In opposition to the model-based results, the hierarchical clustering however
locates Switzerland and the Netherlands closer to the Continental, Southern, and Eastern
European countries than to the Nordic ones.




                                                  20
         These findings change slightly when we look at the dendrogram for the full set of
countries available for 2007. 9 In this version, we find the strongest correspondence between
the hierarchical agglomerative and the model-based clustering results. (Compare the right half
of Table A4 with Figure A1 in the Appendix.) To the right of the dendrogram in Figure A1,
we see those countries with high compensation and high integration policy levels. The
Netherlands and Switzerland are part of a cluster together with the Nordic countries plus
Germany. Austria is not included in this group but is rather part of the large cluster that
comprises the remaining European countries (plus Mexico). The Anglo-Saxon countries form
the third, distinctive group together with the Asian OECD member states (Japan and Korea).

  The introduction of five additional countries leads to a re-classification of Poland in a cluster with Greece. In
this enlarged sample, we also find high homogeneity between the Czech Republic and Slovakia.

5. Developments since 2007

A qualitative review of disability policy changes that were implemented in OECD countries
after 2007 indicates that the trends that we observe for the period 1990 to 2007 did not come
to a halt in recent years. Governments continued to reduce inactivity and benefit reliance,
while strengthening prevention and support for (re-)integration of workers with health
problems. At the same time, reform activity continued to be distributed very unevenly across
countries.

5.1 Increased monitoring and early intervention

       A continuing strand of reforms consists of efforts to improve disability prevention
through monitoring and early intervention during sickness absence. Austria, for instance,
introduced a new Labor and Health bill in 2011 which established an informational and
consulting service to identify and support workers with a heightened risk for disability
(fit2work). In analogy to Germany, which established a similar system in 2004 (Betriebliches
Eingliederungsmanagement), workers who accumulate more than six weeks of sickness
absence within one year are identified as having an increased risk. The Austrian system is
however less binding than the German one, where the law mandates employers to contact
their sick employees and to be responsible for re-integration efforts.
       Switzerland increased its focus on rehabilitation with additional reforms in 2008 and
2013, which encouraged the use of vocational rehabilitation (OECD 2014). Particularly strong
reform efforts were undertaken in Sweden, which carried out major legislative changes in
2008 (Burkhauser et al. 2014). Sweden strengthened the incentives and improved the
opportunities for individuals with disabilities to work. The principal reform component is the
establishment of a new timeline for the provision of rehabilitation services, with additional
work capacity assessments during sickness. In particular, after six months of receiving
sickness benefits, a benefit recipient's work capacity is tested in relation to the regular labor
market as a whole (OECD 2013). If a person is found to have remaining work capacity, she
comes under responsibility of the public employment services and must accept adequate job
offers or loses her benefit entitlement. In Denmark, the government very recently adapted the




                                                    24
sickness benefit scheme. In 2014, the timeline for the assessment of sickness benefit
extension was shortened to 22 weeks (previously it was 52 weeks). In 2015 further reforms
were implemented, including measures to improve the case management of workers with
complex health problems and to strengthen the involvement of employers (Ministry of
Economic Affairs 2015).

5.2 Continued efforts to improve gate-keeping and reduce number of beneficiaries

       In general, measures to improve early intervention continued to be accompanied by
reforms to impose stricter gate-keeping and higher thresholds for benefit application. In
Denmark, the 2003 reform increased the level of disability or work incapacity which was
required for benefit receipt and became, after a transitional period, applicable to all workers
after 2010. Sweden introduced time limits for its sickness benefits: Until July 2008, there was
no formal time restriction on the length of sickness absence in the sickness insurance, this was
first reduced to 2.5 years and is currently 1 year (although extensions might be applicable).
More importantly, however, strict guidelines for sickness absence were introduced in 2008
which were rapidly implemented by Swedish doctors (Försäkringskassan 2014; Skaner et al.
2011). These guidelines contain general recommendations for sickness absence certification
and provide doctors with reference values for the length and extent of sickness absence for
different diagnoses.
       Norway developed an on-line tool that makes it possible for physicians to compare
their sickness certification practice against all other physicians, supporting them when
assessing future patients (OECD 2015). In 2011, it also passed an extensive pension reform
that restricted access to disability benefits as a form of retirement. The United Kingdom
introduced a new and stricter work capability assessment in 2008 and tightened the
requirements for beneficiaries to engage in work-related activity (Burkhauser et al. 2014). In
Austria, the access to disability benefits (which correspond to a benefit for health-related early
retirement) was stopped for persons younger than 50 years of age and replaced by a benefit to
rehabilitation programs in 2014.
       Several countries intensified their efforts to increase the utilization of graded (i.e.
partial) sick leave models. In Finland, the option to graded sick-leave, which had been




                                                    25
introduced in 2007 with a restriction to long absences (> 60 days), was extended to shorter
absences (> 14 days) in 2010 (Kausto et al. 2012). In Norway, graded sick-leave was pushed
as one component of comprehensive tripartite agreements signed by the government and the
employer and employee organizations to foster an inclusive working life (IW agreements).
       Although efforts to reduce the number of persons on sickness and disability benefits
continue to focus primarily on the inflow of new applicants, some attempts have been made to
reduce also the stock of beneficiaries. Sweden, for instance, introduced pilot programs to
provide disability recipients with incentives to return to work. As pointed out by Burkhauser
et al. (2014), however, these measures were not very successful. The United Kingdom carried
out a large-scale reassessment of the work capacity of its invalidity benefit claimants. This
attempt reassessed in its initial phase a large number of claimants as fit to work. However,
due to appeals, there is a large backlog of claims that await assessment which resulted in
political controversy and, ultimately, led to very few reactivations (Gaffney 2015).
       These examples indicate that recent reforms continued to strengthen activation and re-
integration of workers with health impairments, while at the same time they kept protection
levels constant or reduced them further. Although we cannot compute complete scores for all
observed countries, the available evidence leads us to expect that after 2007 the average
OECD integration indicator prolonged its upward and the compensation indicator its
downward trend. Behind these average trends, heterogeneity across countries continues to be
large and has most likely been increasing. The most decided reform steps that we can observe
in recent years took place in the same set of countries which already did most to change their
management of sickness and disability in the previous period.
       We found little evidence that countries with low reform activity between 1990 and
2007 introduced major changes to their sickness and disability policies in the last years. These
countries typically lack a consistent strategy to combine prevention with activation and
protection, as well as the institutional set-up which is required to provide an adequate mix of
policies and services, incentives and support. Significant need for reform has been identified,
among others, in Canada (OECD 2010), Belgium (OECD 2015), and the United States (Autor
2010; Liebman and Smalligan 2013).




                                                   26
        Although further in-depth research on policy changes is needed, the available evidence
corroborates the findings from the previous sections. In spite of a broad, common trend
towards integration, the reform process seems to have led to a higher degree of diversity
across groups of advanced industrialized countries with respect to their sickness and disability
systems.

6. Summary and conclusions

We used score indicators developed by the OECD for the period 1990 to 2007 to investigate
differences in disability policies across countries and their evolution over time. Overall, we
observe a considerable amount of reform activity in sickness disability policies across
countries in the 1990s and 2000s. A clear and well-documented trend emerges from these
reforms, with an intensification of activation and integration policies and (moderate)
reduction of protection and compensation. Changes in the level of employer responsibility
and incentives for employer involvement as well as measures for program/benefit
simplification were, on average, particularly strong. In addition, numerous countries
introduced larger programs and/or stronger incentives for workers with health impairments to
remain employed. With respect to the compensation dimension, countries tried primarily to
reduce the inflow into disability benefits implementing stricter gate-keeping and monitoring.
In some instances, a strong interlocking of the sickness and disability systems was achieved.
       Behind these average developments, we find significant diversity in disability policies.
According to the OECD’s scores, the Netherlands introduced by far the most extensive
changes to their disability policy. Northern European countries as well as other European
countries (United Kingdom, Italy, Poland, Germany, Switzerland) and Australia recorded also
far-reaching reforms. Reform activity, as measured by the scores, was much more limited in
other countries, such as Belgium, Portugal, Canada, and the United States. In spite of these
differences in reform activity as well as in initial conditions, it is possible to single out
clusters of countries with similar policies. In its comparative analysis, the OECD (2010) had
identified three main country groups, which had strong overlaps with the welfare regime
taxonomy associated with the “Liberal”, the “Corporatist”, and the “Socialdemocratic” worlds
of welfare described by Esping-Andersen (1990).




                                                     27
       In our clustering analysis, we reach similar conclusions. Using model-based clustering
techniques, which rely more on statistical inference than hierarchical aggregation clustering,
we find however that the number of distinct country clusters in terms of sickness and
disability policy increased over time. The group of Nordic and Continental European
countries was not identifiable as a separate cluster in 1990. In spite of common trends in
policy re-orientation, the changes of the last two decades thus sharpened the distinction
between country groups. Whereas convergence took place in the compensation dimension,
intense reform activity by a sub-set of countries led to divergence in the integration
dimension. Qualitative evidence on the reforms which were carried out since 2007 suggests
that in recent years the heterogeneity between clusters might have further increased, as
countries with high reform activity in the previous period made additional efforts to adapt
their sickness and disability systems.
       These results add to our understanding of strategies and reform activities in the field of
sickness and disability policy. They also point to different avenues for future research. First,
further research is needed to assess the policy changes which were implemented after 2007.
This is particularly important for those European countries, such as Greece, Portugal, and
Spain, which underwent large structural adjustment programs in the wake of the Great
Recession and the Euro-zone debt crisis. In addition, not all aspects of a comprehensive
strategy to tackle health problems and disability are equally well represented by the OECD
indicators.
       The analytical framework for a comprehensive disability strategy proposed in this
paper rests on three pillars: prevention, protection, and activation. The OECD indicators lack
coverage of policies which can be associated with the first of these three pillars (prevention),
such as the strictness of occupational safety and health regulations. Even aspects of sickness
and disability policies which are more closely related to protection and activation are not
explicitly addressed in the scores either. Examples include measures such as graded sick-
leave benefits, the existence and extent of employment protection in case of sickness, and
measures to improve GP’s sick-listing practices.
       Second, the observed differences in reform intensity and the growing gap in
employment-orientation raise the question of the determinants of reform adoption. Scharle et




                                                   28
al. (2015) highlight the role of different welfare regime institutions and of the political context
as reform determinants. More research will however be needed, particularly since our results
point in the direction of increasing differences between countries groups and country-specific
differences within welfare regime types.
        Finally, the diversity of strategies and reform pathways calls for the investigation of
causal reform effects. The empirical evidence on outcomes associated with particular
disability policies and reform steps is growing, but still limited. A review of the available
findings would go beyond the scope of the present paper. There is some indication, however,
that those countries which – according to the policy scores we investigate in this paper –
introduced far-reaching reforms, particularly in the integration dimension, achieved tangible
results. Sweden, for instance, was very successful in tackling its large numbers of sickness
and disability recipients (OECD 2013). In Switzerland, the repeated reforms of the Swiss
Disability Insurance Act have been associated with a decrease by 45% in the number of new
disability benefit claimants (OECD 2014). The radical restructuring of sickness and disability
policies implemented in the Netherlands, too, reversed the trend of rising disability receipt
rates (Everhardt and de Jong 2011; van Sonsbeek and Koning 2013). These countries provide
examples for the implementation of comprehensive strategies to address sickness and
disability.

Note: Authors’ calculations based on disability policy country scores covering 20 dimensions, OECD
(2003; 2010). Hierarchical cluster analysis: Dendrogram using ward linkage. Red numbers on cluster
edges are approximately unbiased (AU) p-values. Red rectangles highlight clusters which are
statistically significant at AU p-values ≤ 0.1.
