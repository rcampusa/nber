                                           ABSTRACT

For the past generation scholars have emphasized that the Lower South was one of the most
economically successful regions of British mainland North America, and perhaps the most
successful. Planters, the primary economic actors, made extensive use of slave labor and created a
successful staple-export sector, which by 1774 produced the highest levels of private wealth per
capita in the colonies. Focusing on the rapid growth of the primary exports of the Lower South in
the colonial period – rice and indigo – most scholars have concluded that standards of living for
colonists in the region must have been rising rapidly. Elsewhere we have argued that the
conventional view of the economy of the Lower South prior to 1800 is mistaken. Rather, per capita
incomes were essentially stagnant from 1720 to 1770, and did not change appreciably between 1770
and 1800. Central to our interpretation is a revised understanding of the behavior of regional exports
that indicates that they were much less important as a stimulus to economic growth than has
heretofore been believed. This paper describes in greater detail our estimation of regional exports,
and documents the reasons why they could not have been a stimulus to intensive growth within the
region.

I. Introduction

        For the past generation scholars have emphasized that the Lower South was one of the

most economically successful regions of British mainland North America, and perhaps the most

successful. 1 Planters, the primary economic actors, made extensive use of slave labor and

created a successful staple-export sector, which by 1774 produced the highest levels of private

wealth per capita in the colonies.2 Until recently, however, our knowledge about the economy of

the Lower South did not go much beyond such generalities. Writing in 1985, John McCusker

and Russell Menard decried the lack of knowledge about this region.3 Though subsequent work

by others has broadened our knowledge, these studies continue to pivot on the centrality of

exports as the primary engine of economic growth.4 Even while scholars have acknowledged the

limitations of the “staples thesis” it has nonetheless remained the primary organizing tool in most

work on the eighteenth-century American economy.5

        Focusing on the rapid growth of the primary exports of the Lower South in the colonial

period—rice and indigo—most scholars have concluded that standards of living for colonists in

the region must have been rising rapidly. Writing in 1998, for example, Marc Egnal suggested

  It was rivaled in this regard only by the Chesapeake. In both regions, much of the wealth was in the
form of slaves. If measured by nonhuman wealth the differences among regions are reduced
substantially, although not eliminated (Alice Hanson Jones, Wealth of a Nation to Be. New York:
Columbia University Press 1980, 54; Edwin Perkins, The Economy of Colonial America, New York:

relations with the mother country.

  See Egnal, New World Economies, p. 4 on the continued usefulness of the staples thesis, along with a
discussion of its limitations. According to Egnal, the key features of the staples thesis are that “…the
export of primary products was the engine of growth for the colonial economy…[and that] the nature of
these exports shaped the pattern of regional development.” Egnal, New World Economies, 5.

that per capita incomes in the Lower South increased at an annual average rate of 0.9 percent per

year from 1713 to 1775, implying that per capita incomes grew by more than 70 percent over the

entire period.6 Recently we have argued, however, that the conventional view of the colonies of

the Lower South greatly overstates the rate of economic growth in the region.7 In fact, our

estimates suggest that per capita incomes were essentially stagnant from 1720 to 1770, and did

not change appreciably between 1770 and 1800.

        What explains the difference between our estimates and previously published figures?

Central to our interpretation is a revised understanding of the behavior of regional exports that

indicates that they were much less important as a stimulus to economic growth than has

heretofore been believed. But even without that revision, it would be surprising to find that

exports from this slave-plantation based economy led to rapid growth of output per capita. As

McCusker and Menard explained so clearly, when the export staple is a plantation crop it “will

have only a minor impact on local industry or the size of the market.”8 In these instances, the

impact of export growth is restricted almost entirely to increasing aggregate income via a

multiplier effect. Without linkages to further development within the region that could push up

labor productivity, per capita income can increase only if export proceeds rise faster than the

population.9

        As we shall show, this did not happen. Previous analysts have been misled by focusing

  It is possible that the characteristics of the exporting sectors in other colonial regions were more
conducive to growth via what Galenson and Menard call spread and linkage effects.

on only a subset of the most successful exports; failing to take into account both the slower

growth of other export commodities and the rapid growth of regional population (and its

changing composition), which was linked to the increase in aggregate exports; and ignoring the

place of exports in the context of the broader economy. What follows is based on a much more

comprehensive measure of regional exports set in the context of the entire economy and on

changes in the size and composition of the non-Native American population of the Lower South.

        Our result, that the economy of the Lower South experienced growth only in aggregate

output and population but not growth in per capita income, harkens back to the argument put

forth some time ago by Daniel Scott Smith that the distinctive feature of the early American

economy was its rapid extensive growth.10 This view has been out of favor for some time

because the prevailing wisdom had come to accept that there had been growth in output per

capita. That evidence against Smith’s thesis was not firmly based, however, having been arrived

at by assuming that per capita growth in the colonial economy must have been at least as rapid as

that in England, or that GDP grew as rapidly as the most successful exports.

        As Daniel Scott Smith argued, the absence of growth in per capita income does not mean

that the economy of the Lower South was stagnant or unsuccessful. Quite the contrary; over the

course of the eighteenth century, the colonies and states of the Lower South experienced rapid

extensive growth in economic activity, as well as in population and land under cultivation. Such

high rates of extensive growth were, in the words of Dan Smith, “extraordinary by any

standard.”11 Moreover, extensive economic growth brought with it an increase in the percentage

of the population under the age of 10, which reduced the share of the population engaged in

production. Under these circumstances, simply maintaining a constant level of per capita income

should be seen as a remarkable achievement.



II. Exports from the Lower South

        Exports were crucial to economic success in colonial British North America. That, at

least, is the argument advanced by both historians and economists. Whether one looks at the

literature about the colonies taken as a whole, or for any of the major regions (except New

England), exports loom large as the primary engine of economic growth. According to the

dominant theme found in textbooks as well as scholarly works, enterprising Europeans arrived in

North America and through hard work and abundant land created a prosperous and burgeoning

economy based on the export of agricultural staples. There is an appealing intuition to this

argument. After all, extracting wealth from North America was one of the factors motivating the

English since the age of Queen Elizabeth I. As a result, English and Anglo-American authorities

often kept careful track of exports from the colonies. And, on the face of it, there are grounds to

support the argument: some exports increased rapidly and provided the appearance of economic

growth, while population and aggregate GDP expanded at unprecedented rates.

        For the Lower South, scholars have routinely emphasized that exports, primarily of rice

and indigo, drove this region’s economy.12 Though these exports expanded at rapid rates, that

export success did not generate growth of GDP per capita in the region. There are five reasons

for this apparent anomaly. First, not all exports grew as rapidly as rice and indigo. Second, the

methods of production required large increases in the population and labor force and thus


12

citations in footnote 5
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                         6

forestalled increases in per capita output. Third, some individuals chose to increase their family

size rather than enjoy all the potential income themselves, thereby hindering improvements in,

and possibly reducing, GDP per person. Fourth, the success of the two staple exports was

confined almost entirely to a limited geographic area and a small part of the region’s population.

Fifth, production and productivity in the domestic sector, which were previously under-

emphasized, were important determinants of the region’s economic performance.

        The central role of exports in prior estimates of the southern economy follows from

scholars’ extensive use of the records of low country planters and those with whom they

organized the regional rice trade. To be sure, exports – especially of rice – grew rapidly and

represented a substantial output. But a comprehensive picture of regional export performance

requires that we look beyond rice and indigo to consider exports of naval stores and deerskins.

Although cotton was the region’s primary export in the nineteenth century, it did not emerge as a

significant contributor to exports until the 1790s. Consequently it is not a factor in economic

growth in the colonial period, but must be considered when measuring economic growth over the

longer period to 1800.

        Table 1 summarizes data on the quantity and value of these five items along with

evidence on the value of all other exports for 1768-1772, drawn from the American Inspector-

General’s ledgers. According to James Shepherd this is “the only complete source for

commodity trade for any years in the colonial period.”13 At the end of the colonial period these

five commodities accounted for 80 percent of the value of regional exports. Table 2 presents

data on the output and growth of each of these commodities over the course of the eighteenth

century. The top panel shows the quantity (three-year averages) of each of the five exports at

decadal benchmark dates; the bottom panel summarizes the rates of growth of these exports over

selected periods. In 1712, rice exports topped 3 million pounds, and by 1720 had more than

doubled to 8.1 million pounds and continued to climb, reaching a temporary peak of 34 million

pounds in 1740. That initial period of expansion ended with the start of the international conflict

known as the War of Jenkins Ear, which pitted Britain against Spain in a contest for who would

control shipping from the Caribbean and Central America. This conflict, as well as King

George's War (1744-48), substantially raised shipping and insurance costs and caused a sharp

drop in the net prices received by rice farmers.14. The depressed conditions persisted for most of

the decade, during which planters experimented with other crops, including indigo, which

emerged as an important complement to rice.15 With the return of peace in the late 1740s, rice

prices recovered along with exports. In the early 1760s, rice prices began to increase again, and

exports shot upward in the decade and a half before the Revolution.16 By 1770 exports had

increased to over 70 million pounds. This expansion implies a compound average annual rate of

growth of nearly 5.7 percent from 1712 to 1770.

        The upward trajectory of rice exports came to an end with the American Revolution as

substantial conflict in the region led to substantial material losses.17 In 1790, the next year for

South Carolina, 1722-1809,” Journal of Economic History, 61 (2001),

   Because indigo had a much higher value relative to weight than did rice, it could much more easily
bear the higher costs resulting from wartime conditions than could a bulky commodity like rice. But the
volume of exports did not take off until Britain began to offer a bounty for indigo in 1749 making the
crop commercially attractive. Moreover, since it could be grown on lands not suited to rice cultivation,
and its peak labor demands did not coincide with those of rice cultivation, planters could add indigo
without substantially reducing their commitment to rice (Gray 1958, p. 289).

Centuries,” Economic History Review 45, (1992), 692; Henry C. Dethlof, “The Colonial Rice Trade,”

Georgia and the Cape Fear region of North Carolina. Despite that expansion, South Carolina remained by
far the largest producer.

which we have data, exports were almost 42 million pounds; slightly less than they had been in

1760. Although the quantity of rice exported increased during the 1790s, in 1800 it remained

well below the peak reached during the colonial period.

        Indigo production did not begin in earnest until the 1740s, but as Table 2 reveals, during

the next two decades the quantity of indigo exported from the Lower South expanded quite

rapidly. In the 1750s, exports of indigo grew at the astonishing rate of 30 percent per year on

average.

        The growth of rice and indigo exports, however, obscures changes that were taking place

in the production of other export commodities. While it is true that rice and indigo became the

most important exports in the lower south in the eighteenth century, the rise of those trades came

at the expense of others. Planters employed the labor under their control to maintain rice

plantations and harvest indigo, which meant they put less labor toward the production of naval

stores, beef and pork, or Indian corn.18 And there was less emphasis on the trade in deerskins,

most of which arrived in colonists’ hands from native suppliers. The much slower growth of

deerskins and naval stores exports can be seen in Table 2.19 Between 1712 and 1770 the export

of deerskins rose at 1.3 percent per year, while naval stores increased at 3.8 percent per year.


population. Although data are imprecise, it is estimated that approximately 25,000 slaves died, ran away,
or were carried off by the British during the war; see Philip D. Morgan, “Black Society in the
Lowcountry, 1760-1810,” in Ira Berlin and Ronald Hoffman, eds., Slavery and Freedom in the Age of the
American Revolution (Charlottesville, 1983) 111, and Lewis C. Gray, History of Agriculture in the
Southern United States to 1860 (Gloucester, Mass., 1958) 596. The devastation caused by the war is
apparent in the low levels of exports in the immediate post-war period. Although exports rose rapidly in
the second half of the 1780s, even at their post-war peak in 1793, Charleston’s exports were well below
the level of the early 1770s. Gray, History of Agriculture, 1020-23
18
   Between 1753/54 and 1768-72, the export of Indian corn increased at only 1.25 percent per year, while
the export of beef and pork declined at 0.8 percent per year. The 1753 and 1754 data are from Edmund
Burke, An Account of the European Settlements in America, 6th ed. London, printed for J. Dodsley, 1777
pp. 259-61; those for 1768-72 are from Shepherd and Walton, Shipping, Maritime Trade, Appendix IV,
Tables 2-6, pp.211-227
19
   According to Converse Clowse, Economic Beginnings in Colonial South Carolina (Columbia, 1971),
178-79 and 222-23, beef and pork exports began to decline when rice initially rose in importance. .
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                               9

        The performance of these four items (rice, indigo, deerskins and naval stores) taken

together gives a close approximation to the behavior of total exports over the long term. In

1746-47 these four items comprised 89.3 percent of exports from Charleston, whereas in 1768-

72 they made up 89.7 percent of the region’s exports.20 Table 3 presents our estimates of the real

volume of all exports from the region expressed in 1840 prices at benchmark dates over the

course of the eighteenth century.21 As the evidence in Table 3 makes clear, although total

foreign exports rose at a rather rapid pace —4.27 percent per year between 1720 and 1770 —

this was substantially slower than the growth in rice exports alone.22 The success of rice exports

in the colonial period has given a distorted picture about the role of exports more generally,

suggesting that the economy of the Lower South was more successful than implied by the

behavior of total exports.23



III. Putting Export Performance in Context

        While exports were crucial for low country rice planters, an understanding of the impact

of the export sector on the Lower South as a whole must look more broadly across the region,


20
   The 1746-47 shares are from Coclanis, Shadow of a Dream, p. 81; the 1768-72 figures are from
Shepherd and Walton, Shipping, Maritime Trade, Appendix IV, Tables 2-6, pp.211-227. If deerskins
were excluded the remaining three items would not proxy the movement of total exports as well. The
share comprised by rice, indigo and naval stores rose from 67.3 to 82.5 percent.
21
   To construct an index of real aggregate export performance it is necessary to combine data on physical
quantities of individual exports based on a constant set of prices that abstracts from general changes in the
price level. The details of the derivation of these estimates are provided in the Appendix to this paper.
Nash constructed a similar index, but it was limited to exports from South Carolina and did not include
deerskins. With those his index shows a somewhat higher rate of growth. R.C. Nash, “South Carolina
and the Atlantic Economy in the Late Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,” Economic History Review
45, (1992).
22
   Over the longer period, total exports are pushed up near the end of the period by the cotton boom of the
1790s.
23
   Export growth is even slower if one takes into account the quantity of agricultural products shipped to
other colonies. Shipments to other colonies grew at an average annual rate of just 3.2 percent between
1720 and 1770. As a result the combined value of all external shipments in the colonial period grew at a
rate of just 4.1 percent per year.
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                              10

taking into account not only other exports, but also the enormous economic activity devoted to

non-export functions. Georgia, North Carolina, and the backcountry of South Carolina--which

are bit players in others’ economic histories—need to be integrated into any assessments of

regional economic patterns. 24

        The place to begin is with population. As can be seen in Figure 1, the bulk of the

region’s population in 1700 was concentrated in North Carolina, and though the colony exported

some naval stores it remained largely insulated from foreign trade.25 Georgia was established

only in 1732, and prohibited slavery until 1749. Until it eliminated restrictions on slavery its

population grew relatively slowly, but during the second half of the century it increased more

quickly, expanding to account for about 15 percent of the region’s population.26 Although the

growth of rice exports at the beginning of the eighteenth century contributed to the expansion of

South Carolina’s share of regional population, this figure peaked at 50 percent in 1730 and then

declined.

        But even within South Carolina, a declining share of population was engaged in export

production. The growth of rice exports from the Lower South coincided with the rapid

expansion of settlement into the interior regions of South Carolina. For the most part, the

settlement of the backcountry consisted of small independent farmers possessing few if any


24
   Although Peter Coclanis, (Shadow of a Dream,. 71-77) focused on the rise and decline of the low
country, he made careful and important distinctions between the impact of trade on that subregion and on
South Carolina as a whole. He thus brought to the fore the need to better understand the economy of the
backcountry, but he did not pursue the implications of the wide variations in economic performance
across subregions for economic growth in the Lower South as a whole.

26
   Although North Carolina was more populous than South Carolina it had far fewer slaves for most of
the eighteenth century. Slaves constituted a majority of South Carolina's population for most of the
eighteenth century. That colony contained 85 percent of the region’s slave population in 1700 and
although the numbers of slaves in Georgia and North Carolina grew more rapidly than those in South
Carolina, at the end of the century it still accounted for 43 percent of the region’s slaves (U.S. Bureau of
the Census 1975, Series A-7, and Z-1 to 19).

slaves, and producing only small quantities of marketable crops.27 As late as 1770, only 6,000

(8.7 percent) of South Carolina’s 76,000 slaves lived in the backcountry. In contrast, 30,000 (61

percent) of the colony’s 49,066 free inhabitants resided in this region.28

        That larger share of the population residing in the backcountry was virtually uninvolved

in the export trade dominated by the low country. From 1768 to 1772 average annual exports per

capita in Carolina's low country averaged £ 3.7 for the entire population, and £ 17.1 for the white

population. The backcountry figure was a mere £ 0.5. 29 Nor does it seem that backcountry

residents were producing food for the plantations since low country slaves were largely self-

sufficient.30 Residents of rice plantations also relied on hunting to make up for the fact that

planters did not give them much meat, and they tended their own gardens, growing a variety of

foods, including African foods.31

        When compared to the growth of population, the success of the export sector looks

considerably less impressive, as Table 3 makes clear. While exports were growing at 4.27

percent per year between 1720 and 1770, the region's population was increasing at 4.42 percent

per year. Consequently, the real volume of exports per capita was declining on average at 0.15

29,000 by 1790 and accounting for 27 percent of the state’s slave population. Klein Unification of a

of the century, rice planters remained the dominant employer of slaves, and the production of exports was
concentrated on the slave-based plantations. The rapid expansion of cotton cultivation beginning in the
early 1790s accelerated this shift, so that by 1810 close to 44 percent of the state’s slaves were living in
the back country.

percent per year.32 Moreover, even the success of the rice industry pales when population growth

is taken into account, with the volume of rice exports per capita having risen at only 0.3 percent

per year between 1720 and 1770.33

        Rather than serving as an engine of growth, the export sector is better understood as a

source of short-run instability. Exports, especially rice and indigo, rose more rapidly than

population in some decades and no doubt served to propel the region's economy ahead in those

years, but these times were intermingled with periods when exports grew slowly or even

declined. The net result is that over the entire colonial period population grew more rapidly than

exports, and thus exports per capita declined.

        There are two reasons why export growth could not keep ahead of population growth.

The production of exports rose rapidly in the Lower South primarily because the labor input had

increased rapidly, and that in turn required an increase in the population. Furthermore, economic

success fueled other demographic changes that made growth in GDP per capita difficult to

achieve. In the lower South of the eighteenth century, the methods of production yielded little in

the way of improvements in agricultural output per worker. 34 Instead, the increase in the volume

of rice and indigo exports was predominantly the direct result of an increase in the amount of

slave labor applied to the cultivation of those products. To some extent, the increased labor input


32
   As discussed below, the picture looks slightly different when exports are compared to the free
population alone.
33
   The growth of exports was slower after 1770, which resulted in a poorer performance over the longer
period from 1720 to 1800 when total exports per capita declined at 0.6 percent per year. Even rice
exports per capita declined over the longer period, due to a fall in production after 1770.
34
   Although the shift in the locus of production from upland areas to the low country and the adoption of
tidal irrigation suggest productivity gains might have occurred in rice farming, we estimate that long term
productivity improvements in the region's farm sector were modest at best, and may have been negative.
The annual rate of advance between 1720 and 1800 fell in a range between minus 0.2 and plus 0.3 percent
per year. See Peter C. Mancall, Joshua Rosenbloom, and Thomas Weiss 2002. “Agricultural Labor
Productivity in the Lower South, 1720-1800,” Explorations in Economic History 39 (2002), 390-424,

to rice and indigo came from a reduced production of other goods, but to a far greater extent it

required an increase in the slave population. And, because the natural rate of growth in the slave

population was extremely low (although higher than in the Caribbean) the increase in the number

of slave workers was achieved by importing them.35 Indeed, as Figure 2 illustrates, during the

colonial period decadal variations in slave imports into the region closely paralleled changes in

the volume of exports. Although these imported slaves may have been of working age, and thus

did not negatively affect the worker/population ratio, they nevertheless increased the population.

Indeed, even the slave population grew faster than exports.36 Between 1720 and 1770, when the

volume of exports from the Lower South to foreign destinations increased at 4.2 percent per

year, the slave population was rising by 4.8 percent.

        Meanwhile, the composition of the free population was changing in ways that reduced the

worker/population ratio. The overall labor force participation rate for the entire colony is a

function of the participation rates for specific population groups and the relative importance of

the different groups. In this economy, slaves had a higher participation rate than free persons,

free males had a higher participation rate than free females, and those aged 10 and over had

higher participation rates than those younger. Initially the colonial population of the Lower

South consisted largely of males of working age. Over time, and in part as a result of economic

   For comparisons of slave fertility and mortality in British North America with that of other western
slave societies, see Lorena S. Walsh, “African American Colonial Population,” and Stanley Engerman,
“Population History of the Caribbean,” in Michael Haines and Richard Steckel, eds. A Population History
of North America, (Cambridge, Eng., 2000), 198-209, 505-510. For the Lower South, we estimated that in
almost every decade of the eighteenth century slave imports exceeded the increase in the stock of the
slave population. See Peter C. Mancall, Joshua Rosenbloom, and Thomas Weiss, “Slave Prices and the
Economy of South Carolina, 1722-1809,” Journal of Economic History, 61 (2001), Table 2

   The slave population did grow more slowly than rice exports alone which could imply that there was
some productivity advance in rice production. See Nash, “South Carolina and the Atlantic Economy,”
Table 6, 689; as well as Mancall, Rosenbloom and Weiss “Agricultural Labor Productivity in the Lower
South, 1720-1800,” Table 2. On the other hand, it may simply reflect the reallocation of slave labor into
rice cultivation and out of other, less profitable, activities.

success in the export trade, the number of women and children increased. More women

migrated to the colonies, and successful farmers and planters married and chose to have more

children.

        The trends in the composition of the population that influenced the labor force

participation rate are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, the slave share of the regional

population increased from 39 percent in 1720 to 43 percent in 1730, but thereafter the share

dipped slightly and recovered, so that by 1774 the share was at the same 43 percent it held in

1730. These changes in the slave share of the population would have helped push up the labor

force participation rate in the 1720s, but not thereafter. The trends in the shares of the other

population groups -- the male share of the free population, the adult share of the male

population, and the adult share of the slave population -- were all downward. That is to say, the

components of the population that were increasing were those with lower participation rates

which resulted in a decline in the average participation rate for the entire colony. As a result of

these demographic shifts the participation rate remained steady at 0.49 between 1720 and 1740,

but declined thereafter to 0.47 in 1774. As a consequence, if there were no increase in labor

productivity, GDP per capita would have declined by 4 percent between 1720 and 1774.37

        These demographic shifts could be interpreted as an indication of economic success and

prosperity, but the standard indicators of economic output, which measure the value of goods and

services produced, do not reflect any increased value for this behavior. Indeed, the standard

measure such as GDP per capita could decline as the output was shared with additional family

members.


37
   After 1770, all the changes in the composition of the population, especially the decline in the slave
share of the population, worked to reduce the labor force participation rate from 0.47 in 1774 to 0.39 in
1800. With no increase in labor productivity, GDP per capita would have declined by 17 percent in the
last quarter of the century.

IV. Exports and Production for Domestic Consumption

        The focus on the export trade of the low country in the decades prior to the Revolution

also masks what was happening in the rest of the regional economy, where most production was

taking place. Even if the export trade had grown faster than it did, and faster than the population,

its impact would still have been restrained simply because the value of exports abroad amounted

to only 25 percent of the region's total output.38 The dominant part of GDP was production for

the domestic market, which normally comprised around 75 percent of the regional economy, and

most of this was produced in the backcountry.

        Although the disparities between the colonies in the Lower South and the subregions

within those colonies have been pointed out by other scholars, their implications for the course of

economic growth have not been pursued in previous discussions of the region’s economic

history. To understand the performance of the entire region requires more than an analysis of

low country rice exports. A more comprehensive assessment demands analysis of all the basic

components of output: firewood, shelter, nonagricultural output and food production.

        Given the importance of food, estimates of its value are essential to gauging the size of

the domestic sector. Regrettably there are no time series data on the production of food in the

eighteenth century, but a series can be obtained by estimating the value of food consumed and

making allowance for the import and export of food items. Despite the lack of a widely accepted

time series for food consumption, there is enough information about the diets of colonists and

slaves to permit a reasonable approximation of the likely values of food consumed.

        Existing documents provide evidence on the diet or its components, and on the value of

   John McCusker put the share at 25 to 30 percent for the colonies as a whole; see “Estimating Early
American Gross Domestic Product,” Historical Methods 33 (2000), 155-62 See Table 5 below for our
estimates of GDP for the Lower South and a comparison to foreign exports.
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                             16

providing a specified diet for a number of different groups in the population: free settlers,

soldiers, slaves, prisoners, and those needing charity. The evidence can be found in official

colonial records, court cases, committee hearings, travelers’ accounts, plantation records, and

vestry minutes. The records of the Trustees of Georgia, for example, contain well-documented

evidence on the monthly costs of maintaining those persons sent over to the colony and the

standard provisions for maintenance of settlers.39 The specified diet included beef or pork, rice,

peas, flour, beer, molasses, cheese, butter, spice, sugar, vinegar and salt. Moreover, the Trustees

specified different quantities of each for adult males, adult females, children and servants.40 The

colonial records for Georgia and South Carolina also reported expenditures on provisions for

troops, including in some instances provisions for those slaves and Natives who accompanied the

troops.41 That evidence from South Carolina for the period 1734 to 1756 indicates that the real

value of provisions provided to soldiers declined over time.42 Finally, vestry minutes detail




39
   Allen D. Candler, ed., The Colonial Records of the State of Georgia, III 407-11. The amounts
expended after the first year or two appear quite high and would suggest that the value of the diet declined
between the 1730s and 1800. We believe that some of the provisions in later years must have been
destined for settlers who had gone over in earlier years, and thus think the initial year’s figure may be a
better approximation of the average value of the diet.
40
   We have calculated the value of this diet to equal $31 per adult male in prices of 1840. The diet for
women and children aged 12 and over was calculated to be 83 percent that of a male; that for children
aged seven to twelve was specified be half that for those aged 12 and over; and that for those aged two to
seven was one-third. Apparently no provisions were provided for those under two years of age. (Colonial
Records of Georgia, III, 408-09).
41
   See for example the expenditures for Oglethorpe’s siege of St. Augustine (Colonial Records of
Georgia, II, 159-202. Robert Gallman argued that military rations were a reasonable proxy for food
consumption by the colonists; see “The Statistical Approach: Fundamental Concepts Applied to History,”
in G.R. Taylor and L. F. Ellsworth, eds., Approaches to American Economic History (Charlottesville,
1971), 73-78
42
   This is true regardless of whether it is valued in South Carolina currency, Pounds Sterling, or Dollars
(in prices of 1840). The figures in dollars and valued in 1840 prices were $32 in 1734 declining to $22 in
1756. It may be that the soldiers were expected to obtain some of their provisions by hunting and fishing,
and perhaps increasingly so over time as suggested by the decline in the allotment after 1736 (Colonial
Records of South Carolina, [hereafter CRSC] Journal of the Commons House of Assembly, vols. 1, 2, 7
and 14).
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                             17

evidence on weekly, monthly and annual maintenance for the poor.43

        Based on this variety of evidence, a case could be made that the diet of free colonists did

not change much, if at all, over the course of the eighteenth century. To be sure, diets no doubt

fluctuated from one year to another depending on the success of a harvest, or the booms and

busts of the economy. The estimates here allow the value of the diet to increase over time,

taking the most optimistic view implied by the assorted data on the diet, and thus giving an

upward bias to the economic growth that took place.44 Specifically, they are based on the

assumption that the value of an adult colonist's diet rose at an annual average rate of 0.25 percent

from 1720 to 1800. 45

        Surviving evidence reveals, not surprisingly, that the value of food consumed by a slave

differed from that of a free colonist, while that of an adult colonist differed from that of a child.

Although information on the slave diet is scarce, making assessments about changes in the diet

over time especially frustrating, it is unlikely there could have been much change in the slave

diet.46 After all, it was not highly varied in the nineteenth century and the quantities of food


43
   Vestry minutes are the records of the church parishes. Parishes had the primary responsibility for the
care of the poor and could levy taxes to finance their activities. See Brown (1928) and Watson (1977).
44
   Elsewhere we have shown that our estimated rates of growth are not very sensitive to plausible
changes in this and other assumptions underlying the estimates; see Mancall, Rosenbloom, and Weiss.
“Conjectural Estimates of Economic Growth in the Lower South, 1720 to 1800.” If we were to allow the
colonists' diet to increase even more rapidly over time, which would lead to a more rapid growth of GDP
and GDP per capita, then the domestic sector would have been responsible for even more of the growth
that had taken place. If we allowed exports to grow more slowly, the domestic sector would have been
relatively less important, but economic growth would have been slower.
45
   This rate is based on a comparison of the value of the diet specified for an adult by the Rules for
Georgia for 1735 ($31) with the figure of $37 we estimated for 1800. This is a very healthy advance in
the value of the diet considering that it does not reflect any increase in the costs of distribution.
Moreover, such an increase is likely too great for all the region’s free inhabitants. The diet specified in
the Rules for Georgia was for those going over as charity cases. Their diet is likely to have been inferior
to the average to be found for colonists residing in the longer established and wealthier colonies of
Carolina. See Colonial Records of Georgia, III, 407-11; and Mancall, Rosenbloom and Weiss, "The
Value of the Diet in the Lower South in the Eighteenth Century," Paper presented at the NBER Summer
Institute, 2002.
46
   Morgan argued there were differences in slave diets across regions, and slaves in the low country
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                            18

planters provided had to be sufficient to provide the calories and protein necessary to carry out

the arduous work of producing rice or indigo. In the nineteenth century, the value of a slave's

diet equaled about 75 percent that of a free person.47 For the eighteenth century, the data here

assume that the value of the slave’s diet increased from around 50 percent of a colonist's diet in

1700 to 75 percent in 1800, thereby adding another upward bias to the estimated rate of

economic growth.48 With the colonist’s diet increasing over time, this results in a substantial

growth in the slave’s diet of 0.29 percent per year. The estimates here assume continuity in the

diet of free children under the age of 10 at 50 percent of an adult’s diet for the entire century.49

The value of food consumed per capita for the region is a weighted average of the value

consumed by each of these major population groups.50

        Food produced for consumption within the region is the dominant component of the

domestic sector, but not the only one. The domestic sector includes as well the value of


produced more food on their own time than did those in the Chesapeake; he does not discuss the
likelihood of changes in the slave diet over time. See Slave Counterpoint, 135-143.
47
   The information we have found for the colonial period would put the relative value anywhere between
20 percent and 75 percent CRSC II, Commons Journal, 1739-1741, 493 and CRSC IV, Commons
Journal, 1742-1744, 377. The relative value of 20 percent seems much too low. The figures lying behind
that ratio imply annual values of $46 for a free person and $9 for a slave (in prices of 1840). The value
seems very low for slaves and high for free persons, thus yielding much too low a relative figure for
slaves.
48
   We based this beginning year value on Charles Kahn’s estimate for the “least-cost diet with minimum
fat requirements” using the medium price of pork; see Kahn, “A Linear Programming Solution to the
Slave Diet,” in Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, eds. (New York, 1992), table 25.5, p. 532). That
estimate equaled approximately 75 percent of the cost of the diet specified by Fogel and Engerman or
Sutch, which in turn was equal to 75 percent of the cost of a free person’s diet. Thus we assumed that the
value of the slave diet in 1800 equaled 75 percent that of a free person, and the value in 1700 equaled 75
percent of that 1800 figure—i.e., 56 percent of a free person’s diet—and that it changed at a constant rate
between those two dates.
49
   If instead we had assumed that the child’s diet had equaled 75 percent of an adult’s, food consumption
and production per capita would have been $3 to $4 higher in each year, but growth would have been
about the same.
50
   The weights are their respective shares of the population. In order to obtain an estimate of food
production we deduct the value of food imported and add the value of food products shipped to other
colonies. The derivation of these food imports and exports is explained in Mancall, Rosenbloom and
Weiss, “Conjectural Estimates of Economic Growth in the Lower South,” 400.

firewood produced, the rental value of dwellings, and all nonagricultural industries. Estimates of

output for these various components of the domestic sector are shown in Table 4. Table 5

reports estimates of GDP and GDP per capita for the region and compares them with the value of

foreign exports.



V. Re-interpreting the Economic Performance of the Lower South

        The economy of the Lower South expanded greatly between 1720 and 1770, but there

was no long-term upward movement in real GDP per capita. Within the colonial period the

region experienced particular success in the 1720s and 1750s, with GDP per capita rising on

average around one half of a percent per year, but these upward surges were offset by declines in

GDP per capita in other decades. As a result of these offsetting performances, GDP per capita in

1770 was almost identical to that in 1720, and there was very little change up or down over the

major sub periods of 1720-40 and 1740-70.51

        The performance, moreover, reveals little consistency between the success of the export

sector and that of the economy as a whole. Agricultural exports to foreign markets rose rapidly

in some decades, but not all, and GDP per capita and even exports per capita did not always

move in the same direction or with the same force. In the 1720s, there appears to have been a

rather strong relationship between export growth and the growth of GDP per capita. In the

1720s, exports grew at 7.4 percent per year, the highest average rate achieved for any decade in

the colonial period, and GDP per capita rose at 0.5 percent per year. In the 1740s, the

relationship seems clear as well, but with unfavorable consequences, as exports declined at 0.4

percent per year and GDP per capita declined at 0.3 percent per year. In the other decades of the


51
  Production for the domestic market helped to buoy up the growth of GDP after 1770, but even still, the
GDP per capita figure 1800 was only slightly higher than that for 1720 and below that for 1730.
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                         20

colonial period, that is the 1730s, 1750s and 1760s, the relationship is less clear. In the 1730s,

exports increased at the strong rate of 5.1 percent per year, only slightly slower than in the

previous decade, but GDP per capita declined at 0.6 percent per year. In the 1750s, exports

grew, albeit slower than in any decade except the 1740s yet GDP per capita rose at 0.4 percent

per year. In the following decade, exports grew faster than in the 1750s, but GDP per capita

grew much more slowly at only 0.2 percent per year.

        These figures reveal that the domestic sector influenced the outcomes. Between 1720

and 1740 when exports abroad surged upward by 6.3 percent per year in the aggregate and 0.8

percent per year on a per capita basis, GDP was held in check by a slower growth of output in

the more dominant domestic sector. Output there rose at an annual rate of only 5.0 percent

because food production grew slowly between 1720 and 1740. Two related phenomena explain

this situation. On the one hand there was less need to produce food because the slave share of

the population had increased, and on average slaves consumed less food. Second, the region

imported more food most likely because landholders devoted more of their holdings to crops for

export. The aggregate import of food rose at 12.5 percent per year, implying a $2 increase in the

per capita value of food imports from other colonies between 1720 and 1740. Some of the

growth of exports abroad was accomplished by shifting resources out of the production of food

for the local market into the production of exports. After 1740 the food-producing sector was

less of a drag on the region’s production, with the per capita value of food production rising in

each decade. Had the export sector been able to maintain the rapid pace of growth achieved in

the 1720s and 1730s, or if it had slowed down less than it did, the region's economic history

might have been much different. But this was not the case. Export growth slowed so much after

1740 that the per capita value of exports declined at a rate of 0.8 percent per year down through
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                        21

1770.52 In those circumstances, the region was fortunate to have had the larger food and

firewood sector which plowed ahead steadily and kept GDP per capita from declining.



VI. The Terms of Trade and the Value of Exports

        Colonists engaged in trade to obtain goods produced more cheaply abroad. If the terms

of trade improved, the real quantity of imports that could have been obtained would have risen

even if there were no increase in the quantity of the exports.53 But the relative changes in export

and import prices varied over time: the terms of trade improved at times, but worsened at others.

And the changes differed across the colonies both in magnitude and timing.

        What can be said about the Lower South? Did the terms of trade for that region improve

for the colonists, and to such an extent that they offset the decline in the quantity of exports per

capita? The price of rice rose substantially in the 1720s and 1730s, but those gains disappeared

when prices dropped during the War of the Austrian Succession in the 1740s. Prices only

returned to their pre-war high after 1760.54 Indigo prices moved opposite to those for rice,

soaring upward in the late 1740s when the crop was first cultivated on a commercial scale, but

declining after 1760. But neither of these export prices can adequately reflect the general

movement of all export prices; changes in the terms of trade must take into account the different

behavior of the various exports.55 By using the wholesale price indexes of South Carolina


52
   And, exports per capita declined even faster thereafter. By 1800 the per capita value of exports was
only 60 percent the value achieved in 1720.
53

Egnal’s estimate that exports stimulated colonial economic growth to a rate of 0.5 percent per year.

products prepared by Arthur Cole and George Rogers Taylor, which take into account the prices

of all the major exports, it is possible to calculate an index to represent all exports.56 For the

import price index, wholesale commodity prices in New York and Philadelphia must suffice. 57

Although price data for imports into the Lower South would be preferable, they are not available

for the entire period. The New York and Philadelphia price indexes should be a good proxy

because they represent goods similar to those southern colonists imported. Moreover, while the

prices in Charleston may have differed from those in New York or Philadelphia, changes in the

prices moved similarly.58

        The terms of trade varied often and widely, so it is difficult to generalize about the impact

on the colonists (See figures 4A and 4B). Colonists benefited from an improvement in the terms

of trade up through 1738 as the price of rice rose substantially, but those gains were lost over the

next ten years. With the rise in the price of indigo in the late 1740s the terms of trade improved

briefly, but fell for nearly a decade beginning in 1753. The terms of trade improved after the

French and Indian War, but even with that recovery there had been little change over the colonial




commodity prices, which shows that over the period 1722-75, the price of rice rose relative to the price of
English goods, and likewise for indigo prices over the period 1747-75. He did not present the average
increase over the periods, nor did he combine the two export prices to get a combined export price.
56
   The indexes are available in Historical Statistics of the United States, Series E92-95, with further
details available in George Rogers Taylor, 1932, “Wholesale Commodity Prices at Charleston, South
Carolina, 1732-1791,” and “Wholesale Commodity Prices at Charleston, South Carolina, 1796-1861,”
Journal of Economic and Business History, vol. IV, pp. 356-77 and 848-76.
57
   The Wholesale Commodity Price indexes were from Arthur Cole, Wholesale Commodity Prices in the
United States, 1700-1861, Vol. 1 (Cambridge, Mass., 1938), 124-25 and 148-49. According to Shepherd
and Walton, some of the more important imports, were muscovado sugar, West Indian rum, molasses, and
salt, but the imports into the Lower South that they could identify amounted to between 19 and 33 percent
of all imports in the years from 1768 to 1772. Regrettably there is limited information on the price of
imported manufactured goods, or other items that comprised some portion of imports into the region.
58
   For the short time period in which we can compare prices in the different locations, 1784-91, the
Charleston and New York prices moved closely together, both rising from an index value of 78 in 1784
and 1785 to 100 in 1791, while Philadelphia’s index changed very little. Cole, Wholesale Commodity

period.59

        These terms of trade, however, ignore slave imports, a vital component of the region’s

trade. A substantial portion of the Lower South’s export proceeds was spent on slave imports,

not on goods and services, and such importation has implications for the terms of trade and the

real incomes and standards of living of colonists. The value of slave imports as a percentage of

the value of exports ran between 10 and 31 percent.60 A second time series on the terms of trade

that takes into account the importation of slaves by combining the import price index discussed

above with an index of slave prices is shown in Figure 4B. 61 As shown there, this alternative

version of the terms of trade showed no improvement over the colonial period 1722 to 1773, and

our estimate is that it declined by about 10 percent.62 The worsening in the terms of trade

reflects the fact that the price of slaves rose over the century, especially after 1760.

        Although we cannot say reliably what the trend in the terms of trade was over the

colonial period using either of these two measures, it seems clear that there was no noticeable

long term upward movement. In other words, changes in the terms of trade would not alter the

picture shown by the sluggish growth in output per capita.
59
   There is so much variation in the series that no regression estimates of the trend is significant. The
1770 value of the terms of trade was roughly 10 percent above the value for 1720, but 12 percent below
that for 1730, and well below the peak of 1.79 found for 1736. The terms improved in the years leading
up to the Revolution, but with the deterioration of trade during and after the Revolution, they fell back
with the result that for the entire period 1720 to 1800, the terms of trade deteriorated by about 10 percent.
60
   In the 1740s, when the rice market was severely depressed and there was a prohibitive duty of slave
imports up through 1744, the figure amounted to only 2 percent. See Mancall, Rosenbloom and Weiss,
“Slave Prices,” Tables 1 and 2. These shares are based on the values of slaves and exports expressed in
1840 prices.
61
   The weights given to each are based on the import data for 1768-72, which indicate that slave imports
comprised 27.7 percent of all imports into the Lower South. Historical Statistics of the United States,
(1975) Series Z: 287 and 290. An alternative way to treat the impact of slave imports would be calculate
the effect of the terms of trade on only the fraction of export revenues that were spent on merchandise
imports.
62
   There is so much variation in the series that no regression estimates of the trend is significant. The
1770 figure was below that for 1722, our earliest observation, by 5 percent and below the 1730 figure by
19 percent. The 3 year average around 1770 was above the 1722 figure by 9 percent, but below the 1730
figure by 9 percent.

VII. The Standard of Living of the Free Population

        The preceding results indicate that the export trade had a small impact on the standard of

living in the Lower South due largely to the growth of the slave population. The importation of

slaves reduced any advantage that might otherwise have arisen from improvements in the terms

of trade and simultaneously increased the denominator in the calculation of GDP per capita for

the entire population. The picture looks somewhat different for the free colonists only.

        The average value of exports per free person was substantially higher than that for the

entire population; 80 percent higher in 1740 for example. Since the free population grew slightly

slower than the total population during the period, 1720 to 1770, exports per free person rose

slightly from just under $22 to $23.63 Gross Domestic Product per free person increased only

slightly faster during the colonial period than did that for the entire population.64 For the period

1720 to 1770, GDP per free person rose at 0.14 percent per year versus the negligible 0.03

percent for the entire population.65 (see Tables 5 and 6) Although the growth of income per free

colonist in the Lower South was still sluggish, the colonists of the Lower South were well off.

The average GDP per capita (valued in prices of 1840) amounted to $75 in 1720, rose noticeably

to $85 in 1730 and then fell back to $80 by 1770.66

        The free white colonists may also have benefited from bounties provided by England to


63
   For the longer period 1720 to 1800, however, the free population grew faster than the total population
with the consequence that exports per free person declined at an average annual rate of 0.7 percent per
year.
64
   The amount of GDP flowing to the colonists was estimated by subtracting from total GDP an estimate
of maintenance for the slave population.
65
   For the longer period 1720-1800, however, the figure fell at 0.05 percent per year instead of growing at
0.04 percent when the entire population is taken into consideration.
66
   The value declined further after the Revolutionary War, with the 1800 figure being below that for
1720. These values are somewhat below those presented by Perkins (1980, p. 154), which he derived by
multiplying average wealth estimates by an assumed wealth/output ratio.

encourage the importation of items that the British thought they sorely needed. These bounties

were paid to encourage the import of selected items from the colonies. To some extent they were

intended to offset higher costs of transporting items from the colonies than from the continent.

The colonists benefited from the increased demand for their product by English importers who

received these subsidies, but they may also have benefited from some portion of the bounty

being passed on to the colonial producers. Because such a government subsidy is not included in

the 1840 price used to value colonial output, the income flowing to white colonists may not be

fully captured in our measure.67

        Two subsidized items were of some importance to colonists of the Lower South: naval

stores and indigo. In the case of naval stores, the British needed an alternate source of supply

when war in Scandinavia and actions by the Stockholm monopoly severely reduced imports of

tar and pitch from the Baltic region. Beginning in 1705 a bounty of £4 per ton on tar and pitch

was provided for imports from the colonies.68 The Act providing for these bounties lapsed in

1725, and "the bounties were discontinued during the four years following 1725," but were

restored with passage of a new Act in 1729.69 The latter provided reduced bounties of £2 4s on

tar and £1 on pitch.70 The bounty for indigo was also established in response to the impact of

war. King George’s War (1739-1748) disrupted both the rice trade of the Lower South and the

British importation of indigo from French colonies. During the War, the colonists experiment
67
   We do not know which portion of the bounty, if any, was passed on to the colonists, so our calculations
are made to illustrate the consequences of these bounties in the event that all of it was passed on to the
colonists.

   For tar that met the specifications of the 1722 act, the bounty would be £ 4. But, there were complaints
about the quality of tar from the colonies, and “London merchants petitioned the Board of Trade in 17679
to drop green tar from the bounty list, ‘there being little or no tar of such quality imported or used in the
Manufactures of this Kingdom.’” Williams, “English Mercantilism,” pp. 184-85)

with indigo as an alternative export staple, and at the end of the War the British established a

bounty to encourage the development of an alternative supply.71

        Although the effectiveness of these bounties in calling forth additional production has not

been fully determined, the colonists nevertheless may have received additional income that is not

included in our estimate of the value of exports produced.72 And, in the case of naval stores, this

was not an inconsiderable amount. In 1706, the initial year of payments, the bounty amounted to

only £554, but rose quickly to reach £10,135 in 1715, nearly tripled the following year, and

peaked at £52,011s in 1718.73 On a per capita basis for the colonies as a whole, these do not

amount to much, running between 3 to 5 pence per white person in all colonies, with a peak of

around 30 pence per person in 1718. The export of naval stores, however, came

disproportionately from the Lower South. In 1768-72 when we have export data for all colonies,

the Lower South accounted for 68 percent of all naval stores exports. Given that this was a

region with a relatively small white population, the bounty per person would have been a more

noticeable amount, reaching as high as £1 Sterling (or $4.44) in 1720 (see Table 5). If the

bounties on naval stores and indigo were fully passed on to the colonists in all years, they would

have given a bigger boost to the colonists’ income early in the period, especially between 1716

and 1725, than near its end. Ironically, the consequence of this would have been to slow the

growth of per capita income.

        With or without the bounties, the free colonists in the Lower South were quite well off in

71
   According to McCusker and Menard, The Economy of British America, p. 187, the initial bounty of six
pence per lb. was reduced to 4 pence sometime in the 1750 or 1760s, but then restored to six pence in the
early 1770s. Lewis Gray, Agriculture in the Southern United States to 1860, p. 293 says the bounty was
reduced to 4 pence per lb. in the early 1770s.
72
   McCusker and Menard are of the opinion that the bounties stimulated the production of naval stores up
through the 1720s, whereas for indigo “the bounty’s impact has been exaggerated.” In the latter’s case,
duties on foreign indigo likely had a more favorable effect. Ibid, pp. 179-80,187.

the mid-eighteenth century. Indeed, they were as well off as the average American resident was

in the opening decades of the nineteenth century, when GDP per capita for the nation ran around

$66 to $77 up through 1830. Not until 1840, when the value of GDP per capita reached $91 did

the average American surpass the level that had been achieved by these free colonists as early as

1730.74 Of course those nineteenth-century figures pertain to the entire population, including

slaves. When the comparison is made to the free population alone in 1840, the free colonists do

not appear quite as well off. The most pertinent comparison is with the free population in the

South Atlantic region. That region, which includes the District of Columbia and the states of

Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina Georgia and Florida, is not

exactly comparable to the Lower South, but is more similar than the entire nation. Average

income per capita for free persons in that region in 1840 was $96, higher than that for the

colonists, but not by much. 75 That figure suggests that per capita income in the region may have

increased by only around 12 to 20 percent over the preceding century.



VIII. Conclusions

        These new estimates of exports, output in the domestic sector, and GDP provide little

support for the view that export success led to intensive economic growth. Any picture of

colonial success that rests on the performance of the export sector alone is likely to misrepresent

the true course of change, at least for the Lower South. This should not be too surprising.

Exports were a relatively small part of the economy. They have received a great deal of attention

74
   These figures are all expressed in prices of 1840. See Weiss, “Economic Growth Before 1860,” Table
75
   Stanley Engerman and Robert Fogel, “The Economics of Slavery“ in Stanley Engerman and Robert
Fogel eds., The Reinterpretation of American Economic History, 335. Their figures were reported in
prices of 1860, but they would be the same if expressed in 1840 prices because there was no change in the
GDP price deflator between the two dates. See Robert Gallman, “Gross National Product,” 34, Table A-
3. The average per capita income for the entire free population in the United States in 1840 was $105,
above that for the free colonists of the Lower South.
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                    28

because they were a primary reason for the initial English colonization of North America, at the

heart of political debates, and generated quantifiable statistics. Moreover, exports from the south

grew quite rapidly in the aggregate, so that sector would appear to have been dynamic and

capable of generating sustained growth. Population, however, was simply growing quicker.

        The emphasis that previous research put on South Carolina, and in particular the low

country's export and economic success, has fostered a misleading view of the performance of the

entire region. The low country was only a portion of the region, and its population became less

numerically significant over the course of the eighteenth century. The economic activity taking

place in Georgia, North Carolina and in the rapidly growing back country of South Carolina

played a large role in shaping the region’s economic performance. The other primary

demographic shift in the region—the growing proportion of the population under age ten—also

has received inadequate attention. Each of these factors suggests that reliance on the adult

population of the low country—the population most responsible for exports—provides an

imperfect picture of the regional economy.

        The fact that output per person did not grow much, if at all, over the course of the

eighteenth century should not blind us to the success that was achieved. The colonies of the

Lower South experienced rapid population growth. The number of free persons and slaves grew

at 4.2 percent per year between 1720 and 1800, and the labor force grew slightly slower (3.9

percent per year) as the share of the population comprised of women and children rose. The

combination of a stable or nearly stable per capita figure and rapid population growth means that

gross domestic product in total grew quite rapidly. Real GDP for the non-Indian population

increased at 4.44 percent per year during the colonial period from 1720 to 1770, and 4.27 percent

per year from 1720 through the end of the century.

        The great need for labor in the colonies encouraged both migration and the importation of

slaves over the course of the eighteenth century. It is all too easy, perhaps, to overlook the fact

that the colonial economy was able to absorb the additional labor without experiencing declines

in productivity. This stands in contrast to the inability of so many economies to absorb labor in

the period after World War II, and differs from the experience of much of Europe between 1500

and 1750 when economic advance could occur only when population growth was held in

check.76 The success of the Lower South's economy is in part a tribute to the abundance of land

that enabled colonists to fend off diminishing returns, at least in agriculture, and perhaps in part

to the transfer of land from Natives to newcomers at relatively low costs. Nevertheless, the

existence of that abundant resource is one thing, its apparent efficient use in combination with

labor should not be taken for granted. That the per capita figure did not decline in the face of the

rapid increase in population and labor is a notable accomplishment.

        The extensive growth of population and GDP are measures of success. Colonists had

more children because they felt they could afford to and because they believed that their children

would eventually become productive workers.77 Likewise, some colonists imported slaves

because they saw them as productive investments in a land abundant environment. Others

migrated to the region because the economy looked attractive to them. These responses are signs

of a productive economy. Indeed, the fact that the region's economy could forge ahead in the

wake of such population increases attests to its capabilities. For the colonial period itself, there

   With a rise in income, households can choose to have more goods and more children. If the prices of
goods were relatively high, as they likely were in colonial America, households might have chosen to
substitute children for durable goods. And, some might have chosen to increase the number of children
rather than try provide greater quality for a smaller number. See Richard Easterlin, The Reluctant
Economist, chap. 8, “An Economic Framework for Fertility Analysis,” Cambridge University Press,
2004, for a discussion of these issues.
Exports-Slow Growth Colonial                                                                      30

was economic success, just not quite as much as previous writers suggested.

        The results here do not alter the older view that the economy of the mainland Anglo-

American colonies was a success. Instead, careful attention to the changing demographic

composition and residential patterns of the region reveals that the traditional view was correct to

a large extent, but too narrowly focused. Rather than concentrate on exports, which involved an

increasingly small percentage of the colonial population, scholars need to measure economic

success by considering the entire population, including the vast majority who were not directly

involved in export-oriented occupations. The staples thesis can no longer stand alone as the

primary way to explain this economy. If we are to take seriously the effort to understand and

measure economic performance in the mainland, we need to replace explanations pivoting on

exports with newer, more encompassing models that include a wide range of economic behavior.

One way to launch this new conceptualization of the Anglo-American economy is to pay greater

attention to the entire population, even those whose efforts were never recorded by merchants or

port authorities. Seen from this new angle, slow growth of income per capita is no longer an

anomaly. It is, instead, a reasonable measure of an economy that succeeded despite massive

population growth, a demographic trend that has undermined all too many other societies.

          The value of all exports is an independent estimate made by contemporaries, and accepted by Shepherd and
Walton. (See Shepherd and Walton, pp. 93-95). Shepherd and Walton reported the 1769 figure for rice exports to
southern Europe in hundredweight. We converted to barrels by dividing the reported value by the price per barrel
(2.1814 Pounds Sterling) implicit in the Shepherd and Walton figures for rice exports to Great Britain and the West
Indies in 1769. That conversion implies there were 5.25 hundredweight per barrel.

Notes and Sources to Table 5:
        GDP is the sum of output in the Domestic and Export sectors, where the latter includes shipments to other
North American colonies. The estimates of exports abroad are from Table 3 above. The estimates of output in the
domestic sector are from Table 4.
         GDP as measured here is narrowly defined to exclude land clearing and the value of home manufactures. If
it were more broadly defined to include those items, growth would be slower because both of those items were of
greater importance early on in the period. All figures are real dollars expressed in terms of 1840 prices. These
estimates are similar in concept to the earlier conjectures made for the early nineteenth century in that the scope of
coverage is consistent as regards the extent to which marketed and non-marketed output is measured. See Paul
David, “The Growth of Real Product in the United States Before 1840: New Evidence, Controlled Conjectures,”
Journal of Economic History 27 (1967), 151-197; Thomas Weiss, “U.S. Labor Force Estimates and Economic
Growth, 1800-1860,” in Robert Gallman and John Wallis, eds., American Economic Growth and Standards of
Living before the Civil War (Chicago, 1992), 19-75; Weiss, “Economic Growth Before 1860: Revised Conjectures,”
in Weiss and Donald Schaefer, eds., American Economic Development in Historical Perspective (Stanford, 1994),
11-27
        These GDP figures are not the usual measure of the market value of goods and services produced in any
given year as compiled by the Department of Commerce today. Portions of the domestic sector’s output in each
year were estimated by extrapolating backward in time a base year value for 1800 that reflected a greater degree of
market orientation than existed in 1720. In effect, they measure the value of the colonies’ output as though the same

fraction were marketed in each year as prevailed in 1800. This makes sense when trying to gauge the output and
standard of living of people whose economy may have been largely non-market oriented, but as a result the figures
are conceptually different from the standard national income accounting measures wherein GDP is confined for the
most part to market transactions. In that scheme, GDP can increase with an increase in the extent to which output
passes through markets, even when there is no increase in production. The present estimates minimize growth from
that source. It may be that some of the divergence between the present estimates of growth in output per capita and
those of previous researchers reflects the differences in concept. That is, the higher rates of growth estimated by
others may reflect the increased output that is going through market channels rather than an increase in production.
This, however, is only speculation, as other researchers have not made clear how much, if any, of their estimates
reflect increased output versus increased market orientation. Of course, as Farley Grubb (“The circulating medium
of exchange in colonial Pennsylvania, 1729-1775,” Explorations in Economic History 41 (2004), 353) has argued,
the increase in the marketed versus non-marketed activity can mean an increase in welfare per capita.

         Residual GDP was calculated by subtracting a maintenance allowance for slaves from the
estimated value of GDP and also deducting the value of exports to foreign destinations. The maintenance
allowance was equal to the value of the slave diet underlying the estimates of GDP, which increased over
time from a value of $25.42 in 1720 to $29.11 in 1770, plus an allowance for housing, firewood and all
other items. The value of these three items varied slightly over time, and averaged $7.80 for the period
1720 to 1770.
         The bounties were estimated by multiplying the quantities exported of indigo, and of naval stores
(tar, green tar, pitch and turpentine), by the specified bounty per unit. The indigo bounty rate is from
McCusker and Menard, The Economy of British America, p. 187. The initial bounty of six pence per lb.
was reduced to 4 pence sometime in the 1750 or 1760s, but then restored to six pence in the early 1770s.
Lewis Gray, Agriculture in the Southern United States to 1860, p. 293 says the bounty was reduced to 4
pence per lb. in the early 1770s. The naval stores bounty rate is from Lewis Gray, Agriculture in the
Southern United States to 1860, pp. 153-56. A ton was specified as being eight barrels. Bounties were
also provided for turpentine and rosin at £3 per ton, and for mast, yards and bowsprits at £1, none of
which were of much importance to the Lower South.

       Although the historical record for the colonial period is more complete as regards exports
than other things, it nevertheless is not fully complete, nor is it complete enough for our
purposes. A complete record would cover all exports from each colony or colonial region, not
only one or two major staple exports, and cover exports to all destinations, not just Great Britain
or England, which is readily available. And, it would distinguish exports produced in the region
from re-exports of goods produced elsewhere. In order to estimate GDP for the region, we had
to construct the series on domestically-produced exports shipped to all destinations.
       The series we produced is shown in Tables 1 and 2. In Table 1 we present benchmark
estimates of the real value of all domestically-produced exports to all destinations, as well as the
per capita values of those exports and the average rates of change. We have shown the real value
of exports under two different dating schemes. We have shown the export figures by year of
export, which is the more common or traditional dating scheme. We have also shown the value
of exports by year of production, because we are ultimately interested in estimating the region's
production. Thus we have shifted the estimated values of exports backwards one year in order to
have a series that is more closely aligned with the time of production than with the time of
export. Table 2 shows the annual values of these variables. The derivation of this series on the
real value of all exports to all destinations is explained below and laid out in Tables 3 through
12.



                  Derivation of the Series on Domestically Produced Exports

       We constructed the estimates in parts. First we established a benchmark figure for 1770
based on the estimates of Shepherd and Walton.1 We then extended that figure backward to
1710 and forward to 1803. The former extension was done using an index of the volume of the
four most important exports. The latter extension was done in two parts: we first linked the 1770
benchmark figure with data for 1790-92 using the method set out by Shepherd and Walton

point, but in fact the evidence taken from Shepherd and Walton is for the five year period 1768-72.

(1976) and then extrapolated the 1790-92 data to 1803 using a volume index of the eight most
important exports.2



Benchmark Figures for exports of 1768-72 (production years 1767-71)

       The estimates for 1768-72 were calculated from the evidence assembled by James
Shepherd and Gary Walton from the "American Inspector-General's Ledgers."3 Shepherd
describes this as "The only complete source for commodity trade for any years in the colonial
period."4 Shepherd and Walton presented the total value of exports in Pounds Sterling from each
colony of the Lower South, as well as the quantities and the Sterling values of many selected
commodities that were exported from each of those colonies in each year 1768-1772 (1972,
Appendix IV, Tables 2-6).

       We wanted a series valued in constant prices in order to gauge the growth of real output
produced for export. And, we wanted the series valued in prices of 1840 so that it could be
combined with other estimates of real output for the region and then linked to estimates of real
GDP for the nineteenth century. We used 1840 prices to value the quantities of the eight most
important exports reported by Shepherd and Walton in each of the five years, and inflated that
figure to obtain the value of all exports in 1840 prices. The 8 items and their 1840 prices are
shown in Table 3. These 8 items comprised an average of 85 percent of the current price value
of all exports from the region for the period 1768-72, with the percentage having remained fairly
constant over the period (see Table 4, col. 3). The value of the 8 items in1840 prices (Table 4,
col.4) was divided by those current price shares to obtain the value of all exports from the region
in 1840 prices (Table 4, col. 5).

       We have also shown in Table 4 alternative estimates of the exports valued in 1840 prices
in each of these five years. We derived these by converting the current price values from
Sterling to dollars at the exchange rate of $4.44, and then deflating to obtain the values in 1840
prices.5 In the first instance we deflated by a David-Solar-McCusker Price Index (the David-
Solar-McCusker Price Index) which on a base of 1840 had a three-year average value of 92.6 in
1770. In the second case we used Cole's data to construct an export price index for the Lower
South, which on a base of 1840 had a three-year average value of 161.7 in 1770. As can be seen
in Table 4, these alternative values differ noticeably from the figures we calculated using 1840
prices, and differ noticeably from each other, and demonstrate the difficulties of attempting to
put a precise value on real exports.

       It is worth pointing out that the estimated growth in our export series before or after this
period will not be affected by our choice of benchmark figures, even though the benchmark
figures differ widely across these series. In our time series estimates, growth before and after
1768-72 is based on the behavior of volume indexes constructed independently of the benchmark
figures.



Exports Before and After the Benchmark Period

       We extended our benchmark estimates backward in time to produce an annual series

running back to 1710. We extended the series forward in time as well, but the annual series is

confined to the period 1790 to 1803. In both cases we estimated the value of domestically

produced exports by using a volume index of change in the region's exports. A volume index is

a real index of exports in which quantities of the individual exports are weighted by a constant

set of prices and summed. The index measures the change in that weighted sum. Our index for

1790-1803 is based on the same eight major exports that were used to construct the benchmark

figures for 1767-71; our index for the period before 1767 is based on four of those major exports.

The issue is how to weight these available data in order to best approximate the behavior of total

exports.



Exports in the Pre-1767 period
        In the colonial period there were four major items exported internationally from the

Lower South: rice, naval stores, deerskins and indigo. The quantity exported of each of the first

three of these was available for most years back through 1712.6 Indigo was not produced until

1746, but an annual series could be compiled from then on.

        Export quantities for rice, naval stores, and indigo were taken from Historical Statistics

of the United States (U.S. Census Bureau ,1975). The rice figures (series Z: 481) purport to

show total exports from ports in South Carolina and Georgia so provide the coverage we were

seeking.

        For naval stores (series Z: 500 through 503) report exports from Charleston, and thus

cover exports from South Carolina, one of the two major sources in the region. Those data for

some years cover only a few months so we inflated each of those to full years assuming that the

exports in each month were proportionate to the months for which data are available. Annual

exports from the other major producing colony, North Carolina, are not available, but exports

were reported at selected dates. Shepherd and Walton provide figures of exports to overseas

destinations for 1768-1772, all of which went to Great Britain. Roy Merrens reports figures of

exports to all destinations for those years, including other North American colonies.7 A

comparison of the two figures indicates that for the 5 years, exports overseas accounted for 66

  We did have to fill in a few gaps in the data in order to avoid spurious fluctuations. These are

percent of the total. Exports of naval stores were also available for 1720 and 1752.8 Given that

the chief interest of the Burkes was on the trade between the colonies and England, (see vol. 1,

preface) it is likely that all 84,012 barrels reported were shipped overseas. But in order not to

minimize the growth of naval stores exports we assumed that the total included exports to other

colonies, and applied the same percentage (66 percent) as calculated for 1768-72. We made the

same assumption for the 1720 figures.

        We interpolated between 1720 and 1752, and also between 1752 and 1770, to obtain

annual figures for other years. Because North Carolina made up such a large portion of total

naval stores exports -- averaging 58 percent for 1768-72 -- we used changes in the value of

bounties paid on American naval stores.9 Because North Carolina’s export of naval stores

increased faster over time than did that of all colonies, we also used changes in the ratio of North

Carolina’s exports to the bounties paid. The ratio could be calculated for the benchmark years of

1720, 1752 and 1768-72 (5 year average), and then was assumed to increase at a constant rate

between benchmark dates. The estimated exports of naval stores from North Carolina in the

intervening years is thus the product of the interpolated ratio and the reported value of bounties

paid to all colonies. This procedure yielded the result that North Carolina’s share of all bounties

fell from around 60 percent in 1768-72 to only 7 percent in the years 1720-22. We assumed that

the share remained constant at 7 percent back to 1706 -- the first year in which bounties were

paid -- and calculated the amount of bounty paid to North Carolina. Dividing that amount by

the bounty per barrel yielded the estimate of naval stores exported from the colony in each

year.10

          The data for indigo (series Z 433 and Z 434) cover both South Carolina and Georgia for

1753-1770 but only South Carolina for the remaining years. In order to complete the volume

index we compiled a new series on deerskin exports, combining the evidence available from

several sources for South Carolina and Georgia.11

          Most of the reported export data appear to reflect exports between the fall of one calendar

year, and the fall of the next year (e.g., November 1, 1734 to October 31, 1735). This “export

year” reflects sales of the crop harvested in the fall of the calendar year on which it begins.

Historical Statistics (U.S. Census Bureau 1975) generally attributes exports to the year from

which most of the data come (in the example, exports would be listed as 1735; but correspond to

the crop grown and harvested in 1734). Gray (1958) generally adopts a “crop year” dating

scheme, so he would list the exports as being for 1734.12 The choice is in some sense arbitrary,

but it needs to be consistent. We have adopted a “crop year” dating scheme, which means that

we have changed the dates of all the data from Historical Statistics to be one year earlier than in

the source.

          In Table 5 we have presented benchmark figures on the quantities of these major exports
that underlie our volume indexes, along with the rates of growth of each of those. As can be
seen, rice exports grew quite rapidly from 1712 onward, and quite rapidly in almost every
decade. Only in the 1740s did rice exports decline and only in one other decade, the 1750s, was
the average rate of growth below 5.0 percent. Exports received a substantial boost in the 1750s
by the growth of indigo production, but the other major items that were exported over the entire

   Clowse did likewise in reporting exports for Charleston. (1981, pp. 57-58, Table B-21).

period did not fare so well. Over the longer term, naval stores rose on average at only 0.55
percent per year between 1712 and 1770, while deerskins increased at 1.3 percent per year over
that same period. Although rice was the dominant export in value terms (see Table 6), naval
stores and deerskin exports were not unimportant, especially so in the earlier decades of the
century. Thus, the increase in the real value of exports over the period 1720-70 was held in
check by these slower growing items, and the average rate of growth for total exports in constant
prices must have been less than the 4.65 percent shown by rice alone.
        We considered a number of alternative weights to use in order to construct a volume
index for the years before 1767 based on these four exports. These weights, which are based on
the composition of exports in selected years, are summarized in Table 6. We also show there the
implicit shares of each export yielded by valuing the export quantities by the prices of 1840. The
volume indexes that we have calculated based on various weighting schemes are summarized in
Table 7
        The first series shown in Table 7 is that derived by weighting the quantities of each
export by its price in 1840 (prices are shown in Table 3) and is the series we have used to
extrapolate the benchmark figures back to 1712.13 As can be seen, this index yields the highest
rates of growth for the region over the colonial period, as well as the highest in most decades and
subperiods.14 This index shows a decline in real exports during the 1740s, a result which
captures the impact of the decline in rice exports before the favorable effect of increased indigo
exports takes hold. That decline or slowing down is captured as well in most of the other
indexes. The rate of growth shown by our volume index between 1720 and 1770 is consistent
with the fact that real exports in total must have grown more slowly than the quantity of rice
exported. The latter rose at 4.6 percent per year between 1720 and 1770, our volume index
implies that total exports grew at 4.25 percent per year over that same period. Indeed, the rates
of growth implied by this index seem consistent with the rate of growth of rice exported in each
subperiod. In all subperiods the total grew somewhat slower than rice exports with three
exceptions: in the 1740s when total exports declined somewhat more rapidly than rice, in the

13
   The series on naval stores exports terminates in 1712 so we have used that date as the terminal date for
the extrapolated volume index series. We have extended the index to 1710 based on the export of only
rice and deerskins. By excluding naval stores, or any substitute export, we think the growth in the volume
index between 1710 and 1712 is overstated.




                                                    8
1750s, and between 1740 and 1770. In these last two cases the growth of total exports was
pushed up by the increased production of indigo.
        The other series shown in Table 7 are also based on the exports of the same three or four
major items used in our volume index, but with different weights given to each export in the
various series. The first two alternative indexes are based on valuing the major exports in terms
of hundredweights (cwts.) of rice. To construct such an index, the exports of the other
products—deerskins, indigo and naval stores—were converted to their equivalent in rice using a
fixed set of relative prices. Nash (1992, p. 699) calculated such an index for South Carolina
based on three exports rice, naval stores, and indigo. The series labeled Extended Nash Index
was constructed by us to broaden Nash’s index to cover exports from the other colonies in the
region and to include deerskin exports. Nash (1992, p. 699) calculated the relative prices of rice,
naval stores, and indigo for the pre-1773 period. For rice he used the average price for 1733-74,
for indigo prices the average price for 1747-74, and for naval stores he used a weighted index of
prices of pitch, tar and turpentine averaged for 1733-74. Unfortunately price data for deerskins
are very limited, and we used the average price of deerskin exports for the 1767-71 period.15
Although we did not find many prices of deerskins, those we did find, with the exception of a
price quoted in the correspondence of Henry Laurens, were higher than the price for 1769-72 and
thus would have given a greater weight to deerskins in the index. A greater weight may have
been appropriate, but because deerskins were among the slower growing exports we did not want
to assign too high a weight to them and thereby bias downward the growth of the volume index.
Thus we chose the relatively lower average price for 1769-72 to give a lower weight to deerskins
in the index. The prices are:
                Rice = 6s. 10d. per cwt = 1 volume unit
                Indigo = 3s 7d. per lb = 0.52 volume unit
                Naval Stores = 6s. 10.75d. per barrel = 1.01 volume unit
                Deerskins = 1s. 11.5d per lb = 0.29 volume units




14
   The series based on Nash's index grew faster at times and over the full period 1720 to 1770, but his
index pertains to only South Carolina, not the entire region.
15
   This price was the average value of a lb. of deerskin exports for 1769-72 calculated from the data
reported by Shepherd and Walton (1972, Appendix IV).



                                                     9
       The Extended Nash Index is based on the quantities of four exports back to 1746, but
only three exports from 1746 back to 1712. The index value for 1746 based on the four exports
was extrapolated back to 1712 based on the change in the index for three items.
       The other alternative indexes are based on the relative importance of each of the four
major exports in 1767-71 and 1747-48. The relative importance varied depending on whether
the items were valued in current prices or in constant prices of 1840. Moreover, in each of the
series based on the 1767-71 share weights we produced two variations, one without reweighting
before 1746, the other with reweighting in order to adjust for the fact that indigo was not
produced before 1746.
       Another check on our series is to gauge the growth of real exports in the colonial period
by deflating the value of exports in current prices. This, however, can only be done for a few
sub-periods because the current price data are available for only a few years. Moreover, the
price data available are not ideally suited to the task of deflating exports. One of those, the price
of rice covers only one export; the other the David-Solar-McCusker Price Index is a more
general consumer price index, not an index of producers prices. Nevertheless, these deflated
values can give an approximation of the likely rate of increase in the real value of exports. As
can be seen in Table 8, exports deflated by the David-Solar-McCusker index increased between
1712 and 1747 at an annual average rate of 5.7 percent, between 1747 and 1770 at an annual rate
of 4.3, and for the longer period 1712 to 1770 the average rate of growth was 5.1 percent per
year.16 Use of the other indices gives different results. For the period 1747-70, when deflated by
the price of rice, the real value of exports rose at only 3.2 percent per year, whereas deflated by
the Cole index, the rate of growth was 3.7 percent per year. Although these estimates are
imperfect and limited in scope, they do provide some perspective for assessing the growth
measured by using export quantities. The rate of growth in our volume index corresponding to
the years for which we have been able to calculate deflated values are shown in the last column
of the table. As can be seen our estimates show faster growth than all three of the deflated series
in the period 1747-70. For the longer time period, 1701-70, our index shows somewhat slower
growth than the series deflated by the David-Solar-McCusker Price Index, but the difference is
not great.




                                                 10
                                  Exports in the Post-1770 Period
        We extrapolated the 1767-71 benchmark data forward in two stages. We first linked the
benchmark data to 1790-92, and then extrapolated that figure forward to 1803 based on a volume
index of change in the most important exports.
        There is not enough data available to construct an annual export series running from 1772
to 1791. Instead we have made an estimate for 1790, 1791 and 1792 following the method laid
out by Shepherd and Walton (1976, 397-422). They estimated the increase in real exports
between 1768-72 and 1791-92 by valuing the quantities of the most important exports in constant
prices. For the 13 colonies and states they calculated such an increase in two ways; using on the
one hand the prices of 1768-72 in pounds Sterling, and on the other hand the average price for
1791-92 in dollars. The choice of price weights did not matter. The increase in real exports for
the selected commodities was 37 percent.17 Those selected commodities comprised 88 percent
of the current price value of all exports in 1768-72, and 86 percent in 1791-92.
        Their estimates by region were not presented in comparable detail. They were calculated
by deflating the reported current price values by the Paasche price index implicit in the
calculations for the 13 colonies and states. For the Lower South they showed a growth of real
exports between 1768-72 to 1791-92 of only 5.6 percent. Rather than accept this estimate, we
made more detailed calculations of the sort they had made for the colonies as a whole. These
calculations are shown in Table 9, with the dating shifted backward one year. We obtained
somewhat different results from those of Shepherd and Walton, but not greatly so and the result
depends on the choice of price weights. If we use the Sterling prices of 1767-71 we find that real
exports rose by 9 percent between 1767-71 and 1790. If we use the prices of 1791 as the
weights, the real value of exports declined by 1.0 percent between those dates. 18



16
    The 1701 figure covers only exports to England, not to all destinations, so probably understates the
total volume of exports. As a result, rates of growth between 1701 and other years are probably upper
bounds.
17
   The increase was 37.1 percent using the Sterling prices of 1768-72 and 37 percent using the prices of
1791-92. (Shepherd and Walton, 1976, p. 412 fn. 24).
18
   If we use the average export value for 1790-92 the increase from the average value for 1768-72 was 20
percent. Using the average values the increase was 11 percent.



                                                   11
        We have chosen to use the estimates based on the prices of 1767-71 to link the colonial
export series with the post-1790 period, and thus impute some growth in the real value of
exports. Although foreign trade was subject to much disruption after the Revolutionary War,
Gordon Bjork concluded from his examination of the period that "there was a modest increase in
exports between the pre- and post- revolutionary period."19 He was commenting on the colonies
as a whole, not the Lower South, but the calculations made by Shepherd and Walton indicated
that some small increase in exports had taken place for the region. The index shown in Table 9
for the 8 items was used to extrapolate to 1790, 1791 and 1792 the 1767-71 value of all exports
(expressed in 1840 prices). Those values are shown in the last column in Table 9.


Estimates for 1790 to 1803
        Although export statistics are available for the years after 1790, the reported values are in
current prices and include re-exports. We do not know exactly how large re-exports were for
any region, but for the nation they were quite large from 1793-1806, and varied in importance
from year to year. And, over time, inflation contributed noticeably to the increase in the value of
exports. Because our goal is to estimate real output in the Lower South, we wanted a series on
only domestically-produced agricultural exports in constant prices, so we needed to eliminate the
influences of inflation and re-exports. An indication of the extent to which these two phenomena
influenced the value of exports from the Lower South, and the increase in the value over time,
can be seen from a glance at the trade statistics shown in Table 10A. There we show the extent
to which the increase in the nominal value of all exports from the region between 1790 and 1801
can be accounted for by the growth of the 8 major exports known to have been produced in the
region. The portion unaccounted for – labeled “share not identified’ – is an approximation of the
value of re-exports of items not produced within the region. As can be seen, that share varied
widely over the decade, and amounted to as much as 53 percent of the total value of the region’s
exports in 1796.
        Between 1790 and 1800, the nominal value of exports from the Lower South soared from
$3.6 million to $13.6 million. There was of course a cotton boom, but this can account for only a
fraction of the increase. Cotton exports valued in current prices rose from virtually nil ($47


19
  Bjork, 1964, p. 560. He did point out that the increase in exports was far below the rapid increase in
population, and he was commenting on the colonies as a whole, not the Lower South specifically



                                                    12
thousand in 1790) to $4.4 million in 1800. Rice, which had been the region's chief export, did
not fare so well; the nominal value of rice exported increased by only $408 thousand between
1790 and 1800. In other words, the two major agricultural exports of the region can account for
only around 40 percent of the increase in the region's total exports expressed in nominal prices.
        The remaining major exports cannot explain the increase. Indeed, as a group the value of
these other exports declined slightly; pulled down for the most part by the fall in indigo exports.
In other words, a very large increase in total exports, more than $6 million or about 60 percent of
the increase, remains unexplained by the growth of the 8 most important regional products.
        It is possible that other regional products not among these eight, such as wheat and flour,
might account for some of the increase, but more likely most of the increase was due to an
upsurge in the re-export of items, such as coffee and sugar, that were not produced in the region.
The national figures suggest this was the case. For the nation, the nominal value of exports rose
from $20.2 million in 1790 to $70.8 million in 1800, about the same percentage increase as took
place in the Lower South. Re-exports, which were recorded for the nation, rose by $38.8 million
accounting for about three-fourths of the total increase. Domestically produced exports rose by
only $11.8 million.20
        Because our interest is in the value of real exports produced in the region, it was
necessary that we take account of the two phenomena of inflation and re-exports. We first
attempted to do this by using the available published statistics. We deducted an estimate of the
value of re-exports from the reported value of all exports for the region in order to obtain a figure
representing the value of agricultural exports produced in the region. We then adjusted those
current values of domestically-produced exports for price changes in order to obtain the real
values. The results are shown in Table11.
        The current value of exports shown there is net of our estimate of re-exports from the
region. We derived re-exports from the region as the sum of estimates for each of three states
(GA, NC, and SC), adjusting each state's series for the value of re-exports likely to have been
included in the reported totals. For 1791 through 1802, the reported export figures combined the

20
    There is some question as to the whether the value of re-exports was $39 or $49 million in 1800, and
thus whether the value of domestically produced exports, which was obtained by subtraction of the re-
exports from the total value of exports, was $31.7 or $21.7. North (1961, p. 221) reported re-exports as
the larger figure, whereas the figure is reported as $39 million in Historical Statistics, (Series U-192).




                                                    13
value of domestically-produced exports and re-exports. Beginning in 1803, the values of the two
types of exports were reported separately by state. We used the relative shares for 1803-1810 for
each state to distribute the totals reported for each state in the earlier years. For Georgia and
North Carolina, domestically-produced exports comprised 99 or 100 percent of total exports in
every year after 1803, so we assumed all exports in each of these states for the years 1791-1802
were produced domestically. The domestically-produced share of exports in South Carolina was
less than 100 percent in each year and varied over the period 1803-10. The share dropped
between 1803 and 1805-07 and then rose. We extrapolated the domestic share for South
Carolina back to 1791 based on the change in the domestically produced share for the United
States and an assumed ratio of South Carolina's share to that for the United States. In order to
bias upward the 1800 figure for the Lower South - and thus bias upward the rate of growth that
had taken place before 1800 - we used the higher average ratio found for the subperiod 1805-07
rather than the average for the longer term 1803-10. For 1790 we had to resort to an alternative
method of estimation because even the total export figures by state were unavailable; only
national figures were reported but they did provide the breakdown between domestically
produced exports and re-exports. We estimated the value of domestically produced exports for
the region as 18 percent of the figure reported for the United States; this percentage being the
average for the years 1791-96. 21
        These net values were then deflated by several available, but imperfect, price indexes to
obtain estimates of the real value of exports produced in the region. The results using three
different price series as deflators are shown in Table 11. All the deflated series show substantial
increases over the decade of the 1790s, with the average annual rates of growth ranging from
6.97 to 12.18 percent per year.
        The Taylor-Cole Export Price Index is conceptually the more appropriate deflator as it
measures changes in prices of the chief exports from the region. For the period after 1796 the
price index includes all South Carolina’s export staples except deerskins, while before 1791 it
covers the four chief export staples: rice, deerskins, naval stores and indigo. The real value
series based on that deflator may be the best of the three, but there are several shortcomings. The


Doug Irwin (2002, p.36) argues that the lower value of re-exports is the correct one as the Treasury
Report of 1837 shows the $39 million figure.
21
   In all these estimates we have assumed that all the domestically-produced exports from the Lower
South were agricultural products.



                                                   14
most important flaw is that the index constructed for the period 1796 to 1812 gives cotton a
weight of 65 percent. This large a weight may be suitable for much of the period, but not for the
1790s when cotton was only beginning its rise to prominence. As was seen in Table 7, and again
in Table 10, at the beginning of the 1790s cotton accounted for at most 2 percent of the region's
exports. Its share rose substantially thereafter, but even at the end of the decade its share was not
above 50 percent, well below the 65 percent weight in the Taylor-Cole Index. Another
shortcoming is that there is no coverage between 1791 and 1796, and the index for the post-1796
rests on a different base year than that for the period before 1791.22 We have linked the two
series based on the change in the price of rice between 1791 and 1796 in order to put them on the
same base year in both periods. Given that the Taylor-Cole Index gives such a large weight to
cotton, interpolating by changes in the price of rice may not be ideal, but it seemed the only
practical alternative.23 Although imperfect, the series deflated by the Cole index gives some
measure of the likely increases in the real value of domestically produced exports. Given the
extremely high weight given to cotton, this series most likely gives an upwardly biased measure
of growth in the region's exports during the 1790s.
          We also estimated the real value of domestically produced exports in the 1790s by
applying the same method that was used to link 1767-71 with 1790-92. That is, we first derived
an index of change in the volume of the 8 most important exports and then extrapolated the
benchmark figure for 1791 (expressed in prices of 1840) on the change in that index.
          This too does not lend itself to unequivocal results because of the wide variation in the
behavior of the chief exports and the large changes in their relative importance over time. As
was seen in Table 10B, the pattern of increase or decrease was not uniform among the chief
exports. The quantity of cotton surged while the quantity of rice declined substantially between
1790 and 1800. The quantity of naval stores, which had fallen off substantially between 1770
and1790, remained fairly constant during the 1790s. The quantity of deerskins, which had
declined precipitously between 1770 and 1790, rose substantially during the 1790s although at
the end of the century the quantity exported was still well below the 1768-72 average. The
quantity of wood products, both boards as well as staves and headings, remained roughly
constant during the 1790s, while tobacco which had increased noticeably between 1770 and 1790

22
     A minor problem is that the index for the period before 1791 includes corn.




                                                     15
declined during the 1790s. Indigo exports fell throughout. Based on these conflicting patterns,
one cannot say with much confidence that real exports in total increased or decreased over the
closing decade of the century.
        It should also be pointed out that the quantity figures for the region's export of naval
stores, boards, staves and headings, and tobacco in the years after 1792 were estimated by
assuming that the region’s share of the U.S. exports of those products equaled the share for 1791
and 1792. The consequence of this is that the behavior of these exports is heavily influenced by
what was happening in the other regions that exported these products. The behavior of exports
from those other regions may not represent well the growth in the exports from the Lower South.
This is perhaps most obvious in the case of tobacco for which the Lower South was a minor
exporter, but it may be true for naval stores and wood products as well.24
        Despite these shortcomings, we weighted the quantities of these 8 exports by prices to
obtain an index of the change in the volume of the 8 exports combined that took place between
1791 and 1800. In fact, we constructed two indexes: one in which the quantities were weighted
by prices at the beginning of the period (1791 prices) and a second using prices from the end of
the period. The two estimates are shown in Table 12.
        The two index series behave very similarly, especially up to 1798. They diverge
somewhat after that point, with the index weighted by 1791 prices rising more rapidly.
Nevertheless, for the entire decade the two indexes give fairly similar results. Real exports
increased substantially between 1791 and 1800, by 106 percent when weighted by 1791 prices
and by 83 percent when weighted by prices of 1800. The average annual rates of change
between 1790 and 1800 were 9.1 and 7.7 percent. These rates are also very similar to those
obtained by deflating the estimated current price value of domestically produced exports by
either the David-Solar-McCusker Price Index or North's Export Price Index (see Table 11), but
are below the rate of change implied when the current price figures were deflated by Cole's
Export Price Index. Based on these comparisons, the Cole-deflated series appears to be an
outlier, and we think this is for the reason we stated earlier that it simply gives too great a weight
to cotton during this decade.

23
   For the period 1796 to 1803, changes in the price of the two commodities were substantially different;
the price of rice rose by about 26 percent while the price of cotton fell by 52 percent.
24
   The Lower South accounted for only 13 percent of the nation’s export of tobacco in 1791 and 92,
whereas it accounted for 31 percent of the wood products and 39 percent of the naval stores.



                                                    16
       We have used the index based on the 1791 prices to extrapolate the real value of all
exports expressed in prices of 1840. Those estimates are also shown in Table 12. We also show
there the per capita value of exports expressed in prices of 1840. The per capita figures held
quite steady until 1798, then increased sharply.

Notes to Tables 1 and 2:
        The derivation of the export series is explained in the accompanying text and tables.
         The population of the Lower South includes that in Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and
Tennessee. The benchmark figures for the free and slave population for 1700 to 1780 are from Historical
Statistics (Series Z:1-19). The Black population includes both slaves and free negroes. John McCusker
and Russell Menard made slight revisions to the figures for 1710, 1720 and 1740 (Table 8.1, p. 173), but
did not report the white and black populations separately for each colony. Their figures, as well as those
shown in Historical Statistics, differ slightly from the figures reported by Wood for some of these years.
        The 1790 figures are from the U.S. Census of 1800, as shown in Rossiter 1909. The figures were
taken from an electronic file provided by Michael Haines. The 1800 white and slave population figures
are those underlying Weiss's (1992) labor force estimates, and came originally from the U.S. Census of
1800.

1840: All prices except those for indigo and deerskins are from Arthur H. Cole, 1938, Statistical
Supplement. The prices of rice, naval stores, boards, staves and headings, and tobacco are the average of
the monthly prices reported for the year 1840. The cotton price is the average for 1839-41, which was
higher than the price for 1840. For indigo we used the average value per pound for indigo exports in
1840 (U.S. Congress, 1884, p. 37) rather than the price reported by Cole which referred to the price of
Venezuelan indigo in New Orleans. The price of deerskins for 1840 was derived from data in Anne
Bezanson, Robert Gray, and Miriam Hussey, (1937) Wholesale Prices in Philadelphia, 1784-1861.
Philadelphia: U. of Pennsylvania Press. We extrapolated the 1791 implicit export price to other years
based on the change in their index of prices in Philadelphia.

Notes and Sources to Table 5
Naval Stores: The total is the sum of estimates of exports from South Carolina and from North Carolina.
The South Carolina exports for 1712-1724 are from Clowse, 1981, p.65. We estimated the values for
1713-16 by interpolating between the reported values for 1712 and 1717. For 1724-1777 Census Bureau
(1975, series Z 500, 501, 503). The reported data for some years covered only a few months. We have
inflated each of these to full years assuming that the exports in each month were proportionate to the
months for which data are available.
         The exports of naval stores from North Carolina were reported for only a few selected dates.
Shepherd and Walton provide figures of exports to overseas destinations for 1768-1772, all of which went
to Great Britain. Exports of naval stores were also available for 1720 (Colonial Records of North
Carolina, vol. II, p. 396 as reported in Lewis Gray, 1958. History of Agriculture in the Southern United
States to 1860. Gloucester, MA: Peter Smith. (reprint edition). p. and for 1752 (Edmund and William
Burke, An Account of the European Settlements in America, 6th ed., printed for J. Dodsley, 1777, vol. 2, p.
261. As described in the accompanying text, we interpolated between 1720 and 1752, and also between
1752 and 1770, to obtain annual figures for other years. We then shifted these export estimates backward
a year to attribute them to the year of production, and combined them with the exports from Charleston
(displaced to the year of production) to arrive at the total for the Lower South.

Rice: 1710-1773, U.S. Census Bureau (1975, series Z 481), which shows total exports from ports in
South Carolina and Georgia; after 1782, export data are for Charleston only, and we inflated these using
the ratio of South Carolina and Georgia to Charleston exports that prevailed from 1768 to 1773 (1.23) to
inflate Charleston exports to their regional level. Data for 1782-1788 are from U.S. Census Bureau




                                                    26
(1975, series Z 483). The reported data for 1713 to 1774 and 1783-89 were shifted back a year to
represent the crop year (i.e. the year of production), a method espoused by Clowse, 1981, pp. 57-58,
Table B-21.
Indigo: 1746-1787, U.S. Census Bureau (1975, series Z 433 and Z 434). For 1753-1770 data for Georgia
are available. For the remaining years the data are for South Carolina alone. For 1789-1800 data are
from Gray (1958, p. 1024). The reported data for all years were shifted back a year to reflect the crop
year. Gray reports quantities in chests or casks, both of which were assumed to weigh 350 pounds.
Deerskin: Exports were compiled by us. See Mancall, Rosenbloom, and Weiss, 2002 "Estimates of
Deerskin Exports from the Lower South, 1700-1800," mimeo University of Kansas.

Notes and Sources for Table 6:
         The 1747-48 figures are from Coclanis, 1989, p. 81. Those for 1767-71 are from Shepherd and Walton,
1972, Appendix IV, Tables 2-6. The 1791-92 current price figures for the region equal the quantities (New
American State Papers, Commerce and Navigation, vol. 1, pp. 163ff) times prices (Table 3 above). The values in
1840 prices were calculated by weighting the quantities of each export by prices shown in Table 3. See Tables 4
and 8 for the sources of the quantity data.

      the rate of change shown for the Nash Index for 1712-47 is for the period 1710-50.
    See the text for a discussion of how the various indices were calculated. We have used 1712 as the terminal date for the extrapolated volume
index series because the series on naval stores exports terminates in 1712. We could extend the index to 1710 based on the export of only rice and
deerskins, but with the exclusion of naval stores or any substitute export, the growth in the volume index between 1710 and 1712 would be greatly
overstated.

Notes and Source to Table 8:
        The value of exports in dollars equals the Sterling values converted at $4.44 per £.
        The value of exports in Sterling for 1701 is the three year average for 1700-02 taken from the 'official series' (Historical Statistics, Series
Z: 223 That series was valued in prices of 1700-02, so the values for these particular years should thus be close to current price values.
        The value of exports in Sterling for 1747 is from Coclanis, 1989, p. 107.
        The prices of rice are from Cole (1938a, p. 154) converted at the exchange rate of $4.44 per £
        The composite index was constructed by McCusker, (1999) "How Much is That in Real Money," Table A-1. McCusker extended the
Brady-David-Solar Consumer Price Index (backward to 1720 based on Bezanson's index of Philadelphia commodity prices. Whereas the original
index used 1860 as the base year, we have shifted the index to a base year of 1840. We have used three-year average values of the index for
deflation.
        Cole's Export Price Index is that for Charleston's export prices, prepared by George Rogers Taylor (Historical Statistics, Series E: 92-95).

Notes and Sources to Table 9:
     The values of the individual exports are the products of the quantities (Tables 8 below and Shepherd and Walton, (1972) Appendix IV, Tables
2 to 7) times the prices of 1768-72 or 1791 (Table 3 above).
     The Index of Real Exports is the index of the sum of the 8 items with 1767-71 set as the bas year.
     The value of exports in 1840 prices for 1767-71 comes from Table 4. The value in other years equals that base year value times the index for
each year. The sum of the eight items in Pounds Sterling for 1767-71 shown in this table differs slightly from the figure shown in Table 4 because
the latter is the average of the five annual totals.

Notes and Sources to Table 10 B:
    The data for 1767-71, both price and quantity, are the values reported by Shepherd and Walton for
1768-72. (1972, Appendix IV, Tables 2 to 7). The reported data were shifted back a year to reflect the
crop year. The Sterling values were converted at $4.44 per pound Sterling.

Rice: For 1789-1800 we used quantity data from Gray (1958, vol. 2, pp. 1020-23, Table 37). For 1801 to
1803 we extrapolated the 1800 figure forward on the basis of the change in rice exports for the U.S. taken
from Holmes, 1912, pp. 5-7. The Lower South's share of U.S. exports implicit in this calculation is 86
percent, about equal to the 87.5 percent share for 1791-92 based on tierces exported (New American State
Papers, Commerce and Navigation, vol. 1 pp. 163ff.

Indigo:. 1789-1800, from Gray (1958, p. 1024). Gray reports quantities in chests or casks, both of which
were assumed to amount to 350 pounds.

Deerskin: Exports were compiled by us. See Mancall, Rosenbloom, and Weiss, 2002 "Estimates of
Deerskin Exports from the Lower South, 1700-1800," mimeo University of Kansas.

Cotton: Bruchey (1967, Table 3-A). Lower South exports were estimated based on total US exports and
the share of the Lower South in total US production. According to Bruchey, in 1791 the Lower South
accounted for 100 percent of cotton production. By 1801 this figure had fallen to 85 percent. We
interpolated linearly between these figures to get the shares for other years.

Naval Stores, Boards, Staves and Headings and Tobacco: The quantity figures shown as being
produced in 1790 and 1791 are the export figures for 1791 and 1792 (New American State Papers,
Commerce and Navigation, vol. 1, pp. 163ff). The figures for other years were estimated based on
changes in U.S. exports of each item. The U.S. figures are from U.S Congress, 1884, Table NO. 2, pp.
16-23.

    The quantities reported in the sources were shifted back one year to better represent the crop or
production year. This is a method espoused by Clowse, 1981, pp. 57-58, Table B-21.

    The price data are from Cole, 1938, except for deerskin prices. In any year for which Cole did not
report a price for Charleston, we estimated a price by extrapolating the nearest Charleston price by the
change in the Philadelphia price for that same export item. The deerskin price for 1791 is the price
implicit in the exports of deerskins for that year (New American State Papers, vol. 2, p. ). The deerskin
price in other years was estimated by extrapolating the 1791 figure on the change in the Bezanson price
index for deerskins in Philadelphia. (Bezanson, et al, 1937).

     The David-Solar-McCusker Price Index was constructed by McCusker, (1999) "How Much is That in Real
Money," Table A-1. McCusker extended the Brady-David-Solar Consumer Price Index backward to 1720 based on
Bezanson's index of Philadelphia commodity prices. Whereas the original index used 1860 as the base year, we
have shifted the index to a base year of 1840.
