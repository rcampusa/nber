                                             ABSTRACT

We investigate whether local average treatment effects (LATE’s) can be extrapolated to new settings.
We extend the analysis and framework of Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii (2015), which examines
the external validity of the Angrist-Evans (1998) reduced-form natural experiment of having two first
children of the same sex on the probability of an incremental child and on mother’s labor supply. We
estimate Angrist and Evans's (1998) same-sex instrumental variable strategy in 139 country-year censuses
using data from the Integrated Public Use Micro Sample International. We compare each country-year's
LATE, as a hypothetical target, to the LATE extrapolated from other country-years (using the approach
suggested by Angrist and Fernandez-Val 2010). Paralleling our findings in Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and
Samii (2015), we find that with a sufficiently large reference sample, we extrapolate the treatment
effect reasonably well, but the degree of accuracy depends on the extent of covariate similarity between
the target and reference settings. Our results suggest that – at least for our application – there is hope
for external validity.

1. Introduction

Angrist and Evans (1998) use the sex composition of the first two children as an instrument for

the effect of fertility on labor supply. In light of Imbens and Angrist (1994) and Angrist, Imbens,

and Rubin (1996) and the subsequent local average treatment effect literature, the immediate

empirical relevance of the Angrist-Evans finding is limited not just to the United States in 1980

and 1990 but also to the subpopulation of compliers - i.e. those mothers whose fertility was

increased as a result of having had two first children of the same sex. In this sense, it is doubly

local.

         At the same time, it is natural as social scientists to view these results in a more general

light: they hopefully reflect the underlying relationship between family size and a woman’s labor

supply. As an economic issue, the connection between these two variables is of broad interest.

Within the context of developed, low-fertility countries, increases in fertility could lead to

reductions in female labor supply and labor force participation. In developing countries, where

fertility rates are higher but declining, the reverse effect is relevant: reducing fertility could

significantly increase female labor force participation and spur economic growth.

         In this paper we address the tension between these two perspectives. Using the Integrated

Public Use Micro Sample International (IPUMS-I) data set, we implement the Angrist-Evans

same-sex instrumental variable strategy in 139 country-year censuses. The censuses span the

world geographically (as listed in Appendix Table A-1) and cover five decades from 1960 to

2010. In particular, we use results from Abadie (2003) and Angrist-Fernadez-Val (2010) to

characterize the complier population in each country-year sample in terms of covariates. We use

these characteristics to extrapolate the treatment effect from a given country-year (the




                                                  2
“reference” country) to a country-year of hypothetical interest (the “target” country). We

perform this exercise on each country-year pair and use the resulting 139 × 138 dyads to examine

the extent to which the local average treatment effect (LATE) can be reliably extrapolated from

reference to target. We also conduct the analysis cumulatively, using all available reference

country-years prior to time t to extrapolate to a target country-year at time t.

       We think of the complier population in the target country as the population of

hypothetical policy interest. In principle one could extrapolate a reference LATE to various

subpopulations in the target country. But for the complier subpopulation in the target we can

directly identify an internally valid benchmark (namely the target country-year LATE) against

which to compare the extrapolation. Using our approach, we can also extrapolate both the target

and reference LATE’s to average treatment effects (ATEs), hence compare an extrapolated

reference ATE to the target ATE; we consider this approach in Section 8.1 below.

       The exercise connects to two interrelated literatures within labor and development

economics. First, it relates to Lalonde (1986) and the papers that followed from it (see Heckman

et al. 1997, 1998, 1999 and Dehejia and Wahba 1998, 2002 inter alia). By using an external

reference sample to estimate the treatment effect in a setting where we already possess a

plausibly internally valid estimate of the treatment effect, we use Lalonde’s basic template. In

addition, we are interested in characterizing when an externally extrapolated result is likely to

provide a reliable estimate of the treatment effect (in the spirit of Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and

Todd 1998). Furthermore, our exercise represents the first step in an empirical induction in a

setting where general theorems are not possible. For Lalonde, the question was the extent to

which non-experimental estimators could replicate an experimental benchmark. As his paper

showed, even in the context of a single data set, a thoughtful attack on this question could push




                                                  3
the literature to replicate and extend his findings and eventually reach a broader understanding.

We hope that, in a modest way, our paper could provoke further investigation into the

relationship between local average treatment effects and their potential to extrapolate treatment

effects globally.

       Second, our work also connects to a small but growing literature that has begun to

grapple with issues of external validity in randomized controlled trials (RCT’s); see inter alia

Allcott (2014), Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii (2015), Gechter (2015), Prichett and Sandefur

(2013), and Vivalt (2015). In no small part spurred by Lalonde (1986) and the ensuing literature,

RCT’s have been used extensively, indeed globally, to estimate the causal impact of a broad

range of policy interventions. A tension similar to that of instrumental variables resonates in this

exercise. Each RCT evaluation of an intervention is also a local average treatment effect, perhaps

in the Imbens-Angrist (1994) sense if issues of non-compliance arise, but also in the broader

sense of evaluating an intervention in a specific time and place and on a specific and not always

representative set of experimental subjects. At the same time, there is an intellectual agenda in

which an accumulation of experimental evidence might allow one to reach more general

conclusions regarding the efficacy of certain policies or the relevance and validity of specific

economic models (an issue which we examine in Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii 2015 and in

Section 6, below).

       In this paper we take up the challenge of examining the extent to which we can

extrapolate a LATE from a quasi-experimental evidence base to new contexts of interest. Using

the Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2010) framework, we assume that heterogeneity in the local

average treatment effect is driven by differences in observable characteristics of the complier

population. By characterizing the complier population in each country-year sample, we can




                                                 4
calibrate the local average treatment effect from a reference country to match the complier

population distribution of covariates in a target country of interest. Of course, such an exercise

will succeed in reliably extrapolating the treatment effect only if the identifying assumptions are

approximately true in the application and data we are studying. It is precisely in this sense that

our exercise uses Lalonde (1986) as a motivation. Our data provide internally valid estimates of

the target LATE’s. Most immediately, this allows us to test the validity of the identifying

assumption that LATE heterogeneity is driven by observable covariates. But more substantively,

we are interested in characterizing which differences between an experimental reference and a

target context are most likely to lead to failures in external validity. This latter goal represents a

step toward systematizing the discussion of issues related to external validity.

       To preview our findings, our exercise has five steps (which parallel our approach in

Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii 2015). First, using simulated data, which satisfies our

identifying assumptions by construction, we confirm the basic insight that calibrating the

treatment effect in a reference country does yield a reliable estimate of the treatment effect in a

target country. Indeed, we show that if the identifying assumptions are true, not only is external

validity possible but also “super-external validity”: if only a small sample size is available in the

target, it can be preferable to use an externally extrapolated estimate from a reference country

where the treatment effect is more precisely estimated (i.e., with a larger sample size).

       Second, we graphically document that there is considerable heterogeneity both in the

first-stage and in the instrumental variable estimates across our sample. We also find substantial

variation in the characteristics of the complier populations.

       Third, we use the dyads described above to run regressions of external prediction error

against differences between the target and reference countries and to characterize empirically




                                                  5
which differences significantly drive prediction error. We show that prediction error increases

considerably in covariate differences between the reference and target contexts of interest.

           Fourth, we use the timeline of our country-year samples to examine how the

accumulation of evidence from additional samples affects out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We

find that, using all available evidence from reference country-years, extrapolation error is low in

the sense of being statistically indistinguishable from zero while also being bounded quite

tightly.

           Fifth, we compare the prediction error from our extrapolation technique to the prediction

error from using OLS within the target site. Our interest here is to understand the extent to which

non-experimental evidence, even if it recovers a treatment effect that is both potentially biased

and different from the complier population, compares to externally extrapolated quasi-

experimental evidence from an instrumental variable estimate from another site or sites. In the

development economics literature, Pritchett and Sandefur (2013) have speculated that bias from

a non-experimental estimate within the target site might be smaller than bias due to failure in

external validity. In our application we find the opposite: extrapolation error tends to be lower

than endogeneity bias from within-target OLS estimation.

           The paper begins by outlining our identifying assumptions and empirical approach, and

then examines each of these five questions in turn, followed by a series of extensions and

robustness checks.

2. Methods

We define the conditions and methods for extrapolating from an instrumental variables estimate

to the causal effect in a target population.1 We focus on the case of using local average treatment

effects estimated from a set of reference contexts to identify and estimate the LATE in a target

context, where the LATE’s are the complier average causal effects in the respective populations

(Angrist et al. 1996). We focus on extrapolating to the LATE in a target context because of the

nature of the data that we have for our benchmarking exercise. The IPUMS-I data allow us to

estimate LATE’s in different populations defined by country and year. As such, we can use

these data to conduct benchmarked comparisons between actual, estimated LATE’s in a given

context and what we would obtain by extrapolation from other contexts. Nonetheless, the

methods that we apply here are straightforward to generalize for extrapolation to other types of

populations. Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2010) and Hartman et al. (2015) provide useful

discussions of defining targets for extrapolating causal effects.

       Following Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2010), our setup supposes that a randomly

sampled unit i has two potential outcomes, Yi(1) and Yi(0), that would obtain under assignment of

a treatment Di to the treated (=1) versus control (=0) condition, respectively. In our application,

the treatment is an indicator for whether a mother has more than two children, restricting

consideration to the subpopulation of women with at least two children. Observed outcomes are

given by,

                                                                                                (1)

  This section and the analysis in this paper draw extensively on Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii
(2015), where we discuss external validity issues in the context of experiments.

where α = E[Y(0)], ηi = Yi(0) – α, and γi = Yi(1) – Yi(0)                 is the unit-level causal

effect of Di. We also define an instrument, Zi = 0,1, that affects treatment assignment. Thus, we

have potential treatment assignments, Di(1) and Di(0), corresponding to the treatment values that

would obtain for a unit under Zi = 1 versus Zi = 0, respectively. In our application, the

instrument is an indicator for whether the sexes of the first two children are the same. The

observed treatment is given by,

                                                                                               (2)

where γ = E[D(0)], υi = Di(0)- γ , and pi = Di(1) – Di(0).

       Units are characterized by covariates, Xi, which include both unit- and population-level

variables. These covariates play a central role in extrapolation. We assume throughout that

conditions required for identifying the conditional LATE hold (Angrist and Fernandez-Val 2010,

p. 7). These include:



       C1(a) Conditional independence and exclusion: (Y(1),Y(0),D(1),D(0)) ╨ Z|X.

       C1(b) Valid conditional first stage: E[p|X] ≠ 0 and 0 < P[Z=1|X] < 1.

       C1(c) Conditional monotonicity: P[D(1) ≥ D(0)|X] = 1 or P[D(1) ≤ D(0)|X] = 1.



       We also define an indicator, W, for whether a population is the target to which we want to

extrapolate, W=1, or whether it is part of the reference set for which we have LATE estimates,

W=0.

       The covariate-specific LATE in a target population is defined as

                                                                                               (3)

and in a reference set population as



                                                 8
                                                                                                (4)

Given covariate-specific LATE’s for a target population (W = 1), the marginal LATE for the

target context is given by (Froelich 2007):


                                                                                                (5)


We now state the assumptions needed to allow for a LATE from a reference population to be

transported to the target population conditional on covariates, following Hotz et al. (2005).



Proposition 1 (Identification): Suppose C1 holds across all populations. Furthermore, suppose

          C2 Unconfounded location: (Y(1),Y(0)) ╨ W|D(1) > D(0),X=x, and

          C3 Covariate overlap: 0 < P[W = 0|D(1) > D(0),X = x] <1.

for all x in the support of X in the target population. Finally, suppose we have data to estimate

           for all x in the support of X in the target population. Then,      is identified and can

be estimated from the data.



Proof: Under C1-C3, we have

                                                                                                (6)

for all    in the support of   in the target population, in which case


                                                                                                (7)

          We adopt an estimation approach based on interacted regressions.

and

with       being the value of the covariate   centered on the sample complier mean in the target

context (         ), and                                for    . Let     be the residuals from a

linear regression of the sample       values onto the matrix of sample

values. For a sample of       units with       ,

Proof: By standard results for centered regression with heterogeneous effects (e.g., Imbens and

Wooldridge 2009, pp. 28-30), we have


                                                                                            (11)


for           . The result then follows from the consistency of the IV estimator for the LATE

(Imbens and Angrist 1994).

         The key assumption for this estimation strategy is that we can define a linear series in

covariates to account for unit-level heterogeneity in both outcomes and treatment take-up given

variation in the instrument. When the covariates consist of indicators for an exhaustive set of

strata, estimation via a centered interaction regression is algebraically equivalent to the type of

stratification reweighting used by Angrist and Fernandez-Val (2010) (see, e.g., Miratrix et al.

2012).

         Proposition 2 shows that we can use 2SLS with interactions centered on the target

population complier means to extrapolate from reference data to the LATE in the target

population.    This requires that we can estimate the means of covariates among compliers

(                . By Theorem 3.1 of Abadie (2003), one can accomplish this task via “kappa

weighting.” Specifically, for our target population with        , we have


                                                                                              (12)


where


                                                                                              (13)


We use the sample analog of expression (12) to compute the        terms for the complier-centered

interaction regression. In our applications below, we take the       terms as fixed and therefore

apply standard 2SLS inference.




3. Illustrative simulation

We use a simulation to demonstrate the properties of IV extrapolation under assumptions C1-C3.

To construct a naturalistic simulation, we start with the covariate, instrument (that is, the “same


                                                11
sex of first two kids” indicator), and treatment data (that is, the “more than two kids” indicator)

from one percent subsamples of the IPUMS census data for Cuba in 2002 (yielding 223

observations) and the United States in 1990 (yielding 3,343 observations). The covariates that we

use include the gender of the first and second born children, the woman’s age coarsened into

three-year bins, the woman’s education level coarsened into four bins (less than primary,

primary, secondary, and university completed), and her spouse’s education level coarsened into

the same four bins. We used these covariates to generate potential outcomes under treatment and

control for women in each simulation replicate sample.2 We generated observed treatments and

outcomes on the basis of the actual instrument and treatment values in the data. As such, we

have realistic potential outcome distributions but we can also compute the actual LATE for each

simulation replicate sample.

        Because potential outcomes are defined in terms of the micro-covariates only, C2 holds.

We restrict attention to the portions of the Cuba and United States samples that overlap in their

covariates such that C3 holds. We determine that C1b holds by observation: for the US in 1990,

the first stage coefficient in the sample is 0.060 (robust s.e.=0.015), while for Cuba in 2002, the

first stage coefficient in the sample is 0.090 (robust s.e.=0.048). We then assume assumptions

C1a and C1c based on arguments of Angrist and Evans (1998). To generate the extrapolations,

we use the complier-centered interactions 2SLS model defined above.                       We conduct 1,000

simulation runs.

        Figures 1 and 2 display results from the simulation exercise. Figure 1 shows results for

simulations where Cuba was the target and the US was the reference sample. We see in Figure 1

that the distribution of extrapolations is centered on the true LATE. The extrapolation

distribution (depicted with the dotted lines) is also more precise than the IV estimates fit on the

target population data (depicted with the light gray shading). This is because the reference

sample (3,343 observations) is much larger than the target population sample (223 observations).



                                   [FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE]



       Figure 2 focuses only on the extrapolated estimate distributions as we reduce the size of

the reference population. Again, the target distribution is depicted in light gray in the

background. As we reduce the size of the extrapolation population, we see the distribution widen

until the smallest reference size of 167 observations is even less precise than the target

distribution, simulated using 223 observations. This outcome illustrates the theoretical possibility

of “super-external validity,” whereby extrapolations from an existing evidence base may provide

more accurate estimates of the LATE in a target context than would be the case if one estimated

the LATE using only data from that context.



                                      [FIGURE 2 ABOUT HERE]



       In summary, the simulation illustrates our extrapolation strategy, and confirms that when

the identifying assumptions are satisfied, the method indeed works (in the sense that extrapolated

LATE’s on average replicate the target LATE). Note, however, that the quality of the

extrapolation depends on the sample size of the reference context and also on the degree of

reference-target covariate overlap.

4. A world of LATE’s: same-sex, more kids, and mothers’ labor

supply

4.1 The same-sex instrumental variable and IPUMS-I data

Angrist and Evans (1998) used two instrumental variables for a mother’s incremental fertility,

the first two children having the same sex (i.e., boy-boy or girl-girl) and a twin birth. In this

paper we focus on the first. They examine the sample of married women between age 18 and 34,

with two or more children from the 1980 and 1990 US IPUMS. A preference for a gender mix of

children encourages mothers with the first two children of the same sex to have an incremental

child. The IV strategy uses that variation to look at the effect of increased fertility on labor

supply. The identified local average treatment effect is the effect of fertility on labor supply for

those women who have an extra child when their first two children are the same sex but would

not otherwise. For the 1980 (1990) sample, same-sex leads to a 0.068 (0.070) increase the

probability of the third child (relative to approximately 0.5 of the sample that has a third child).

The reduced-form effect of same-sex on whether the mother worked for pay is -0.0080 (for

1980) and -0.0053 (for 1990), with an IV estimate of -0.120 (for 1980) and -0.104 (for 1990),

relative to 0.528 of the 1980 sample and 0.667 of the 1990 sample who work.

       We use the IPUMS-I data to take the Angrist-Evans strategy to the world. The IPUMS-I

data provided harmonized coding that in principle yields measures of the above variables that are

comparable across countries and years. Data are available for a maximum of 139 country-years,

although accounting for missing data our sample becomes smaller for some specifications.

Individual covariates include the mother’s age, her age at birth of her first child, her education

(coded as 1=illiterate, 2=primary, 3=secondary, and 4=college or higher), and her spouse’s



                                                14
education (coded similarly). Summary statistics are presented in Table 1. The average age of

mothers at the time of the survey in the global sample is 30.05, and the average mother’s

education is 1.92.



                                   [TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE]



       As discussed in the introduction, while extrapolating from reference to target country

makes use only of micro covariates, in our investigation of external validity we explore country-

year level differences and whether they explain the pattern of extrapolation error. Our country-

year covariates included GDP per capita, women’s labor force participation, the sex ratio

imbalance (the number of male children divided by the number of female children minus 0.5),

the total fertility rate, and the pairwise geographical and temporal distances between country-

year samples. Summary statistics of these dyadic absolute differences are presented in column 2

of Table 1. We will demonstrate that these differences strongly predict the magnitude of the

extrapolation error.

       In our application we focus on the same-sex instrumental variable rather than a twin

birth, because it is more likely that two non-twinned children can be born in the same calendar

year in high-fertility countries than in the US. Same-sex has its own challenges when used as an

instrument on a global scale. The first concern is sex selection. While this is not believed to be

an issue with US data, for some countries in our sample (such as China) it is clearly a concern.

We address this by treating sex-selectivity as a country-year covariate and examining empirically

whether it affects the IV extrapolation from reference to target. In Section 8.4, we also show that

dropping potentially sex-selective countries does not significantly affect the results. A second




                                                15
concern is violation of the exclusion restriction, especially for low-income countries. Butikofer

(2011) has presented suggestive evidence that the gender mix of the first two children in low-

income countries can directly influence a mother’s labor supply through the cost associated with

having a third child (see also Huber (2015) for evidence of instrumental validity for US data).

We address this in a similar fashion, namely by examining the extent to which GDP per capita

affects extrapolation error and in Section 8.5 using the Huber-Mellace (2015) test to detect and

drop country-years unlikely to satisfy instrument validity.



4.2 IPUMS-I data: first stage, compliers, and IV estimates

In this section we provide a graphical summary of the variation in the first stage and IV estimates

from IPUMS-I data. Figure 3, panel a, plots the first-stage effect of same-sex on an incremental

child against the standard error of the estimate. Each point represents a country-year IPUMS-I

sample, and different markers are indicators for geographic regions. Figure 3, panel b, plots the

density of first-stage effects. We note that all but a handful of first stages are positive: the

preference for a gender mix of children seems to be global. From panel b, we note that the

average first-stage effect is approximately 0.04 across countries and years. Both panels highlight

the heterogeneity of the first-stage strength, an issue we return to in the cumulative analysis.



                                   [FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE]



       Figure 4 recreates the analysis of Figure 3 but replaces the first-stage results with the IV

estimates of the effect of an additional child on the mother’s work status. The striking difference

between Figures 3 and 4 is that the IV estimates are both negative and positive. While we can see



                                                 16
in Figure 4, panel b, that the average affect across countries and years is negative (-0.129,

compared to -0.120 and -0.104 for the US in 1980 and 1990), there is a genuine mix of positive

and negative coefficients. In panel a, estimates from high labor force participation economies

such as North America, Western Europe, and Eastern Europe tend to be negative, while

estimates from less developed regions are more positive.



                                  [FIGURE 4 ABOUT HERE]



       In Figure 5, we examine how the population of individuals who comply with the

instrument differs from the overall population. In the top two panels, we look at mother’s age at

the time of the survey and at the time of the first birth. The top-left panel indicates that, on

average, the complier population is younger than the overall population for most country-years at

the time of the survey. At the same time, there are regions (notably North America and Western

Europe) where these two distributions are similar. This pattern is reversed in the top-right panel,

which charts the comparison for mother’s age at first birth. Here we note that compliers are

consistently older than the overall population across all country-years in our data set. In the

bottom two figures, we find that complier mothers and their spouses are more likely to have

secondary or tertiary education than the overall population although these differences are far less

pronounced.



                                      [FIGURE 5 ABOUT HERE]




                                                17
       The above analysis highlights a key aspect of our approach: heterogeneity in differences

between complier and raw populations is the dimension along which we calibrate the IV

treatment effects in the reference country to extrapolate to the target of interest. While discussed

formally in the methodology section above, it bears emphasis that this heterogeneity lies at the

heart of what external validity means in an IV context. If differences in complier populations

affect the relationship of interest, external validity may be compromised. By calibrating our

reference estimates to approximate the target complier population, we remove this threat to

external validity. The efficacy of this technique hinges crucially on whether the observable

covariates that we can measure fully capture the latent characteristics that would otherwise

reduce external validity.




5. Dyadic regressions

In this section, we examine the extent to which extrapolation error from reference to target

country-year can be explained by covariate differences between the two contexts. As noted in the

introduction, our strategy is to create all possible pairwise combinations of the country-year

samples, with one country serving as the target and the other as the reference. We use the

complier characteristics in the target country to calibrate the conditional-on-X LATE’s in the

reference country. Since, as in our US-Cuba example, for any two country-years the

extrapolation differs depending on which is the target country and which the reference country,

our dyads consist of all n×(n-1) pairwise permutations. For each dyad, we record the

extrapolation error, Eij (the target country-year i LATE estimate minus the extrapolated treatment

effect from the reference country-year j), its standard error, and covariate differences between




                                                18
reference and target (which for simplicity we assume these can be summarized simply as

              ).

       As in Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii (2015) we use this setup to estimate the external

validity (or X) function:

                                                               ,

where we weight the regression by the inverse of the variance of the extrapolation error. In the

spirit of the Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998) bias function, which characterizes

selection bias as a function of covariates, our interest is to characterize reference-to-target

country-year extrapolation error, while maintaining the assumption of a valid instrumental

variables strategy (hence an internally valid target country-year LATE). Note that in addition to

within country-year micro covariates, Dij includes country-year level macro covariates as well,

including GDP per capita, labor force participation, and total fertility rate.

       Results are presented in Tables 2 and 3. We begin in Table 2 by examining the univariate

relationship between covariate differences and extrapolation error. We find that the differences

in all covariates save for mother’ age at first child’s birth, the labor force participation rate, and

temporal and geographic distances, are significant predictors in the expected direction: greater

reference-target differences are associated with increased extrapolation error. The magnitude of

the bias is considerable for each covariate. Since the significant covariates are in logs, the

coefficients can be directly compared in terms of percent changes; this suggests that a ten percent

increase in the difference between reference and target in mother’s education, spouse’s

education, mother’s age at the time of the survey, per capita GDP, the gender ratio, and total

fertility rate is associated with a 0.017, 0.02, 0.009, 0.013, 0.006, or 0.01 increase in

extrapolation error respectively (relative to an average world LATE of -0.129).



                                                  19
       Temporal and geographic distances are presented in standardized measures, implying that

a 1 standard deviation increase in geographic distance (substantively an increase of roughly

4,650km) corresponds to a 5 percent increase in extrapolation error although this is not

significant at conventional levels. Similarly, the effect of time is noisily measured but, again,

pointing in a positive direction.



                                    [TABLE 2 ABOUT HERE]



       When we include all covariates simultaneously, we find in Table 3 that differences in the

spouse’s education, differences in mother’s age at the time of the survey, and differences in the

gender ratio remain significant in the full sample. The coefficients on spouse’s education and

mother’s age at the time of the survey are robust to restricting the analysis to country-years

where first-stage t-statistics are greater than 2, 5, and 10 although the estimate for mother’s age

becomes less precisely estimated. As in Table 2, the magnitudes are considerable for spouse’s

education. A ten percent increase in the difference in spouse’s education corresponds to a 0.018

increase in the absolute difference between the target and extrapolated estimates (again relative

to an average world LATE of -0.129). It is worth noting that these coefficients decline both in

significance and in magnitude as we restrict the sample to stronger first stage targets. This

suggests that the accuracy of our extrapolation technique is less susceptible to differences in the

covariate profile when our target estimate is more precisely estimated. However, certain

covariates remain significant, particularly differences in spouse’s education.



                                       [TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE]




                                                20
       Overall the results underline an intuitive but important result: when the target and

reference countries are close together in the covariate space, extrapolation error tends to be

smaller. As will be demonstrated in Section 7, this intuition motivates our use of minimized

Mahalanobis distance to predict the optimal dyad for extrapolation.




6. Accumulation of evidence

While the dyadic regressions in Tables 2 and 3 highlight the importance of covariate differences

between reference and target countries, they do not allow us to deduce how close the

extrapolation comes to the target country LATE. Furthermore, while the dyadic setup is useful to

explore the external validity function, it uses only a single country-year reference to predict the

target, whereas in fact the available pool of reference countries is much larger in all but the first

time period of our data set. We address both issues in Figures 6 to 11.

       In Figures 6 to 9, we depict the extrapolation error for specific target country-years

(Greece-1971, Colombia-1985, Belarus-1999, Colombia-2005), and show how the prediction

error changes as additional reference country-years become available at each point in time. Note

that in any given year, we use all of the available reference country-years available up to that

point in time (excluding the target country in earlier periods) to predict the target country-year.

Our exclusion of the target country data in earlier periods constitutes a more difficult test of our

extrapolation technique by removing the (presumably) most similar reference data from the

accumulated pool of observations.




                                                 21
                                [FIGURES 6 – 9 ABOUT HERE]



       Several patterns become evident. First, as more evidence becomes available through an

increased reference set, prediction error typically decreases. Second, although there are counter-

examples, the pattern that extrapolation error is not statistically significant when using the

maximal reference set does usually hold. Third, there are instances in which the target LATE

itself is not precisely estimated, and in these cases extrapolation error, although not statistically

significant, can be large in terms of magnitude. Fourth, for target countries later in the sample for

which a larger reference set is available, prediction error tends to converge to zero.

       Figures 10 and 11 average the extrapolation error across all target countries with the dots

color-coded by the number of observations in the accumulated reference data and the vertical

bars representing the standard deviation of the averaged estimates. Figure 10 averages with

respect to years relative to the target country-year (so for example, 1970 is -4 with respect to

Ecuador 1974). Figure 11 averages by calendar year. In Figure 10, predictions by t=0 combine

some country-years early in the sample with few reference countries and those later in the

sample with more country-years available. Conversely, Figure 11 presents an unbalanced panel,

with country-years rotating out as targets for years after their own year (so for example US 1980

does not enter the average as a target country beyond 1980, but remains in use as a reference

country). Both figures confirm the pattern that bias tends to be smaller for country-years later in

the sample although Figure 10 exhibits greater variance in the estimates, owing to the inclusion

of early target-years for which larger reference sizes are unavailable.



                               [FIGURES 10 & 11 ABOUT HERE]




                                                 22
       Overall, Figures 6 to 11 show that with a sufficiently large reference set, the extrapolated

LATE is able to systematically replicate the actual country-year LATE with considerable

precision. Given the validity of the IV strategy, this in turn serves as a test of the validity of our

key identifying assumption of uncounfounded location.




7. Extrapolation vs. interpolation

This section presents a series of comparisons between the extrapolated LATE estimates

measured using different criteria and the OLS estimates within the target country. The thought

experiment is trading off two possible biases: extrapolation error from the extrapolated LATE

versus endogeneity bias from regressing a women’s labor force status on an endogenous

indicator of incremental fertility. In other words, is there any reason to believe that errors

associated with extrapolation are systematically larger or smaller than biases associated with

endogeneity? It is worth noting the artificiality of the exercise at the outset. We know that OLS,

whether biased or not, is estimating the average treatment effect, whereas the extrapolated LATE

is replicating the LATE for the target country. So even without bias, we would not expect these

two to be the same. Nonetheless, we argue that the choice is not entirely artificial: a policy maker

could indeed be faced with the choice of two potential biases. In Section 8.1, we present results

comparing an extrapolated ATE to target country-year OLS estimates.

       The results are presented in Figure 12, where the x-axis depicts the mean of the dyadic

extrapolated LATE’s for a given target country-year less the within-country estimated target

country-year LATE and the y-axis depicts within country-year OLS less the estimated LATE.




                                                 23
Both values are represented in absolute terms, reflecting that we are agnostic as to whether the

extrapolated estimate is larger or smaller than the target. In addition, we divide the absolute error

by the sum of the squared standard errors of each estimate. Doing so helps account for the

precision of the point estimates of both the target and the reference. For example, a 5 unit

difference between target and extrapolated estimates where the target standard error is 5 should

not be as concerning for our technique as a 5 unit difference where the target standard error is

0.1. By dividing the absolute error by the sum of the target and reference variation, we account

for the first two moments of the results, giving us a more comprehensive understanding of the

efficacy of our technique.



                                  [FIGURE 12 ABOUT HERE]



       Points are coded in different shades of grey by the size of the reference sample for the

target country-year. One pattern that again emerges is that, while extrapolation error can be large

when the size of the reference sample is small, much of the data lies close to zero. In this range,

OLS and extrapolated errors are roughly equivalent. However, as we move further away from

the best cases, there is evidence in favor of the extrapolated results over OLS. Note, however,

that the mean extrapolated results are much noisier than the OLS estimates, as evidenced by the

wider horizontal confidence intervals as compared to the vertical lines, which are almost hidden

at the scales presented.

       Figures 13 and 14 use the same framework to compare the OLS estimates against the

dyadic prediction error where the reference country-year is chosen to minimize geographical

distance or Mahalanobis covariate distance with the target country-year. As demonstrated above,




                                                 24
differences in the covariate profile significantly predict absolute error between target and

extrapolated estimates. By minimizing the Mahalanobis distance, we are effectively reducing the

total impact of these differences in choosing the best dyadic pair. Meanwhile, minimizing

geographic distance is included as a second-best heuristic to follow if additional comparison data

are unavailable. In both figures, there is clear evidence in favor of the extrapolated estimation

technique over OLS. For small-sample reference sets, the extrapolated IV consistently

outperforms OLS; for larger sample sizes this also appears to be the case for minimized

geographic distance.



                              [FIGURES 13 & 14 ABOUT HERE]



       Having demonstrated that extrapolated IV performs well relative to OLS using either a

raw average for each target country-year or choosing the best reference country-year based on

minimized Mahalanobis or geographic distance, we finally turn to a similar comparison using the

cumulative results from Section 6. Given the convergence trends summarized in Section 6, we

choose the most recent cumulative extrapolated results for each target country-year under the

assumption that this represents both the largest reference dataset as well as the most accurate

extrapolated prediction on average. We calculate absolute error in the same fashion as described

above and plot the cumulative error on the x-axis. On the y-axis, we re-plot the OLS errors as

well as the minimized Mahalanobis and geographical distance results.



                                 [FIGURE 15 ABOUT HERE]




                                               25
As depicted in Figure 15, there is strong evidence in favor of the cumulative approach over OLS

estimates and suggestive evidence in favor of cumulative results over the best dyadic

extrapolated estimates.

       As a final best practice, we turn to combining the minimum Mahalanobis distance

technique from the dyadic results with the cumulative data, leveraging both the ability to reduce

distance in the covariate profile as well as the larger reference sample sizes afforded by the

cumulative results. Specifically, from each year prior to the target’s year, we select the year

whose reference country-years minimize Mahalanobis covariate distance with the target. As

depicted in Figure 16, this approach even more strongly favors extrapolation over within-

country-year OLS estimation. Almost all prediction errors are above the 45 degree line,

indicating a better fit for the cumulative minimized Mahalanobis distance approach.



                                 [FIGURE 16 ABOUT HERE]



       Our results suggest that while extrapolation error remains a concern, at least for this

application, the endogeneity bias of within country-year OLS is generally larger.




8. Robustness checks and extensions

8.1 Extrapolating reference ATE to target ATE

In the extrapolation exercise presented above, we are assuming that the characteristics of the

complier population in the target setting are known and can be used to reweight the local average

treatment effect in the reference country. There is a potential circularity here in the sense that




                                                26
knowledge of the target complier population implies the existence of micro data on the

instrument and treatment variables in the target. Our argument in favor of the exercise is that the

target complier population is simply one possible policy-relevant subpopulation in the target,

specifically the only target subpopulation for which we have an internally valid estimate of the

average treatment effect. An alternative approach is to use our extrapolation procedure to

estimate the target ATE from both the target data and the reference data. We then measure “bias”

as the extrapolated ATE from the reference data minus the extrapolated ATE from the target

data. A snapshot of the results for this approach is presented in Figure 17.



                                  [FIGURE 17 ABOUT HERE]



       Figure 17 depicts the average extrapolation error, where the set of reference countries

evolves along the x-axis as they become available in years up to and including the year of

observation of the target. The pattern is similar to Figure 10. Twenty or more years prior to the

target country-year, the extrapolation tends to be noisy. But as additional reference country-years

become available, extrapolation error approaches zero in magnitude and is not significantly

different from zero despite being reasonably stable.

       An advantage of extrapolating ATE’s is that these are directly comparable to OLS

estimates within the target. In Figure 18 we revisit our extrapolated reference IV to target OLS

comparison for this case.



                                  [FIGURE 18 ABOUT HERE]




                                                 27
In particular, Figure 18 compares extrapolated reference IV average treatment effects to OLS,

where the nearest geographical country is used as the reference. The results are similar to Figure

13. Most of the points lie about the 45-degree line, with a significant concentration of points at

very low values of extrapolation error for IV estimates on the x-axis.

       Thus our conclusions regarding the reference LATE to target LATE extrapolation also

carry over to reference ATE to target ATE extrapolation.



8.2 Extrapolating using the number of children as the endogenous variable

Angrist and Evans (1998) present results using both the number of children and an indicator for

more than two children as the endogenous variable. In our main results, we focus on the latter.

Here we present results using the former. Figure 19 presents cumulative extrapolation error

results. The results are again similar to Figure 10. When using reference countries available

twenty or more years prior to the target, estimates are noisy and tend to bounce around from year

to year. But moving closer in time to the target, estimates home in on, and are not statistically

significantly different from, zero extrapolation error.



                                   [FIGURE 19 ABOUT HERE]



8.3 Using prior information to improve predictions

In many evaluation contexts prior information exists that can be used to improve the

extrapolation. For example, one might begin with the prior of a zero treatment effect (perhaps

motivated by Rossi’s [1987] “Iron Law”). In the context of our application, prior information, if

available, can readily be incorporated into the extrapolation by appropriately weighting the




                                                 28
reweighted reference LATE with the prior. Here we present the simplest case of taking a convex

combination of the reweighted LATE and the prior of a zero treatment effect.

       Figure 20 summarizes the weight on the prior that minimizes the root mean squared error

of the cumulative extrapolation for each reference sample size (where the reference sample size

increases with the increasing availability of reference country-years over time). The optimal

weights range from 0.9 to 0.5. The fact that the optimal weights tend to put substantial weight on

the prior reflects the fact that in this application many IV LATE’s are in fact close to zero, i.e.,

that the prior of zero treatment effect is, ex post, a good one. The optimal weight also reflects the

fact that the zero prior reduces posterior estimation variability. The importance of the latter

diminishes as sample size increases, which is reflected in the downward trend of the optimal

weight toward 0.5 for the full reference sample. In general, of course, the prior cannot be chosen

with the benefit of hindsight, and absent extremely strong prior information weights in this range

are unlikely.



                                  [FIGURE 20 ABOUT HERE]



       At the same time, even a small weight put on a prior of a zero treatment effect tends to

improve the root mean squared error of the extrapolation. This is depicted in Figure 21. As

weight on the prior increases, root mean squared error decreases essentially linearly. Again,

while a very high weight on the prior is implausible, even a low weight on a prior of zero is

beneficial. As illustrated in Table 4, a weight of 0.01 on the prior reduces mean prediction error

by 0.031 and root mean squared error by 0.14. These values are statistically significant after

controlling for reference population size and the standard error of the extrapolated estimate. Prior

predictions.

8.4 Dropping sex-selectors

The most direct challenge to the validity of the IV assumptions in our application is the well-

known practice of sex selection in some of the countries in our sample (most notably China

under the one-child policy). In our main results we control for the degree of sex selection within

country-years. In this section we instead drop countries where sex selection and potential non-

exogeneity of the same-sex variable is a concern (in particular, India, China, and Nepal and

Vietnam). Figure 22 presents the cumulative extrapolation error results corresponding to Figure

11. The results are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. After an initial “burn in” period where

average extrapolation error bounces around from year to year, it homes in on, and is not

statistically significantly different from, zero.



                                    [FIGURE 22 ABOUT HERE]



8.5 Dropping country-years with invalid IV’s

As an extension of Section 8.4, we rely on recent work by Kitagawa (2008) and Huber and

Mellace (2014) who exploit the implications of the LATE assumptions to derive systematic tests




                                                    30
of IV validity. Unlike Section 8.4, where our rationale for dropping sex selectors is based on

indirect evidence and case study research on cultural determinants of gender heterogeneity (see

Rosenzweig and Wolpin [2000] for evidence from India and Edlund and Lee [2013] for evidence

from South Korea), here we employ a data-driven test for violations of the LATE assumptions.

As described in Huber (2015), the LATE assumptions require that, for all y in the support of Y:



                     f(y,D=1|Z=1) ≥ f(y,D=1|Z=0), f(y,D=0|Z=0) ≥ f(y,D=0|Z=1),



lest the joint densities of the compliers be less than zero. Violations of these inequalities are not

enough to identify which LATE identifying assumptions fail, but they do constitute smoking-gun

evidence that: Z is not randomly assigned; defiers exist in the data and dominate the compliers;

or both.

         We use the procedure outlined by Huber (2015) to identify which country-years fail to

satisfy the identifying assumptions necessary for the same-sex instrument to be valid. 3 One

benefit we enjoy thanks to our large dataset is that our finite sample power is high enough that

we are unlikely to commit Type II errors. Nevertheless, as stressed by Huber (2015), failures to

reject the null cannot be taken as evidence of instrument validity. Table 5 lists the country-years

with partial p-values smaller than 0.4, representing a conservative test for IV validity. We rerun

our cumulative analysis on the restricted data and present the results in Figure 24, represented by

light gray circles. The results are not meaningfully different from those presented above.

       A final check is to stratify the data over coarsened covariates in an attempt to see whether

the IV test fails for any subset of the population. We use three bins for the educational attainment

of the mother and her spouse (0 = less than high school, 1 = high school, 2 = more than high

school) and a binary variable indicating whether the mother is in her 20s or her 30s at the time of

the survey. We then stratify over these covariates and run the IV validity test on each sub-

population in each country-year, yielding as many as 18 separate p-values for evaluation

(although many country-years do not have full coverage for all possible strata). Figure 23 lists

the results for all 139 available country-years in the dataset, ranked by the minimum partial p-

value across all available strata. With 18 possible violations for each country-year, we elevate

our threshold for removal to the 95% level of confidence and drop any country-year with at least

one p-value less than 0.05 from our analysis, resulting in the omission of 29 country-years for

our robustness check, listed in dark font at the top of the y-axis.



                                   [FIGURE 23 ABOUT HERE]



       Again, our conclusions are largely robust to the omission of these country-years. Figure

24 overlays the cumulative running counter analysis from the main results with the same results

calculated after dropping the invalid country-years. The convergence is still striking. The

robustness-check results outperform the main analysis in the earliest counters. Although for the

most stringent robustness exercise of dropping country-years that fail the stratified IV validity

test, we note that it takes longer for the extrapolation results to converge to approximately zero

error. This is not surprising given the reduced sample size.

9. Conclusion

In this paper we have investigated the degree to which LATE’s from one context can be

extrapolated to another. Returning to our twofold motivation in pursuing this exercise – namely

informing both the external validity of instrumental variables estimates and of the growing body

of policy-relevant evidence from natural and randomized experiments – our findings are both

optimistic and cautious. We find that external validity improves when the reference data and

target data are from similar settings and that given sufficient data, even with a small set of

covariates, average extrapolation error is close to zero when extrapolating LATE’s from one

country-year to another. Furthermore, the resulting extrapolation error is usually less than the

endogeneity bias of using within-target OLS.

       At the same time, extrapolation error increases considerably with reference-target

covariate differences. Covariate differences of 10 percent between reference and target settings

lead to extrapolation error ranging from 5 to 20 percent of the overall treatment effect. While it is

difficult to offer a specific quantitative guideline, our results suggest the importance of a close

match between covariate profiles in reference and target settings. This echoes findings in the

program evaluation literature such as Heckman, Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998) and our own

related work on this theme (Dehejia, Pop-Eleches, and Samii 2015).




                                                 33
       Given the increasing number of internally valid, albeit local estimates that are becoming

available to assess the impact of policy interventions, our results suggest that there is some hope

to reach externally valid, general conclusions from this stream of evidence but also that the

quality of extrapolation depends crucially on a sufficient body of quasi-experimental evidence

from contexts that resemble the policy environment of interest. Finally, we note an important

qualification: our results are narrowly relevant only to the application we have considered.

Further replications of this exercise for other instrumental variables and natural and field

experiments are necessary to develop a more systematic understanding of the opportunities for

and limits to externally valid knowledge.

The simulations were run on a 1% random sample of the full IPUMS data in which we generated
potential outcomes conditional on the covariate profile and observation “type”. In this context,
observation type refers to whether the unit was a complier, an always-taker, or a never-taker. We
deterministically set half of the population to compliers and a quarter each to always- and never-
takers. By construction, defiers are removed, thus ensuring we meet the conditional monotonicity
assumption (C1(c)) discussed in Section 2. Combining the covariate profile with type yielded an
extended covariate vector        which has length and, when stacked on observations, yields
matrix                  .

To generate the potential outcomes, we multiplied                     by a -length vector of coefficients    to
yield        .      was drawn from a multivariate normal distribution. Without loss of generality, we set
         .

Having defined our potential outcomes as such – and in so doing, guaranteeing compliance with
the necessary assumptions – we simulated the instrument assignment in a manner that varied
with the covariate profile . (Note that instrument assignment varies with and not       since
the latter would violate the conditional random assignment assumption of the instrument.)
Specifically, we used a logit specification to determine the probability that the instrument
conditional on                using the following specification (as above, let      be a stacked matrix of
covariates and               observations):

                                                                                                        (B.1)

where            is a       length vector of coefficients, again drawn from a multivariate normal distribution
for the sake of simplicity. Note that                         to account for the removal of unit type (again,
compliers, always-, and never-takers) from the extended covariate vector                .

The simulation was run 1,000 times, using the centered-interactions technique specified above to
extrapolate the target estimate from the reference population. The code (in both Stata and R) is
available upon request.

  household standard deviations presented in brackets. The three 2SLS variables are dummies. More
  kids is coded zero if the mother has only 2 children and one if the mother has more than 2 children.
  Same sex is coded zero if the first two children are of different genders and coded one if the first
  two children are of the same gender. Economically active mother is coded zero if the mother is not
  economically active and coded one if the mother works for pay.

         Notes: Invalid country-years ranked by partial P-values from Huber-Mellace (2014) test
        of IV validity, column 3. The p-values test whether f (y, D = 1|Z = 1) ∏ f (y, D = 1|Z = 0)
        and, similarly, f (y, D = 0|Z = 0) ∏ f (y, D = 0|Z = 1). These constraints can be rewritten
        as four point estimates (µ̂1 , . . . , µ̂4 ) which must fall between the bounds of the mixed
        population. The fourth and fifth columns give the standardized point estimates in the
                max(µ̂ ,µ̂ )
        form of SD(Y1 ) 2 for the treated (St. Diff1 ) and non-treated (St. Diff0 ) subpopulations.
        Violations of the null are therefore positive values. Inference is applied to the test statis-
        tics using two-stage bootstrapping, the details of which can be found in Huber and Mel-
        lace (2014).

Figure 1: Simulated results of recovering Cuba (2002) LATE using data from US (1990). 1,000 simulations
run to generate distributions. The light-gray shaded polygon depicts the distribution of the simulated
estimates using the Cuban (2002) data while the vertical light-gray line represents the mean estimate. The
solid unshaded polygon depicts the unadjusted simulated estimates using the US (1990) data. The dashed
distribution represents the extrapolated simulations using the same US (1990) data after calibrating to the
complier covariate profile from the target country-year.
