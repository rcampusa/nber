                                               ABSTRACT

Among the thirteen original colonies, Pennsylvania was most successful at issuing paper money with
only minimal effects on prices -- so much so that the colony's experience is sometimes seen as violating
the classical quantity theory of money. Quantity theorists usually attribute this apparent anomaly to
mismeasurement of the money stock. In contrast, I use data on money, prices, and real activity in Pennsylvania
from 1723 to 1774 and for the United States as a whole from 1790 to 1850 (when the money stock
is better measured) to show that the long-run behavior of money and prices is well explained by the
quantity theory in both periods, despite the differences in institutional arrangements, once growth in
monetized transactions is taken into account.

        Backing, the Quantity Theory, and the Transition to the U.S. Dollar, 1723-1850

                                       By Peter L. Rousseau *



         Prior to the ratification of the Federal Constitution and adoption of the dollar standard

nationwide, the thirteen original colonies operated under monetary systems that differed

significantly from the one that followed. Among these, Pennsylvania was most successful at

issuing paper money with only minimal effects on prices -- so much so that the colony’s

experience is sometimes seen as violating the classical quantity theory of money, that is, the

identity

(1)      MV = PY,

where M is the nominal money stock, V its velocity, P the price level, and Y real monetized

transactions. Quantity theorists generally focus on the left-hand side of (1) when dismissing this

apparent anomaly as resulting from mismeasurement of M (Ronald Michener, 1987; Bennett T.

McCallum, 1992). In contrast, this study emphasizes the right-hand side in faulting the

assumption of a constant Y. Specifically, I use data on money, prices, and real activity in

Pennsylvania from 1723 to 1774 and for the nation as a whole from 1790 to 1850 (when M is

better measured) to show that the long-run behavior of money and prices is well explained by (1)

in both periods despite the differences in institutional arrangements.

         The analysis is in the spirit of Robert E. Lucas (1980), who controlled for short-run

effects while isolating the relationship between money and prices in postwar U.S. data, but

differs in bringing the effects of a growing modern sector back into the empirics at a time when

accounting for them is crucial. How Pennsylvania money held its value in the short term is

another matter, but I observe that the “backing” theory (Bruce D. Smith, 1985) seems ready to

explain the data without requiring large stocks and flows of circulating specie money. My view

thus offers some common ground among the quantity and backing theories.



                                          I. Background

       Before the Revolutionary War, various foreign coins passed from hand to hand as

currency, supplemented by assorted fiat paper monies issued by individual colonial legislatures

that sometimes also passed current beyond their borders. There is disagreement about how

important coins were to the total money supply, with estimates ranging from as little as one-fifth

to as much as two-thirds of it on average. Though this means that the quantity theory cannot be

tested for the colonies with the total money stock, scholars have still noted low correlations

between prices and outstanding stocks of paper money.

       Indeed, assuming V and Y are constant in the short term, as per the usual starting point for

the quantity theorists, Roger C. West (1978) found no statistical relationship between paper

money and prices with the available data for the colonies of New York, Pennsylvania, and South

Carolina. Michener (pp. 236-7) observed the absence of specie in the money stock of West’s

regressions and reasoned that if this potentially large component were included and were to

fluctuate so as to offset paper money issues and retirements, the quantity theory would still hold.

I contend that new paper issues, rather than causing perfectly offsetting specie outflows, could

have been absorbed without inflation in so far as they encouraged more transactions (i.e., Y) to




                                                 2
be made using money. Since money was more efficient than barter or bookkeeping, its issuance

not only drew transactions into the formal economy, but may have also increased activity therein.

       The colonial economy certainly grew intensively over the period studied. John J.

McCusker’s essay in the Historical Statistics of the United States (Susan B. Carter et al., 2006,

Vol. 5, pp. 630-31) suggests average annual per capita income growth of 0.6 percent between

1655 and 1775, with more rapid growth between 1740 and 1774. But even these estimates,

though substantial by the standards of the time, understate how much the modern sector grew.

For example, Pennsylvania’s real exports to and total trade with England increased at average

annual rates of 16.8 and 16.7 percent, respectively, between 1723 and 1774. Per capita output

grew more quickly in the nation as a whole from 1790 to 1850, and real exports and total trade

grew at average annual rates of 11.8 and 11.7 percent, respectively, despite the export embargo

of 1807-09. This is why it is necessary to control for Y explicitly when exploring the relationship

between money and prices in colonial and early U.S. history. To his credit, John Webbe (1743, p.

6) seemed unconfused when he wrote that “the value of it (i.e., paper money) will, on a

supposition of its quantity continuing the same, be more or less in proportion to the intrinsic

worth of the moveable commodities exchanged by it.”


                                            II. Empirics

       The empirics proceed as follows: first, I show that traditional tests of the quantity theory

“fail” for the United States as a whole between 1790 and 1850 in much the same way as they do

for colonial Pennsylvania. This occurs even though we have much more complete data for the

total money supply (i.e., paper and specie) for the later period and despite the absence of a

system of government-issued fiat monies at that time. Then, assuming V constant, I proxy for Y

using real exports and demonstrate that a long-run relationship, consistent with the quantity




                                                 3
theory, exists between Y and M/P in both periods. Since Y represents monetized transactions

rather than aggregate output and such transactions were more prevalent in modern sectors such

as shipping and international commerce than traditional ones, trends and fluctuations in real

exports, even those associated with declining transport costs, would seem to provide the best

available combined indicator of the demand for money and the economy’s ability to absorb it.

            Table 1 presents West-style regressions that correct for first order serial correlation via

maximum likelihood.1 For colonial Pennsylvania, I use annual averages of Arthur H. Cole’s

(1938, Table 48, pp. 138-9) index of monthly wholesale commodity prices for Philadelphia and

the stock of paper money from Historical Statistics (2006, Vol. 5, Series Eg307, pp. 692-3). For

1790-1850, I use the consumer price index from Historical Statistics (Vol.3, Series Cc2, p.158)

and the total money stock from Rousseau and Richard Sylla (2005, p. 22-4). There is little

1
     Standard alternative corrections for AR1 and AR2 disturbances yielded similar qualitative

results. Box-Ljung “Q” statistics showed no indication of higher order serial correlation.

evidence of correlation between the logs of prices and either contemporaneous or lagged money

in either period. The lack of support for the quantity theory for 1790-1850 offers reason for

pause since the proper measurement of M renders the classical explanation for the failure of

West’s regressions inapplicable to the early Federal period. Indeed, it even seems that the

quantity theory is better supported in the data for colonial Pennsylvania (see col. 2 of Table 1),

which excludes the specie component of the money stock.

         Maybe a short-run relation between money and prices that does not account for increases

in monetized transactions or growth of the modern economy is just too much to expect from the

quantity theory for 18th and early 19th century America. But does the quantity theory hold in the

long-run? If so, we might expect to find a cointegrating relation between Y and M/P after

rearranging (1).

         Table 2 presents Soren Johansen’s trace and maximum eigenvalue (λ-max) statistics for

the corresponding bivariate autoregressive systems with three lags as determined by nested

likelihood ratio tests. For colonial Pennsylvania, I use real exports to England from Historical

Statistics (Vol. 5, Series Eg432, pp. 710-11) to proxy for Y; for 1790-1850 I use total exports and

re-exports of merchandise (Vol. 5, Series Ee365, pp. 498-9) deflated by the export price index

(Vol. 5, Series Ee431, pp. 515-16). M/P is formed by dividing the series for outstanding bills of

credit and the total money stock by the corresponding commodity price indices.2 The test

statistics reject the null hypothesis of no cointegration (r = 0) at the 10 percent level or better for

both systems, while the null of at most one cointegrating vector (r ≤ 1) is not rejected for either.

    Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests with a constant, trend, and four lags do not reject the null

hypothesis of a unit root for exports or real money in either period.

This implies the existence of a valid error correction representation with a single cointegrating

vector. Table 2 includes estimates of these vector error correction models (VECMs) of the form


(2) ΔYt = μ1 + γ1,1ΔYt-1 + γ1,2ΔYt-2 + ξ 1,1ΔM/Pt-1 + ξ1,2ΔM/Pt-2 + α1(β1Yt-1 + β2M/Pt-1) + ε1,t

(3) ΔM/Pt = μ2 + γ2,1ΔYt-1 + γ2,2ΔYt-2 + ξ 2,1ΔM/Pt-1 + ξ2,2ΔM/Pt-2 + α2(β1Yt-1 + β2M/Pt-1) + ε2,t,


where β1 and β2 are loadings on Y and M/P that form a linear stationary combination (i.e., the

“error correction term” or ECT) and the αi measure the speed with which the dependent variables

adjust to shocks that perturb the combination. The ECT enters the model as a single lag.

       For colonial Pennsylvania, the coefficients on the ECT (i.e., the αi’s) are significant at the

five percent level in both equations of the VECM. The negative loading on the level of M/P in

the cointegrating vector (see final row of Table 2), combined with negative sign on α in the Y

equation implies that increases in M/P, which depressed the value of the stationary combination,

were met with increases in Y. The α is positive in the M/P equation, which combined with the

positive loading on Y suggests that increases in modern sector activity acted as an inducement for

additional paper money issues. For 1790 to 1850, the ECT is negative and significant only in the

Y equation. Combined with the negative loading on M/P, this once again suggests that increases

in the real money stock tended to raise Y in the long-run. The short-run parameters (i.e., the γi’s

and ζi’s) are generally not significant in either period, except for the first lag of M/P in the M/P

equations, which might be expected given that the coefficients of first-order autocorrelation for

the M/P series are 0.93 for 1723-1774 and 0.98 for 1790-1850.


                                           III. Discussion

       The findings of Section II support the long-run implications of the quantity theory. At the

same time, the insignificant short-run parameter estimates in the VECMs raise the question of

why prices did not increase more on impact given the quantities of paper money sometimes

issued. For 1790-1850 one can argue that paper money was issued by banks and that individuals

could most of the time present it to the issuer for redemption in specie, meaning that the young

nation operated under fixed specie-paper exchange rates defended by individual banks. But who

would have defended fixed rates in colonial Pennsylvania? Michener (p. 264) suggests that it

was Philadelphia merchants, citing a set of coin ratings declared by 75 of them in the September

16, 1742 issue of the Pennsylvania Gazette as evidence, but it is hard to conceive of such groups

controlling the value of exchange across an entire colony. McCusker’s data on exchange rates




                                                  7
between the British pound sterling and Pennsylvania pounds in Historical Statistics (2006, Vol.

5, series Eg318, p. 698) also indicate quite a bit of variation over time. Exchange rates could

have fluctuated less than expected, however, if the specie stock was large enough for the public

to deem paper as good.

       The difficulty here is that the supply of specie appears to have been inadequate in

Pennsylvania in the 1720s and 1730s, and perhaps throughout most of the colonial period.

Indeed, this scarcity and the growing needs of commerce appear to have motivated the issuance

of paper money in the first place (see Benjamin Franklin, 1729). There is an indication that the

amount of specie in the colonies rose in the late 1740s with the end of King George’s War, but

also that these inflows were quickly reversed. We know for certain, however, that Pennsylvania

increased its paper money stock more than five times over between 1755 and 1760 in the midst

of the French and Indian War. How could the commodity price index have risen by only 15

percent in these years? Perhaps specie left the colony as the paper was issued, holding total

money steady, but specie would have to compose about 80 percent of Pennsylvania’s money

supply in 1755 and nearly all of it would have to exit before 1761 to accomplish this, which

seems extraordinary. Persistent inflows of coin from 1760 through 1773 would then have been

necessary to maintain the total stock of money as the supply of paper fell by 70 percent, while if

anything specie flows were erratic over this period.

       Given these facts, we should consider carefully the model of Neil Wallace and Thomas J.

Sargent (1982) as a possible explanation for the short-run stability of prices, especially after

1754. They show that money issues, if backed by “real bills,” need not be inflationary. Building

on this, Smith suggests that promises of colonial legislatures to accept paper money issues as

loan and tax payments at some future date and then to destroy it effectively created an asset




                                                  8
“backing” (i.e., a receivable) along with a liability (i.e., the paper money issue), leaving the

colony’s balance sheet unaltered. So long as the public maintained confidence that the

government would adhere to these plans, modest new issues need not have been inflationary.

Given Pennsylvania’s early successes in issuing paper money, perhaps the “full faith and credit”

of the government was something to be taken seriously by the time of the French and Indian

War. This could have allowed the currency to retain its value until it could be reined back to

more closely reflect the level of transactions sustainable after the war. In earlier years, such as

1729 when the stock of paper money rose by 77 percent, the backing theory can explain why the

paper held its value while the colony’s level of monetized transactions adjusted to it.

       In any case, the “backing” versus “fixed rates” debate seems best suited to discussions of

short-run phenomena. The quantity theory of money with the Y properly accounted for, on the

other hand, remains as equipped as ever to explain the long-run behavior of money and prices in

colonial Pennsylvania, the early United States, and beyond.
