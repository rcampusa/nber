       This paper analyzes the savings and health care impacts of mortali~        coniirzgenf claims,

defined here as income measures, such as annuities and life-insurance, under which earned income


is contingent on the length of one’s life.    The postwar increase in mandatory annuity and life-


insurance programs, as well as the rapid increase in life-expectancy, motivates a better understanding


of the effects that mortality contingent claims have on resources devoted to life-extension.      We


analyze the incentives that such claims imply for life-extension when resources may affect mortality


endogenously and argue that these incentives dramatically alter the standard conclusions obtained

when mortality is treated exogenously.

 1          Introduction
The number of countries that have old age or survivor income programs
provided through the public sector has increased by almost five times since
1940—from           33 to 155.1       Although         the financing          of these programs         varies
widely across countries, the benefits are paid out almost exclusively in terms
of annuities and they often cover more than 90 percent of the labor force2.
Furthermore, private pensions add to the degree of annuitization of most
elderly populations. Public annuity programs are large, both in terms of
levels and growth:            in OECD         countries they constitute              about one-tenth         of
GDP, make up more than three-quarters of all social insurance in developed
countries, and have contributed to a quarter of the growth in total public
expenditures        since 1960.3 As a consequence,              small mortality effects have large
impacts on public expenditures: in the U. S., an extra year of living would
increase outlays by, at least, the annual size of Medicare and Social Security,
about one-third            of total federal expenditures.             Understanding         the impact of
such programs on investment in health is thereby important for assessing the
relationship between the dramatic increase in old-age life-expectancy, the
postwar growth in mandatory annuity programs, and the rapid development
of medical care to extend the length of life.
      In this paper we study the impact of mortality                          contingent    claims    on sav-
ings and investment in health human capital. Mortality contingent claims are
defined as any type of financial arrangements that generate income dependent
on the length of one’s life and include, for example, annuities ~life-insurance,

   2For the median household          in the U. S., public annuities          are the biggest    component   of
wealth:     about   60 percent    of median    wealth is social security         wealth,   about    25 percent
housing,    with the remainder     being partly annuitized          through    private pensions.

reverse mortgages,        and various forms of survivor benefits in pension plans.
Our main argument is that mortality contingent claims have important in-
centive effects on investments in health and that these incentives raise a rich
set of unexplored        questions.   Although       conventional    analysis of these issues4
by economists assumes mortality to be exogenously                   determined,    and thus not
affected by health investments, we argue that the rapid increases in expendi-
tures on medical care inputs is very hard to interpret without treating mor-
t alit y as endogenous. A major point we stress is that under such endogenous
mortality, there are feed-back effects between the two largest public programs
in many countries—health care services and old-age annuities; Medicare and
Social Security in the US.
    Section 2 sets forth our basic model of life-extension,               in which length of
life may be extended through costly medical care or other resources. Many
economists seem to stress that since medical care is often highly subsidized,
maximum      life-extension     will always take place when feasible.              This ignores
that extending     life involves large private costs such as e.g. reduced quality
of life (e. g., pain),     foregone   bequests,      and time transfers from spouses or
children.   Other costs include life-extending            lifestyles, diets, prescriptions,   or
experimental     therapies, which also contribute            to costs beyond       simply subsi-
dized hospital and physician services. 5 These private costs affects the tradeoff
between living well versus living long because life-extension               reduces resources
available for consumption         but increases the time to consume.              We argue that
this tradeoff is central for assessing the impact of mortality contingent                 claims
on savings or investments in health.
    When     a claim is contingent        on mortality        alone, it is incomplete      with
respect to morbidity        and we consider the effects of this incompleteness                on
life-extension. First, we argue that public annuities induce excessive life-
expectancy. An extreme, but illustrative, example of this incentive effect is
financing the co-payment for a person’s life-support machine with his So-
cial Security pay. More generally, annuities are piece-rate incentives for
life-extending   health investments.        As a consequence,           mandatory      annuities
have some unrecognized          welfare losses because they distort life-expectancy
upwards as a life is more valuable to extend when one has not run out of

    4See e.g. the references in Kotlikoff (1989), Hurd (1990), or Posner (1995),
    sIndeed the fact that sellers of annuities and life-insurance do not price discriminate
             I
medical insurance or living wills but do discriminate on behavior not related to medical care
(e.g., smoking) also suggests that there is a large behavioral component in life-extension.

savings.      Second, if income is more valuable when healthy than when sick),
the morbidity         incompleteness      of annuities implies that a very sick individual
has nothing better to spend annuitized income on than futile attempts to im-
prove his health.G These two annuity-induced                   effects on health investments,
we believe,      are particularly        relevant to the recent explosion             in mandatory
annuity incomes, health care out lays, and life-expect ancy at the end of life.
    Section 3 considers the non-standard interactions between public and pri-
vate savings under a Pay-As-You-Go     (PAYG) Social Security program under
endogenous       mort alit y. Contrary to the case when mortality is exogenous,                    our
model explains why private savings may respond positively to expansions in
mandatory savings programs. 7 An important factor determining the comple-
mentary nature of private and public savings is whether the public savings
are life-extending. If they are, more private savings may be needed to finance
old age living. A somewhat self-evident example is mandatory savings for
health care, such as Medicare in the U.S. By taxing the young for the care of
the elderly, such programs extend life beyond that which would be observed
in a free market.         Private savings may therefore be increased to finance a
longer life in old age.
    Furthermore,         life-extending     savings programs such as Medicare                interact
positively with other programs dependent on the length of life, such as Social
Security. Thus, if the co-payment rate for Medicare were lowered, then this
would presumably raise Social Security outlays through longer living. The
incentives of life-extension           imply a feed-back     effect in the opposing        direction
as well: if annuity levels rise, the increases in medical care would take place.
This feed back, in turn, would raise the annuity outlays even more. In other
words, not only does subsidizing health care increase expenditures                         on social
security by extending life, but expanding               social security also increases health
care outlays by raising the income rewards for living. Moreover, this feedback

   ‘The     extreme form of a private demand       for transfers away from sick states is through
so called   advance    diTectiues,which limit medical care in disabling states, many times to
secure bequests.
   ~There is a substantial    literature on the effects of the low substitutability    of non-pension
and pension savings. Cagan (1965) and Katona (1965) show that the extensive margin,
whether having pensions or not, affects non-pension savings positively. Green (1981) and
King and Dicks-Mireaux        (1982)    document   these effects on the intensive     margin as well,
and Poterba et al. (1996) find these effects robust to controlling       for individual   fixed effects
and a range of potential substitutes.

arises for empirically   relevant parameters in the US. In particular,            Tengs et
al. (1995) review about 500 studies on interventions            to extend life and find
that the median total cost for extending life by one year was about $20,000.
Subsidized at a Medicare rate of 80%, this would imply a cost of about $4,000,
which is far below the annual Social Security benefits for many individuals. a
      We show in section 4 how the incentives of life-extension       affect the demand
for annuities and argue that non-indexed         annuities, where real income falls
wit h length of life, may involve efficiency gains by discouraging        life-extension.
Due to the life-extension feedbacks of annuities, the competitive pricing of
them implies that unit prices rise with quantity. We illustrate how to measure
such feedback effects of public annuities using aggregate data from a public
pension program      in the US, The Civil Service Ret’iTement System (CSRS).
Finally, section 6 concludes.
   Our results imply that the advantages of annuities, and therefore the case
for them being provided      by the public sector, have been overstated.g             The
case has been made in models of exogenous            mortality, but those models fail
to explain the large amount of medical care devoted             towards life-extension
and therefore only consider the advantages           of annuities in insuring against
depletion of savings.    By expanding    the domain of a relatively scarce lit era-
ture on the determinants     of endogenous     lifetime (see, e.g., Grossman (1972),
Ehrlich and Chums (1990), and especially Rosen (1989, 1995)), we show
how the traditional analysis is altered when mortality contingent claims af-
fect mortality,



2       Rational         Life-Extension                and Annuities
This section sets out the basic incentives that are important for life-extension
when wealth is tied to length of life through mort alit y contingent          claims.


2.1      Mortality       Contingent           Claims      Under        Certainty
We consider a non-working retired individual with an increasing and strictly
concave instant aneous utility function U(c). Consider allocating a lump-sum

   8Moreover, in the US private pensions increase    the benefit,   and Medigap   coverage
reduces the cost in this tradeoff.

of retirement wealth W over a remaining life of T years after retirement.                               The
indirect utility V(W, T) obtained by optimally choosing consumption                                 subject
to the wealth constraint is


                              V(W, T) = Maz.             J:o~(.(~))e-”’~~

                                       J         c ()t e-”dt     < W,
                                           t=o
where ~ is the discount rate throughout,                       assumed to be equal to the interest
rate.      The solution to the consumption                     problem     in this case is well known;
it involves perfect consumption                  smoothing        in the sense of equalizing         yearly
consumption         levels.   The lump-sum              wealth is split equally across years to
give the annual consumption                level c(t) = W/A[T],             where A[T] is the present
value of a security paying one-dollar                    every year until T, 10 Substituting               in
the annual consumption             level yields


                                   V(W, T) = A[T]U(~).


This implies that the length of life is complementary to wealth (i.e., VTW > O)
because the poorer is the individual, the less does he consume when extending
life. Put more simply, if one runs out of savings, one does not have much of
a life to extend.
     Denote by M the resources devoted towards extending life, which includes
not only medical care (e. g., hospital and physician services), but also other
resources such as dietary expenditures,                     home care outlays, and time transfers
from children or a spouse.           If such care extends life according                   to the weakly
increasing and concave technology T(M), it introduces a tradeoff between
the quantity and quality of life as represented by years lived T and annual
consumption c. 11 Yearly consumption falls when investing in life-extension
because less wealth is spread over more years. If this is represented by the

  l“This  value is determined by A[T] = ~t~o e–’tdt.
  1lThis technological   relationship relates to the frequently estimated                quantities of ‘life-
years-saved’  of medical interventions    (see, e.g., World Bank (1993)                  and Tengs et al.
(1995)).    In order to maintain the focus on life-extension,            we do not consider more elaborate
health production     functions.



                                                        5
overall utility V(W— M, T(M)),              the demand for care balances the value from
extending    life to the loss in quality of life from foregone consumption               spent
on care:
                                        VTTM = VW

For a mortality    contingent       claim, we denote by W(T)             the wealth that is
associated   with a given lifetime T.            This now implies the indirect          utility
V(W(T(M))    – M, T(M)),  and the demand for life-extending                   resources has
now been altered. The necessary first-order condition is now

                                  T~[VwWT       + VT] = VW,

The left-hand side is the marginal benefit of extra resources devoted to life-
extension.    Now, however,        this is not only made up of the direct effect of
enjoyment of living, but also the indirect effect of income cent ingent on living
(i.e., the mortality   contingent     claim).       The right-hand   side is, as before, the
marginal cost of foregone consumption               due to life-extending   care.
    The point is not that individuals may make a profit from living, but rather
that the marginal benefit of life-extension            has been increased,    Consider the
case of partial annuitization,lz       when the overall wealth is given by the non-
annuitized wealth, Y., together with the amount of annual annuity earning,
YI, multiplied by the number of years lived,

                                     W(T)     = Y, + YIT.


In this case, the marginal wealth impact of life-extension               equals the annual
annuity pay: WT = Y1. When annuitized, the individual does not have to
about financing future years of living because the quality-quantity tradeoff
has been altered. To illustrate, consider the annual consumption                    level when
fully annuitized (Y. = O), as in

                                   Y,T(M)     – M ~ y, _        M
                       c(t)   =
                                      T(M)                    T(M)   “

The yearly consumption            level is now made up of the annuity income,              less
the yearly care used to extend life.            The key point is that life-extension         is

   12We here focus on the ex-post decision, when the annuity is provided through a Pay-
A.s-You-Go program, but we later consider private markets for annuities in which life-
extending efforts are priced out,


                                                6
cheap because extending life generates more annuity receipts to finance the
life-extending care. Indeed, if T(M) is elastic, then both the quantity and
quality of life increase with care. The individual lives longer and enjoys more
consumption when extending life. 13
    These annuity incentives imply that, holding overall wealth constant, life-
extension is excessive relative to lump-sum                   savings when annuitized.        Figure
1 below indicates the opportunity sets in terms of feasible combinations of
wealth and lifetime (W, T) for a non-annuitized and an annuitized individual.
The annuitized opportunity set ranges from (YO + YIT(0), T(O)), when all
wealth is consumed, to (O, T(M), when all wealth is allocated towards life-
extension and ~ is the maximum feasible level of care defined by annuity
revenues equaling care outlays, Y. + Y1T(m) — ~ = O. More wealth has
to be given up for an extra year of life when there are no annuities because
life-extension            is not wealth generating.       This implies that the slope of the
frontier of feasible wealth and life-length combinations                     is steeper for the non-
annuitized individual.




     Now consider the optimal combination                     when annuitized,       as denoted    by
(WA, T~). If the individual faces the lump-sum tradeoff, as given by the non-
annuit ized opportunity set, then he will reduce life-extension and increase
consumption by choosing (WN, Z’~) instead of (WA, TA). The fact that the
two opportunity             sets cross at the optimal annuity combination           means that the
lump-sum wealth is the same as that of the annuitized individual. In other
words, the difference in life-extending care is not due to wealth. The tradeoff
that is less steep, in terms of foregone                  wealth when annuitized,          naturally
makes him shift towards                 greater quantity,      relative to quality      of life:   the
distorted life-length under the annuity is TA – TN.
  laNaturall~,~~ discussed below, this gets priced out in a private annuitY market in
terms of larger premia.         It may even be that without   commitment      devices, such as caps on
Medicare       outlays,    a private annuity market breaks down.    This would be the case when a
life-support     machine      could be financed   by Social Security, leaving some residual   amount
of resources      left over, perhaps for the partner of the life-extender.

2.2        Mortality                 Contingent              Claims          Under          Uncertainty
The same incentives are present under uncertainty, when annuities and other
mortality contingent claims fill the important role of insuring against deple-
tion of savings. Let uncertainty be represented by a set of health states h =
1,2,.. , H, where health states represent a given disease or illness condition.14
Under a lump-sum claim that pays off Wh in state h, the individual devotes
resources ~h under the incentives discussed in the previous section. The
ex-ante problem is therefore to allocate state contingent wealth W~ to solve


         ~a~     ~      ~hV(W,        – ~~(W~),        T~(~h(Wh.)))           s.~,      ~X~Wh        < W,
                 h=l

where ~(Wh)     is the demand for life-extending resources in a state, m~ is
the probability of the state occurring, and W is ex-ante wealth. The pure
insurance       benefit of an annuity is well known,                         and is the exclusive            focus
of discussions concerning                 exogenous      mortality.        It applies in our case when
life-extension         efforts are completely           unproductive,         so that dTh/a~h           = O, im-
plying that no resources are given up for care, ~h = O. In this case, the famil-
iar condition          for optimal insurance requires that all gains from trade across
states are exploited,                implying    that annual consumption                 levels without          life-
extending care are equalized across states at the level Wh/AITh(l))]. Hence,
an annuity providing this consumption guarantees optimal consumption, 15

Annuities makes such life-expectancy   excessive relative to lump-sum pay,
even when they serve the role of insuring against depleted savings. More
precisely,      for     any annuity        contract,     there   exists     a state-contingent          claim      of
equal present          value under       which    life-expectancy         is loweTed but individuals              aTe
bette~    oH.    To show this in a similar way to the deterministic                                case, for an
annuity of size Y, let the state contingent                       wealth under annuity-dependent
care Mb(Y)            be denoted by

                                            ~h = Th(Mh(y))y.
  14For example,         those classified by DRGs under Medicare               in the U.S.
  15Formally,         this follows    from the marginal      indirect     utility    of wealth   given by Vw =
U’(Wh /A ITh(0)]), which, together with the first order condition            fihv~ = mh~ (where } is
the Lagrange      multiplier),       yields that Wh/A[T~ [0] is equal across states.


                                                         8
Since annuities increase the marginal benefit of life-extension,                  we know that
the life-extending     resources under the annuity are larger than under lump-
sum pay: M(Y)        > M(W~).        Therefore, for all states, receiving the lump-sum
wealth Wh requires the same expenditures                 ex-ante, ~ nhW~ = E[T IM(Y)]Y,
but less- life extension in each state. This reduction in life-extending care
relative to annuities makes the individual better off in each state but reduces
life expect ancy,
                                 EITIM(Y)]       > EITIM(W)].

In sum, annuities involve excessive life-extension relative to complete, state
cent ingent contracts, even when they are serving the role of insurance against
depleted savings. The effect discussed here is that observed when holding
wealth constant, but equally important                 may be the effect that occurs due to
the wealth effects generated by public transfers across generations.
   The excess extension of annuities relative to lump-sum pay is particularly
important   when utility is state-dependent,                in the sense that the marginal
benefit from income           is positively     related to health so that income          is less
valuable when sick. This is because annuities are only mortality                     contingent,
and not morbidity       or health contingent.            If Yh(T) is the amount of the an-
nuity in health state h under life-length               T, this is represented by the health
incompleteness Y~(T) = Yh,(T). When income is valued more when healthy,
other things constant, the individual would want more resources when in good
health, rather than bad health.               This is the opposite       transfer of traditional
health insurance, which is actually ‘sick insurance’.                If better health increases
the marginal utility of income, there are gains from trade across future health
states, when the utility loss from the foregone income when sick is less than
the utility gain of the same income when healthy.                    However, since annuities
are not health-dependent,           there are excess resources when sick, which are
therefore devoted to life-extension:            a sick individual with a large annuity has
nothing else to spend it on other than excessive medical care. Consider two
health states, sick and healthy, denoted h = O and h = 1 representing sick
and healthy, and let (Yo, Y1) be the hypothetical annuity amounts held in the
two morbidity       states.    Assume that life-extension            is only productive    when
sick, in which case any redistribution                away from the sick state towards the
healthy state reduces the overall life-expectancy,

                     EITIYO, Y,] = 7roT(Mo(yo))            +   ~l~(~l(fi)).




                                                  9
Life-extending        care in the sick state is larger, the larger is the annuity and
the larger is the loss in marginal utility of consumption                    from sickness. Even
if the productivity        of life-extension     under a treatment is very low, substantial
expenditures       may be made because the value of the income foregone is also
low when sick. This will often imply that optimal demand for the annuity
that is complete with respect to morbidity requires Y1 > Yo, which is impos-
sible for incomplete         annuities requiring Y1 = Y. and, hence, longer living in
this case.


2.3         Life-Extension               In Altruistic           Families
There may be several people investing in one person’s life, as would be the
case, for example, if children are longer living or a younger wife invests in
the life-extension       of a husband.         The investments may be made in cash but
also in-kind, the latter taking place through shared housing or time trans-
fers. Although out-of-pocket   expenses are non-trivial for individuals above
65,16 the largest component of private resources appear to be actual time
allocated towards private care, whet her by children, spouses, or the person
herself,17 Under multi-person            life-extension,    principal-agent      issues arise when
the person whose life is being extended                  is not undertaking       the costly care.
The important         point here is that mortality          contingent     claims may affect the
degree to which the preferences of the agent and the dependent principal line
up, in particular when the agent is altruistic towards the principal.la
      Consider the common case of a male annuity of size Y~, which has survival
benefit to the female of Sf, in which case the after care wealth under no
discounting      is

                  W = YmTm + Max{              Sf(Tf     – Tin), O} – Mm – Mf.

  160ut_of_pocket     ~xPenditures    constituted   more than 20 perCent of income for more ‘ban
10 percent of elderly in 1977 and 1987 in the National         Medical    Care Expenditure    Survey
(NMES) (see Taylor and Banthin (1994)).
  lTShroeni and McGarry (1995) discuss evidence concerning               the magnitude   of such time
transfers in a recent US survey.
   16The extreme, but illustrative,      version of this argument   is the routine investigation   of
life-insurance   beneficiaries   in homicide   cases.




                                                    10
The effect on it of extending         the life of the male is thus




which derives from the fact that an extra year of male living generates one
more year of annuity pay, but, if the male is outlived by the female, one less
year of survivor benefits. Therefore, life-insurance of the female lowers the
income gain from life-extension. 19 Dependent on the altruism of the female
spouse, the observed under-insurance                of widows may provide an efficiency
gain in generating male life-extension.              We would expect couples with more
altruism, perhaps as reflected by a longer duration of marriage, to more fully
insure the wife against the death of the husband because in more altruistic
couples less of an income motive is needed.
   More generally, when more than one life is extended,                      let V(W,     Tm, Tf)
denote the indirect utility for a given family wealth and given lifetimes of
the male and female,         defined similarly to the single-life              case.20   It is the
value of optimal consumption           for a given wealth level and length of life of
both partners in the couple.          When there is no discounting               and differential
annuities of size Y~ for the male and Yt for the female, the total wealth is

                          W = YmTm+YfTf                 –Mm     –Mf.

The marginal effects of life-extension          on wealth are, in this case, simply Ym
and Yi for the male and female. This can easily be shown to imply that, even
though there may no gender interaction                  in the effectiveness     of medical care
on life-extension,    more expenditures        are made on the male when his annuity
is larger.21

  lgNote that this implies that providing    survival benefits to public and private annuities
may have small, or even   negative, effects on total annuity outlays dependent on the relative
size of the increase in outlays on the agent and the decrease in outlays on the principal.
   20More        precisely,       it     may       be       defined      according         to
V(W, Tm, Tf)    s Maz a ~t~~ Uf (cf    (t))e-rtdt   +   (1 – a) ~t~~ U~(cm(t))e-rtdt     subject   to

~~f cf(t)e-’tdt     ~=o c~(t)e–rtdt
                 + ~Tm                < W, where a is the relative weight of the female.
  2~Consequently, pharmaceuticals     should be expected to tailor research towards the fem-
inist agenda as the annuity levels across genders converge.

3       Aggregate               Implications                 for Public Savings
        and Health
This section considers the non-standard             interactions   between public and pri-
vate savings under endogenous life-extension when the public program is
financed in a Pay-As-You-Go  (PAYG) manner, as well as the interactions
that occur between          such public savings programs           and those programs         for
health.
    We consider the effects of a PAYG-financed                mandatory   annuity program
under no discounting.        Let L and T denote the total years of work and retire-
ment, where the first is assumed exogenous but the second is affected by our
discussed life-extension incentives. Consider a population where each indi-
vidual lives L + T years, With a stationary level of fertility of N individuals
born every year, the age distribution          is stationary with N individuals         in ev-
ery age cohort.    At every period, the total number of workers is therefore NL
and the total number of retired individuals              is NT,    with the corresponding
dependency    ratio    for the population     (i.e., number of non-workers per worker)
6 = NT/NL. Let the yearly after-tax earnings be W(I – ~) during working
years, and let the annuity level and medical care in retirement be Y and
M(Y),     so that when total life-time income is smoothed              out over all years of
living this gives the annual consumption             level

 ~ = LW(l      – T) + TY–        M(Y)
                                            = p(Y)w(l        – T) + [1 – p(Y)]Y     – m(Y),
                      L+T

where m(Y)     -      M(Y)/(L    + T) is the medical care smoothed           out over time
and p(Y)    ~ L/(L + T) = 1/(1 + J(Y))              is the fraction of life spent working
and is a negative function of the dependency ratio. Annual consumption net
of care is thereby determined by the wedge between working and retirement
income.    The implied savings S during working years is given by

            s = W(I      –7) – c =      (1 – /o(Y) )[w(l      – 7) – Y] +?-rL(Y).

To smooth     income,       savings increase with the number of retirement              years
to be financed relative to working years, with the gap between working and
retirement income, and with the amount of old age medical care. If the PAYG
Social Security program is balanced,           then we have that the tax-rate T(Y) is



                                               12
implicitly defined by the annuity level Y when revenues of the program equal
its expenditures,    as in


                     NWT(Y)L        = NTY        + T(Y) = 6(Y)(;).


This implies that when the dependency                  ratio depends positively        on the the
annuity level, d6/dY        2 0, the increase in taxes needed to finance an increase
in the level of annuity income is strengthened,                 because,     in addition to sim-
ply requiring larger funds holding the age distribution constant,                        annuities
increase the number of individuals eligible to receive payments,

                             dr         7(Y)   + d6(Y)      Y
                                                 y(~)            20.
                             dY=         W

Using this effect of annuities on taxes, the effect of raising the mandatory
annuity level on savings is given by


         :    =(1   -p(Y)     )[w(-$)          -1]    - #[w(l          -T)   - Y]+:.


The first negative effect is induced by the reduction in the gap between
pre- and post-retirement income. The second positive effect is non-standard
and results from the change in the age distribution                    caused by the increased
incentives   of life-extension     generated         by the annuity increase.          Savings in-
crease because the person will live longer when incentives for life-extension
are increased. The third effect is positive as well and is due to the increased
medical care induced by a larger incentive to extend life. This implies that
a mandatory      annuity program may have a low, or even positive, impact on
private savings.     The complement arit y between public and private savings,
or private pensions      and private savings outside pensions,                  has been shown
to be of empirical importance            but is inconsistent       with traditional      life-cycle
analysis .22 As this analysis shows, however, this conclusion is due to ex-
ogenous mortality; if life-extension is affected by the piece-rates for living
induced by annuities, a complement arity between public and private savings
may be present.

                                                13
3.1     Public      Annuity         and Health            Care Programs
Subsidization of medical care interacts in important ways with the discussed
incentive effects of annuities. Most public health subsidy programs seem to
amount to mandatory        health care savings since relatively                  larger taxes are
levied on the working young and relatively larger subsidies are paid to the
sicker old. Our results imply that public mandatory medical savings may
be complementary with private savings. To determine the savings effects
of subsidizing   life-extending   medical care, let ~ denote the fraction                 of care
subsidized, and consider a demand function for medical care as a function
of health subsidies and annuity benefits M(j, Y) such that, ceteris paribus,
it responds positively    to both incentives for care: dM/d’,                dM/dY     2 0. The
central aspect of such subsidies is that they interact positively with the excess
extension of life induced by annuities, since the medical costs to be spread
across years of living are reduced.     In other words, the larger are the medical
care subsidies, the larger is the discussed incentive effect of annuities, since
the annuities drive the benefit of extension            and subsidies lower the cost of
such extension. Therefore, they may interact positively, so that the annuity
effect on medical care is determined by the level of the subsidy: d2M/djdY 2
0. Suppose that the budget for medical care and Social Security is balanced,
as in
                          NT[M(f,     Y)f   + Y] = NLW~,

with the previous special case of no public medical care being obtained when
~ = O. The tax rate that finances both the health and Social Security
programs is determined by

                                                 M(f,   Y)f   + Y
                         T(f, Y) = 6(f, Y)              ~           .


Increasing medical subsidies or annuities has two positive effects on the tax
rate, one being the direct effect due to increased expenditures                     under a con-
stant age distribution    and the other being the indirect effect through the ag-
ing of the population    under increased intent ives for life-extension:              ~f, ~Y z O.
By arguments similar to those made above, the annual consumption                        level un-
der the two programs is

                   ~ = LW(l       –~)+TY–(1             –f)M(f,         Y)
                                                                             J
                                            L+T


                                            14
with the corresponding          savings per year worked

     s = W(I     –    T) – c =     (1 – p(f, Y))[w(l            –T(f,    Y)) – y] +~(f,         y),

where m(j, Y) s (1–~)~($,  Y)/(L+T)                     is the non-subsidized part of medical
expenditure smoothed out over time.                    The effect of increasing the medical
subsidy on savings is therefore

             $    =(1    -P(Y)      )W(-$)         -   $[W(l         -T)-Y]         +;.

The first two terms are similar to before:                  the direct negative savings is due
to lower after-tax      earnings and the positive effect is due to increased                           life-
extension   under medical subsidies.              The second effect is again through the
change in the age distribution. The third and last term reflects how much
medical expenditures increase due to the increase in the subsidy; it may
be positive or negative, depending             on whether or not medical care is elastic.
This implies that an increase in medical subsidies during old age may increase
private savings. Indeed, this may even be true if the lifetime is exogenous,
since if the rise in the subsidy increases outlays, then more money is needed
during old age.
    The interesting fact is that the two programs                       interact in total outlays.
When mortality is endogenous, medical subsidies affect annuity outlays since
productive medical care implies that an individual must be paid on his annu-
ity longer: if the co-payment         rate for Medicare in the U.S. were to be lowered,
then Social Security outlays would presumably                       increase. Furthermore,            there
are indirect effects in the opposite direction as well. If annuity levels were
to be increased, then medical care expenditures would increase as well, due
to the increased benefit of life-extension              when annuities raise the income re-
wards for living. 23 More precise 1y, the first effect of medical subsidies on the
outlays of the Social Security program is given by
                                       dr
                                       —=NY~>(I
                                       df              df   –
  Zaour   ~rgument~    are based on the substitution            effects generated    by the interactions
between these programs      in a stationary   age distribution.      Of equal importance     may also be
the wealth effect induced    by richer old people that is generated         by programs     that transfer
resources between age cohorts under a non-stationary                age distribution. For example, if
younger cohorts pay relatively more for their annuities            than older ones in the U. S., and if
medical care is a normal good, then Social Security may increase medical                  care relatively
more for the older generation than for the younger generation.

and is due to the fact that larger outlays occur when people live longer.               The
second effect that Social Security outlays have on medical care is due to the
larger life-extension intent ives, as in

4        Implications               for Private             Mortality            Con-
        tingent       Claims Markets
This section discusses the implications         of our arguments for private markets
for mortality contingent claims in terms of limiting the life-extension          induced
by annuities and the price effects of such incentives.


4.1      Efficiency      and Indexation
In competitive insurance markets, where prices are driven down to minimum
average costs, fair prices obtain. Consider the illustrative case of no discount-
ing when the price p(Y, M)         of an annuity of size Y under care M is given
by
                     P(Y, M)     = ~nhTh(Mh)Y        = YEITIM].

This is simply quantity times the unit price equalling the life-expectancy               of
the demander.      The classic moral hazard problem          induced    by annuities is
that the harm imposed on those paying the premium by life-extension                 is not
internalized.   In particular,    at the time of life-extension,   this is determined
by the indirect utility V(YTh – Mh – p, Th) without           taking   into   account   the
efleci on the premium p. Optimal care balances, as before, the benefit from
income and living against the cost in foregone consumption, as in


                                 ~[vwY      + v,] = Vw.


On the other hand, the socially efficient level of care is determined by taking
into account how the annuity price is affected by this same change in care,
as in
                      ~[vwY         + v, - Vw] = &~Tkvw.
                   ‘h dMh


                                           16
This balances the social benefits of those that end up in the health state (the
left-hand side) with the social cost it imposes on others in terms of a larger
premia (the right-hand          side).    Since private incentives imply that the left-
hand side is zero, efficient provision reduces life-extension in order to avoid
the negative external effects it has on others paying the premia.
      Private markets may internalize such external effects.                  The efficient ‘tax’
on life-extenders makes them pay the marginal harm imposed on all premium
payers.     If 13~is the tax-rate,        then 13~M~is the Pigouvian            tax bill for life-
extending       care.
                  It should be set to equate the social cost with the social
benefit above, as in



This is the harm (on the margin) imposed on those not ending up in the state
by the premium increase induced by their life-extending                       care. A method of
mimicking       this tax on unobservable         care would be through            decreasing    the
income rewards of life-extension           through a non-indexed         annuity in which the
real annual pay fell with the length of life. A lack of indexing would discrim-
inatee within a given cohort, in cent rast to conventional              age discrimination        in
annuity premia which operates across cohorts .24


4.2       Competitive            Pricing
The conventional        analysis in which care is unproductive                and mortality     ex-
ogenous implies linear pricing;            that is, unit prices do not change with the
quantity of annuities purchased since life-expectancy is unaffected. On the
other hand, consider the case when the distribution of lifetimes on a higher
quantity       of annuities dominates       one of a lower quantity            in the first-order

  24More precisely, when the annuity is not indexed,       it pays out the decreasing   real annual
pay fraction    R(T)Y   at age T, where O < R(T)     < 1 and RT <0.      The marginal     condition
ex-post   at the time of care therefore   becomes


                               ~[VwY[l        + R,] + V,]=     Vw,


which reduces the marginal     benefit of life-extension   since the factor    [1 + RT] is less than
unity, the value it takes when indexed.




                                                17
sense. In this case, unit prices pu s p/Y              rise with quantity, as in

                                 dpu _    dEITIM(Y)]           > ~,
                                 dY–              dY           –

In other words, prices are non-linear: unit prices rise with quantity as it raises
the life-extension and consequently the outlays of the insurer; the larger is
the annuity effect on survival, the larger is the positive effect of quantity on
unit price.
    Unfair pricing above expected claims may make unit prices fall with quan-
tity. However, there would still be different predictions                    between exogenous
and endogenous      mortality.     In particular,      assume that prices satisfy




where ~ = (~o, ~1) are fixed and variable costs adding to the premia beyond
just expected     claims. This implies the unit price




Now, under exogenous          mortality, unit prices fall with quantity as the fixed
costs are spread over a larger sized contract:

                              dEITIM(Y)]      = o ~          dpu    < ~
                                   dY                        dY     –

On the other hand, under elastic endogenous mortality, there exists a quan-
tity A above which unit prices are rising, although they may be falling ini-
tially, because the fixed costs become negligible at larger quantities,25

                                    dpu >0
                                                  ,    YzA
                                     dY   –

Furthermore,      two observable       groups that differ in the size of the incentive
effect will have different relationships between unit price and quantity, al-
though not necessarily a positive one. For example, as the life expectancy
of a young      cohort   is less elastic than that of an older one, we predict                   a
posit ive age interaction       on the quantity-unit              price relationship;   prices for

  ZsThi~ follows directly   from the expression   for ~.



                                              18
older cohorts have larger effects of quantity on unit price, even though the
relationship    may not be positive, due to fixed costs.
   our life-extension incentives imply that prices for so called guaranteed
annuities have predictable price differences relative to standard annuities.
Such annuities guarantee          an annual pay of Y for at least TO years, after
which the annuity works in the standard                 way.    This mortality    contingent
claim differs from a standard annuity in that the marginal benefit from life-
extension is lowered. The price of a guaranteed                annuity would be



If the survival function under the two contracts were the same, the difference
in total price between the regular and guaranteed                annuity would be


                        PG(Y)     –   P(Y) =   Y    ~:(1-S(i))dt.
This is because the guaranteed annuity is like paying a regular annuity to an
individual     that lives with certainty during the guarantee period.              However,
relative to the normal annuity, the marginal effect of life-extension               is lower
under a guaranteed      annuity, which consequently             implies that the premium
for a guarantee should be less than the difference above, due to the reduction
in life-extension   under guaranteed income.
      Finally, the same arguments         can be used to predict         the premium      for
indexing.      Our incentives     imply that indexing          should affect unit prices in
predictable    ways. In particular, indexing should increase the cost of annuities
more than the expected          cost of inflation since it implies larger incentives to
extend life.


4.3      Measuring          The Feed-Back                 Effect of Annuities
This section illustrates how to empirically            assess the feedback effects of an-
nuities using standard aggregate data generated by an annuity roll. We use
data reported in Virga (1996) on the public pension program covering federal
employees in the U.S. who were hired before 1983, The Civil Service Retire-
ment System ( CSRS). Figure 2 below shows survival functions for groups
differing in the amount of monthly         annuity pay they received while on that
pension roll. The data cover the fiscal years 1988-94 and are differentiated
by five levels of monthly annuity levels.


                                               19
    The annuities under CSRS are indexed relative to the CPI and are manda-
tory so that selection-issues are presumably of minor importance.2G The sizes
of these annuities are relatively large, as they combine Social Security and a
federal employee pension program. The data report ed in Virga (1996) were
presented in terms of yearly mortality hazard rates on the annuity role rep-
resent ed by CSRS across salary and annuity cells, with exceptionally                                  large
cell sizes ranging from about 1500 to 1.8 million. The data show that yearly
mortality hazards fall with annuity level and salary, each falling when con-
trolling for the other. The lowest yearly hazard rates are about one-half
of the highest, across all cells. We used these hazard rates to compute the
annuity-dependent   survival curves reported in the figure. 27 The plotted sur-
vivals are for males, conditional on reaching age 57, and they display the
positive relationship between annuity pay and survival discussed above.
    Although       these patterns may, of course, be confounded,                   the data reported
by Virga show that they hold controlling for gender and salary levels, as well.
However, the key point of these survivals is to illustrate how relatively small
differences in survivals may nevertheless lead to relatively large incentive
effects. To compute these incentive effects, we decomposed the price increase
of an annuity due to an increase in quantity int o two components:                          one holding
unit price constant and the other holding quantity constant, as in

                                alp(Y) = p~(Y)dY            + Ydp~(Y),

Dividing      through        by the increase in the total annuity value, the relative
contributions      are obtained,      as in

                                  ~ = Ydp~(Y)             + p~(Y)dY
                                           alp(Y)            alp(Y)      “

We call the first term the incentive component of the increase in the annuity
value resulting from the increase in the unit price and the second term the
quantity     component        resulting from the increase in the quantity alone.

  “Even     under voluntary      demand,    Cawley    and Philipson      (1996)   present   evidence    that
supports    that selection    on the demand   side does not occur on private information               about
mortality   in life-insurance   markets.
   27More precisely, we used a linear spline approximation   h(t IY) to compute the yearly
hazards using the reported hazard rates in 5 year intervals, and then compute the discrete
time survival function according to S(tlY) = ~~=o(l – h(slY)).


                                                     20
    Figure 3 below plots the size of the incentive             component    for different
increases in the quantity. The three curves corresponds to three separate
quantity increases from YL= $500 per month to YH = $1250, $1750, and
$2500 per month. The figure reports the first incentive component                 using the
annuity dependent survival functions of Figure 2.




    A given curve corresponds       to a given pair (Y~, YH) before and after the
quantity increase, and each curve is plotted against the x-axis representi~g
the age at which the annuity starts.          For example,      the top curve indicates
that if an annuity starts at age 70 then the incentive component           in raising the
quantity from $500 to $2500 per month is about 18 percent.             In other words, of
the increase in the annuity value that occurs when increasing the quantity, 18
percent is attributable to the increase in longevity due to the larger annuity.
The feedback      effects illustrated by the non-trivial       incentive effects in these
aggregate      data suggest that a more careful empirical           examination     of the
relationship     between life-extension   and public annuity expenditures          may be
warrant ed.



5      Conclusion
We analyze the savings and health care impact of mort alit y contingent claims,
under which income earned is contingent             on one’s length of life. We stress
the incentive     effects of such mortality       contingent   claims on resources      de-
voted to extend life. We discuss the effects that such claims have on savings
and resources devoted to life-extension           and argue, among other things, that
life-extension    is excessive under mandatory        annuity programs such as Social
Security; that public savings may increase private savings; that there may be
an annuity-based gender bias in medical care; and that the lack of insurance
of wives against the deaths of their husbands may have an efficiency basis.
We further discussed the non-linear          pricing of mortality    contingent    claims,
the efficiency gains of not indexing annuities, and the important           interactions
between public subsidies for health and savings, interactions which are absent
in models with exogenous        mortality.    Overall, we argue that the insurance
aspects of mortality contingent claims have been overemphasized, relative to
their incentives for resources devoted to life-extension through medical care.


                                             21
    Our arguments may imply important differences with the standard theory
of Ricardian equivalence. It is claimed there that inter-generational trans-
fers have no real effects if children are altruistic towards parents or parents
towards children. This is not necessarily true under endogenous mortality. If
parents support children because they are altruistic, they have no artificial
intent ive to extend their lives. But if children support parents, our arguments
show that there may be excessive investment in health. Moreoverj if income
is redistributed     from parents to children, Ricardian equivalence says this has
no effect, regardless of which one is altruistic.       But if children are altruistic,
such a redistribution      will raise the incentive     to invest in life-extension   by
parents.
    Finally,   although    our discussion   concerned    the impact    of annuities on
mortality, this may not be the only channel through which annuities affect
age distributions.     If children and annuities are substitutes for old age income
and health support,       then mandatory     annuities naturally    lower the demand
for children so that annuities may not only have effects on mortality but also
on fertility. The overall impact of mandatory public annuity programs on the
more recent part of the demographic transition, namely the postwar reduc-
tions in both mortality      and fertility rates, therefore remains an important
area of future research.
