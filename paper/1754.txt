            Workers' Pits: Pethinking Protective Labor Legislation



                                ABSTRACT




     This   paper focuses on a few directions in which protective labor

legislation might be expanded in the United States over the next decade

and the implications of expansion in each area for labor markets.

Specifically, it addresses the areas of hours of work, unjust dismissal,

comparable worth, and plant closings. In each case, the discussion

stresses the need to be explicit about how private markets have failed,

the need for empirical evidence to test such market failure claims, the

need for economic analysis of potential unintended side effects of

policy changes, and the existing empirical estimates of the likely

magnitudes of these effects.

I. Introduction

     While the last fifty years have seen the federal government become involved

with macroeconomic and labor market policies to stimulate increased employment,

they also have seen the rapid growth of programs and legislation that seek to

mandate conditions under which workers may   be employed. These latter policies
fall under the rubric of "social insurance programs" (e.g., workers' compensa-

tion, unemployment compensation, and the social security retirement, survivors,

and disability programs) and "protective labor legislation" (e.g., minimum wage,

maximum hours, child labor, occupational safety and health, private employees

retirement income security, antidiscrimination, and mandatory retirement laws).

     All of these policies seek to mandate protection for workers in areas in

which society perceives that workers have a "right" to be protected. Whether

these be areas of pecuniary compensation (e.g., insurance against unemployment,

work injury, nonwork disability, or promised retirement benefits not being

delivered) or nonpecuniary conditions of employment (e.g., occupational safety

and health), in each case the implicit judgement was reached that private

markets had in some sense failed and that government interven.tion was required.

In each case the policies also led to market repercussions, as federally

mandated changes in the employment relation invariably led employers to react to

the changing constraints they faced. In some cases these responses resulted in

increased employment, however, in other cases they resulted in a reduction in

employment opportunities. 1

    This paper focuses on a few directions in which protective labor legisla-

tion might be expanded in the United States over the next decade and the

implications of expansion In each area for employment policy. Somewhat surpris-

ingly to the noninformed observer, perhaps, protective labor legislation Is far

less comprehensive in the United States than it is in many other western
                                      —2—


countries. While this may result from greater union strength in these countries

and unions achieving through legislation many things that are left to the

collective bargaining process in the United States, it does leave much room for

expansion in protective labor legislation here.

     For example, while in the United States we have an overtime pay premium to

discourage employers' use of overtime hours and to encourage additional employ-

ment, several European countries have more stringent rules that require prior

governmental or employee approval before any overtime can be worked.2 Or, to

take another example, while for the most part in the United States employers can

unilaterally terminate employees—at—will unless specific contract provisions

protect the workers, in most European countries such dismissals are subject to

various governmental review processes that may lead to reinstatement and/or

severance pay if they are deemed unjust.3

     The plan of this paper is as follows. I begin in the next section with a

discussion of hours of work legislation in the United States that presents a

conceptual framework for analyzing proposed changes in protective labor legisla—.

tion. A rationale from the perspective of an analytical labor economist for

many forms of protective labor legislation is that they are attempts to correct

for failures of private markets and overtime hours legislation is analyzed in

this framework. The discussion stresses the need to be explicit about how

private markets have failed, the need for empirical evidence to test such market

failure claims, the need for economic analysis of potential unintended side

effects of proposed policy changes, and empirical estimates of the likely

magnitudes of these effects.

     The next three sections adapt this framework to address three areas of

proposed forms of protective labor legislation that have begun to receive public

attention and that have considerable implications for employment policy. These
                                             —3—


 respectively are policies relating to "employment at will", "comparable worth",

 and plant closings". A brief final section provides some concluding remarks.



 II. Rours of Work Legislation4

     The overtime pay premium provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)

 currently regulate only two dimensions of the hours of work relationship, the

number of hours after which the overtime premium goes into effect (forty) and

the premium's level (time and a half). As noted above, in their legislation,

several European countries regulate other dimensions; for example, they require

either prior governmental approval for overtime, for employees to give their

consent to working overtime, or both. A bill to amend the FLSA introduced into

Congress in 1979 by Representative Conyers would similarly have prohibited

mandatory    assignment of overtime in        the United States, as well as raised the

overtime   premium from time arid   a   half to double time and required premium pay
after 35 rather than 40 hours.5            Although hours of work legislation will

probably   not be an area of great      legislative effort over the next decade, a

brief summary of the history of such legislation in               the United States   and a

discussion of my prior attempt to analyze the Conyers proposal will help to

provide the analytic framework I will use          throughout this paper.
     The earliest forms of hours of work legislation in the United States were

Initiated at the state level, applied to women and children and had the aim of

reducing fatigue and exhaustion.6 For example, in 1879 legislation regulating

maximum hours of work was introduced in Massachusetts, where its supporters

claimed that long workweeks were exhausting and caused women to age prema-

turely.7 The first hours laws covering men in the private sector were also at

the state level and covered occupations in which long workweeks adversely

affected third parties or employees themselves. An 1890 Ohio law limited hours
                                      —4—


of workers who operated trains in the hope that this would reduce railroad

accident rates and protect the traveling public. This law was quickly followed

by state laws limiting workweeks in mining to protect miners, who were subject

to unhealthy and unsafe working conditions.8

     In each of these cases a rationale (from the perspective of an analytical

labor economist) for the protective labor legislation Is found in the fact that

the marginal social cost of longer workweeks exceeded the marginal private cost

to employers. In the absence of government intervention these divergencies

persisted because low family income levels did not permit many women and

children the luxury of turning down low wage—long hours jobs, because no good

alternatives to the railroads existed for long—range travel and railroad

passengers were not always accurately informed about railroad employees'

workweeks, and because the limited alternative employment opportunities In

mining communities often restricted the occupational choice of individuals in

those areas. In each case, then, markets failed, in the sense that compensating

wage, or price, differentials did not arise to compensate employees, or third

parties, for the full risks they incurred because of long hours of work. The

case for government intervention was strong; the only real question is why the

legislation took the form of outright restrictions on hours rather than the use

of tax or penalty schemes to increase employers' marginal private cost of longer

hours.9

     At the federal level, throughout the early 1930s bills were repeatedly

introduced into Congress to limit the length of the workweek. While the goal of

protecting existing employees from the ills associated with excessive fatigue

remained, a second explicit purpose of such legislation was to Increase employ-

ment by spreading the available work. Ultimately on June 25, 1938, the Fair

Labor Standards Act, with its overtime provisions, was enacted.
                                      —5--



     Once again, the provisions of the Act can be rationalized in terms of the

divergence between private and social costs. Even if employers and their

employees in the 1930s were satisfied with long workweeks, their private

calculations Ignored the social costs borne by the unemployed. The time and a

half rate for overtime can be thought of as a tax to make employers bear the

full marginal social cost of their hours decisions; it was meant to reduce the

use of overtime hours and, to the extent that the increased costs do not

substantially reduce total manhours demanded, stimulate employment.'0 Further—

more, if employees were not satIsfied wIth long workweeks during the l930s but,

because of market imperfections, did not have the freedom to choose employment

with employers who orfered shorter workweeks, the direct payment of the tax to

employees who worked longer workweeks can be understood as an attempt to remedy

this imperfectIon.11

     Although coverage under the overtime pay provisions of the FLSA has

Increased substantially over the last half century, the premium itself has

remained constant at time and a half. Periodically, as in the Conyers bill,

proposals have been introduced in Congress to raise the premium to double time.

The underlying argument made to support the increase is that while unemployment

remains a pressing national problem, the use of overtime hours has increased in

recent years. Moreover, the argument follows, since the enactment of the FLSA,

the deterrent effect of the overtime premium on the use of overtime has been

weakened by the growing share of hiring and training costs, fringe benefits, and

government mandated insurance premiums in total compensation. Many of these

costs are quasi—fixed or employee related (e.g., vacation pay, holiday pay, sick

leave, hiring costs), rather than hours related, in the sense that they do not

vary with overtime hours. An increase in these quasi—fixed costs reduces

employers' marginal costs of working their employees overtime relative to their
                                      —6—


costs of hiring additional employees. The growth of these costs, it is claimed,

has been at least partially responsible for the increase in overtime and

therefore an increase in the overtime premium paid by employers is required to

offset this adverse effect.

     A complete analyses of the desirability of raising the overtime premium

requires answers to a number of empirical questions. Would higher overtime pay

rates relative to the quasi—fixed costs of employment induce employers to reduce

their usage of overtime hours? Would reductions in overtime hours be "con-

verted" to full—time jobs or "lost" to capital substitution or output reduc-

tions? Would employers comply with the legislation? Would workers who previ-

ously worked overtime, moonlight at second jobs and reduce the employment oppor—

tunities for unemployed individuals? Would the unemployed have the skills

necessary to fill any new jobs that might be potentially created? Finally, what

would be the Income distribution consequences of the proposed policy change?

Empirical analyses directed at answering all of these questions led us to

conclude that raising the overtime premium would not be an effective way of

stimulating employment growth, even though it would lead to a reduction in

overtime hours, and that it would not have desirable income distribution
                12
consequences.

     Raising the overtime premium paid by employers might make sense for another

reason, however, if the revenue that would accrue from such an Increase was not

distributed to employees in the form of higher premium pay received by them for

overtime. Instead, the revenue from any increase in the tax on overtime would

go directly to aid the unemployed; for example it could be contributed to the

unemployment insurance fund or to employment and training program budgets.

Unless It can be demonstrated that market imperfections prevent currently

employed workers from freely choosing the length of their workweeks and that the
                                       —7—


 existing overtime premium does not fully compensate these workers for the

 disutility associated with long workweeks, then no increase in the premium paid

 to employees is justified. One can thus logically be in favor of raising the

 tax paid by employers when they use overtime hours but not in favor of raising

 the overtime premium paid to employees.

     What about the Conyers proposal to legislate the prohibition of mandatory

overtime, as is done in several European countries. Presumably such a proposal

can be viewed as being based upon the belief that market imperfections persist

in the labor market and that the overtime premium does not fully compensate

employees for the disutility associated with mandatory overtime. One may

question, however, if markets have failed here. There appear to be a variety of

overtime hours provisions offered in the labor market; for example, only 16

percent of the individuals in the 1977 Michigan Quality of Employment Survey who

reported working overtime also reported that the overtime hours decision was

made unilaterally by their employer and that overtime was mandatory in the sense

that employees who refused it suffered a penalty.'3 In addition, roughly 20

percent of employees covered by major collective bargaining agreements in 1976

had explicit provisions in their contracts that gave them the right to refuse

overtime.14

     To the extent that labor markets are competitive and establishments do

offer a variety of ove-rtime hours provisions (e.g., employer determines,

employee determines, penalty for refusal), compensating wage differentials

should arise. To attract labor, establishments that offered distasteful

mandatory overtime provisions would have to pay higher straight—time wages,

higher overtime premiums, or higher fringe benefits than establishments in which

such provisions did not occur. If fully compensating wage differentials exist,

there is no case for legislative prohibitions against mandatory overtime.
                                       —8—


Evidence on the extent to which such compensating wage differentials currently

do exist is of importance to policy makers.

     In   fact, the only empirical study done on the topic found that, on average,

such compensating differentials did not exist.'5 This provides some support in

favor of a prohibition of mandatory overtime, although the benefits from such

legislation would have to be weighed against the potential costs; the latter

include reduced employer flexibility in scheduling production, and thus,
increased production costs, which would lead in turn to lower employment levels.

The study also found, however, that compensating differentials did exist for

union members. That is, unions were able to win for their members through the

collective bargaining process what the market on average did not produce.'6 The

workers most "in need" of the prohibition on mandatory overtime then are

nonunion workers.



III. Employment—At—Will

    Judging by the spate of articles in both academic journals and the popular.

press, reform of the employment—at—will doctrine to provide nonunion workers

with protection against "unjust dismissal" appears to be one of the most

pressing labor issues of the decade.'7 Put in simplest terms, the doctrine of

employment—at—will asserts that both employers and employees have the right to

terminate an employment relationship at any time. Of concern to workers is that

under such a system they have no statutory protection against arbitrary deci-

sions by employers to dismiss them.

    Unlike virtually all European nations, which have specific legislation that

prohibit unjust dismissals and that often mandate the use of labor courts and/or

industrial tribunals to resolve disputes, for the most part in the United States

the doctrine of employment—at—will continues to prevail.18 Unionized workers
                                      —9—


with specific contract provisions that govern discharges, as well as tenured

teachers and workers under some civil service systems are not subject to this

doctrine and all workers receive some protection if they are dismissed for

reasons that are prohibited under other federal statutes (e.g., race, sex, or

age discrimination) since they may file suit for remedy under those statutes.

Estimates, however, are that over 60 million workers in the United States have

virtually no protection against unjust dismissal.'9

     Concern over the issue arises because it is also estimated that each year

around 4 to 5 percent of the labor force are discharged from their jobs.2° While

the majority of these discharges may be justified, due to willful and

deliberate misconduct, some may be unrelated to a worker's productivity on the

job and/or the penalty of dismissal may seem excessive relative to the workers

actions.

     In the union sector, where contract language Often protects workers from

arbitrary dismissals, discharge rates tend to be lower.2' Moreover, approx-

imately half of unionized workers who are discharged and who appeal these

discharges through an arbitration process, as specified in their contracts, are

reinstated.22 One researcher has estimated that if nonunion workers had similar

rights to appeal their dismissals to impartial arbitrators and did so at the

same rate that dismissed union workers did, that approximately 150,000 dis-

charged nonunion workers would be reinstated each year.23 To the extent that

these workers suffer serious economic losses, employers are not bearing the full

marginal social cost of unjustly dismissing workers, and a case for government

intervention may   exist.
    In recent years, public policy In the United States relating to the

employment—at—will Issue has preceeded primarily through state judiciary

systems. As of 1984,more than twenty state courts had adopted "public policy"
                                      —10—


or "whistle—blowing" exceptions to the doctrine. In these states workers cannot

be discharged for actions that are consistent with public policy (e.g., refusing

an employer's request to commit perjury, refusing an employer's request not to

serve on a jury, reporting a violation of an OSHA standard). Similarly,

thirteen state courts had adopted "implicit contract" exceptions. In these

states, some of which also have public policy exceptions, workers cannot be

dismissed "without cause" if actions taken by the employer (e.g., oral state-

ments, established past practices, statements in personnel manuals) implicitly

promises such protection.24

     These exceptions, however, appear to apply primarily to those dismissed

executive and managerial employees who have the financial resources necessary to

pursue redress through the courts. The majority of discharged workers are lower

level blue—collar workers whose reasons for dismissal typically don't fall under

the exceptions.25 While several state legislatures have introduced bills

requiring "just cause" for dismissal and requiring mediation and/or arbitration

of disputes, no state bill has come to vote since 1975, and the only federal

attempt at such legislation similarly failed to come to vote.26 Some observers

have argued that a federal statute is required and pressure for such legislation

may continue to build.27

    To understand the potential rationale for such legislation, it is useful,

as in the previous section, to consider several models of the labor market.28

Consider first a simple competitive labor market with many buyers and sellers of

labor, in which skills of workers are completely general, in the sense that a

worker's productivity is not firm—specific. In such a world, proponents of the

employment—at—will doctrine argue that it is an equitable or fair form of

contract since either party can terminate the contract at will. Workers can

quit if they perceive better opportunities elsewhere and firms can dismiss
                                           —11—


workers if they perceive that workers' productivity has fallen below their

wages. In the latter case dismissed workers would suffer no permanent loss,

since their skills would be perfectly transferable. However, since job search

takes time, there would be a loss of income during the job search process. How

large the loss of income would be in part depends upon whether being dismissed

adversely affects the time it takes to find a job.

          Proponents of employment—at—will also argue that it is an efficient form of

contract since either party can terminate it if the other party reneges on the

agreement. Knowledge that each party reserves this right decreases the chances

that workers will not put forth expected levels of performance and that em-

ployers will not provide promised pecuniary and nonpecuniary forms of compensa-

tion. Thus, efficiency is promoted and monitoring costs are reduced.

          If in such a world an employer justly discharges a worker for malfeasance,

the worker might suffer a loss of income but this loss would be deserved.

Proponents claim that firms would have little incentive to unjustly discharge

workers because information that they were doing so would reduce the attractive-

ness of the firm to prospective future employees and increase voluntary turnover

of existing employees. On both counts, employers' labor costs would go up;

unjust discharges would lead to"reputational costs" and would be costly to the

f irui.


          In   evaluating potential losses to workers from unjust discharges, it is

useful to consider four different situations. First, consider the employment

relation in casual or secondary labor markets; markets in which neither firms

nor workers have incentives to maintain stable long—term relationships. In such

markets, workers frequently voluntarily or involuntarily change jobs and the

stigma from being dismissed is not likely to be a permanent one. The loss to

workers from unjust dismissal are likely to be only short—run in nature.
                                         —12—



     Next,   consider the situation I have previously discussed; a situation of

competitive labor markets   with   completely general skills. We know that in such

a world workers bear the full costs of acquiring skills and hence firms have no

Investments in workers.29 Reputational costs would discourage firms from

unjustly dismissing workers, however if they did, permanent losses to workers

would occur only if information about the workers' true productivity could not

eventually overcome the signal given by their dismissals.

     Third, consider the situatiän in which skills are firm—specific. In this

case workers and firms share the cost of training and have incentives to

maintain stable relationships.3° Firms would appear to have little incentive

to unjustly dismiss workers; if they did, however, dismissed workers' losses

might be permanent because their productivity with other employers would be

lower.

     Finally, consider the situation of general skills, where firms use upward

sloping   age—earnings profiles to motivate increased attachment and increased
productivity by employees.3' With such Implicit contracts, workers are init-
ially paid less than their marginal product but eventually are paid more. While
reputational costs would discourage firms from unjustly dismissing workers who

were in the stage of their life—cycles in which marginal productivity was less

than wages, if they did, these workers would suffer permanent losses.

    Proponents of employment—at—will essentially would argue then that in

structured internal labor markets, where workers and firms have long—term

attachment, there are strong incentives for employers not to unjustly discharge

workers (the last two situations). In casual labor markets, or markets where

general training prevails (the first two situations), there are fewer incen-

tives, however in these cases it appears that discharged workers' losses would

only be temporary. Given the perceived benefits from allowing employment—at—
                                      —13—


will, any policy recommendation should relate to short—term compensation for

unjust discharge, not to restricting employers' rights to dismiss workers.

Moreover, proponents would argue that once government restricts employers'

rights to dismiss workers, it opens up the possibility of future restrictions on

other dimensions of the employment relation such as promotion, transfers, and

lesser disciplinary actions.

     Critics of employment—at—will, of course, would disagree with this analy-

sis. They would argue that labor markets are not competitive and that firms

have dominant power. Worker opportunities may well be limited by the structure

of labor markets and the absence of viable alternatives implies that dismissed

workers may suffer permanent losses. .If worker alternatives are limited, firms

need not fear any reputational costs associated with unjust dismissals. More-

over, since discharges are almost always an individual rather than a collective

phenomenon, it is unlikely in any case that potential employees would be aware

of any discharges (let alone unjust ones) and thus that firms would suffer any

reputational costs. Viewed in this way, employment—at—will does not seem

equitable and seems to favor employers over employees. They focus on modifying

this policy because of the severe costs they feel It imposes on unjustly

dismissed workers; costs which are much more severe than any other personnel

action a firm may take.32

    The case then for modifying employment—at—will is similar to the case for

Intervening in the overtime hours decision. If labor markets are not competi-

tive, employers will not take the full marginal social cost of unjust dismissals

into account in making dismissal decisions. Specifically, they will Ignore the

social costs of involuntary unemployment and/or dismissed workers having to

accept jobs at wages that are not commensurate with their productivity. Viewed

this way, the appropriate policy recommendation is to put a "tax" on unjust
                                        —14—


dismissals to increase employers' costs of taking such actions. In fact, this

is   exactly what the policy of a number of European countries is, calling for
severance pay if dismissals are found to be unjust.33
      Ultimately,   of course, which position is correct   and the appropriate public
policy   depend upon the answers to a number of questions. What are the charac-

teristics of people who are unjustly dismissed? Do they suffer prolonged spells

of uneniploynient? Do they suffer permanent earnings losses from their dismissal?

Not surprisingly, given that data do not permit us to distinguish unjust from

just dismissals, we currently have answers to none of these questions. Some

studies, however, do provide information on related questions.

      First, as compared to unemployment insurance recipients, unemployed workers

who are disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance benefits because they

were dismissed for misconduct tend to be younger, lower wage, nonwhite, and

unmarried.34 Dismissal rates also tend to be higher at small firms than at

large firms and for short—term employees than for long—term employees.35

Together, these facts suggest that dismissed workers are often short—term

employees in casual labor markets; a situation in which I argued above that

unjust dismissal is likely to lead only to temporary earnings loss.

      Second, survey information suggests that employers are less likely to hire

an employee dismissed for cause, than they are one who was laid—off or who

voluntarily quit.36 Yet data on durations of spells of unemployment from five

states suggest that in two of the states where workers dismissed for misconduct

were disqualified from receiving unemployment insurance for the duration of

their spell, these durations of unemployment were considerably shorter than

those of otherwise comparable unemployment Insurance recipients.37 Denial of

unemployment insurance benefits apparently prods discharged workers to return to

employment relatively quickly and, on average, they succeed, even if employers
                                      —15—


are less willing to hire them. For the most part these discharged workers were

unemployed for only relatively short spells.

     We have no information, though, on the post—unemployment earnings loss

suffered by these dismissed workers vis—a—vis the losses suffered by unemploy-

ment insurance recipients; one might suspect that the lack of unemployment

insurance benefits causes the former to settle for lower positions. Moreover,

we do not even have any information on the absolute magnitudes of the post—

unemployment earnings losses for discharged workers. Without such information

for unjustly dismissed workers, it is difficult to suggest what the appropriate

policy should be.

    It is interesting to note, however, that public policy in European countries

typically takes the form of first mediation and then formal labor court or

industrial tribunal proceedings, with workers deemed to be unjustly discharged

being   awarded severance pay. In most cases the severance pay is short—run,
rarely exceeding six months in duration.38 Reinstatement is rare; this makes
sense   in terms of our analytical framework, in that raising the cost to

employers of "unjust" discharges is more efficient than an outright prohibition

of the action.

     One possible reform then is to propose federal legislation on the subject.

For example, one might require that discharge disputes go to arbitration or

industrial tribunals atid that severance pay be awarded in cases of "unjust"

discharges. Rather than expanding the federal bureaucracy, however, it may make

more sense to work within existing state legislation, specifically those dealing

with unemployment insurance.

     All states currently penalize unemployed workers who have been discharged

due to misconduct connected with work and who apply for unemployment insurance

benefits. While each state has its own interpretation of misconduct, misconduct
                                       —16—



 typically   includes violations of company rules, insubordination, refusal to

 perform work, and excessive absences. In a number of states it must be "willful

and deliberate" for a penalty to occur. Fifteen states provide benefits to

penalized individuals after a waiting period of typically three to ten weeks,

while the remainder disqualify these individuals for at least their duration of

unemployment.39 It is interesting to note that of the fifteen states that

provide   benefits after a waiting period, the judiciary in only one, Nebraska,
currently has adopted an implicit contract exception to the employment—at—will
doctrine.     Apparently the judiciary Is acting asif the      provision of some
unemployment    insurance benefits to discharged workers may   reduce   the pressure

they feel to adopt implicit contract exemptions, although they never mention

such benefits in their decisions.

     Given that the provision of unemployment insurance benefits to unjustly

dismissed workers would provide financial support     similar to severance pay
benefits,   one wonders why pressure for refordoes not take the form of devising

ways to have state unemployment insurance systems more rigorously examine

"dismissals for misconduct" and to encourage them to award benefits without

extra waiting periods in cases in which the dismissal was deemed excessive.40

While this might require claim evaluators to hold more thorough and expeditious

hearings than they currently do, in principle this type of examination is what

the system should be doing anyway. The only weakness of this approach is that

to the extent that the unemployment insurance payroll tax is not perfectly

experience—rated, employers would still not be bearing the full marginal social

cost of their dismissal decisions.4'

    Moving away from an employment—at—will policy would not be costless.

Suppose, as in many European nations, we moved towards a system of using labor

courts or industrial tribunals to resolve discharge grievances for nonunionized
                                        —17—


employees. To the extent that doing so increases employers' costs of termina-

ting workers, it should induce them to devote more resources to ascertaining

the likely productivity of potential applicants and to more frequently termina-

ting workers prior to the end of their probationary periods.42 In a growing

economy, the result would be a slow—down in the rate of growth of employment,

with the lost employment opportunities being concentrated among lower produc-

tivity workers (where minimum wage laws prevent employers from offering low

initial wages to compensate for uncertainty about productivity). We also should

expect to see increased turnover of members of this group during their proba-

tionary periods. The limited data cited earlier suggest that dismissals are

currently concentrated among   low—skilled workers in casual employment relation-
ships and it seems ironic that the very group that It is hoped would be pro-

tected by the policy change, would be the group that would appear to bear most

of the cost of the change.

     It is also not clear what the effect of moving further away from an

employment—at—will policy would be on the level of unionization in the economy.

European nations are much more heavily unionized than the United States and this

has allowed the unions to win through national legislation many things which

more typically would be part of collective bargaining agreements In the United

States. Limitations on the rights of employers to assign overtime and dismiss

workers are two examples. Strong national unions led to these policies in

Europe, not visa ersa.

    Some people argue that limitations on employment—at—will in the United

States would be a pro—union policy. They argue that unions have the skills to

represent nonunion workers in cases involving unjust dismissals and that

nonunion employers'resistance to unions would diminish if nonunion workers

legislatively were granted the protection that union contracts often provide.
                                        —18—


Hence, passage of such legislation might stimulate the growth of unions. Others

argue, however, that legislative provision of this protection would decrease the

demand for union services and hence would hurt unions.

       A careful econometric study using data on unionization rates by state

during the 1964—1980 period found that the adoption by state judiciary of

implicit contract exceptions to the employment—at—will doctrine seemed to be

associated with a decline in unionization rates, suggesting that passage of

national legislation would have an adverse effect on unions.43 However, while

unions tend not to place the issue of employment—at—will high on their legisla-

tive agendas and have not actively lobbied for the passage of unjust discharge

protection   bills at the state level, in general they have   been supportive of

such   legislation.44   This is not the first time that econometric evidence on the

effects of labor market legislation on union growth has had little effect on the

positions unions take with respect to the legislation.45



IV. Comparable Worth

       Some two decades after the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title

VII of the 1964 CIvil Rights Act, which together prohibit (among other things)

sex discrimination in wages on any given job and sex discrimination in access to

employment opportunities, it is still common to observe that on average females

earn less than males, females are distributed across occupations in a quite

different manner than males, and earnings in occupations that are dominated by

females tend to be lower than earnings in those dominated by males, even after

one controls for traditional proxies for productivity.47 The frustrations

generated by these outcomes have led to pressure for the adoption of the

principle of comparable worth, a principle that at least one participant in the

debate has called "the women's issue of the 1980s."48
                                      —19—


     Put in simplest terms, proponents of comparable worth assert that jobs

within a firm can be valued in terms of the skill, effort, and responsibility

they require, as well as the working conditions they offer. Two jobs would be

said to be of comparable worth to a firm if they were comparable in terms of

these characteristics. The principle of comparable worth asserts that within a

firm, jobs that are of comparable worth to the firm should receive equal

compensation.

     While some efforts to implement comparable worth have taken place in the

private sector, the major push for comparable worth has occurred in the state

and local government sector.49 By the mid 1960s over a dozen states had passed

comparable worth legislation covering state employees, although these laws were

rarely enforced. Starting with a 1974 State of Washington study, a number of

states have undertaken formal job evaluation studies to see how their compensa-

tion systems mesh with the principle of comparable worth.5° In several cases,

this has led to "voluntary" implementation of comparable worth through the

legislative and collective bargaining processes (e.g., Minnesota, Connecticut,

New York), or to court ordered implementation (Washington).51 By the summer of

1985, over a dozen states had begun the process of implementing some form of

comparable iorth in their employees' compensation systems.

     Comparable worth initiatives have also been undertaken at the local level

in over 50 cities, counties, and school districts. Many of these units are in

the states of California, Minnesota and Washington. Comparable worth wage

adjustments were implemented in San Jose, California after a well—publicized

strike of municipal employees over the size of the adjustments and the publicity

this strike received undoubtedly influenced the spread to other California

units. Minnesota passed a law in April 1984 requiring political subdivisions to

do job evaluations and then to revise their compensation structure in accord
                                      —20—


with comparable worth. Finally, the early Washington comparable worth study

mentioned above attracted attention to the issue in that state.

     At the federal level, hearings on comparable worth have been conducted by

several Congressional committees.52 While support for the principle has been

espoused by some Congressional Democrats, in 1985 the U.S. Civil Rights Commis-

sion and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, both dominated by

Reagan administration appointees, each came out against comparable worth.53

     Once again we can consider a simple stylized competitive labor market model

to understand the cases for and against comparable worth.54 In a competitive

labor market a firm hires employees In an occupation or job category until the

category's marginal product equals its real wage. A category's marginal product

represents Its "worth" to an employer. However, this is not necessarily fixed

over time, but rather depends upon the number of employees hired in the category

and all other job categories, the quantity of capital available to employees to

work with, the production technology, and the quality of employees in the

various job categories. The worth of a job then can not be determined indepen-

dent of the qualifications of its incumbents and may well change over time.

This suggests that job evaluation surveys cannot be a one—shot event, but rather

must be constantly updated; the worth of a job to an employer is not necessarily

constant over time.55

    Now move to the level of the labor market as a whole. The aggregation of

individual firm's demand curves for each occupation leads to market demand

curves for the occupation. The supply of labor to each occupation/job category

will depend upon workers' qualifications, the pecuniary and nonpecuniary forms

of compensation every job offers and the distribution of preferences across

workers for the various jobs. If there are no barriers to occupational mobil-

ity, a worker will move between jobs until the "net advantage" he or she
                                      —21—


perceives from each is equalized. Such movements lead to an equilibrating

structure of occupational wage differentials; this depends upon the distribution

of workers' qualifications and "tastes" for the various jobs.

     In this stylized competitive world, all of the factors that comparable

worth advocates believe should affect wages (skill, effort, responsibility, and

working conditions) would affect wages, since these factors would influence the

underlying supply and demand schedules. However, the weight the market would

place on each factor in determining wages would reflect the entire distribution

of employees' tastes for, and employers' valuation of, each factor, not neces-

sarily the weight assigned by a job evaluation scheme. Put another way, If

workers have heterogeneous preferences with respect to various nonpecuniary

conditions of employment, the relative wage each occupation would pay would

depend upon employers' relative demands for the various occupations. Job

characteristics would not be the only determinant of wages.56

     If in such a world females clustered into lower—paying occupations than

males who had comparable productivity related characteristics (e.g., education),

this would reflect only systematic differences in tastes between males and

females for the nonpecuniary characteristics offered by the various jobs. For

example, married females with children might have strong preferences for jobs

that do not require travel, long hours, or work that must be brought home in the

evenings. Given their preferences, males and females would have made optimal

career choices and no government intervention would be required.

    Of course, this conclusion presupposes the validity of the assumptions of

the model and there are a number that proponents of comparable worth seriously

challenge. The first is the assumption that there are no barriers to occupa-

tional mobility. If women are systematically excluded from high paying occupa-

tions, one cannot claim that the structure of earnings is the result of volun—
                                      —22—


tary choice. A market economist would respond that an appropriate long—run

remedy in this case would be to break down occupational barriers through actions

including rigorous enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. However,

such actions would provide only for gradual improvement of the welfare of the

discriminated against group, as they would have to wait for vacancies to occur

in the higher paying male jobs. In addition, for jobs that require training,

this policy would benefit primarily new entrants whose time horizons are

sufficiently long to enable them to profitably undertake the necessary training.

     In the absence of a policy that could 1) create "male" jobs for all

qualified females who want them, 2) identify the older women whom historic

discrimination prevented froni making different occupational choices early in

their lives and who now could not afford to profitably undertake the necessary

investment if the barriers to entry were broken, and 3) would provide resources

to these women now so that they could undertake the training, it could be argued

that a policy calling for comparable worth might make sense. Its justification

would be based on equity considerations; one would have to conclude that these

would outweigh any efficiency losses that might result. Sone of these losses

are discussed below.

     The second assumption challenged is that wages in female dominated occupa-

tions are determined in competitive markets. There is considerable evidence that

employers in some female dominated occupations, such as public school teachers

and hospital nurses, appear to have monopsony power.57 As is well—known, in

this circumstance there is a range over which one can"legislate" a higher wage

without suffering any employment loss. Whether the wage that would be set under

a comparable worth wage policy would fall in such a range cannot be determined a

priori and, in any case, the vast majority of females are not employed in these
                                      —23—


occupations. A remedy that insures that employers in these markets actively

compete for workers might make more sense than comparable worth.58

      The case for comparable worth thus seems to rest on the argument that the

current occupational distribution of female employees is based on discriminatory

barriers which existing legislation has not broken down. Even if one could

enforce these laws, breaking down barriers does not help experienced older

workers who have invested heavily in occupation—specific training and whose time

horizon is now too short to profitably undertake new occupational investments.

Comparable worth is one of several policies that could provide a remedy for

these workers.59 Whether it is a desirable policy depends upon one's percep-

tions of how the benefits it provides contrast with the efficiency losses it

Induces. Just as with one's perception about the value of the minimum wage,

given the trade—offs involved, ultimately one's position on comparable worth

must depend on value judgements.

     Assuming one wants to seriously consider comparable worth as a national

policy, there are a number of issues that must be addressed. First, there are a

host of questions relating to the usefulness of current job evaluation methods

for comparable worth studies. These include, but are not limited to, questions

of sex bias In describing or evaluating jobs, the question of which character-

istics should be valued, the statistical reliability of raters' evaluations, the

correlation of ratings under alternative job evaluation methods, and whether

market wages should be used in the determination of the'weights" different job

attributes should receive. There is considerable debate over these issues,

primarily by noneconomists, and the interested reader can pursue this debate

elsewhere. 60

     Second, supporters of comparable worth are quite explicit that the concept

is to apply to individual employers and that job evaluation schemes are to be
                                     —24—


establishment or firm—specific. This immediately suggests that, like many

other forms of protective wage legislation, comparable worth legislation would

have to have size class exemptions, because only relatively large firms would

have enough employees to meaningfully consider conducting formal job evalua-

tions. Comparable worth laws would apply then only to relatively large firms.

    Now to the extent that a comparable worth wage policy succeeded in raising

the wages of women in such large covered establishments, one might be tempted to

deem the policy to be a success. However, this ignores several market repercus-

sions that would occur.61 Employers in the covered sector would have an

incentive to substitute male employees for female employees; thus we should

observe a decline in female employment in this sector. To the extent that scale

effects outweigh substitution effects, a decline in male employment in the

covered sector should also occur. If these displaced male and female workers

seek employment in small firms in the noncovered sector, wages of both males and

females there would fall. Hence, while some women would gain (women who keep

their jobs In large firms In the covered sector), other women would lose (women

who lose their covered sector jobs and women Initially employed in small firms

in the noncovered sector). It is unclear whether women as a group, on balance,

would actually gain.

     In part, the answer depends upon the magnitude of the disemployment

effects. One study of Australia, where the implementation of a comparable worth

type system via wage tribunals saw the average female/male earnings ratio in the

economy rise from .61 to .76 over a five—year period, concluded that the policy

change decreased the rate of growth of female employment by 1.3 percent a

year.62 This was approximately one—third the actual rate of growth of female

employment during the period, so it represents a rather substantial decline.

The same study concluded that the female unemployment rate was about .5 percent
                                         —25—


higher at the end of the period, than it would have been in the absence of the

comparable worth policy.

     In the United States comparable worth wage policies are only beginning to

be implemented, and then primarily in the state and local sector. As a result,

estimated disemployment effects can be obtained only from simulations that use

estimated systems of demand curves for male and female employees to provide

estimates of male/female substitution as relative wages change. A detailed

study of the state and local sector concluded that a 20 percent comparable worth

wage adlustment for all females in the sector, would lead to only a 2 to 3

percent decline in female employment in the sector.63 While one might expect

gender substitution, and hence disemloyment effects, to be greater in the

private sector, existing studies of male/female substitutability in the private

sector are not sufficiently precise to allow one to draw this conclusion.64

     In part, the answer also depends on whether women are employed dispropor-

tionately in the covered (large firm)       or   noncovered (small firm) sectors, the

magnitude of the male/female wage differential in each sector, and the wage

differentials between sectors? If women are disproportionately employed in

small firms   with   large male/female wage differentials, which pay much less than

large firms, on balance women as a group may        lose   by the policy. While It is

well—established that wage levels vary by size class, evidence on the other

questions is only sketchy. One study did find, however, that the proportionate

representation of women in the U.S. manufacturing firms declines with establish-

ment size.65

     Furthermore, if comparable worth is a firm—specific policy, it will do

nothing to eliminate male/female wage differentials that exist because of

differences in the sex distribution of employees across Industries or across

size classes of establishments within an industry. To the extent that women are
                                      —26—


concentrated in low wage industries and/or low wage small firms, comparable

worth will have only a limited effect on the average male/female wage differen-

tial in the economy.66

     Of course, a comparable worth wage policy might have supply—side effects.

On the one hand, it would reduce the incentive females have to obtain training

for higher paying "male" occupations, since increasing the wage in "female"

occupations via comparable worth wage adjustments would reduce the return to

training Investments; this would lead to another efficiency loss. On the other

hand, such wage adjustments might increase the attractiveness of "female"

occupations to males and reduce the extent to which females were excluded from

ma1e" occupations, since the wage advantage in "male" jobs would be smaller or

no longer exist. We have no information on the likely magnitudes of these

responses, which further hinders our evaluation of such a policy.



V.   Plant Closing Legislation

     Most European nations have some form of legislation relating to plant

closings or large scale layoffs.67 Typically they call for, advanced notice by

employers and employer negotiations with employees and government over whether

the closing can be averted. Often they require severance pay for displaced

workers and some, for example Sweden, have detailed programs of labor market

services (retraining, placement, public works, wage subsidies) to facilitate

adjustments. Canada similarly requires advance notice. In many of these

countries small establishments with less than one—hundred employees are exempt

from the requirements, perhaps due to the greater failure rate of small busi-

nesses or the belief that a shut down of a small business does not have a

substantial effect on a community.
                                           —27—


        Plant closing legislation in the- United States is much more modest.68 As of

early 1985, there is no federal law and only four state laws. Two, Maine and

Wisconsin, require advance notice of plant shutdowns (with size class exemp-

tions), and Maine also requires one week's severance pay per year of service for

workers with greater than three years tenure. Connecticut, does not require

advanced notice, but does require nonbankrupt firms      to   maintain health insurance

and other benefits for workers unemployed by plant shutdowns for up to ninety

days. Massachusetts similarly requires maintenance of health insurance and

encourages, but    does   not require, advanced notice and severance pay.

        Interest in plant closing legislation in the United States has grown since

the deep recession of the taid—1970s and the relatively large number of plant

closings and permanent layoffs in major manufacturing industries since then,

undoubtedly stimulated this interest.69 During the 1975—83 period over 125

bills relating to plant closings were introduced in 30 states; the majority in

the northeast and midwest.71 More than ninety percent of these.bills had provisions

requiring advanced notice of shutdowns, while substantially smaller percentages.

required severance pay or economic assistance to either workers, employers,

local   governments,   or potential buyers.

     At the federal level, some 40 bills have been introduced into Congress

since 1979. The National Employment Priorities Act, first sponsored by Gerald

Ford and Walter Mondale in 1974, was active in Congress as HR 2847 in 1983 and,

if passed, would have required advance notice if over fifteen percent of

employees in- an establishment were expected to lose their jobs due to a plant

closing or relocation. Among its other provisions, it also called for severance

pay for displaced workers along with weekly income maintenance benefits while

they were unemployed for up to one year at eight—five percent of previous wages

(one hundred percent If a worker was enrolled in a training program), mairiten—
                                      —28—


 ance of all benefit and insurance plans, for the firm   to   pay relocation allow-

ances if jobs were available in other establishments it operated, and for the

firm to make payments for a year to the community in which the business was

located to compensate it for lost tax revenue.     A weaker form of the bill,

HR1616 was reported to the floor of the House in 1985. It required employers to

give 90 days advance notice of a plant shutdown or layoff involving at least 50

employees and for employers to consult with the employees or their union about

the potential displacement.

     Proponents of plant closing legislation argue that advance notice provi-

sions will ease displaced workers' shock and facilitate their search for alternative

sources of employment or training. Such notice also allows employers, workers

and the community to see if ways exist to save the jobs, such as wage conces-

sions, tax concessions, or seeking new ownership, including the possibility of

employee ownership. If plants do shut, the maintenance of health insurance

provide needed service for individuals during a period when stress leads to

increased incidence of physical and mental ailments.72 Finally payments by

firms to the communities in which the plants were located would help alleviate

the extra demands placed on these communities for social services that the

shutdowns cause; demands that would arise at the same time that local property

and sales tax revenue were being reduced.

     Opponents of the legislation argue that, in addition to restricting the

free mobility of capital, advance notice legislation would have a number of

other adverse effects on firms.73 They claim it would increase worker turnover

and decrease productivity, as those productive workers with the best oppor-

tunities elsewhere would leave and the morale of remaining workers would suffer.

It also would decrease the likelihood that buyers of the plant's product would

place new orders, that banks would supply new credit, that suppliers would
                                      —29—


continue to provide services, and that the firm could sell the plant to poten-

tial buyers. Finally, it would depress corporate stock prices. Such a provi-

sion, plus the others that directly increase the costs of plant shutdowns,

effectively increase the cost of reducing employment and thus should encourage

firms not to expand operation in states where such laws are in effect. Opponents

argue then that it is a self—defeating regional policy, in that, if adopted, it

would discourage creation of new jobs in snowbelt states.

     In evaluating the case for plant closing legislation, it is again useful to

stress the divergence between private and social costs. Employers currently do

not bear the full social costs of plant shutdowns, both because unemployment

insurance is imperfectly experience rated and because the costs these actions

impose on communities are not taken into account by them. As such, imposing a

"taX" on plant closings makes sense; it would have the effect of discouraging

the action. Of course, to avoid depressing new employment growth in snowbelt

states, the tax would have to be nationwide; critics have inadvertently sup-

ported the case for federal instead of state legislation.74

     Two additional points should be noted. First, the community effects of

worker displacement depend partially upon the number of jobs lost relative to

the size of the local labor market. In a given size market, it is hard to

ascertain what the differential effects on the community would be of an estab-

lishment with one hundred employees shutting down, of an establishment with one

thousand employees permanently laying off one hundred of them, or of one hundred

establishments each laying off one employee. Viewed this way, size class

exemptions under the law make less sense, as does the distinction between plant

shutdown and layoff. In addition, the costs the community faces for any given

displacement will be higher the smaller is the local labor market and the higher
                                        —30—


is the area unemployment rate. The latter suggests that the "tax per displaced

worker should increase as unemployment rates increase.

       Second, to say that employers should pay a "tax" on plant closings does not

necessarily imply that the revenue from this tax should go to displaced workers

in the form of severance pay, just as an increase in the tax on overtime should

not necessarily go to workers In the form of an increased overtime premium (see

Section II). However, if displaced workers' losses are greater than those

incurred by other unemployed workers covered by the unemployment insurance

system and If it can be shown that these losses were not already compensated for

by the market in the form of higher pre—uneiiiployment wages, a case for worker

compensation might be made on equity grounds.

       To understand the losses workers suffer from a plant shutdown or permanent

layoff, it is useful to again consider several simple competitive labor

market models. Consider initially the situation in which all skills are

perfectly general. In this case workers would accept jobs with an employer

whose risk of shutdown or permanent layoff were high only if they received a

wage   premium to compensate them for their lost earnings during the time they
expected to be unemployed searching for new employment. In   such a world, worker

losses would only be transitory, since their skills are assumed to be perfectly

general. Their post—unemployment wages might be less than their pre—unemploy—

merit wages, however this would reflect only that they had moved to less risky

jobs. This points out that a comparison of post— to pre—unemployment wages may

overstate   the permanent losses workers face.

       In fact, several studies suggest that labor markets do compensate workers

for their risk of unemployment; jobs with higher risk of subsequent unemploy-

ment, ceteris paribus, pay higher wages. While the provision of unemployment

insurance indicates that society believes that markets are not working per—
                                      —31—


 fectly, the same studies also suggest that as expected, higher unemployment

insurance benefits lead to smaller wage premiums for risk of unemployment.75

     Permanent losses for workers would occur, however, if workers had pre-

viously invested in firm—specific skills and they did not anticipate layoffs or

plant closings. In this situation, post—unemployment earnings would be less

than current earnings and no predisplacement wage differential would have arisen

to compensate these workers for the risk involved in their investments. When

industries reach a period of decline (e.g., auto and steel), it is likely that

potential new etnployees(to the extent that there are any) will be aware of the

risks and will demand wage premiums to compensate them. However, older workers

who invested decades earlier when times were good, would be "locked—in" to the

Industry because of the specificity of their skills and would receive no

compensating differentials.

     The notion that compensating wage differentials for risk of unemployment

will arise primarily for workers with relatively short job tenure has not been

tested. The study of mandatory overtime cited in Section II did find, however,

that compensating wage differentials for that unfavorable job characteristic

existed only for employees with less than three years tenure.76 To the extent

that this result carries over to risk of unemployment, permanent losses would be

suffered primarily by workers with long tenure. This Implies that severance pay

plans and job assistance programs for displaced workers should focus on workers

with relatively long tenure. As noted earlier, the Maine law requires three

years tenure for severance pay and then increases severance pay with experience.

Such a structure makes sense.77

    One must be aware, though, that since employers share the costs of invest-

ment iii firm-specific training, they also will share the losses from unantici-

pated (at the time of the training) plant closings. To make them pay for the
                                         —32—


above programs for senior workers with specific training would increase their

loses and discourage all employers from making future investments in firm—

specific training. To avoid this perverse incentive, in the presence of

specific training such programs might be funded out of general revenues.

       The situation would be very different, however, if employees worked in

structured internal labor markets where employers used upward sloping age—

earnings profiles to motivate increased attachment and productivity by employ-

ees.    As noted in Section III, in such a world workers are initially paid less

than   the marginal productIvity   but eventually are paid more. Over theIr expected

tenure with the firm they receive an expected present value of compensation

equal to their present value of productivity. Any unanticipated plant shutdown

would cause permanent losses for experienced workers and the employers would not

directly share in these losses. A       stronger case for program costs to be borne
directly   by the employer can be made in this case.

       The discussion so far has focused on losses that workers suffer after

displacement occurs. What about possible losses in the years prior to displace—'

ment?78 If employees anticipate forthcoming plant closings or layoffs, they

will cease their investments in firm—specific training and one should observe a

flattening in their age—earnings profiles prior to the displacement. In

contrast, if they fail to anticipate such displacements, they will continue

their investments and no such flattening will occur. In the later case, failure

by employers to provide workers with information that displacements were

forthcoming would have erroneously led workers to undertake investments that

were sure not to pay off. In fact, one careful study of displaced workers found

that the slope of age—earnings profiles did tend to flatten prior to displace-

ment for permanently laid—off workers but did not for workers involved in plant
                                           —33—


 shutdowns. Apparently layoffs tend to be anticipated, while plant shutdowns are

 not.

        The above finding provides a further rationale for advance notice for plant

 closing (but not for layoffs) legislation; it would provide incentives for
 workers not to make wasted investments in firm—specific training. Other

 empirical evidence provides additional support for the policy. One Study in
Maine    found   that advanced notice did appear to speed up labor market adjustments

to plant closings; area unemployment rates peaked earlier in situations where

advanced notice took place, although long—run unemployment rates were not

affected.8° Another early study of thirty—two plant closings found that advance

notice of closings rarely led to inc!-eased quit rates or decreased produc-

tivity.8' To further protect against these things occurring, the receipt of

severance pay and/or job assistance programs could be restricted to employees

who remained with the plant until it shut down; this in fact is done in Maine.

Finally, it is estimated that over the last decade advanced notice permitted

about 60 cases of employee ownership to arise to avert plant shutdowns; these

'saved about 50,000 jobs and in only four or five cases did the firm subse-

quently go out of business.82

        One should caution, however, that a study of the earnings loss displaced

workers suffer found that advanced notice provisions did not appear to reduce

earnings loss.83 The policy may aid worker transitions but it does not seem to

affect their long—run prospects. More generally, this and other studies

concluded that workers with high education levels and general skills suffer only

small earnings losses from labor market displacement.84 In contrast, unionized

workers in heavy manufacturing industries (e.g., steel and auto) suffer substan-

tial earnings loses, 25 percent plus, in the first two years after displacement

and still have annual losses in the range of 10 to 15 percent after six years.
                                     —34—


Given estimated wage differentials paid to union workers of at least this

amount, it is difficult to say how much of this loss merely represents that

dissipation of union rent. Finally, workers in less heavily unionized indus-

tries with higher rates of turnover, and where long—term attachment of workers

to firms is less prevalent, and less specific training occurs, suffer some

short—run losses but virtually no long—run losses.

    A number of studies also indicate that older workers, women, and workers

with long tenure suffer the greatest losses from displacement.85 Earnings

losses also appear to be higher when area unemployment rates are high and in

relatively small labor market areas.86 These findings further support the

notion that labor market adjustment policies should be targeted.on. older workers

and that resource allocation formulas should have area unemployment rate

triggers, as various training and extended unemployment insurance benefit

programs have had in the past.

     These earnings losses estimates do not take account of the effects of

existing income replacement programs, such as unemployment insurance and trade

adjustment assistance. In cases where displaced workers were eligible for trade

adjustment assistance, first year net income losses were substantially re-

duced.87 However, these benefits did not appear to affect long-run net income

losses and they did appear to increase displaced workers' duration of unemploy

tnent.88 To speed up the process of labor market readjustment, any plan that

proposes that compensation be paid to displaced workers probably should call for

lump sum payments, rather than weekly benefits while unemployed.

     So far the discussion has ignored the role of unions. Workers covered by

collective bargaining in the United States have some protection against plant

closings. Employers must bargain with unions over the effects of plant closings

(e.g., severance pay, pension recall and transfer rights, seniority), although
                                            —35—


 they are under no obligation to bargain over the decision to close.89 If a

 union wants certain rights, such as advance notice of anticipated closings, they

 must win it at the bargaining table. Moreover, the recent Milwaukee Springs II

 decision by the National Labor Relations Board affirms employers' rights to

 transfer work from union plants to nonunion plants to avoid high union wages

 during the course of a contract unless the language in the contract
                                                                               specifically
prohibits it.9°

       A recent survey of provisions relating to plant closing provisions in major

collective bargaining agreements (agreements covering one thousand or more
workers) found that over one—third contained some provisions relating to worker

participation in decisions about the effects of plant closing or relocation

decisions, with severance pay provisions being the most common.91 However, only

slightly more than ten percent of these contracts called for advanced notice.92

Presumably coverage in smaller agreements is less extensive.

       While   union   protection against plant      closings   thus seems limited, it must
be remembered that one important                 play is to acquire information and
                                       role unions

to counicate        it   to members on the true economic conditions of the firms at
which they     work. The   study   of the changes in the steepness of age—earnings

profiles prior to plant closings or layoffs discussed above            also found that the
profiles   became flatter for union members.93 Apparently they better anticipated

labor market displacement than nonunion workers, and thus were less likely to

make   wasted   investments in firm—specific training. Furthermore, while there is

not yet evidence that unions win larger compensating wage differentials for

anticipated plant shutdowns or layoffs than the market produces for nonunion

workers, there is a growing body of      literature    relating to other unfavorable job

characteristics that suggests larger compensating differentials arise in the
                                         —36—


union sector.94 As with overtime hours and mployment—atwill legislation, the

major need for plant closing legislation may well be in the nonunion sector.

      Finally, it must be stressed that whatever form plant closing legislation

takes it is subject to problems relating to bankruptcy and noncompliance. Almost

by definition bankrupt firms will not have the resources to fund benefits for

displaced workers and in the absence of substantial penalties for noncom-

pliance, incentives for compliance are limited. If the goal is to aid both

communities and displaced workers in a timely fashion, it           seems clear that

public    insurance of provision of benefits may be required in these cases. This
leads logically to the notion of a "Plant Shutdown Benefit Guarantee Corpora-
tion," which might be financed in an analogous manner to the Pension Benefit
Guarantee   Corporation.


VI. Concluding Remarks
      This paper has focused on four areas in which protective labor legislation
might be expanded     in the United States over the next decade, specifically the

areas   of hours of work, unjust dismissal,     comparable worth, and plant shutdowns.

In   each case I   have tried to provide a rationale for government intervention, to

discuss  if empirical evidence supports this rationale, to discuss potential
unintended side effects of the proposed policy changes that are relevant for

employment    policy, and to discuss how proposed legislation might be structured.

Space and time constraints have precluded my consideration of a number of other

areas of likely expansion, including disability, retirement income, and occupa-

tional safety and health policies.

        Several themes emerge from the paper that are worth mention. First, the

case for legislation and the appropriate form that legislation should take often

depend crucially on the empirical nature of labor markets. Are workers who are
                                        —37—


 required to work overtime compensated in the form of higher wages? Do unjustly

 dismissed workers typically suffer permanent losses? Do wage differentials by

 gender arise because of occupational barriers? Have displaced workers who

invested in firm—specific skills been compensated for risk of displacement by

 the market? Do wage profiles slope upward because of firm—specific training or

life—cycle incentive compensation arrangements? We unfortunately don't have

answers to some of these questions; they are required to design policies in the

areas discussed above.

     Second, unionized workers, both directly through the collective bargaining

process and Indirectly through winning wage differentials to compensate them for

unfavorable job characteristics, appear to have much more protection in many of

these areas than do nonunion employees. The major beneficiaries of legislation

In these areas would be nonunion workers. While strong protective labor

legislation and strong unions coexist overseas, one wonders if the growth of

protective labor legislation in the United States would decrease the demand for

unions and further reduce the share of the workforce that is organized.

     Third,    there are reasons to propose size class exemptions in each of the
above areas.    However, such exemptions stratify employment into a covered (large

establishment) Sector with "good" working conditions and a noncovered (small

establishment) sector with "poorer" conditions. The workers most in need of

protection may well be employed in smaller establishments; the design of the

legislation may frustrate its objectives.

     Finally, it is worth restressing that what is seen as worker protection by

some, is seen as sources of economic inefficiency by others.96 While I have

tried to articulate many of the benefits and costs of proposed policies, and to

suggest in several places ways to minimize the costs, ultimately decisions about
                                     —38—


these policies will have to involve much more explicit value judgements than are

presented here.

majority of their members are lawyers who are comfortable with the standards

approach.

     10. Initial drafts of the legislation established outright prohibitions of

long hours. The idea of instituting a penalty for overtime instead apparently

arose only as a compromise during the late stages of the debate. See Paulsen

(1959), Phelps (1930), and Grossman (1978) for legislative histories of the

FLSA).

     11. Hundreds of court decisions handed down since the FLSA was enacted

confirm that Congress had the dual intent of inducing employers to reduce hours

of work and increase employment and of compensating employees for the burden of

(1983), and Stieber and Murray (1983). A search of on—line data bases turned up
almost 100 articles on the topic, primarily in law journals, during the 1981—84
period.

ment were much lower in highly unionized New York State than they were in four

relatively low unionized southern states.

      One must, of course, interpret these data with caution. One cannot

distinguish whether these differences are due to the protection unions give to

workers or to differences in the characteristics of workers (e.g., skilled or

unskilled) or of jobs (e.g., structured internal labor market         with   premiums    paid
for   a stable workforce or casual unstable jobs) between the union and nonunion

sector.

      24. Stieber (1984). Three statesr—California, Massachusetts and Montana——

also have "good faith and fair dealing" exceptions which hold that while an

employee may   be   dismissed without   cause,   he or she must be dealt with   fairly   and

in good faith. So, for example, firing an employee to avoid having to pay a

commission on a large     sale would fall under the exemption.

      25. Stieber (1984).

      26. The federal legislation, HR 7010, the Corporate Democracy Act was

introduced in 1980 by Congressman Rosenthal. It defined "just cause" and

prohibited employees    from being fired without just cause, as well as specified
social policy exceptions to      the   employment—at—will doctrine. This bill died in

committee. At the state level California and four other states are currently

considering legislation to prohibit unjust dismissal (Business Week (1985)).

employment and earn specified amounts before they become eligible for UI

benefits   during future spells of unemployment. All'of the above penalties are
for cases of   "simple misconduct;" in cases of "gross misconduct" harsher

penalties are often imposed.

     40. Such a policy would be less generous to workers tian the policies in

some European nations, where compensation for unjust discharge is often awarded

in addition to unemployment insurance benefits. See Stieber and Blackburn

(1983), p. 70, for some examples.

     41. For evidence on the extent of imperfect experience rating in the UI

system and its effects on temporary layoffs, see Topel (1983).

of employment from protection under unjust dismissal laws. See Stieber (198Oa).

     43. Neumann and Rissman (1984). No similar relationship was found for

adoption of "public policy" exceptions .     This result is to be expected, the
latter exception does not relate to the services unions provide.

        45. For example, a long literature on the effects of state right—to—work

laws for the most part suggest they have little effect on the level of union-

ization or union organizing success, yet unions place repeal of these laws high

on their legislative agenda. See Ehrenberg and Smith (1985), P. 376, for

citations to this literature..

        49. Explanations for why this occurred include that public decision makers

are more likely to be swayed by public opinion calling for such policies than

are private profit maximizing firms and that increases in female wages in the

public sector caused by comparable worth wage adjustments are likely to lead to

only small employment losses because the demand for public employees is likely

to be inelastic. I discuss the evidence on the latter point below.

function of years of service in the occupation. This would have the advantage

of making the size of the remedy a function of the magnitude of the loss and

would not reduce employment of women in the occupation.
