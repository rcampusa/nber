                                         ABSTRACT

The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s was a unique event. The immigration wave was
distinctive for its large high skilled cohort, and its quick integration into the domestic labor
market. Immigration also changed the entire economic landscape: it raised productivity,
underpinned by the information technological surge, and had significant impact on income
inequality. The extraordinary experience of Israel, which has received three quarter million
migrants from the Former Soviet Union within a short time, is also relevant for the current debate
about winners and losers from immigration. This paper provides a rigorous explanation for a
possible link between the immigration wave and the changed level of redistribution in Israel’s
welfare state.

1. Introduction


Globalization is currently facing some challenging political tests, more than in past decades.

Migration is the core of the emerging economic nationalism, which threatens to tear off

international integration developments. Jeff Sachs (2017) puts it succinctly when he says: “If

people were told that they could move, no questions asked, probably a billion would shift around

the planet within five years, with many coming to Europe and the US. No society would tolerate

even a fraction of that flow. Any politician who says, ‘let’s be generous,’ without saying ‘we’re

not going to let the doors stand wide open’ will lose.” The core of the wall-building coalition in

the United States consists of white males with low educational attainment. Low-income citizens

were also far more likely to support Brexit in the United Kingdom. Evidently, rational and

generous policy that also resonates politically will not eliminate national borders altogether.

Rather, immigration policy may elicit economic-social based arguments for limits on the flow of

migrants. The argument for a “points-based” immigration system is an explicit call to increase

the skill composition of UK immigrants. However, because there are no barriers put on Israel by

the Law of Return, Israel not only enables free immigration but also grants returnees immediate

citizenship, regardless of origin and skill. For an economist, it is like a laboratory experiment of

how free migration can function without noneconomic forces and anti-migration sentiments

which drive barriers for immigration.


Over the long history, demographic trends often shift the balance of politics among ethnic

groups, economic classes and age groups. However, the assimilation of immigrants in the

electoral system in Israel has been relatively robust; and ,therefore, the change in the political

balance was substantial. Recall that Israel’s Law of Return grants returnees immediate


1
citizenship and consequently voting rights. An early study by Avner (1975) finds that the voting

turnout rate of new immigrants was markedly lower than that of the established population. This

means that immigrants did not fully exercise their voting rights and did not therefore influence

the political economy equilibrium in Israel as much as the established population. However, a

later study conducted by Arian and Shamir (2002) about voting turnout patters of new

immigrants to Israel in the 2001 elections reverses the earlier finding, the new immigrants in this

study are predominantly from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Arian and Shamir find no marked

difference in voting turnout rates between the new immigrants and the established population.

Immigrants’ voting is key to understanding the political-economy mechanism that determines

income distribution and redistribution (see Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2002 a, b).


Generally speaking, migration differs from the movement of other factor inputs (such as capital

flows) in one fundamental way. Migrants become part of the society of the receiving country,

including its evolving culture and politics. 1 A highly developed social welfare system in the

receiving country may greatly complicate matters, as emphasized by Razin, Sadka and Swagel

(2002b). A related issue is the implications of ageing population for the size of the welfare state;

see Razin, Sadka, and Suwankiri (2011). While high skilled and therefore high-wage migrants

may be net contributors to the fiscal system, low skilled migrants are likely to be net recipients,

thereby imposing an indirect tax on the taxpayer of the receiving country. Sooner or later, then,

migrants may shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic classes, or age groups,

and reshape the distribution of wealth and disposable income, That is, immigrants influence the

2
size of the welfare state directly through the electoral system, and indirectly, through their effect

on market based inequality.


The organization of the paper is as follows. Section 2, provides a background to Israel’s unique

immigration story. Section 3 discusses migrant’s high-skill characteristics. Section 4 addresses

the unique assimilation story of the immigrants from the Former Soviet Union. Section 5

develop a political economic theory to shed light on the inequality consequences of the

immigration from the Former Soviet Union. Section 6 concludes.


2. Historical Background


Immigration has far-reaching economic and social consequences. These include the labor market,

international trade, economic growth, the social and political structure, etc. (see, e.g., Lucas (2014)

for a recent treatise), as has long been known. Between 1990 and 2012, almost 20m people moved

from Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe to richer countries in Western Europe, about 8

percent of the population of Europe. This east-west migration accelerated after 2004 when eight

eastern European countries, including Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, joined the EU.

At the same time, Israel received almost 1m immigrants, about 20 percent of Israel’s population.

In both episodes migration borders restrictions were eased. Both in the Israeli case and within the

EU’s borders is the free movement of people tied to the free movement of trade and capital.

However, key differences between the two episodes, in addition to the relative size of the flow of

migrants, are in the skill levels of the immigrants and the migrant-absorption policies that the

receiving countries embraced.


The unique experience of Israel is vastly different for continuing of the globalization effort, not

only from the recent experience in Europe, but also from the US experience. The core of the “wall-

3
building” coalition in the US is white males with low educational attainment. Low income British

were far more likely to support Brexit in the UK. The call for a “points based” immigration system

from the Brexit campaign was an explicit call to increase the skill composition of UK immigrants.

How does one explain the recent anti-immigration sentiment by a simple argument based on first

principles? Low-skilled immigrants compete for low skill native-born jobs, and depress their

wages. Furthermore, low-skilled immigrants are also more likely to be net beneficiaries from the

typically generous welfare state- the burden of which low-skilled workers share. In contrast, high-

skill immigrants may increase the productivity of the low-skilled population and are net fiscal

contributors, making them a more attractive form of immigration. Low-skill segment of the

destination-country established population. Therefore, net fiscal burden underpins the discontents

with immigration. It would tilt the composition of immigration toward high-skilled workers. Other

groups are more likely to gain from low-skilled immigration. They increase the wages of high-

skill workers and do not necessarily impose a fiscal burden on retirees, who no longer fund the

welfare state. Therefore high skill workers support the globalization course that advanced

economies have taken until the more recent wave of anti-immigration sentiment. In Israel, as we

will see, the political-economy major effect of the 1990s-early 2000s migration wave is on income

inequality through the downsizing of the welfare state. However, partly because of the successful

integration, no significant anti-migration sentiments emerged.


The exodus of Soviet Jews to Israel in the 1990s, especially its impacts on income inequality and

the political balance of power vivifies Lucas’s findings.2 Israel is well known for the unique ways

it absorbs immigrants; who in turn tend to arrive in waves triggered by external shocks. Each wave

has its unique origin, distribution of skills, and often socio-economic characteristics. Thus, the

exodus of Soviet Jews in the 1990s adds useful insights into this ongoing experiment.


The importance of the Soviet Jewish exodus is best appreciated when one thinks in historical

perspective. Immigration to the pre-state Palestine and to the state of Israel came in waves from

the late 19th century onwards. 3 During the pre-state era (prior to 1948), immigration was at times

controlled by the British rulers. 4 However, immigration was free, and even encouraged, under the

umbrella of the “Law of Return”. Table 2.1 suggests that immigration at times, especially in the

nascent statehood and in the last wave from the Former Soviet Union (FSU) constitutes about 20%

of the established population.

Soviet-Jew immigration of the 1990s stands out from previous waves both because of its sheer

volume and because the economic motivation. The choice, albeit limited by immigration

restrictions of the advanced countries in the West: Australia, Canada, Germany, was between Israel

and the rest, and US. In fact for a portion of would be immigrants, Israel was a second- choice.


The disunion of the Soviet Union and the destruction of communism in the USSR 1987-1991

triggered the recent wave of Soviet Jews (Figure 1) to various parts of the world, including Israel.

All the migrant-destinations are controlled by the migration policies of the receiving countries,

except Israel. Immigration into Israel is free by the Law of Return.

The primary driver of Jewish exodus from Russia 1990-1996 was the Soviet Union’s and

subsequently Russia’s economic collapse, often-dubbed “katastroika”. The Jewish community

sensed the pain, anticipated the danger and fled for this compelling reason, but also due to the twin

threats of a military coup d’tat and civil war. Both the demise of the Soviet Union and the following

exodus in a macroeconomic jargon is a supply side shock, which triggers sizeable migration flows.

The communist regime inaugurated a liberalization campaign in the political (“demokratizatsiya”),

economic (“perestroika”), social and international spheres (“novoe myshlenie”) that expanded

opportunities of many, including the Soviet Jews to increase their welfare. 5 However, they were

legally barred from leaving the country until the complete demise of the regime. The prospect of

brighter tomorrows in more stable and advanced , reinforced by mounting political, social and

economic turmoil which raised the risk of civil war, created the specter of a military coup d'etat,

threatened economic collapse.


The Soviet-Union economy ceased growing in 1989 and then plummeted nearly 10 percent in 1990

as enterprise managers focused on privatizing state assets to themselves (“spontaneous

privatization”), liquidating them and transferring balances abroad instead of dedicating them to

current operations. Inter-industrial supplies, the backbone of modern economies were shattered

because managers ignored their contractual obligations to intermediate input users.


This was shock therapy in action without Sachs’s conditionality. 6 In theory, Soviet managers who

had no experience designing and marketing products to satisfy consumer demand were expected



5
  The first hint came in the enterprise reform law of January 1988, which allowed state enterprise managers to use
company funds at their discretion instead of complying strictly with central plans (“tekhpromfinplans”). Soon
thereafter, central plans ceased being obligatory. The stated intention of the enterprise reform law was to give
managers more latitude in dealing with day-to-day operations, but the opportunity to divert funds from operations
and investment to personal consumption and round-a-about insider privatization was not missed (“kleptostroika”).

to transform themselves into efficient competitors under duress. However, they could not do it.

The reality was an economic depression that caused GDP to fall between 37 and 50 percent

between 1989 and 1998. 7 Full economic recovery has not been achieved until 2006.


The Soviet Union’s crumbling sphere of influence in Central Europe and East Germany, together

with the successful secession of the Baltic States alerted the Russian Jewish community to the

wisdom of carpe diem. A window of opportunity had opened, and Jewish emigres of the 1990s

chose to seize the day. Migration waves and growth: bird’s eye


One of the most distinctive features associated with the Aliah waves is the high rates of economic

growth. 8 See Table 2.

Table 2 indicates that the Alyiah produced massive investments, both in residential structures and

in non-residential capital. These investments were so substantial that they increased the capital to

labor ratio and facilitated economic growth. In some cases further aided by the remarkable human

capital brought by the olim. Except for the olim who came during the major wave of Aliyah

immediately after the birth of the state of Israel, the education level of the olim generally exceeded

that of the established population and thus contributed remarkably to overall productivity. It is also

noteworthy that in general the massive investments in physical capital and infrastructures were

financed by capital imports (reflected in persistent current account deficit), as the olim themselves

fled their former homes almost penniless and credit constrained so that they hardly saved. Table

2.3 shows, for instance, that during the years 1922-31, when the number of olim each year was

about 9.5 percent of the established population, output increased at the whopping rate of about

9
16.4% per annum, so that output per capita increased by a remarkable 7.8 % per annum. Similarly,

during the years 1950-51, when the percentage of olim each year amounted to about 26.1% of the

established population, output increased by about 10% per annum. During the years 1952-63, when

the percentage of olim each year amounted to about 19.4%, output growth was steady, 4.9 percent

per anuum. In this period, capital stock growth rate was 12.8 % and housing stock by 11.6 percent-

- a whopping investment boom. In contrast, during the years 1972-82, when the percentage of olim

each year amounted to about 7.6 output per capita rose by the meager rate of 0.8 % per annum

(obviously, the oil price shock cum Yom Kippur War depressed output growth). In the later years,

output growth was a declining trend the percentage of olim each year amounted to 16.5%, output

growth was meager 2.5 percent per anuum.


Obviously, Table 2 is only suggestive for the role played by immigration and the massive

investment, which accompanied its big waves, in growing the economy. Evidently, the statistics

in Table 2.3 reflect the effects of business cycle fluctuations, external shocks, military conflicts,

and the like, in addition to the migration waves.


     3. Migrant Characteristics


The professional, social, attitudinal and behavioral characteristics of the 1990s Jewish exodus

cohort proved to be distinctive. Immigrants came mostly from urban areas, with advanced

education systems. Their skill (education) composition is heavily skewed towards high education

levels; skewness in their relatively higher labor income (see Table 3). Their share in the population

was sizable - 14.5%. Their average family size (2.32 standard persons) was lower than the national

average (2.64 standard persons). This indicates fewer dependents. Most important was their higher




10
education level and consequently their higher labor income. The average number of schooling

years of the new immigrants was 14.0, compared to the national average of only 13.3.

Even more striking was the percentage of heads of the households with bachelor degrees: 41.1%

among the new immigrants, compared to a national average of just 29.5%. The higher education

level and the lower family size can presumably explain the income gap: the average labor income

per standard person of the new immigrants was NIS 4,351, compared to a national average of only

NIS 4,139. Noteworthy, this gap existed even though the new immigrants had lower work seniority

than the established population.

The educational achievement figures of the immigrants from the FSU are impressive compared to

the EU-15. Relying on data from the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and the

OECD, Razin and Sadka (2014) report that only 18% of the stock of immigrants in the EU-15 in

1990 and 24% in 2000 had tertiary education.


            4. Assimilation Story: Catching Up


Cohen and Hsieh (2001) show that average effective wages of native Israelis fell and the return to

capital increased during the height of the influx in 1990 and 1991. By 1997 however, both average

wages and the return to capital had returned to pre-immigration levels due to an investment boom

induced by the initial increase in the return to capital. As predicted by the standard intertemporal

model of the current account 10, the investment boom was largely financed by external borrowing.

Furthermore, despite the high educational levels of the Russian immigrants, the Russian influx did

not lower the skill-premium of native Israelis. They explain this effect by the rise in Total Factor

Productivity during the 1990s relative to stunningly low productivity increase through much of the

1970s and 1980s. Eckstein and Weiss (2004) develop a descriptive methodology for the analysis

of wage growth of immigrants that is based on human capital theory. The sources of the wage

growth are (1) the rise of the return to imported human capital, (2) the impact of accumulated

experience in the host country, and (3) the mobility up the occupational ladder in the host country.

Using data on established Israelis and immigrants from the former Soviet Union of Israel, they

estimate Mincer-type wage equations jointly for the two groups. They find that in the ten years

following arrival, wages of highly skilled immigrants grow at 8 percent a year. Rising return to

skills, occupational transitions, accumulated experience in Israel, and an economy-wide rise in



10
     See Razin (1995).

12
wages account for 3.4, 1.1, 1.5, and 1.5 percent each. They do not reject the hypothesis that the

return for experience converges to that of natives and that immigrants receive a higher return for

their unmeasured skills. We find that there is some downgrading in the occupational distribution

of immigrants relative to that of the established work force.


The second generation of Jews, whose parents immigrated from the former Soviet Union (FSU),

experienced significantly higher upward mobility than all other ethnic groups. As documented by

Aloni (2017), although the general association with parents' incomes within the FSU group is not

very different compared to the population, their mobility relative to the national distribution is

high, and the second generation finds its way even to the top percentiles. Table 3.1 shows the

estimated probability of second generation outranking first generation in the full sample, and the

groups’ relative income rank convergence rates. Having higher probability to outrank parents

highly depends on the relative income position of the group in the population’s income

distribution, thus, for example, Ethiopian and Arab children exhibit high upward mobility.

However, controlling for their initial position, former Soviet Union (FSU) immigrants to Israel

experienced the highest pace of upward mobility, while other groups converged to the mean

slower.

Upward mobility is also indicated in Figure 2. The Figure shows the distribution of children of

parents from the bottom decile. Comparing the FSU immigrants and the general population, the

former experienced a greater upward mobility, with children reaching higher earning ranks,

dispersing more evenly across the deciles.

These documented facts that the FSU group has higher upward mobility, along with the fact that

the Israeli-Arab group experienced slower upward mobility, may increase inequality. This is

because the FSU first generation immigrants’ income is high compared to the population, while

Israeli-Arab families have a lower income mean.


     4.2 Inequality


Israel’s fast development, facilitated by the integration into the world economy, and the inflow of

high skill immigrants, came at a cost of growing income inequality, measured by both as market-

based and redistribution-based Gini coefficients. Currently, Israel, along with the US and UK are




15
at the top of market-forces generated inequality; and they do less than other OECD countries to

reduce the inequality through the redistribution of income. 11 See Figure 5.3.

To gauge the size of income redistribution one can subtract the market based Gini coefficient from

the disposable income Gini coefficient. Israel’s relatively high market-based inequality coefficient,



11
   See Gornick and Jantti (2014) for a comprehensive report on income inequality and redistribution among rich
countries. Krugman (2006) argues that to the extent that globalization explains rising income inequality in the
United States, it is through the effect of international trade on the “skill premium”, the gap between the incomes of
college-educated workers and those without a college degree. What we know, however, is that rising inequality is
not mainly about the rising skill premium. Only around a third of the rise in US inequality over the past generation is
associated with a rising premium for education. Economic estimates indicate that the widening of the skill premium
itself is more a result of “skill-biased technological change”, a growing demand for highly educated workers due to
the rising importance of information technology, than a result of globalization.



16
shown in Figure 4 , is driven by the large, and increasing, share of two relatively poor minority

groups in the population: Ultra-orthodox Israeli Jews (primarily males), and the Israeli Arabs

(primarily females 12), stay out of the labor force. The rise in the share of these groups in the total

population is because the fertility rates among these minorities are much higher than the other

groups in the population 13 In addition, the emergence of highly educated, economically active

large group of Israelis, reinforced by the high skill immigration of Soviet Jews, made the upper

tail of the distribution thicker. Israel is not an outlier in the OECD countries with respect to the

market-driven (pre-tax-cum-transfer) income inequality. However, Figure 5 indicates the time

dimension of inequality. Disposable-income inequality in Israel was roughly stable until the

beginning of the 1990s, rose sharply thereafter, even though no such change occurs with respect

to the market-generated inequality. Israel’s level of redistribution of income falls short of many

other OECD countries. A partial resolution of the issue, proposed by Razin, Sadka, and Swagel

(2002), hinges on the political-economy effects of a rise in the dependency ratio. On the one hand,

a higher dependency ratio means a larger pro-tax coalition, as the low income groups are net-

beneficiary of the transfers from those who actively participate in the labor market. On the other,

a higher dependency ratio puts a higher tax burden on the people around the median voter, as it is

necessary to ﬁnance transfers to a larger share of the population. People for whom the costs of



12
   Yashiv and Kasir (2011) write: “The most prominent phenomenon among Arab women is the high level of
variation in the rate of participation. Its source apparently lies in the differences between “modern” and “traditional”
women from the point of view of education, family status, number of children and proficiency in various skills (such
as knowledge of English and the use of a computer). There appears to be a dichotomy or some type of dual market,
in which “traditional” women almost never participate. This can explain the low rate of participation in comparison
to other countries. “Modern” women have quite a high rate of participation, which also explains the simultaneous
increase in participation and levels of education over time, together with additional cultural changes. The finding
that participation rates among Arab women are very different from those observed in Western countries and among
Jewish women in Israel, though not significantly different from rates in Moslem countries”.
13
  Dahan (2007) explores the main factors behind the steep decline in the participation rate of Israeli men. He
observes four factors responsible for the decline in participation rate between 1980 and 2001: increases in the
population of students (21%), the ultra-Orthodox (21%), the disabled (32%), and discouraged workers (25%).

17
higher taxes outweigh beneﬁts shift to the anti-tax coalition. Hence, the second factor dominates

in many of other rich countries. That is, the political-economy equilibrium-tax rate declines when

the dependency ratio rises. This would be the case until society ages enough so that the median

voter is retired, at which point there is a discontinuous jump up in the tax rate and corresponding

increase in the share of transfers. In other words, the increased share of the fiscal net-beneficiaries

in the population may have two opposing effects on redistribution policies. On the one hand, the

political influence gained by low-income groups is persistently on the rise. This means that the

median voter preferences shift over time in the direction of more generous welfare state. 14 On the

other hand, if the median voter, plausibly, does not belong the low-skill and non-working groups

(as is probably also the case in Israel) then the increased share of the non-working and low-skill in

the population may well lead policy-makers to lower taxes and transfers. Because, the increased

fiscal burden which results for the large share of “net beneficiaries” adversely affect the median

voter (she is a net contributor to the welfare system). The later affect dominates in Israel.

Consequently, the entire redistribution system contracts.




14
  About the voting right franchise in the US in the 1930s, Meltzer and Richard (1981) conclude: “In recent years,
the proportion of voters receiving social security has increased, raising the number of voters favoring taxes on wage
and salary income to ﬁnance redistribution. In our analysis the increase in social security recipients has an eﬀect
similar to an extension of the franchise.”

Figure 6 demonstrates that redistribution Gini coefficient upturned in 1989 and continues to rise

until 2001. The implied more than a decade fall in income redistribution follows the Soviet-Jew

immigration wave. The Figure demonstrates strong rise in income inequality between 1990 and

2003, which is a combination of declining market income inequality, more than offset by and a

marked fall in redistribution. The influx of high skilled immigrants can explain these two

conflicting trends: A rising middle class thanks to high- skill migration, and a rebalancing political-

economy-based income redistribution policy.

         5. Immigrants and the Political System


Immigrants may also shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic classes, or age

groups, or may generate a massive political backlash. In Israel, the political backlash have been

moderate, whereas the change in political balance was substantial. Israel’s Law of Return grants

returnees immediate citizenship and consequently voting rights. An early study by Avner (1975)



16
   A significant change in re-distribution over time is potentially related to a reduction in income taxes. Income Tax
fell from 30 percent of revenues in 2000 to 20.4 percent in 2015. At the same time, VAT fell rose from 24.9 percent
of tax revenues to 30.1 percent. See also Bank of Israel (2014), and Strawczynski (forthcoming).

finds that the voting turnout rate of new immigrants had been markedly lower than that of the

established population. This means that immigrants did not fully exercise their voting rights and

did not therefore influence the political economy equilibrium in Israel as much as the established

population.


A similar migrant low voting turnout pattern is reported also by Messina (2007) and Bird (2011)

for Western Europe. However, a later study about voting turnout pattern of new immigrants to

Israel in the 2001 elections, conducted by Arian and Shamir (2002) reverse this finding for 2001.

The new immigrants in this study are pre-dominantly from the FSU. Arian and Shamir (2002) find

no marked difference in the voting turnout rates between these new immigrants and the established

population. This is indeed a unique feature of the 1989-2001 immigration waves from the FSU.

Relatedly,

Migration differs from the movement of other factor inputs (such as capital flows) in one

fundamental way. Migrants become part of the society of the receiving country, including its

evolving culture and politics. (The Swiss writer Max Frisch ironically declared: “We asked for

workers. We got people instead.”) In Highly developed social welfare, system in the receiving

country may greatly complicate coalition-buildings political-economy matters, as emphasized by

Razin, Sadka, and Suwankiri (2011). While high-skilled and therefore high-wage migrants may be

net contributors to the fiscal system, low-skilled migrants are likely to be net recipients, thereby

imposing an indirect tax on the taxpayers of the destination country. Eventually, though,

immigrants may shift the balance of politics among ethnic groups, economic classes, or age groups,

or may generate a massive political backlash. Migrants may change the nature of social

interactions, with shifts in religion, ethnicity, and cultural practices.

      5.1 Political-Economy Theory17

To understand better the balance of the political-economic forces at play, one has to analyze the

political-economy forces at play in a general-equilibrium setup. Razin and Sadka (2017) provide

such a stylized general equilibrium model with free migration, where wages are endogenous and

redistribution policy is determined by (endogenously determined) majority voting. 18 They address

the issue of how migration can reshape the political balance of power, especially between skilled

and unskilled and between native-born and migrants, and consequently to political-economic

equilibrium redistribution policy of the welfare state. The general equilibrium model could provide

insights as to how in a “natural experiment” manner, an external supply-side shock triggers a wave

of skilled migration. The shock then can change wages, migration flows, and political coalitions,

to reshape the political-economy balance and the redistributive policies.

         5.1.1 Human Capital Investment


There are just two types of workers: “skilled” (with a symbol 𝑆𝑆) and “unskilled” (with the symbol

𝑈𝑈). The wage per unit of labor of a skilled worker is𝑤𝑤, whereas an unskilled worker earns a wage

of 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 per unit of labor, where 𝜌𝜌 < 1,        19
                                                     All native-born (𝑁𝑁) are initially unskilled. However, a

native-born can acquire education at some cost (𝑐𝑐) and becomes skilled. Individuals differ from

one another through their cost of education: there is a continuum of native-born individuals,

distinguished only by their cost of education. For notational simplicity, we normalize the number


17
   Based on Razin and Sadka (2017).
18
   The model is based on Razin, Sadka and Swagel (2002 a,b)
19
   The model assumes that the only difference between skilled and unskilled labor is the efficiency units of labor
each worker possesses. The simplifying assumption is made in order to focus on the political economy aspects of
the analysis. There could be more tension between skilled and unskilled workers, such that the two types are
complements (e.g., Doepke and Zilibotti (2005)). In this case, an increase in the supply of one type is beneficial to
the other (e.g., migration of unskilled workers increases the marginal product of skilled workers). One can also
assume that capital is more complementary to skilled worker than to unskilled (e.g., Krusell, Ohanian, Rios-Rull and
Violante (2000).

23
of native-born individuals to one. An individual is identified by her cost of education, so that an

individual with a cost of 𝑐𝑐 is termed a c-individual. We assume for simplicity that the cost of

education is uniformly distributed over the interval[𝑜𝑜, 𝑐𝑐̅].


All native-born individuals are endowed with 𝐸𝐸 units of a composite good, the single good in this

economy. All individual in elastically supply one unit of labor. If a c-individual acquires education

and becomes skilled, her income 20 is denoted by𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 )


                           𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐) = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏 + (𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐)(1 + 𝑟𝑟)                          .


, where 𝑡𝑡 is a flat wage tax rate 21; 𝑏𝑏 is a uniform (lump-sum) per capita social benefit; and 𝑟𝑟 is the

interest rate – the return to capital. If a c-individual decides not to acquire education and remain

unskilled, her income (denoted by𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 ) is


             𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏 + 𝐸𝐸(1 + 𝑟𝑟)     (1)                                              .


           (Note that 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐) depends on𝑐𝑐, whereas 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 does not)


Thus, there is a cutoff level of cost,𝑐𝑐 ∗ , so that all c-individuals with 𝑐𝑐 ≤ 𝑐𝑐 ∗ will choose to become

skilled, and all the others (with𝑐𝑐 ≥ 𝑐𝑐 ∗ ) will remain unskilled. This 𝑐𝑐 ∗ is defined by

              (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏 + (𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐 ∗ )(1 + 𝑟𝑟) = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏 + 𝐸𝐸(1 + 𝑟𝑟).                        .


Upon some re-arrangement, the cutoff level of the cost of education,𝑐𝑐 ∗ , becomes:

                                  (1 − 𝑡𝑡)(1 − 𝜌𝜌)𝑤𝑤 = 𝑐𝑐 ∗ (1 + 𝑟𝑟).                                         .




20
     Note that this specification assumes that capital does not depreciate at all.
21
     In an unpublished version Razin and Sadka extended the tax to apply to capital income as well.

24
That is, 𝑐𝑐 ∗ is solved from the equality between the return to education and its cost. A 𝑐𝑐 ∗ -individual

is just indifferent between acquiring education (and thereby becoming skilled) or staying unskilled.

Upon further re-arrangement, 𝑐𝑐 ∗ is defined by

                      (1−𝑡𝑡)(1−𝜌𝜌)𝑤𝑤
             𝑐𝑐 ∗ =          (1+𝑟𝑟)
                                       .   (2)                                                        .


Note that 𝑐𝑐 ∗ may well exceed𝐸𝐸, which means that those c-individuals with 𝑐𝑐 below but close to 𝑐𝑐 ∗

(which is endogenous) actually borrow in order to acquire education. Naturally, the payoff in terms

of the higher wage would more than offset the borrowing cost. For those individuals 𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐 is

negative.


Also, note that we are employing a static framework within which all economic and political

processes occur simultaneously with no time dimension. 22 For instance, we do not distinguish

between the time in which the education is acquired, and the time when the earnings occur.

Similarly, capital earns its return 𝑟𝑟 at the same time it is employed.


The number of c-individuals with 𝑐𝑐 ≤ 𝑐𝑐 ∗ is the number of native-born skilled individuals.

Denoting this number by 𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆 , it follows that

                      𝑐𝑐 ∗
             𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆 = 𝑐𝑐̅ .       (3)                                                               .


Then, the number of native-born unskilled individuals,𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑈 , is thus given by


             𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑈 = 1 − 𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆 . (4)                                                                .




22
     Such a framework is akin to a steady state in a dynamic model with rational expectations.

25
Aggregate investment in human capital (education), denoted by 𝐻𝐻, and is then given by

                  𝑐𝑐 ∗   1          (𝑐𝑐 ∗ )2
          𝐻𝐻 = ∫0 𝑐𝑐 ⋅ 𝑐𝑐̅ 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =              . (5)                                                             .
                                      2𝑐𝑐̅



Therefore, the aggregate stock of physical capital,𝐾𝐾, is equal to 23


          𝐾𝐾 = 𝐸𝐸 − 𝐻𝐻.             (6)                                                                      .


There are also two types of migrants: the skilled who can earn a wage 𝑤𝑤 in the host country, and

the unskilled who earn a wage of 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 in the host country. None of them has any initial endowment.

The migrants come to the host country after they have already made and implemented the decision

whether to acquire or not acquire education. Thus, it is exogenously given who is skilled and who

is unskilled. In other words, the economy benefits from the skilled migrants because it does not

have to pay for the cost of investment.

          5.1.2 Income Groups

The income of skilled and unskilled migrants, respectively, is:

          𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏             (7)                                                               .

, and

          𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏.          (8)
                                                                                                                 .


The income of the native-born as a function of 𝑐𝑐 is depicted in Figure 3.4. Note that 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐) declines

in a straight line until it reaches 𝑐𝑐 ∗ , where



23
  The reader will recognize the implicit assumption that the economy is not open to international trade. The effect
of trade openness on inequality is therefore abstracted from the analysis.

26
          𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 ∗ ) = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏 + (𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐 ∗ )(1 + 𝑟𝑟) = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏 + 𝐸𝐸(1 + 𝑟𝑟) = 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 .

The labor income of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same, but the total

income of an unskilled migrant which is (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏 is definitely below the income of an

unskilled native-born, the difference being the capital income enjoyed by the unskilled native-

born, namely 𝐸𝐸(1 + 𝑟𝑟). The total income of a skilled migrant is definitely higher than the total

income of the unskilled migrant, because of the higher wage earned by the skilled, whereas both

have no other income. The income of the skilled migrants exceeds the income of the skilled native-

born with 𝑐𝑐 > 𝐸𝐸, but falls short of the income of the skilled native-born with 𝑐𝑐 < 𝐸𝐸.

       𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 ∗ ) =

                         = 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁
                                                                                      𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 = 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 − 𝐸𝐸(1 + 𝑟𝑟)



                                                                                                            𝑐𝑐
                                           𝐸𝐸     𝑐𝑐 ∗                         𝑐𝑐̅




The income of a skilled migrant is𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 = (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏, whereas the income of a skilled 𝑐𝑐-

individual is(1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏 + (𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐)(1 + 𝑟𝑟). Therefore, as long as 𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐 is positive (i.e. the 𝑐𝑐-

individual does not borrow in order to invest in human capital), then𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐) > 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 . However, if 𝐸𝐸 −

27
𝑐𝑐 < 0 (i.e. the individual borrows in order to invest in human capital), then the income of the

skilled migrant (𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 ) is greater than the income of the skilled native-born (𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 ). In sum, we have the

following ranking of incomes:


      𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 < 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑁𝑁 = 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 = 𝑐𝑐 ∗ ) < 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 > 𝐸𝐸) < 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 = 𝐸𝐸) = 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 < 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 (𝑐𝑐 < 𝐸𝐸).

        5.1.3 Supply of Immigrants

Recall that the country employs an unrestricted migration policy. We envisage an economy that

allows any migrants to come. Thus, the decision whether to immigrate or no rests solely with the

migrant. Each potential migrant has some reservation income, so that she will migrate if and only

if she will be accorded a higher income in the destination country.


Due to various factors (such as skill, family ties, age, etc.) this reservation income is not the same,

but there is rather a continuum of such reservation incomes. Distinguishing between the two skills

groups, we then assume that there is an upward sloping supply function for each skill group,

depending on the income accorded to immigrants in the destination country. Denoting the number

of skilled migrants by𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 , the supply function of skilled migrants is given by an iso-elastic

function:


         𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 = 𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆 (𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 )𝜎𝜎𝑆𝑆   (9)                                                                         .


, where 𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆 and 𝜎𝜎𝑆𝑆 are some positive parameters. Similarly, the supply function of unskilled

migrants is given by


         𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 = 𝐵𝐵𝑈𝑈 (𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 )𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈    (10)


, where 𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 is the number of unskilled migrants and 𝐵𝐵𝑈𝑈 and 𝜎𝜎𝑈𝑈 are some positive parameters.




28
       5.1.4 Production and Factor Prices

We employ a Cobb-Douglas production function

         𝑌𝑌 = 𝐴𝐴𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼 𝐿𝐿1−𝛼𝛼 , 𝐴𝐴 > 0, 0 < 𝛼𝛼 < 1 (11)                                          .


, where 𝑌𝑌 is gross domestic product, 𝐴𝐴 is a total factor productivity (TFP) parameter, and 𝛼𝛼 is the

capital-share parameter (and (1 − 𝛼𝛼) is the labor-share parameter). Symbol 𝐿𝐿 indicates the total

labor supply in efficiency units and is given by

                            𝐿𝐿 = 𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆 + 𝜌𝜌𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑈 + 𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 + 𝜌𝜌𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈   (12)                           .


The competitive wage per efficiency unit of labor (𝑤𝑤) and the competitive interest rate (𝑟𝑟) are

given by the marginal productivity conditions

                                   𝐾𝐾 𝛼𝛼
         𝑤𝑤 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝐴𝐴 � 𝐿𝐿 �               (13)                                              .


       , and

                     𝐾𝐾 1−𝛼𝛼
         𝑟𝑟 = 𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼 � 𝐿𝐿 �      ,           (14)                                                 .




, where we assume for simplicity that capital does not depreciate.


The model exhibits the standard gains from trade argument. (See appendix A, which remind us

who are gainers and losers from the flow of skilled migrants).

       5.1.4 Income - Redistribution System

We employ a very simple system of redistribution. Wages are taxed at a flat rate of𝑡𝑡. The revenues

are distribution by a uniform per-capita transfer, 𝑏𝑏.

29
We assume that the migrants qualify for all the benefits of the welfare state, and they are naturally

subject to the state taxes. Therefore, the government budget constraint is as follows:

          𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 = 𝑏𝑏(1 + 𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 + 𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 )            (15)                                                                  .


, assuming that the government has no other revenue needs, except for redistribution. 24 Note that

it follows from equation (16) that 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑏𝑏 must be of the same sign. A positive wage tax (𝑡𝑡) allows

the government to accord a positive transfer (𝑏𝑏) to all. A subsidy to wages (namely, a negative𝑡𝑡)

requires the government to impose a lump-sum tax (negative-𝑏𝑏) on all. When 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑏𝑏 are positive,

the tax-transfer system is progressive. When they are negative, the system is regressive.


With unrestricted migration the flows of migrants 𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 and 𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 are determined by the migrants

themselves according to their reservation incomes (embedded in the supply functions, (11) and

(12)), and the income accorded to them in the host country. There are therefore only two policy

variables – the tax rate, and the social benefit𝑏𝑏. However, as the government is constrained by a

balanced budget (condition (16)), it follows that there is essentially only one policy variables; once

𝑡𝑡 is chosen, all the other economic variables are determined in equilibrium, including the tax

revenue (𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡), the number of migrants (𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 , and𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 ), and𝑏𝑏. Alternatively, alternatively, once 𝑏𝑏 is

chosen, all the other economic variables are determined in equilibrium.


Choosing 𝑡𝑡 as the single policy variable, we note that there remain 15 endogenous variables


                             𝑤𝑤, 𝑏𝑏, 𝑟𝑟, 𝑐𝑐 ∗ , 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑀𝑀 , 𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 , 𝑛𝑛𝑆𝑆 , 𝑛𝑛𝑈𝑈 , 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 , 𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 , 𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 , 𝐻𝐻, 𝐾𝐾, 𝑌𝑌, 𝐿𝐿.



24
  One may wonder why there is no tax on the initial endowment (𝐸𝐸). In a distortive. However, in a dynamic setting
which we mimic in a static framework, 𝐸𝐸 represents accumulated savings, and taxing it will be distortive.
Furthermore, because all native-born possess the same initial endowment, taxing it in our static model does not
distribute income across native-born income groups; but taxing 𝐸𝐸 amounts to transferring income from the native-
born to the migrants static model such a tax is not.

30
There are also 15 equations in the model – (2)-(9) and (10)-(16) - from which the endogenous

variables are to be solved 25.


The policy variable t is chosen by some natural and plausible version of a majority voting. 26


A two stage voting system is as follows. In the first stage the regressivity-progressivity of the

system is determined. If the tax rate, t, and the social benefit, b, are both positive, the system is

progressive. If the tax rate, t, and the social benefit, b, are both negative, the system is regressive.

The system’s progressivity is chosen by the majority of the voters.


In the second chase the magnitudes of the tax system, t, and b, are chosen by the largest sub group

of the majority coalition. 27


Upon observation, we can see from equations (2) and (3) that the direct effect of the tax-transfer

policy on the incomes of the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants is the same, and

works through the net wage income (1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏. For the unskilled migrant this is the only

effect of the tax-transfer system. However, for unskilled native-born, there is also an indirect effect

through capital income 𝐼𝐼(1 + 𝑟𝑟) (note that 𝑟𝑟 depends on𝑡𝑡); but this indirect effect is of a second-

order magnitude compared to the direct effect.


Similarly, the direct effect of the tax-transfer policy on the incomes of the skilled native-born and

the skilled migrants is the same and works through the net wage income(1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏. Here again,

there is also and indirect effect on the income of the skilled native-born (but not on the income of




25
   In addition, equation (1) defines 𝐼𝐼𝑆𝑆𝑁𝑁 as a function of 𝑐𝑐.
26
   Since the composition of voters is endogenous, and the single-peak property of the voter preferences is not
guaranteed, the median voter proposition is invalid.
27
   See also Lee et al (2004).

31
the skilled migrants) through the capital income (𝐸𝐸 − 𝑐𝑐)(1 + 𝑟𝑟). Here again the indirect effect is

of second-order magnitude.


Thus, all unskilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected by the tax-transfer policy mainly

through(1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + 𝑏𝑏, whereas all skilled (both native-born and migrants) are affected mainly

by(1 − 𝑡𝑡)𝑤𝑤 + 𝑏𝑏. It is therefore natural that all the unskilled whose wage is only 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 would rather

prefer to tax wage income and take advantage of all the skilled whose wage is higher – 𝑤𝑤. Thus,

the most preferred policy of the unskilled entails a positive tax and a positive transfer. Therefore,

if the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) constitute a majority, then the political economy

equilibrium tax and transfer will be positive – a progressive tax-transfer system. However, due to

the indirect effect, which applies only to the unskilled native born, the most-preferred tax and

transfer policy is not necessarily the same for the unskilled native-born and the unskilled migrants.

We then postulate that when the unskilled form a majority, then the tax-transfer policy chosen is

the most-preferred policy by the larger of the two sub-groups (the unskilled native-born or the

unskilled migrants).


Similarly, the skilled (both native-born and migrants whose wage is higher than the unskilled)

would opt to grant a subsidy to the wage, financed by a lump-sum tax. That is, they opt for negative

𝑡𝑡 and 𝑏𝑏 – a regressive tax-transfer policy. In this case too, there is also an indirect effect which

applies only the skilled native-born. Thus, the most-preferred tax-transfer policy is not the same

for the two sub-groups of skilled native-born and skilled migrants. In this case, too we postulate

that the political-economy tax-transfer policy is the most-preferred policy of the larger sub-group.




32
Note that indirect effect of the tax-transfer policy, which works through the capital income,

(E − c)(1 + 𝑟𝑟) is not the same for all members of the skilled native-born sub-group (because it

depends on𝑐𝑐). In this case, we assume that the median voter within this group prevails.


If we keep all other parameter values constant and increase only the parameter value of𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆 , we can

isolate the effect of a supply side shock. That is, we give a positive shock to the supply of skilled

migrants. We find that number of skilled migrants (𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 ) rises sharply. The skilled constitute now

the majority𝑥𝑥𝑆𝑆 + 𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 > 𝑥𝑥𝑈𝑈 + 𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 . As predicted, the political-economy tax-transfer policy becomes

now regressive: 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑏𝑏 are negative. That is, there is a wage subsidy financed by a lump sum tax.

In addition, the skilled migrants form the larger of the two skilled sub-groups, (i.e.𝑚𝑚𝑆𝑆 > 𝑥𝑥𝑆𝑆 ) and

their most-preferred tax-transfer policy becomes now the political-equilibrium tax-transfer policy.

Furthermore, the politically dominant sub-group of skilled migrants drives out all unskilled

migrants (𝑚𝑚𝑈𝑈 = 0), by according them zero disposable income (𝐼𝐼𝑈𝑈𝑀𝑀 = 0).


Noteworthy, the unskilled native-born were initially the politically dominant sub-group and

dictated their most-preferred progressive tax-transfer. Following the supply-side stock of skilled

migration, the unskilled native-born lose their dominance to the skilled migrants who are now

dictating their most-preferred regressive tax-transfer policy. Nevertheless, the unskilled native-

born are better off, because the return to their capital income (namely,𝑟𝑟) rises sharply (in unit of

the all-purpose composite good). Even though the wage per efficiency unit falls, the sharp rise in

the rate of interest (from 1.55 to 2.94) more than compensates the native-born unskilled for the

wage decline. For the same reason, the skilled (native-born and migrants) are all better off. Thus,

except for the unskilled migrants, who are driven out, all other income groups gain from the

skilled-migration supply shock.



33
Note that the influx of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the labor force; consequently, it

does also raise the tax revenue needed for shouldering the pre-existing redistribution policy. This

force works towards more generous-redistribution, because it is fiscally less burdensome.

Counteracting this pro-distribution force, however, is the rebalancing of the political coalition

triggered by the increased share of higher-income skilled in the voting population. The result is

that the emerging decisive voter reverses the pre-existing redistribution regime. 28

It is worth explaining the model specific forces that totally drive out the unskilled migrants in the

wake of the skilled-migration supply shock. The model assumes perfect substitutability between

skilled and unskilled labor in production: each unit of time of an unskilled worker is equivalent

to 𝜌𝜌 units of time of a skilled worker. Thus, unskilled migrants provide no productivity benefits

to the skilled. At the same time, they constitute a fiscal burden Therefore, the new skilled-

dominant coalition drive them out altogether by pushing their disposable income all the way to

zero. The assumed perfect substitutability in production does serve to highlight the anti-

unskilled-migration forces within the ruling skilled coalition. The perfect labor substitutability

assumption overstates market-based inequality in the model. If the supply elasticity of skill

migrant is larger than that of unskilled, it will reinforce the flows of skilled and the outflows of

unskilled because of the migration shock. In a steady state of standard dynamic models, in

general, there is more labor substitutability than in that during the transition- dynamic state. This

provide plausibility to our perfect substitutability assumption. If one introduces into the analysis

Heckscher-Ohlin elements of the traded-non traded sectoral structure, it will serve in our model




28
     For numerical simulation, see appendix B.

34
to understate market based income inequality in our one-sector model. Because these elements

tend to mitigate the wage decline following the migration shock. 29


           6. The migration-inequality model’s predictions



The model attempt to rationalize the sharp rise in income inequality following the Soviet-Jew

Exodus shock, based on unusual electoral participation by the new immigrants. It allows us to

explore how migration supply side shock alters immigration patterns and, at the same time,

reshapes the political-economy balance we develop a stylized political-economy model with free

migration. Important political-economy mechanisms are at work: First, the influx of skill-

immigrants depresses the incentives for unskilled migrants to flow in, though they are still free to

do so. Second, the fiscal burden of redistribution policies diminishes from the viewpoint of the

decisive voter. That is, the influx of skilled labor raises overall productivity of the labor force;

consequently, it also raises the tax revenue needed for shouldering a redistribution policy.

However, counteracting this pro-distribution force is the rebalancing of the political coalition,

because the share of the increase in the skilled in the population. Therefore, the emerging decisive

voter reverses pre-existing the redistribution regime, notwithstanding the fall in the fiscal burden.

Third, nonetheless, the unskilled native-born may well become well off, even though they lose

their political influence. To sum up, the model prediction are as follows. First, the shock depresses

the incentives for unskilled migrants to flow in, though they are still free to do so. Second, tax-

transfer system becomes less progressive. Third, the unskilled native-born may well become well

off, though they lose their political influence, which they had before the migration wave. All other

native-born income groups are also made better off. The positive economics predictions seem to

35
be consistent with data. Theory is motivated by the unique migration experience of Israel of a

supply-side shock triggering skilled immigration and the concurrent decline in welfare-state

redistribution. This paper develops a model, which can provide an explanation for the mechanism

through which a supply-side shock triggering high-skill migration can also reshape the political-

economy balance and the redistributive policies. The paper highlights the differences in the

political-economy induced redistribution policies between the cases in which migrants participate

in the electoral system and the case where they do not. When migrants are allowed to vote, and

they take advantage of this right, then, following the shock, all income groups gain, except low

skilled immigrants who lose. When migrants are not allowed to vote, or choose not to participate

in elections, all income groups gain, except the skilled migrants who lose.


       7. Conclusion

The paper describes a unique experience of Israel. Within a short time period in the early 1990s,

Israel received scores of migrants from the Former Soviet Union (FSU). Its distinctive feature was

the migrants’ high labor skill. Following the immigration wave, the political-economy balance

shifted towards a government pursuit of more regressive policy. Such a significant change in re-

distribution over time is underpinned by a secular reduction in income taxes. Income Tax fell from

30 percent of revenues in 2000 to 20.4 percent in 2015. At the same time, VAT fell rose from 24.9

percent of tax revenues to 30.1 percent. It caused a sharp new upward trend of disposable income

inequality but without a parallel change in market income inequality. That is, the welfare state took

a sharp regressive turn. The model developed in the paper helps explain what is shown Figure 6:

a moderate rise in net income inequality after 2000, which is a combination of declining market

income inequality, and an offsetting fall in income redistribution. The influx of high skilled



36
immigrants can explain both: A rising middle class and a rebalanced political economy

equilibrium.


This underscores the role played by the post migration political balance, which triggered less

redistribution.


           Appendix A: Gains to Native-born from Migration

Like international trade in goods, there are gains and losses from the opening of national borders

to labor mobility. A simple figure (Figure A) can serve to illustrate the gains from migration in

our model. For concreteness, we illustrate the gains to the native-born from low-skilled

migration. For simplicity, we assume that there are no taxes and benefits.

The down slopping curve in this figure is the marginal product of low-skilled labor. This curve is

also the demand for this type of labor.

There are S native-born high-skill labor. Free-migration number of high skilled immigrants is

𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑆𝑆 .


In a closed economy with no migration, the equilibrium high-skilled wage is 𝑤𝑤𝑆𝑆 .

GDP is equal to the area OGAD, of which the area HGA goes to the high-skill native-born and

the area OHAD goes to the low-skill native-born.

Suppose the high-skill migrants face a reservation wage of 𝑤𝑤𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 in their countries of origin, which

                      ����.
is below the threshold𝑤𝑤 𝑆𝑆 If we allow for a free migration then 𝐹𝐹𝑀𝑀𝑆𝑆 high-skilled migrants will


come. The equilibrium wage will be: 𝑤𝑤𝑆𝑆𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 . GDP increases to OGCF (to both native-born and

migrants).

An increase measured by the area DACF.

A part of this increase (the area DKCF) goes to the low-skilled migrants, so that the total gains to

all the native-born is the area AKC. Note, however, that not all native-born gain. The income of

High -skill native-born drops to the area ORKD, so that they lose the area HAKR. On the other

hand, the income of the high-skill native-born exceeds the loss to the low-skill native-born.




38
Therefore, with a perfect, non-distortionary system of redistribution (via lump sums), the high-

skilled native-born can more than compensate the low-skilled native-born, so that all native-born

can gain from migration.

Note also that if the migration of high skill trigger either productivity gains (through external

effects) or an increase in infrastructure investment (through policy effects) the marginal

productivity curve would shift outwardly. Therefore, the wage of high skill under free migration

need not fall.

Because a redistribution system (via wage taxation) is distortionary, the compensation possibilities

are limited. It is not always the case that all native-born gain from migration. A similar conclusion

holds in the case of high-skilled migration.

A striking result in Chapter 2 is that the migration supply shock benefit all income groups despite

of the distortionary redistribution system and driven by political-economy forces.



Appendix B: Migrant’s Votes vs. Migrant’s does Not Vote

The migration-inequality model, motivated by the Israeli experience with the wave of skilled

migration from the FSU, simulates the effects of a supply shock of skilled migration on the political

economy equilibrium tax-transfer policy. To highlight the role of electoral participation by

immigrants, we compare two political regimes. In the first one migrants do not vote. In the second,

migrants vote.

We start with parameter values that entail the unskilled (both native-born and migrants) as a

majority. This case is described Figure B (a) and (b). As predicted, the political-economy tax-

transfer policy is progressive: 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑏𝑏 are positive. Also, the unskilled native-born form a majority

of the unskilled. We then contemplate a skilled migration supply shock that is we keep all other parameter

values constant and increase the skilled migration parameter value. Following the supply-side shock of
39
skilled migration, in part (a), the unskilled native-born do not lose their political dominance to the skilled

migrants. Their most-preferred progressive tax-transfer policy is unchanged. Nevertheless, the unskilled

native-born are better off, because the return to their capital income (namely, 𝑟𝑟) rises.

Following the supply-side shock of skilled migration, in part (b), the unskilled native-born lose their

dominance to the skilled migrants who are now dictating their most-preferred regressive tax-transfer policy.

Nevertheless, the unskilled native-born are better off, because the return to their capital income

Rises .See Figure B (a), (b).


        The comparison between the two cases is insightful. When not given the right to vote, the supply-

side shock of skilled migration (case (𝑎𝑎)) renders the fiscal system more progressive. By contrast, when the

migrants have the right to vote (which they fully exercise), they cause the fiscal system to be regressive.

Noteworthy, when they are not allowed to vote, the skilled migrants lose and all other income groups gain.

When they are allowed to vote it is the unskilled migrants who lose, and all other income groups gain.


        The model therefore help explain what is shown Figure 1 for the Israeli episode: a rise in income

inequality between 1990 and 2003, which is a combination of declining market income inequality and a

more than offsetting fall in redistribution. The influx of high skilled immigrants can explain both: A rising

middle class and a rebalanced political economy based income redistribution policy.
