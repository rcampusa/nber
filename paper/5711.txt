       Mispriced and misadministered      deposit insurance imparts risk-shifting   incentives to U.S.

banks. Regulators are expected to monitor and discipline increases in bank risk exposure that would

transfer wealth from the FDIC to bank stockholders.   This paper assesses the success regulators had

in controlling risk-shifting by U.S. banks during 1985-1994. In contrast to single-equation estimates

developed   from the option model by others, our simultaneous-equation       evidence indicates that

regulators failed to prevent large U.S, banks from shifting risk to the FDIC.       Moreover, at the

margin, banks that are undercapitalized   shifted risk more effectively than other sample banks.

Until a risk-related     premium     structure was introduced       in the 1990s, the flat explicit

deposit insurance premium paid by U.S. banks created an incentive for insured banks to

increase their risk exposurel. Viewing the bank’s deposit guarantee as a put option written

by the FDIC, Merton (1977) shows that the value of this option to the bank would

increase with asset risk and leverage risk. Higher risk increases the value of the FDIC’s

insurance services.     If the incremental cost a bank pays for these services does not rise to

absorb this value, increasing       risk exposure extracts an incremental             deposit insurance

subsidy.   Such subsidies may benefit bank stockholders via higher stock price artd/or they

may be “shifted”, in whole or large part, to bank customers,

     Four forces act to restrain excessive risk taking by the banks. Benston, Eisenbeis,

Horvitz,    Kane,   and Kaufman        (1986)    argue that market       discipline    from uninsured

debtholders    and other stakeholders       limit risk-taking     excesses.    They also mention        a

second limiting     factor: managerial      risk-aversion.      To avoid the negative        effect that

leading a bank to failure may have on their reputational             human capital, managers may

limit risk-taking     to reduce probability      of distress.     Saunders    et al. (1990) develop

evidence that supports this hypothesis.          Third, though cushioned by deposit insurance,

distress costs help to restrain risk-taking.        Substantial   charter value may be lost in the

event of liquidation.       The last but not least important restraining factor is government

regulation.

    Buser et al. (1981) model the price of federal deposit insurance as a sum of two

components:       an explicit     insurance    premium     and an implicit         cost   associated    with

regulatory pressure for safe and sound operation,             The implicit premium is conceived to

be risk-sensitive    so as to stop excessive risk-taking by the banks.            In a bilaterally market-

driven equilibrium,     the marginal benefits from deposit insurance would be exactly offset

by its marginal costs (explicit and implicit).           However, deposit insurance is a trilateral

contract.     Agency problems in government decision-making                process raise the possibility

of an equilibrium in which an uncompensated             risk exposure is shifted to taxpayers.

    Gorton and Rosen (1995) opine that, despite general agreement among researchers on

bank incentives,     “empirical     research has not reached a consensus             on whether deposit

insurance is underpriced.”           Marcus and Shaked (1984) adapt a one-year put option

model to estimate the risk-adjusted           deposit insurance premiums.          Their results suggest

that the FDIC insurance           is generally overpriced,      although    the distribution     of “fair”

premiums      is highly skewed.      Ronn and Verma (1986) refine the Marcus-Shaked                    model

and incorporate     market perceptions        of FDIC forbearance policies.          Duan, Moreau, and

Sealey (1992) use the methods             of Ronn and Verma (1986) to estimate                  fair FDIC

premiums.     Linking changes in these premiums to the changes in banks’ risk exposure,

they estimate that successful risk-shifting is a relatively isolated phenomenon.

    These studies presume a one-year option settlement framework, which understates the

value of deposit insurance.       Pennacchi (1987) clarifies that an implicit and counterfactual

                                                                                                           2
assumption      in one-year models is that, at each settlement           date, insurance premia are

adjusted to fair value and/or the FDIC forces banks to raise their capital ratios to a fair

level.     Studies by Allen and Saunders (1993) and Cooperstein,            Pennacchi, and Redburn

(1995) propose more realistic multiperiod deposit insurance valuation methods.

    Even maintaining         the counterfactual     assumption    of prompt option settlement,       we

develop strong evidence of active risk-shifting.          We use the model of Duan, Moreau, and

Sealey (1992) to tie the incremental insurance subsidy received by a bank to changes in

the bank’s risk exposure.       But our paper improves the empirical analysis of risk-shifting

in three ways:

(1) Our sample is substantially larger and is more representative of the population of U.S.

    banks than the samples studied in prior work.

(2) We explore differences         in risk shifting between healthy and troubled institutions.

    There is no reason to expect a uniform risk-shifting                pattern     across our sample.

    Corporate     finance    theory   implies     that risk-shifting   incentives    are strongest   for

    troubled institutions.     The very large banks studied in the previous literature include

    some of the safest in U.S.

(3) We use an improved estimator that recognizes and adjusts for simultaneity                bias built

    by definition into single-equation     structural models of bank leverage and risk-adjusted

    insurance premia.

    Our estimates indicate that risk-restraining         forces are far weaker than earlier studies

suggest.     The policy implication      of our evidence is that ailing institutions        seek more

actively to shift risks than other banks do and that in 1985-1994 the regulatory system

failed to contain risk-shifting by these banks.




                                                                                                       3
    The paper is organized as follows.             Section I reviews the one-period option pricing

model      for risk-adjusting   deposit    insurance.       Our sample,               methods   and results   are

described in section II. Section III examines the robustness of our findings.                        Section lV

sums up the paper.

                                            1. The Model

    Ronn and Verma ( 1986) model the fair premium for deposit insurance services (P) as

the value of a limited-term (one year) put option:

                                                     (l-a)nv~,        ~(y,     ) ,
                                IP=B,     N(y~)–           ~                                                  (1)


where B 1 is the face value of insured deposits,                B is the face value of insured and

uninsured debt, V is the value of bank assets, 5 is the dividend per dollar of assets, n is

the number of times per period the dividend is paid.                  Variables yl and y2 are defined as

follows:

                                        ln[B/V(l–6)’’]        -0~T/2
                                 y, =                                          7
                                                     Ovfi



                                           Y2=y1+crvti,


where Ov is the instantaneous       standard deviation of asset returns, N(0) is the cumulative

standard normal distribution, T is the effective maturity (one year).

It is convenient to estimate IPP, the insurance premium per dollar of insured deposits:


                           ZPP=ZP/B,        =~(yz)–         (l–d)n;          ~(yl).                           (2)
                  4




                                                                                                                4
Neither the market value of bank assets, V, nor the standard deviation of asset returns, Ov,

is observable.      They can, however, be estimated using two additional equations.                        The

first equation states the call option valuation assignable to the equity of a levered firm:

                                         E =    VN(X,) –pBN(x2)           ,                                (3)


where E is the value of the bank’s equity, p is the exercise price, as a percentage of the

value of deposits.

Variables xl and x2 are defined as follows:

                                               ln[V/pB]+o~T/2
                                        x, =
                                                          O“@                 ‘


                                               x,=x,      -ovti,
We follow Ronn and Verrna (1986) in modeling FDIC forbearance policy as lowering the

exercise price of the shareholders’ call option below the value of bank deposits by setting

p = 0.97. This procedure neglects the option value of further FDIC forbearance when the

p threshold is crossed (Kane (1986)).

    The second equation states a relationship between Ov and ~E that follows from Ito’s

lemma:

                                            ~_ogl
                                               V—E                                                         (4)
                                                           v N(x, ) “

Here, ~E is the instantaneous standard deviation of equity returns.

    Comparative-static       analysis of equation (2) implies that a manager can increase the

value of the deposit insurance subsidy by increasing asset risk Ov and/or leverage B/V.

                                                                                                            5
Duan      et    al.   (1992)     translate     this       implication        into   two   testable     hypotheses   by

approximating         the change in the per-dollar insurance premium as follows:


                                                                                                                    (5)


Equation (5) is rewritten as:

                                                                                                                    (6)

                                                      I                                                             (8)

        A positive ~ 1 would indicate that the bank was successful in increasing its deposit

insurance subsidy through risk-shifting                   during the sample period,          Merton (1977) shows

that -- absent market and government                      disciplinary       responses    -- the partial derivatives

dIPPhov        and dIPP&(B/V) are positive.               Empirically, risk-sensitive        capital regulation and

other risk-restraining         factors introduce negative linkages between                   ov   and B/V (negative

u1). The net effect of how disciplinary restraints modify risk-shifting                              incentives can be

assessed by estimating al and ~ 1. The two hypotheses about the character of net risk-

shifting are:

Hypothesis      1: al 20,

Hypothesis 2: ~1 <0,

Treating crv as exogenous (a restriction we relax in section III), one can test Hypotheses                             1


and 2 for an individual bank j by estimating the following equations:




                                                                                                                       6

Rejecting Hypothesis       1 would affirm that risk-restraining                      factors outweigh risk-shifting

incentives.    Rejecting Hypothesis 2 would indicate that risk-shifting incentives prevail.

    Partial derivatives of IPP with respect to Ov and B/V are complicated                              functions of

these variables.      There is no reason to expect that the parameter ~ defined in (7) is a

constant.     Even if the majority of banks operate safely and do not actively shift risks,

incentives    for risk shifting intensify with financial distress. Marcus (1984) shows that

healthy banks may prefer a safer policy to protect their charter, while financially weaker

banks may reap advantages from strategic risk-taking.                             Marcus and Shaked (1984) find

the distribution    of bank risk-shifting      to be skewed: almost the entire estimated value of

the aggregate deposit insurance subsidy flows to the riskiest 5 percent of insured banks.

The hypothesis      that it may pay a bank to shift risks aggressively                       when it is in distress

implies that positive al and ~ 1 should emerge more frequently at distressed institutions.

    To test for risk-shifting    by distressed institutions,                      we reestimated equations   (9) and

(10) on pooled data introducing interactive dummy variables for financial distress:

                                                                                                                (12)


In these equations,     d = 1 if the bank was undercapitalized                        in the preceding quarter and

d=O otherwise.      We augment the analysis with the following two null hypotheses that we

expect to reject:




                                                                                                                       7
Hypothesis 3: al 1S O

Hypothesis 4: ~11 <0

Rejecting     these two hypotheses     would indicate that undercapitalized       banks are able to

expand their access to deposit insurance subsidy.




                                    Il. Methods and Results

A. Sample Selection and Data

    The models derived in the previous section are estimated with quarterly data running

from the first quarter of 1985 through the fourth quarter of 1994. Our analysis focuses on

chartered commercial        banks (SIC codes 6021 and 6022) whose shares trade on NYSE,

AMEX, or NASDAQ.             To be included into our sample, a bank must have at least sixteen

consecutive      quarters    of   balance-sheet    and    stock-returns    data   available    from,

correspondingly,     Compustat    Industrial Quarterly and CRSP daily returns files.          Such a

restriction is necessary to allow estimation of regressions for each individual bank. These

screening criteria are satisfied for 124 banks, offering us a total of 4,227 bank-quarter

observations.      Survivorship   bias may be introduced       if our selection criteria eliminate

some banks whose particularly         intense risk-shifting   incentives resulted in early failure.

This bias makes our assessment of risk-shifting by troubled banks conservative.

    Table I presents the sample distribution by number of quarters of data available and

by chartering authority.      A full forty quarters of data are available for eighty-three banks.

Data for the remaining forty-one bank cover sixteen to thirty-eight quarters.          Forty-seven

banks are state-chartered;     eighty-seven have a national charter.




                                                                                                     8
    Table II reports the distribution      of the sample by calendar years.          Observations   by

calendar year vary from a low of 338 in 1985 to a high of 492 in 1991, 1992, and 1993.

    Table ~ presents summary statistics for the sample. The sample banks are diverse in

their financial     characteristics.    While   the sample     is clearly   skewed     toward    larger

institutions,   relatively small banks are represented better than in earlier studies.           Bank

asset size varies from a mere $125 million to $251 billion.         Other characteristics,      such as

standard deviations      of stock and asset returns, as well as the estimated          values of fair

deposit insurance premiums are of similar magnitude to those in the samples analyzed by

Marcus and Shaked ( 1984), and Ronn and Verma ( 1986). The last line in the table shows

that while the majority of the sample shows very low values for risk-adjusted                insurance

premiums (the median is 0.00370), a distinct minority receives extremely high IPP values.

This reinforces     our concern that analyzing average risk-shifting        for the sample is not

sufficient.     It is important    to look for groups of banks that actively pursue deposit

insurance subsidies.

B. Definition of Variables

Statistical proxies for conceptual variables are briefly discussed below:

    B, total debt : calculated as a difference between book values of assets (Compustat

    item 044) and common equity (Compustat item 059).

    E, market      value of bank’s equity       ; calculated   as the end-of-period      stock price

    (Compustat item 014) times number of shares outstanding (Compustat item 061).




                                                                                                      9
     GE , standard deviation of the return on equi~ : estimated from daily stock returns

     over the previous quarte?.

     6, dividends per dollar of assets : calculated as the cash dividends per common share

     (Compustat      item 020) times number of shares outstanding                 (Compustat     item 061)

     divided over market value of bank’s assets (V).




C. Tests of Hypothesis 1

                                C. 1.    Linear Time-Series Estimates

    To test Hypothesis       1, equation (9) is estimated separately for each of 124 banks.                The

regressions     include corrections     for first-order autocorrelation       in residuals.    Results are

reported      in the first column of Table IV,          At the five percent significance          level, 33

negative and no positive estimates of al emerge.                At the ten percent level, nine more

coefficient     estimates   prove significantly     negative, but only one significantly            positive

coefficient     develops.    This evidence      rejects Hypothesis       1 that the risk restraints        are

negligible only for between one-quarter and one-third of the sample banks.

    Duan et al. (1992) report that 28 of the 30 banks they examined                        for 1976-1986

exhibited a significantly negative al.         This led them to claim that restraints on bank risk-

shifting dominate risk-taking incentives.          In our expanded sample that covers a later time

period, risk-restraining     factors prove much weaker. Twenty-one banks are present in both

samples.      For 20 of these banks Duan et al. (1992) report significantly negative estimates




5 We require at least 20 stock-return observations for a particular bank-quarter to be included into our
sample. The estimated standard deviation of stock returns is annualized assuming 253 trading days per
year.



                                                                                                            10
of al.   At five percent, only 4 of these show negative coefficient estimates in our 1985-

1994 time period, and only two more negative coefficients emerge at ten percent.

                             C,2. Nonlinear Least-Squares Estimates

In regression (9), the left-hand side variable o “, is calculated from variables that include

the dependent variable BW. This implies that estimates of U1 from model (9) are biased

by variable definitions.      To clarify this, we note from (3) and (4) that:

                                                              B N(xz)
                                                              ——
                                        ov=tsE-aEPv             N(x, ).                                   (13)


Therefore, (9) can be rewritten as


                                   ;=ao+a,
                                       aE
                                                    [
                                                        l–p
                                                              ~%1”                                        (14)


With B/V on both sides of equation (14) direct estimates of al suffer from a definitional

simultaneity    bias.    By construction,      the endogenous       variable B/V enters the regressor.

This renders the regressor stochastic and correlated with the error term &.

    To remove this bias from estimates of al, equation (14) can be rearranged into a

reduced form by collecting B/V terms on the left-hand sideG:

                 B             a.                                    a,a E
                 —=                                                                      +(.              (15)
                 V  l+alo,pN(xz)/N(xl)                  + l+alO.PN(Xz)/         N(x, )


Column 2 of Table IV, presents estimates of al for each bank using the method of non-

linear least squares. The regressions include a correction for first-order autocorrelation                   in

residuals.     Using five percent significance,           across the 124 banks, equation (15) yields




b Strictly speaking, B/V still enters the right hand side of equation (15) through the term NON.        As a
practical matter, however, NON            remains virtually constant across the sample observations: 99% of all
sample values fall between 0.99 and 1. The mean value of the ratio is 0.9995, its standard deviation is
0.0031, and the correlation with BN is only -0.058.



                                                                                                             11
twelve positive and five negative estimates of al.                 Thirteen additional estimates become

significantly     positive at the ten percent significance.           Thus, using the more appropriate

nonlinear model (15), only about four percent of the sample banks behave as if they are

subject to strong risk-restraining          factors.    The policy implication        is that risk-restricting

factors were largely neutralized during the 1985-1994                 period.

     For 38 banks, models (9) and (15) yield different results for the sign of al.                             The

probability of a discrepancy at least as large as this by pure chance7 is only 4.3x 10-1*. It

seems clear that, by not recognizing definitional simultaneity built into equation (9), one

is bound to overestimate the strength of risk-restraining              factors.

                                         C.3.     Pooled Estimates

     We next estimate equation (11) for a panel of all banks.                   To resolve the simultaneity

problem      identified    in the previous         subsection,     we employ        lagged     values       of the

independent      variable Ov as instruments.           At the cost of introducing        specification       error,

this eliminates     contemporaneous        correlation between the regressor and the disturbance

vector and allows us to obtain a consistent estimator of U1.

    We experimented         with several specifications          for the pooled regression.       Likelihood-

ratio tests indicated the existence of both firm- and time-specific effects, while Hausman

tests supported      the fixed-effects     model against the random-effects              model.       Using the

fixed-effects     model allows intercepts to vary across sample banks and periods while

holding slopes constant.        Results are reported in Table V. The estimated al in this pooled




7 Assuming that the probability of type I error is 5 percent and that these errors are independent,   the
probability of having 38 type I errors is equal (0.05 )36X124!/[38 !x(124-38)!].



                                                                                                                 12
regression    proves significantly       negative, indicating that, on balance across the sample,

risk-restraining    factors are strong.

    We test Hypothesis          3 that risk-restraining          factors differ across banks by using

interactive dummy variables.            We estimate al separately for two groups of banks: those

whose leverage in the preceding quarter lay below (d = O) and above (d = 1) the 90th

sample percentile.        The results reject Hypothesis 3: the significantly negative coefficient

on the interactive variable for d = O contrasts with the positive coefficient when d = 1.

This   finding      indicates   that    restraining     forces    are weak     for banks     that    become

undercapitalized.      This implies that regulatory and market disciplines break down in the

very cases where they need to be strong.

D. Tests of Hypothesis 2

                                       D.1.     Time-Series Estimates

    Table VI reports tests of Hypothesis 2 developed from estimates of equation (10) for

each   bank      in the     sample.     The     regressions      include   a correction    for    first-order

autocorrelation     in residuals.      At five percent significance, five positive estimates of ~1

emerge and no negative ones.              At ten percent, another estimate becomes significantly

positive and four negative ones emerge.               This indicates that about five percent of sample

banks were able to expand deposit insurance subsidies through risk-shifting.                        Although

this percentage     is small, the positive coefficients found in these time-series               regressions

imply that particular banks shifted risk for a prolonged period of time: in fact throughout

most of the 4 to 10-year period for which data on these banks were observed.

                                         D.2.     Pooled Estimates




                                                                                                           13
    Relationship      (12) is estimated       for a panel     of all banks.       Again,    alternative

specifications     are compared.    Likelihood-ratio    and Hausman tests suggest the presence of

bank- and time-specific       intercepts.   The slope is held constant across banks.       Results are

presented in Panel A of Table VII.           The estimated ~1 in this pooled regression differs

insignificantly    from zero, suggesting that, on average, risk-restraining        factors just offset

risk-shifting incentives.

    To test Hypothesis       4 about how risk-restraining      factors differ across banks, we use

interactive   dummy variables to estimate ~ 1 separately for two groups of banks: those

whose leverage in the preceding quarter lay below (d = O) and above (d = 1) the 90th

sample percentile.       The results reject Hypothesis 4 at the ten percent level: a significantly

positive beta emerges from the interactive             variable when d = 1.      This indicates     that

regulatory    discipline    failed to prevent undercapitalized        banks from increasing         their

deposit insurance subsidy. For well-capitalized          banks, the coefficient is insignificant.

                                   Ill. Robustness       of Results

    In this section we examine the sensitivity of our findings to misspecification           and other

statistical problems.      Overall, our sensitivity tests support the hypothesis of risk-shifting

and indicate that risk-restraining     factors in 1985-1994 were weak.

A. Simultaneity Bias and Errors-in-Variables

    In principle, a bank’s leverage and the volatility of its asset returns are simultaneously

determined.       Neglecting the simultaneity    between these variables could bias inferences

about risk restraints.     Bias could also exist because the unobservable explanatory variable

is inevitably measured with error.




                                                                                                       14
    An imperfect way to deal with simultaneity bias and errors-in-variables                     problem is to

use instrumental-variable       (IV) estimators.       A candidate         for an instrument        must be

correlated      with the true regressor, but contemporaneously             uncorrelated     with the error

term. A workable (but potentially unreliable) approach is to substitute the predetermined

(lagged) values for the imperfectly observed regressor.            Because we correct for first-order

autocorrelation     in residuals by quasi-differencing,        we introduce the second lag of the

explanatory variable as our instrument.

    We have already used IV estimation for the pooled regressions relating bank leverage

ratios to asset risk, c,.    We now apply the same approach to the pooled regressions                     of

risk-adjusted     deposit insurance premiums.        The results reported in Panel B of Table 7

strengthen our earlier conclusions:        undercapitalized    institutions    successfully increase the

value of their deposit insurance guarantee, but well-capitalized                 institutions    do not and

may indeed not want to.

    The IV versions of time-series         tests of hypotheses      1 and 2 portray risk-restraining

factors as even weaker than our more-restrictive              tests did.      At 5 percent, the relation

between leverage and asset risk proves significantly negative for only three banks.                     The

number rises only to 10 banks at ten percent.            The relation between deposit insurance

premium, IPP, and asset risk is significantly positive for 12 banks (15 at ten percent).

    Although a bank can change its risk exposure overnight, using predetermined                       values

requires us to look at relations between leverage and asset risk that are measured half a

year apart. These IV-model results support the hypothesis that regulatory controls on risk

shifting operate with substantial lags.

B. Ratio Speci..cation      of the Model




                                                                                                          15
    It is also desirable to investigate the effect of coefficient restraints that are built into

every ratio specification.       The models we estimated earlier place implicit restrictions       on

the coefficient     estimates.      For example,      equation      (9) for the regressand   B/V    is

mathematically     equivalent to:

                                       B=~OV+~lVOv           +VE.                               (16)

An unrestricted    version of equation (16) introduces two potentially nonzero terms (with

coefficients y. and y2 ):

                                 ~=yo+y,v+y~o”+y~vov+v.                                         (17)

To test for the appropriateness      of restricting y. = O and y2 = O one may estimate equation

(17).

    For 34 banks, the coefficient restrictions imposed by (9) are not supported by the data.

The number of banks with strong risk-restricting          factors (y3 <O) decreases from 33 in the

restricted   single-equation     regression   (15) to on]y 12,       The number of banks with a

positive relation between leverage and asset risk increases from none to seven.

    Similarly, we estimate an unrestricted version of equation (10). The restrictions              are

not supported for 21 banks.         The number of risk-shifting        banks increases from five to

nine. Again, these results strengthen our initial findi rigs.

                                 IV. Summary and Conclusions

    U.S. experience with state deposit-insurance          systems (Calomiris,   1992) and corporate

finance theory hold that weaknesses in deposit insurance pricing and capital enforcement

encourage banks to extract deposit insurance subsidies by increasing their risk exposure.

To test this hypothesis, we decompose it into three parts.




                                                                                                    16
    The first part looks to measure                the strength      of regulatory    enforcement    as an

intensifying    risk-restraining     factor.     We remove definitional         simultaneity   built in the

model used by Duan et al. (1992) to eliminate a bias in previous single-equation                 estimates

of the tested parameters.      In contrast to the biased procedure, our tests indicate that risk-

restraining factors are weak.

    The second part of our tests investigates the frequency of risk shifting among sample

banks.     Our results indicate that about five percent of the sampled banks succeeded in

increasing their deposit insurance subsidy consistently over observation periods of four to

ten years.

    A third set of tests focuses on endogenous risk-shifting by banks in periods for which

benefits     from increasing       deposit     insurance   subsidy    promise    to be extremely     high.

Consistent with finance theory, we affirm that risk-shifting behavior is concentrated at the

financially weakest banks.

    An array of sensitivity tests establi~h the robustness of our principal finding: troubled

U.S. banks actively engaged in risk-shifting during 1985-1994 and the regulatory system

failed to restrain this behavior adequately.

        The Relation between Bank Leverage and Asset Risk: Time-Series Tests
Time series tests of Hypothesis   1: al 20.     The al is the slope coefficient in the following structural model:

                                              Bji / Vj( = %j + ~(j~vjt + Ejt.                                                  (9)
where Bjl / Vjl is the leverage, ~vj( is the annualized standard deviation of asset returns for bank j in quarter
t.
The table below reports two estimates of al: a direct estimate from linear model (9) and an estimate from
the following reduced form nonlinear regression:

                         Bjt / Vjt = (%j +   aljGEjL ) 1 [ 1 + ~lj~Ejl   pN(xlj,)   /   N(xz,OI+ Cjt                          (15)

where ~EJ,is the annualized stand~d deviation of equity returns for bank j in quarter t, p = 0.97, N(.) is the
standard normal c.d.f,, and xl and X2are defined as follows:

Hypothesis   2: ~1 20.   The ~1 is the slope coefficient in the following regression:

                                                 IPPjl = ~Oji+    ~tavjl    + &jt ,                                             (lo)

where IPPj( is the risk-adjusted insurance premium per dollar of insured deposits, ~vjt is the annualized
standard deviation of asset returns for bank j in quarter t.
Hypothesis 4: ~1*SO. The ~1’ is the first slope coefficient in the following regression:

                                        IPPjt = ~ojt + ~l]d~vj~ + ~l”(l-d)ovj,        +   <jl ,                                   (12)

where d = 1 for undercapitalized        institutions and O otherwise.

Panel A: Pooled regression tests of Hypotheses 2 and 4 using the fixed-effects                        model with bank- and time-
