                                              ABSTRACT

By exploiting a unique health insurance benefit design, we provide novel evidence on the causal association
between outpatient and inpatient care. Our results indicate that greater outpatient spending was associated
with more hospital admissions: a $100 increase in outpatient spending was associated with a 2.7%
increase in the probability of having an inpatient event and a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among
enrollees in our sample. Moreover, we present evidence that the increase in hospital admissions associated
with greater outpatient spending was for conditions in which it is plausible to argue that the physician
and patient could exercise discretion.

1. Introduction

        There are plausible scenarios in which a trip to the doctor’s office leads to the detection

and successful treatment of a condition that, if left untreated, would result in illness and

hospitalization. For example, hyperlipidemia, if untreated, is significantly associated with

coronary artery disease, but appropriate diagnosis and treatment with statins substantially

reduces future illness and hospitalization. However, there are equally plausible scenarios in

which a visit to the doctor leads to a referral to a specialist for additional evaluation and potential

invasive treatment for a condition that, if left untreated, would resolve itself in time (or is best

left untreated). For example, a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) exam for prostate cancer that is

abnormally high may lead to a referral to a urologist, a biopsy and surgery.

        These two tests for common illnesses are illustrative examples of primary care, one

effective and cost reducing and the other ineffective and cost increasing, that are central to the

current health care reform debate. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA)

includes several provisions that bolster the supply of primary care physicians and subsidize

receipt of primary care. Underlying this policy is the belief that primary care is preventive and

cost reducing (see, for example, Starfield et al. 2005; Rittenhouse and Shortell 2009). In

addition, the expansion of health insurance coverage, which is also a prominent part of the ACA,

is often justified with references to the cost-effectiveness of primary care, which is known to

increase among newly insured persons. On the other hand, almost everyone agrees that there is

significant waste in the US health care system. Important evidence supporting the waste

argument comes from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (e.g., Wennberg et al. 2005; Fisher et

al. 2009). The Dartmouth view is that much spending on medical care is due to “supply-

sensitive” care, which is care that is intensive (e.g., many visits to specialist), expensive (e.g.,



                                                   2
invasive procedures), and driven by provider preferences (e.g., no clearly defined evidence-based

guidelines). Much of this “supply sensitive” care has little proven health benefits. If the

Dartmouth view is correct, then greater insurance coverage and greater use of primary care will

result in more hospitalizations because visits to the doctor often result in aggressive treatment

that involves hospitalization and arguably little health benefit (Fisher et al. 2009).

         Empirical evidence on the association between primary (outpatient) care and inpatient

care is sparse, particularly evidence that may be interpreted as causal, despite the importance of

this relationship to health economics and health policy. Research that comes closest to providing

such evidence are studies that examine the association between health insurance status and

hospitalizations because of the known increase in primary care that comes with insurance

coverage.1 Three recent studies provide mixed evidence as to the association between health

insurance coverage and hospitalization using quasi-experimental methods. Using a regression

discontinuity design, Anderson et al. (2012) found that young adults who lost family health

insurance coverage had significantly lower rates of emergency department use and hospital

admissions than those who did not lose family health insurance coverage. Kolstad and Kowalski

(2010) examined the Massachusetts health care reform and found that gaining insurance was

associated with a decrease in hospital admissions through emergency department, an increase in

hospital admissions through other channels, and no change in total hospitalizations. Miller

(2011), who also studied the Massachusetts reform, found that reform was associated with a

decrease in outpatient emergency room visits, particularly those that are preventable with

primary care.



1
 However, health insurance changes the price of both inpatient and outpatient care and studies of the association
between health insurance and hospitalization do not necessarily provide information on the association between
primary care and hospitalization.

                                                         3
         Experimental findings from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) showed that

health insurance coverage (i.e., more generous coverage) was associated with an increase in use

of emergency room services and hospitalization (Newhouse 1993). Specifically, emergency

department use was 30% to 35% lower for those with the least generous insurance (95%

coinsurance) than for those with the insurance plan that paid all costs (i.e., free plan), and any

use of inpatient services was 25% lower for those with the least generous insurance (95%

coinsurance) than for those with the insurance plan that paid all costs. Similarly, evidence from

the Oregon Medicaid experiment also shows that obtaining health insurance, in this case,

Medicaid, is positively associated with hospitalization (Finkelstein et al. 2011).

         Another line of research related to the question of whether outpatient and inpatient care

are substitutes or complements are studies examining the association between changes in

prescription drug use (or prices), which is a distinct type of outpatient care, and use of inpatient

services. There have been several studies and the evidence from these studies is mixed.2 For

example, Chandra et al. (2010) reported that increases in co-payments for prescription drugs

among employees in the California Public Employees Retirement System were associated with a

decrease in the use of prescription drugs and an increase in the probability of hospitalization.

However, Kaestner and Khan (2012) found that gaining prescription drug insurance through

Medicare Part D was associated with a 28% increase in prescription drug use, a 45% increase in

spending on prescription drugs, and no change in inpatient spending among a sample of

Medicare recipients drawn from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey. Results from other

studies offer similarly mixed evidence. More importantly, the evidence from these studies is

(2006); Chandra et al. (2010); Afendulis et al. (2011); McWilliams et al. (2011); and Kaestner and Khan (2012).

                                                         4
limited by the focus on prescription drugs, which is an important, but small part of outpatient

care.

        In sum, there is virtually no evidence, particularly evidence that can be interpreted as

causal, as to whether outpatient and inpatient care are substitutes or complements. This is an

important gap in knowledge because of the importance of this question to understanding how the

health care market operates. Evidence as to whether outpatient and inpatient care are substitutes

or complements is central to both health economics and health policy.

        In this paper, we obtain estimates of the association between outpatient and inpatient

care. To our knowledge, ours is the first study to directly assess whether outpatient and inpatient

care are substitutes or complements. Importantly, the research design underlying our empirical

analysis supports the case for interpreting our estimates as causal. Our research takes advantage

of a unique health insurance benefit design in which funds contained in a savings account

(technically a health reimbursement arrangement or HRA) can by design only be used to pay for

outpatient and pharmacy services, not inpatient care and outpatient surgery services. The

inability to use HRA dollars for inpatient care, in contrast to the better known Health Savings

Account (HSA) products, is the key to our research design because it provides an exogenous

change in the price of outpatient care without affecting the price of inpatient care. Capitalizing

on the exogenous change in outpatient plan features contrasts to other studies that, for example,

focus on the association between health insurance or changes in health insurance benefits and

inpatient care, because the changes typically alter the price of both outpatient and inpatient care.

The design was a feature marketed by the insurer intended to prevent a costly hospitalization

from depleting the account balance. The insurance product was designed and sold by a health




                                                  5
insurer offering exclusively high-deductible health plans on a full replacement basis in the small

group market.

       Results of our analysis indicate that a $100 (4%) increase in outpatient spending was

associated with a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among employees in the employer-

sponsored insurance plans in our sample. Moreover, the increase in hospital admissions

associated with greater outpatient spending was concentrated among conditions in which there is

significant geographical variation in admission rates and for which physicians exercise

considerable discretion—care consistent with “supply sensitive” treatment that has been shown

to be without clinical evidence of its effectiveness. In contrast, there was no association between

outpatient spending and admissions for low-discretion (variation) procedures such as major

cardiovascular care or for births.

2. Setting and Data

       Data for the empirical analysis are drawn from the universe of claims for a small

Midwestern health insurance company that was an early leader in the “consumer-driven” health

plan market. The data include claims and enrollment information for employees and their

dependents within firms offering a high-deductible health plan sponsored by the health insurance

company from 2000 through mid-2006. We have information on all paid claims for inpatient,

outpatient, and pharmaceutical services throughout the policy year. We use only observations

that included full policy years. In addition, we have information on health plan characteristics

including HRA “deposits” at the beginning of each policy year, roll-over account balances from

the prior year, deductible amount, coinsurance rates for both in- and out-of-network care (the

claims data contain an indicator for network status of the provider), out-of-pocket maximum




                                                 6
levels, and copayments for pharmaceuticals. Employers are able to change plan characteristics

annually.

         The HRA plan design used notional (non-transferable) accounts for first-dollar coverage

of pre-specified health care purchases. Employers and employees could fund their accounts on a

tax-free basis and unspent dollars roll over into subsequent years. As noted earlier, a key feature

of the insurance plan design was that HRA dollars could not be used to pay for expenditures

associated with inpatient care or outpatient surgery; a separate hospital and surgery deductible is

specified in the benefit design to impose cost-sharing on that type of utilization. Note that this

plan feature is distinct from HSA designs, which allow account dollars to be used for inpatient

and outpatient health care expenditures.3 Another advantageous feature of the HRA plans in our

study is that the insurer sold the insurance policies exclusively on a total replacement basis;

employers do not offer competing plans from this or other insurers and almost all firms offer just

one insurance plan to employees.4 Therefore, employees do not choose among insurance plans

and we do not have to address the selection issue that comes from employee plan choice. We

limit our sample to firms that had five or more enrollees because of the possibility that changes

in health and use of services for specific enrollees will determine insurance plan features. In

larger firms, insurance plan features are plausibly exogenous with respect to individual enrollee

behavior.5




3
  The insurer began offering HSAs after they were created in the 2004 Medicare Modernization Act, but given the
timing of our data very few firms offered them to employees. A small number of enrollees (<1%) were dropped
because they were enrolled in HSAs.
4
  A small number, 3%, of employers offered more than one plan design to employees in the study period. Most
commonly, employees could select a higher or lower deductible option. However, results reported below did not
change appreciably when these few employers were excluded from the sample.
5
  Results are virtually unchanged if we limit the sample to firms with 10 employees, suggesting that results are not
being driven by employer-responses to employee health care spending, which are more likely to occur in very small
firms.

                                                         7
           Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for individual enrollees by policy year. Our data

include 2,380 company-years representing 959 unique firms. Note that the period represents the

start-up period for the insurer’s operation, which began operation in 2000, thus there are very

few employers in the early years. We limit the analysis to firms with information for full policy

years. Therefore, because our data only include completed policy years ending by 7/31/06 the

number of firms (observations) in the sample is reduced substantially in 2005. The average firm

size is approximately 25 employees. The average age of the employee is about 40 years.6 In just

over half of cases the employee is a single enrollee. Not surprisingly, and consistent with

national trends, spending in all categories increased over time. Outpatient spending increased

from $2350 in 2001 to $2872 in 2005 and average pharmaceutical spending more than doubled

over the period. The fraction of enrollees using inpatient services stayed relatively constant at

15% over the period, though average spending on inpatient care increased.

3. Research Design and Econometric Methods

           Our objective is to obtain estimates of the association between outpatient care (spending)

and inpatient care (spending). This empirical objective is motivated by two hypotheses grounded

in theory as to the causes of an association between outpatient care (spending) and inpatient care

(spending). The first hypothesis is that outpatient care consists of treatments that repair health

subsequent to illness and/or prevent illness. This hypothesis is consistent with the human capital

model of the demand for health and health care (Grossman 1972). In this case, outpatient care is

health improving and, all else equal, will decrease inpatient care, which is an indicator of serious

illness. The all else equal assumption is particularly important because the association between

the quantity of outpatient and inpatient care is almost surely positive if health (shocks) are not

well measured. The second hypothesis is that outpatient care consists of treatments that have

    For family units the characteristics represent the employee.

                                                             8
little value in terms of repairing health or preventing illness. This hypothesis is consistent with

theories of physician agency and supplier induced demand (e.g., McGuire 2000), and the

geographical variation in treatments documented by the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. In this

case, more outpatient care results in greater inpatient care, as physicians exercise discretion and

treat marginal illnesses “aggressively” using intensive, inpatient care. The two hypotheses are

not mutually exclusive and it is highly likely that outpatient care has characteristics consistent

with both hypotheses. Here, we estimate the average association between outpatient and inpatient

care.

        Ideally, our estimates are interpretable as causal estimates. To obtain such estimates, we

estimate the following regression model:



(1)



                              .



In equation (1), inpatient utilization (i.e., any use) of employee/family i in firm j in year t

depends on a firm-specific fixed effect,     , year fixed effects,   , coinsurance for in-network care

(COIN), coinsurance for out-of-network care (COOUT), the hospital-specific deductible

(HOSPDEDUCT), the out-of-pocket maximum (OOPMAX), and personal characteristics (X) of

the employee/family (e.g., age, gender, number of dependents, year of tenure in the plan). Our

interest is in the effect of outpatient spending (OUTSPEND) on inpatient use. Note that only

those plan features that will affect inpatient spending directly are included because we include




                                                   9
outpatient spending in equation (1), and plan characteristics that affect outpatient spending such

as the outpatient deductible and the employee HRA are omitted.

         The main challenge in estimating equation (1) is that outpatient spending may be

influenced by unmeasured characteristics that also affect inpatient spending, most notably health

status. Additionally, there is a mechanical, reverse causal relationship in which inpatient care

necessitates follow-up outpatient treatment. To address the potential endogeneity concern we use

an instrumental variables approach. The instruments for outpatient spending are the employer’s

contribution to the spending account (HRA) and other benefit design features that are determined

prior to the start of the year and affect only the cost of outpatient use. For example, a change in

the amount of employer’s contribution to the HRA, which by design is only relevant to

outpatient spending, will affect outpatient use, but not inpatient use beyond how outpatient use

affects inpatient use.7

         The identifying assumption of the instrumental variables approach is that employers

make decisions regarding HRA contributions and other benefit design features independently of

employee health and preferences for health care. Plausible explanations for employer changes in

benefit design include the rising costs of health care, changes in firm profitability or the firm’s

competitive position that affect decisions about compensation (including health care benefits),

and potential adjustments to a new benefit plan for which the firm had no prior experience. It is

important to note that equation (1) includes firm-specific fixed effects that control for time

invariant employer-specific factors that might be associated with both health care spending and

health plan characteristics. Below, we present evidence that supports the identification

assumption underlying the instrumental variables approach.

7
  It is possible that an employer’s contribution to the account could have an income effect on the household and thus
indirectly change inpatient spending, but given the relatively small magnitudes involved the size of such an effect
would be exceedingly small.

                                                         10
         In Table 2, we present data on benefit plan characteristics that are the source of variation

used to instrument for outpatient spending. The figures in Table 2 have been adjusted for the

changing composition of firms in order to provide a description of how plan features have

changed over time within firm, which is the key source of variation that we use to obtain

estimates of the association between inpatient and outpatient spending. The values in Table 2

indicate that employers tend to decrease plan generosity systematically over time: employer

account contributions fall over time within firm by approximately $100 per year and the

outpatient deductible increases by approximately $50 per year. 8 The observed changes represent

compelling and substantial sources of within-firm variation in outpatient benefit generosity that

are expected to affect outpatient spending decisions by enrollees. Importantly, the changes

pertain only to outpatient spending and therefore provide a source of plausibly exogenous

variation to identify the association between inpatient and outpatient spending.

         The specification of the first stage model used to predict outpatient spending is:



(2)

                                                                                                  .



In equation (2), outpatient spending depends on the following excluded instruments that by

design can only affect outpatient spending: employer contribution to the account


8 We do not directly observe the employer contributions to the HRA in our data because the insurer only recorded
the total contribution to the account balance at the beginning of the year. Nevertheless, we are able to proxy for the
employer’s contribution by determining the minimum observed account balance measured at the beginning of the
policy year among employees in firm j and year t. The minimum account balance is specific to employees in each
coverage option: single, employee plus one dependent, employee plus two or more dependents. Hence to the extent
that at least one employee in each coverage option-firm-year cell chooses not to contribute to their account (the
calculation excludes rollover dollars), our approach will identify the true contribution of the firm to the account. If
all employees contribute some amount to the HRA, the minimum observed amount is a reasonable proxy to the
generosity of the employer contribution. See Lo Sasso et al. (2010) for additional details.

                                                          11
(EMPCONTRIB), the outpatient deductible (OUTDEDUCT), and the pharmacy copayment level

(COPAY). In addition, the other plan features that may affect inpatient care and personal

characteristics described in equation (1) are included in the model.

        Instrumental variables estimates obtained from equations (1) and (2) represent local

average treatment effects (LATE). As illustrated in Table 2 the primary sources of variation

driving changes in outpatient care are changes in employer contributions to the HRA and

changes in the outpatient deductible. Thus the employees who are induced to alter their

consumption of outpatient care are a relatively healthy group of employees and unlikely to be

chronically ill.

        To this point we have ignored dynamic aspects of the problem. However, outpatient care

this year may affect inpatient care in the subsequent year. That is, outpatient spending in period t

may result in treatment that improves health in period t+1 and reduces inpatient care in period

t+1. Such a direct relationship between lagged outpatient spending and future inpatient care is

consistent with the human capital model of the demand for health and the hypothesis that

primary care is preventive and cost reducing. Alternatively, if outpatient spending involves

largely “supply sensitive” care then previous outpatient spending has little effect on current

health (perhaps even a negative effect) and will have little influence on current inpatient care. In

fact, outpatient spending in period t that is largely “supply sensitive” may increase inpatient care

in period t+1 because of the persistence of such physician-induced care.

        To summarize, if outpatient care is largely preventive in nature and health improving,

then it may have dynamic effects that reduce future inpatient care (and outpatient care).

Alternatively, if outpatient care is “supply sensitive” in nature with little health benefit, then

lagged outpatient care may have dynamic effects that either have no association or a positive



                                                  12
association with current inpatient care. In order to assess the influence of lagged outpatient

spending on current inpatient care, we reformulate our model as:



(3)



                              ,



where inpatient use in time t is function of lagged outpatient use. We are able to instrument for

lagged outpatient spending with same (lagged) instrument set described earlier. The specification

of equation (3) yields estimates of the total effect of lagged outpatient spending on inpatient care

that includes the direct association and the indirect associations that operate through current

outpatient spending and lagged inpatient spending. If outpatient spending is truly preventive, and

the relationship is dynamic, we expect the estimate of the association between lagged outpatient

spending and inpatient care to be negative. One necessary compromise in the lagged

specification is that it requires three, not two, years of consecutive enrollment by firms, thus

reducing our sample size considerably.

       We also estimate an alternative specification in which we include current outpatient

spending in the model:



(4)

                                                                     .




                                                 13
The only difference between equations (3) and (4) is the inclusion of contemporaneous

outpatient spending. Including current outpatient spending eliminates the indirect association

between lagged outpatient spending and inpatient care that operates through current outpatient

spending.

4. Results

4.a. First Stage—Associations between Plan Characteristics and Outpatient Spending

           Table 3 displays estimates of the effect of a hypothetical $100 increase in the employer

contribution to the HRA on outpatient spending.9 The employer contribution is only one of three

excluded instruments in our model, but it provides a representative breakdown of how the

change in outpatient care is manifested. The estimate indicates that an additional $100

contribution to the HRA account yields a $32 increase in outpatient spending. The estimate is

statistically significant suggesting a strong first stage relationship between the employer’s

contribution to the HRA and outpatient spending.10

           In order to understand what components of outpatient care change when the employer

contribution changes, we estimated similar first-stage regression models for three major

components of outpatient spending plus a residual category, which we refer to as “other”. The

three non-residual components of outpatient spending are outpatient specialty services that

includes services provided by otorhinolaryngology, pulmonologist, allergist, neurologist,

dermatology, and rehabilitation, among others; spending on office visits defined as office-based

evaluation and management for new or established patients ranging from 10 minutes to 1 hour;

and spending on prescription drugs. Estimates indicate that a $100 increase in employer

contribution to the HRA is associated with a $11 increase in spending on outpatient specialty

services; an $8 increase in spending associated with office visits; a $6 increase in spending on

prescription drugs; and a $7 increase in “other” outpatient spending. The results in Table 3

suggest that a more generous employer contribution to the account leads patients to visit the

doctor’s office more frequently (25% of the total effect), which in turn leads to referrals to

outpatient specialty care (one-third of the total effect) and some change in pharmaceutical use

(20% of the total effect). In the next section we consider whether the observed increases in

outpatient care are associated with changes in inpatient utilization.

4.b. Associations between Inpatient and Outpatient Spending

        Table 4 reports OLS and instrumental variables (2SLS) estimates of the association

between inpatient spending and outpatient spending. Two dependent variables are used: a binary

variable representing the presence of any inpatient spending and the amount of inpatient

spending. For each dependent-independent variable combination, we estimate two model

specifications that differ according to whether we include age by gender interaction terms. We

provide the alternative specifications to assess whether changes in employee characteristics over

time that are known to affect health and spending on medical care affect estimates. If the age-

gender interaction terms have little effect on our main coefficient of interest, it is evidence in

support of the research design. We present estimates of equation (1) for both dependent variables

obtained using linear regression methods.11

        OLS estimates in the left hand side of Table 4 indicate that a $100 increase in outpatient

spending is associated with a 0.2 percentage point increase in the probability of having any

inpatient spending. IV estimates indicate that a $100 increase in outpatient spending is associated

with a 0.4 percentage point (2.7% of mean) increase in the probability of having any inpatient

11
  We have also estimated binary models and, for analyses of inpatient spending, generalized linear models using a
gamma distribution with log link. Estimates from the alternative models were very similar to the linear models and
are available upon request of the authors.

spending. To put this estimate in context, consider that the employer contribution to the HRA

account declined by approximately $500 on average between 2000 and 2005. Using the estimate

from Table 3, this decline in the employer contribution is associated with a $160 decrease in

annual outpatient spending. Based on the estimate of the association between outpatient spending

and the probability of any inpatient care, this $160 decrease in outpatient spending decreased the

probability of having any inpatient care by 4.4%. This is a clinically and economically

significant effect of the observed change in the employer contribution to the HRA account. Also

note that the addition of age-by-gender interaction terms to the model has virtually no effect,

which suggest that changes in employee composition are not affecting estimates. Not

surprisingly, given the results in Table 3, the F-statistics for the joint significance of the excluded

instruments are between 23 and 25 depending on the model. Also, we fail to reject the null

hypothesis in the over-identification test, which is important evidence supporting the validity of

the research design.

       The right hand panel of Table 4 presents estimates of associations between outpatient

spending and inpatient spending. The OLS estimate of the association between outpatient

spending and inpatient spending indicates that a $100 increase in outpatient spending is

associated with a $77 (4 percent) increase in inpatient spending. The 2SLS estimate of same

relationship indicates a slightly larger effect size of $89 (4.6%). Consider the effect of the $160

decrease in outpatient spending as a result of the change in average employer contributions

between 2000 and 2005 on inpatient spending. Such a decrease in outpatient spending decreased

inpatient spending by $144.

        Table 5 presents estimates from the simple, dynamic model described earlier. Here, we

allow for a lagged effect of outpatient spending. We focus our discussion on the instrumental



                                                  16
variables estimates. The estimate of the association between lagged outpatient spending and any

inpatient care is 0.0025 and statistically significant. The IV estimate of the association between

lagged outpatient spending and inpatient spending is positive, small and not statistically

significant. Notably, both estimates are positive, which is inconsistent with the argument that

outpatient care is largely preventive and more consistent with the argument that outpatient care is

largely of the “supply sensitive” type.

       Estimates presented in the third and fourth columns of Table 5 are obtained from a model

that includes both lagged and current outpatient spending. IV estimates of associations between

lagged outpatient spending and inpatient spending are small and not statistically significant.

Overall, estimates in Table 5 suggest that lagged outpatient spending has little effect on current

inpatient care, which is evidence inconsistent with the argument that the association between

outpatient spending and inpatient care is dynamic and that outpatient spending is largely

preventive.

       In contrast, IV estimates of associations between current outpatient spending and

inpatient care in Table 5 remain positive, statistically significant and more or less the same

magnitude as estimates obtained from models that omit lagged outpatient spending. So again, we

find evidence consistent with the argument that, on average, outpatient care increases the

quantity and spending on downstream care (i.e., inpatient care).

       In order to assess what types of inpatient conditions are affected by changes in outpatient

care, we examined the association between outpatient spending and inpatient admissions grouped

by the amount of geographical variation in admission rates. Geographical variation in inpatient

admissions is often used as a marker for physician discretion—decisions for which there is

uncertainty over whether an admission is necessary and/or clinically beneficial (Sirovich et al.



                                                 17
2008). Changes in outpatient care should plausibly have larger effects on high-variation hospital

admissions for which there is a great deal of physician discretion than for low-variation hospital

admissions for which there is little physician discretion. For example, we might expect to

observe some enrollees induced into back and neck surgical procedures and other care that is

subject to greater physician discretion when people are exogenously exposed to greater amounts

of outpatient care.

       We grouped hospital admissions into categories using diagnosis related group (DRG)

codes and the classification system employed by Silber et al. (2010) that was developed to

distinguish between inpatient events with low variation across providers (example: major

cardiovascular procedures), middle variation across providers (example: laparoscopic

cholecystectomy), and high variation across providers (example: spinal fusion surgery). The full

list of procedures and DRG codes is available in Appendix Table 2.

       Table 6 presents estimates of associations between outpatient spending and hospital

admission rates classified by the extent of potential provider discretion. Estimates are generally

consistent with expectations. Changes in outpatient spending have minimal effect for low

variation procedures, and the effect size increases in absolute value with the degree of variation

in care. High variation inpatient care, including back and shoulder procedures increase

significantly when individuals use more outpatient health care services. A $100 (4%) increase in

outpatient spending is associated with a 0.1 percentage point (5% of mean) increase in the

probability of admission for a high-variation condition.

       We also assessed whether outpatient spending had an association with hospital

admissions for ambulatory-care sensitive (ACS) conditions. ACS conditions are widely thought

to be preventable when access to primary care is unimpeded and have been defined by the



                                                18
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) as Prevention Quality Indicators (PQIs)

and include admissions for diabetes complications, hypertension, asthma, and bacterial

pneumonia (AHRQ 2012). Previous work has examined ambulatory care sensitive conditions as

an outcome in different populations that could be affected by insurance coverage (e.g., Bindman

et al. 1995; Pappas et al. 1997; Shi et al. 1999; Kaestner et al. 2001; Dafny and Gruber 2005). If

outpatient spending is largely prevention, then the association between outpatient spending and

ACS admissions is expected to be negative. However, the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care has

examined ambulatory care sensitive conditions and documented that admission rates for these

conditions are highly variable across geography, at least in the Medicare population. The high

degree of geographic variation implies that the ambulatory care sensitive conditions identified by

AHRQ and others may be more discretionary than the developers of these measures believe.

Specifically, the Dartmouth authors write: “When science-based guidelines are weak, physicians

must be guided by their subjective opinions about the effectiveness of admitting such patients to

hospitals, rather than providing treatment in another setting. Hospitalization rates for these – and

for most medical conditions – are also highly correlated with the local supply of hospital beds”

(Dartmouth Atlas 2012).

       The fourth column of Table 6 presents the instrumental variables estimate of the

association between outpatient spending and admission for an ambulatory-care sensitive

condition. Consistent with Dartmouth Atlas view, we find that increases in outpatient spending

results in a statistically significant increase in hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive

conditions. The effect size, 0.07 percentage points, is close to the estimate associated with high-

variation admissions.




                                                  19
        Finally, we examined whether outpatient spending was associated with births. Births

represent largely a falsification test related to the measurement of key variables in our

specification. While there is little reason to expect increases in the employer contribution to the

HRA to have a causal effect on births, if savings account contributions were improperly

measured or if employer contributions were altered based on potential health care need an effect

might manifest when examining births. Thus it is reassuring that the effect of outpatient spending

on births is very close to zero and statistically insignificant.

5. Conclusion

        An important issue in assessing recent health care reform is the likely costs and benefits

of expanded access to primary care. Proponents of expanded use of primary care often argue that

in addition to improving health, expanded primary care use may reduce the costs of health care

because increased contact with primary care providers will allow for greater detection of

previously unknown and untreated conditions, hence leading to reduced hospitalizations. In this

article, we take advantage of a unique health insurance benefit design to assess the causal

relationship between outpatient services and hospitalization.

        Using proprietary data from an insurer, we employ an instrumental variables strategy to

investigate whether variation in the use of outpatient services were associated with changes in

hospitalizations. To our knowledge, ours if the first paper to provide such estimates, at least

estimates that are plausibly interpretable as causal. Estimates indicated that greater outpatient

spending was associated with more hospital admissions and greater inpatient spending. For

example, a $100 increase in outpatient spending was associated with a 2.7% increase in the

probability of having an inpatient event and a 4.6% increase in inpatient spending among

employees in the employer-sponsored insurance plans in our sample. Moreover, we presented



                                                   20
evidence that the increase in hospital admissions associated with greater outpatient spending was

for conditions in which it is plausible to argue that the physician could exercise more

discretion—treat “aggressively”. In contrast, there was no association between outpatient

spending and admissions for births or low-variation procedures such as major cardiovascular

care.

        The nearly dollar for dollar positive association between changes in outpatient spending

and changes in inpatient spending has significant implications for both theory and policy. In

terms of theory, our results suggest that outpatient spending and inpatient spending are

complements, at least at the margin for which our LATE estimates apply. More importantly, the

positive association between outpatient and inpatient spending that we find is not, as is often the

case, because unmeasured health confounds the association. Tests of the validity of the

instrumental variables research design we employed support its validity, which implies that

changes in outpatient spending that result from changes in insurance plan benefit designs are

plausibly exogenous. Thus, the positive association between outpatient spending and inpatient

spending we find is consistent with the Dartmouth view that much health care spending, in this

case outpatient spending, is “supply sensitive” and largely without substantial health benefit.

This result persisted even when we estimated a dynamic model that allowed lagged outpatient

spending to influence current inpatient care.

        It is interesting to note that the context of our results was a high-deductible, “consumer

driven” insurance plan with a focus on demand side cost sharing. Our results suggest that

consumers appear to respond significantly to changes in cost sharing, and that even though the

initial change in consumer health care use in response to changes in cost sharing is for relatively

low cost, outpatient care, there is also a decrease in subsequent use of more expensive inpatient



                                                 21
care. For example, the $500 average decrease in the employer contribution to the HRA that

occurred between 2000 and 2005 was associated with a $160 decrease in outpatient spending and

a $144 decrease in inpatient spending. Thus, total spending decreased by $304, or approximately

5%. Our results suggest that high deductible insurance plans targeted at reducing outpatient use

of services may be effective at reducing the discretionary use of inpatient services that other

researchers have suggested have marginal health benefit. The consumer-directed approach is a

contrast to administrative and supply-side approaches to reduce the same supposed unnecessary

use of services such as the establishment of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force that

identifies cost-effective prevention services that merit no cost sharing; the establishment of the

Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute; and payment reforms linking payments to clinical

outcomes and how the delivery of care is organized (e.g., accountable care organizations).

       Overall, the findings from our study are consistent with the argument made in Sirovich et

al. (2008) and others associated with the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care. In this view, using

more primary care services leads to more hospitalizations as a result of physicians’ discretionary

decisions regarding aggressive and intensive treatment. Cleary not all physicians need to practice

medicine in an “aggressive” treatment style for such findings to obtain; when individuals are

exogenously induced to use more outpatient care through a more generous insurance plan design,

enrollees merely need to have a positive probability of seeing a physician with an aggressive

treatment style. In addition, health insurance has a direct effect on hospitalization because it

lowers the price of inpatient care. The implication of these findings is that expanding health

insurance, as recent federal reform (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) proposes, will

be cost increasing. While the greater costs associated with increased use of primary care may




                                                 22
come with improvements in health, a hypothesis in need of more credible evidence, costs will

increase nevertheless. Claims that costs will decrease do not appear to be well founded.
