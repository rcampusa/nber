Health Plan Conversions: Are They in the Public Interest?

JEL No. I1, L3

                                           ABSTRACT

Recently, not-for-profit health plans have been converting to for-profit status and these conversions
have frequently occurred as steps to facilitate merger or acquisition with a for-profit company.
Some industry observers attribute these managed care market place trends to an industry shake out
resulting from increased competition in the sector. At the same time, the perceived competitive
pressures have led to questions about the long run viability of non-profit health plans. Furthermore,
some industry and government leaders believe that some non-profits are already conducting
themselves like for-profit health plans and question the state premium tax exemption ordinarily
accorded to such plans. This paper develops a framework for evaluating health plan conversions
and examines related health policy issues through the lens of a case study of the proposed
conversion of the CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield Company. Analyses demonstrate that CareFirst
wields substantial market power in some segments of its local market, that it is unlikely to realize
cost savings through expanded economies of scale, and that quality of care appears to be lower in
the plans typically acquiring converting health plans.

    1. Introduction

              In 1994, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) Association changed its by-laws to

    allow members to convert to public stock companies. This touched off a streak of

    conversions and health plan combinations. To date, 14 BCBS plans have converted to for-

    profit plans and a few more have conversions pending. There has also been consolidation

    among BCBS plans; in 1996 there were 63 BCBS plans in operation, in 2003 there are 41. In

    many instances BCBS plans have converted with the explicit intention of being acquired or

    merging with another firm; hence conversions and consolidation are intertwined. This has

    certainly been the case for two BCBS plans that have led the consolidation. Anthem, Inc. is a

    publicly-traded BCBS plan that was built up through the acquisition of exclusive BCBS

    licenses in 9 states. WellPoint, Inc. began with the conversion of the California Blue Cross

    Association and has grown to the largest BCBS company with operations in California,

    Georgia, and Missouri.1 There has been regional consolidation among non-profit BCBS

    plans as well (e.g. the Regence Group with operations in Washington, Oregon, Utah and

    Idaho).

              These changes among BCBS Association members have occurred against a backdrop

    of the growing presence of national managed care companies and for-profit health plans in

    the HMO industry. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, HMO enrollment increased 173% over the

    time period 1987 to 2001. Nearly three quarters of the increase is attributable to enrollment

    growth in for-profit health plans; 50% of the enrollment growth occurred in for-profit

    national managed care plans. Some industry analysts have argued that the rise of national

    managed care companies has precipitated conversion and consolidation among BCBS plans.

       Each of the conversion cases is unique. Local health plan markets are unique, and so

the health plans that operate in them evolve with a unique history. Thus, the evaluations of

specific conversion petitions (and possible acquisitions and mergers) must take into account

factors unique to each market. However, there are policy issues common to all conversions

and in this chapter I develop a framework for analyzing these issues and clarifying the trade-

offs faced by policymakers.

       Following a general discussion of the policy issues and the development of an

analytic framework, I present a case study analysis of a particular conversion petition. In

January of 2002, the CareFirst Corporation filed applications to convert to public stock

ownership with insurance commissioners in the states of Delaware and Maryland, and in the

District of Columbia. CareFirst’s conversion application was explicitly linked to subsequent

acquisition by Wellpoint Inc. I present analyses that were conducted for the public advocacy

organization, D.C. Appleseeds, to support its participation in the formal proceedings in

Washington D.C. At the end of this paper, I will discuss the information gaps that plague

research and policy analysis on this topic, opportunities for health economists to contribute to

policy in this arena, and the limitations and generalizability of my case study research.



2. Policy Issues in Health Plan Conversions

       Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans are not the only health plans to convert to public

stock ownership. However, the BCBS conversion petitions have sparked the most public

debate in part because of the special circumstances in which they were created and because

their conversion typically requires a formal determination by a regulatory official; some

conversions even require legislation. This chapter deals specifically with BCBS conversions;




                                             4
    however, several of the health policy issues are germane to other health plan conversions and

    more generally to the role of not-for-profit organizations in health care.


    Origins of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans

            Many of the health policy issues that arise in connection with the conversion to for-

    profit status of BCBS plans relate in some way to the original creation of the Blue Cross

    companies. As detailed in Blackstone and Fuhr (1998), most of the Blue Cross plans were

    initiated by the hospital industry in the 1920s and 1930s to provide hospital insurance at a

    time when hospitals had declining occupancy rates and escalating operating costs. Typically,

    these plans were established through state legislation as public benefit organizations and

    intended to serve as insurers of last resort. In enacting legislation to establish the

    Pennsylvania BC plan in 1937, Representative Herbert Cohen remarked:


        “The Legislature of Pennsylvania in approving this law was attempting to meet a severe
        need of providing citizens of Pennsylvania with hospital care at a cost within their means
        and also of providing hospitals with a source of financial support which would place
        them in a more stable financial position and therefore less dependent upon state and local
        tax funds. The Legislature therefore was attempting to fill a gap created by commercial
        insurance companies’ underwriting policies which left the mass of Pennsylvania citizens
        unprotected from hospitalization expenses and hospital bills in many instances unpaid.”2

            The plans were exempted from state income taxes on premiums and in return were

    subject to various regulations and charged with a public service commitment. Blue Shield

    plans were created to provide insurance for physician services. The two insurance

    associations merged into the BCBS Association in 1982.3

             Because these plans were chartered as tax-exempt organizations for public benefit,

    state insurance commissioners are obligated to assess whether conversion to a public stock

    company is in the public’s interest. In addition, in the case in which conversion precedes the

    sale of a BCBS plan,4 the insurance commissioner must ascertain that the public receives fair

    value for the plan from the acquirer. 5 In some instances, the proceeds of the sale are placed

    in a foundation; these funds are often used to meet the original objectives of the BCBS plans

    – to provide access to health care services for those in need.6

             In reaching a judgment on whether conversion advances the public interest, state

    insurance commissioners are likely to take into account the potential effects of conversion on

    multiple stakeholders. For example, the insurance commission will want to know how

    conversion will affect insurance coverage for vulnerable populations and reimbursement to

    providers. This analysis of the effects of conversion will require an understanding of how, if

    at all, the behavior or conduct of the health plan might change as a result of the conversion

    and potential sale or merger. There are at least six dimensions of health plan conduct that the

    insurance commissioner may consider:

             Products Offered and Markets Served. Most health plans offer a number of different

    health insurance products and some of these products are tailored for particular

    subpopulations. Products may differ on several dimensions (e.g. the provider network,

    reimbursement for care provided by providers not in the network, coinsurance and

 Most BCBS plans convert to a public stock company as a step toward merging with or being acquired by another
BCBS plan; the existence of publicly traded stock facilitates the ownership transfer and combination.
5
  One of the Association’s by-laws requires that the use of the BCBS trademark can only be acquired by another
BCBS plan.
6
  The financial proceeds from the conversion and sale or initial public offering of a BCBS plan do not always endow
a public trust or charitable foundation. Jamie Robinson describes the factors that led the state government to benefit
financially from the conversion of Empire, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of New York (“The Curious Conversion of
Empire Blue Cross,” Health Affairs, vol. 22(4):100-118, July/August 2003).


                                                          6
copayment rates, services covered (i.e. benefit design), and maximum payments under the

policy). In some states, not-for-profit health plans are required to offer plans in which any

person may enroll without regard to the individual’s age, employment status, health status, or

any other factor which might otherwise cause the individual to be denied health insurance.

These plans are sometimes referred to as open enrollment plans. In deciding on the set of

health insurance products to offer, health plans make implicit choices about whether to serve

certain subpopulations. For example, not all health plans choose to offer a Medicaid or

Medicare product; other noteworthy subpopulations include the small business segment, the

individual policy segment, and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).

       Quality of Care. There are a number of ways in which health plans can influence the

quality of health care services delivered to enrollees. Many of these levers require financial

outlays by the health plan for patient and physician education, information systems, and

program design and administration. For example, health plans may design and implement

chronic disease management programs.

       Quality of Service. Health plans have frequent interactions with enrollees about

coverage issues, the status of particular claims, and the plan’s provider network. The manner

in which these inquiries are resolved may not directly affect quality of care but may

indirectly affect access to care.

       Pricing and Underwriting Practices. In some states, health insurance premiums for

particular managed care products are community rated; this means that the insurance

regulator has eliminated the health plan’s pricing decision and requires all plans serving a

specific population to charge the same premium. In other states, premiums (and benefit

design) for some products are subject to review by the insurance regulator. In yet other




                                             7
    states, there is no regulatory oversight of health plan pricing policies. Depending on the

    regulatory regime of the state in which the health plan is operating, there may be additional

    scope for the health plan to adjust premiums based on the risk factors of the group (or

    individual) to be insured. These are the firms underwriting policies.

             Provider Networks and Reimbursement. In most states and for most products, health

    plans have a free hand in deciding which providers to include in their networks and in

    negotiating the level and the form of reimbursement for services delivered to enrollees.7

    Anecdotally, it is frequently noted that some health plans reimburse at levels substantially

    above or below other health plans in the same market. Health plans may institute other

    policies that make it more or less difficult for the physician to be reimbursed for health care

    services. For example, some providers criticize utilization review and pre-certification as

    burdensome interventions that increase physicians’ costs of delivering care and decrease

    patients’ access to care.

             Public and Community Health Efforts. Most health plans earmark some resources for

    outreach efforts intended to improve the health of community members irrespective of

    enrollment in the health plan. These efforts include such measures as free screening for

    certain diseases and public health education.

        Changes in the conduct of the health plan in any of the above mentioned areas could

influence access to health care, insurance coverage, the quality of health care services provided,

health status in the population, the financial health of providers, and the costs of health insurance

to individuals and employers.

  A recent Supreme Court ruling upheld so-called “any willing provider” laws enacted at the state level which
require health maintenance organizations to accept any qualified doctors who wants to join the HMO’s provider
network (“Justices: States can force HMOs to open networks,” by Bill Mears, CNN.com, April 2, 2003)


                                                        8
Necessary Conditions for Changes in Health Plan Conduct

        Whether the conversion or conversion/sale of a health plan is likely to alter the health

plan’s conduct on any of the above dimensions hinges on two conditions. First, depending on

the regulatory environment and the nature of the market in which the health plan operates, there

may or may not be scope for the plan to change its conduct on some of these dimensions. For

example, it may be that all health plans operating in a particular state, regardless of their tax

status, must reimburse hospitals according to the same mandated fee schedule. An alternative

potential constraint on health plan conduct may be present in the level of market competition.

Consultants to one health plan applying for conversion have argued that the market in which the

health plan was operating was so competitive as to effectively limit the prices the health plan

could charge and still attract enrollees.8

        The second condition necessary for a conversion or a conversion/sale to result in a

change of conduct is that such change must be expected to increase the (short or long term)

profitability of the health plan. Conceptually, a converting health plan could increase

profitability in three ways. First, it could terminate the practice of cross-subsidizing premiums

on unprofitable insurance products or subsidizing care delivery by certain providers. Eliminating

a subsidy or cross-subsidy could increase profits but only at the expense of one of the

stakeholders (i.e. some population of consumers or providers); thus this type of change in

conduct would amount to a value transfer from consumers and/or providers to shareholders.

        The second mechanism through which a converting health plan may increase profits is

through investment in new products and technologies. There are two examples in this category

that come to mind. Some market observers and participants allege that not-for-profit health

CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, January 2002.


                                                      9
plans have limited access to capital and therefore may be unable to make the necessary

investments that would lead to new products or lower costs. It may also be that non-profit health

plans are subject to some organizational inertia and that, while they possess the necessary

resources and capabilities, they do not feel compelled to innovate. This organizational inertia

could be attributable to insulation from competitive pressure afforded by the state tax exemption

on premiums. A change in conduct of this nature could lead to value creation since consumers

would benefit from new products and reduced costs.

       The third mechanism through which a converting health plan may increase profits is

through improved efficiency resulting from enhanced accountability and governance structures.

In non-profit organizations, the residual claimants to the surplus created by an organization are

unclear. Those who make decisions for the organization do not have a clear objective function;

consequently it is difficult to identify suitable performance measures, structure appropriate

incentives, and to hold decision-makers accountable. Reducing inefficiency through improved

accountability and governance structures is a value creating activity because it results in services

being delivered at the lowest cost to society overall.

       Recall that the insurance commissioner must make a determination of whether a

conversion is likely to advance the public interest. If the expected changes in health plan

behavior do not have the potential to create additional value and are simply a transfer from

consumers and providers to prospective shareholders, it would seem difficult to argue that the

conversion is in the public interest. If on the other hand, the expected changes in health plan

behavior are likely to result in new and better products, conversion may indeed advance public

welfare. In all likelihood, a health plan conversion will have the potential for both value creation




                                                 10
and value transfer. In these cases, the insurance commissioner must in essence make a judgment

that involves tradeoffs between different stakeholders.

Other Considerations Beyond Changes in Health Plan Conduct

       Changes in health plan conduct are only the most straightforward of considerations in

evaluating whether conversion is in the public interest. The simple alternatives of approving or

denying the conversion petition are more complicated than they might seem at first glance. The

consequences of approving the conversion are not simply the anticipated costs and benefits of

changes in health plan conduct; one must also consider the opportunities afforded by an endowed

foundation charged with the mission of serving the public interest. Similarly the consequences

of denying the conversion are not simply the preservation of the status quo. One must consider

the factors that prompted the conversion petition in the first place and what they signal about the

evolution of the local health care market and the viability of the health plan petitioning to

convert.

       To assess whether a foundation could more efficiently execute the public service mission

of a non-profit health plan, it will be instructive to first evaluate the extent to which the

petitioning health plan is currently executing this mission and to approximate the resources it

requires (both financial and organizational) to do so. Only then can one make a determination

about whether a foundation could accomplish the same task at a lower cost or implement an

expanded mission with the funds available from the conversion.

       Oversight of a not-for-profit health plan’s execution of its mission is not typically

considered to be in the purview of state insurance regulators and is largely delegated to board

members. There is some question as to whether these not-for-profit health plans are completely

fulfilling their missions as public benefit organizations. In written testimony submitted to the




                                                  11
Maryland Insurance administration in March 2002, William Jews, the CEO of the CareFirst Blue

Cross Blue Shield Company explains when and why the Blue Cross Blue Shield of Maryland

(BCBSMD) plan stopped filling the role of “insurer of last resort”:


        “As with other Blues Plans being formed at about the same time, the [Blue Cross Blue
        Shield of Maryland plan] was conceived with the goal of providing affordable health care
        insurance using “community rating” principles. This worked effectively at a time when
        few, if any, commercial carriers were offering health coverage. In the 1960s, commercial
        insurance carriers began entering the health insurance market in earnest and introduced
        the concept of “experience rating”. As commercial carriers focused on providing
        coverage at lower premiums to the healthiest individuals and groups, Blues Plans like
        BCBSMD continued to extend coverage to all comers, including high risk customers
        through its community rating mechanism. As a result, many Blues Plans became known
        as “insurers of last resort” in their service areas …”

        That role of insurer of last resort changed in the 1960s when the federal government – in
        essence – assumed the mantle of insurer of last resort by establishing the Medicare and
        Medicaid programs to guarantee health covered to the aged and disabled and to provide
        coverage to the poor. From that point forward, Blues Plans began to compete with
        commercial insurance carriers and the longstanding expectation that “Blues” would act as
        the insurer of last resort was greatly minimized. In addition, the continued use by our
        competitors of experience rating, which gave them an unfair advantage, forced most Blue
        Plans to abandon community rating in order to survive.”

Jews contends that the creation of public insurance programs by the federal government relieved

the Blues plans of fulfilling their role as insurers of last resort. If the public service mission of

BCBS plans is limited to the narrow interpretation of providing affordable health insurance using

community rating, and if this mission has been abandoned by BCBS plans seeking to convert,

then the insurance commissioner’s decision of whether to approve a conversion petition is

somewhat simplified. Under the current organization and governance structure, the not-for-

profit plan is receiving a tax exemption while operating in a manner closely resembling that of a

for-profit health plan; the foregone tax receipts and the alternative uses of the plan’s assets are

the opportunity costs of disallowing the conversion and requiring the health plan to continue in




                                                  12
the status quo. In these circumstances, this line of reasoning should eliminate the alternative of

denying the conversion petition and maintaining the status quo.

           However, the insurance commissioner may decide that the public interest would be better

served by going beyond denial of the petition and instituting reform of the health plan

governance structures and accountability systems to ensure that it pursues its original mission.

Whether or not this is the best course of action hinges on two additional analyses: 1) an

assessment of whether the mission will be executed more efficiently by a suitably reformed non-

profit health plan or a newly created foundation, and 2) whether either institution is viable in the

long run.

           In the above statements, Jews asserts that the BCBSMD plan was compelled to abandon

its original mission in order to survive competition from commercial insurance carriers. These

views are echoed in a recent account of the conversion of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield plan of

New York.9 Jamie Robinson recounts how state regulators destroyed the delicate balancing act

of cross-subsidization achieved by Empire BCBS when the regulators allowed commercial

insurers to enter the market and attract the healthy low-cost enrollees with lower premiums.

These actions precipitated an adverse selection spiral that left Empire with the sickest enrollees

and the highest costs. In general, the long-term financial viability of an efficient non-profit is

unknown. There is also limited research on the regulatory structures that might support a non-

profit health plan and the social efficiency of such regimes.

           The foregoing analysis suggests a framework to guide research and decision-making on

health plan conversions (see Figure 3). Prior to evaluating the potential changes in health plan

conduct and the effects of these changes on public welfare, the insurance commissioner might

first want to consider:

                                                        13
       1. Whether the public interest mission of the not-for-profit can be achieved more

           efficiently through a foundation or a health insurance plan; and

       2. Whether any organization can faithfully execute this mission and remain financially
          viable.

After making these assessments, the insurance commissioner must then weigh the costs and

benefits to different constituencies of likely changes in health plan conduct.


3.     Case Study

       In the previous section of this paper, I have described, in a generic sense, some of the

health policy issues that arise when a not-for-profit health plan petitions a state insurance

regulator to convert to a public stock company and potentially to be acquired by another

company. In this section, I present some case study research conducted when the CareFirst Blue

Cross and Blue Shield Company (with licenses in Delaware, Maryland, and Washington D.C)

petitioned to convert to a public stock company and to be acquired by Wellpoint Health

Networks, Inc. I will provide a brief description of the CareFirst organization and the events

leading up to the conversion petition. I will then summarize the main arguments both for and

against the conversion as they have been presented in oral and written testimony, in publicly

available reports, and in the public press. Next, I will present the results of analyses of market

structure, economies of scale, and quality of care. Finally, I will report on the outcome of the

petition and the research challenges remaining.

Background on Carefirst

       CareFirst, Inc. is a holding company with BCBS licenses for Delaware, the District of

Columbia, and Maryland. The company was formed in 1998 with the merger of BCBS of




                                                  14
Maryland and BCBS of the National Capital Area (District of Columbia). In 2000, BCBS of

Delaware became part of CareFirst.

       CareFirst is overseen by a central board of directors; William Jews is the CEO of

CareFirst and CEO of each of the three subsidiaries that make up Carefirst: Group Health and

Medical Services Inc. - GHMSI (the D.C. Blues), CareFirst of Maryland (the Maryland Blues)

and BCBSD (the Delaware Blues). The CareFirst corporation offers a wide variety of insurance

products in these three jurisdictions.

       In November of 2001, CareFirst entered into a merger agreement with Wellpoint Health

Networks, Inc. of California. To consummate this merger agreement, CareFirst needed to

convert to a for-profit public stock company. The insurance commissioners in all three

jurisdictions in which CareFirst operates needed to approve the conversion petition; however,

Maryland was the first jurisdiction to initiate formal proceedings to evaluate the merits of

conversion. As part of the proceedings in Maryland and in the District of Columbia, public

hearings and discovery were held to generate information to inform the public interest

determination. Valuation studies of CareFirst were also initiated.

Summary of arguments for and against conversion

       The CareFirst management team and its consultants advanced three primary reasons in

support the conversion petition. First, they cited an inability to access sufficient capital to fund

investments that would enhance efficiency, improve customer service, and facilitate the

development of new and better products. However, in the consultant’s report and in CareFirst’s

strategic plan it appeared that the need for capital was largely driven by plans for acquiring other

health plans. The need to achieve economies of scale was cited as the primary reason for this

acquisition strategy. Second, without these improvements (and larger scale), they contended that




                                                 15
CareFirst’s long run viability is uncertain. Approving the conversion would therefore “help to

secure the long-term future of the “Blue” brand in local markets”.10 Third, approving the

conversion and merger with Wellpoint would benefit the public because it would result in

additional tax receipts (estimated to be $20 million annually) and the creation of a foundation

with an endowment of $1.3 billion that would be apportioned to the three jurisdictions.

        Those opposing the conversion cited a variety of concerns, many of which related to the

future conduct of a for-profit BCBS plan. Concerns about access to care stemmed from the

expectation that after conversion, CareFirst would discontinue offering insurance products that

served vulnerable populations and that were relatively unprofitable. Some people feared that

CareFirst would raise premiums, tighten underwriting practices (abandon guaranteed issue), and

narrow the coverage of the insurance policies it continued to offer. Another policy concern

related to the potential for skimping on quality. Some providers were not supportive of the

conversion petition because they feared reductions in payment rates, increased administrative

burden, and a more adversarial relationship. Both providers and consumers feared the loss of a

local institution led by members of the community with long run interests of the community in

mind. Two objections to the conversion were unrelated to anticipated changes in health plan

conduct. Some people felt that Wellpoint’s offer of $1.3 billion to acquire CareFirst was less

than the fair value of CareFirst as an ongoing concern.11 Finally, many consumers were outraged

at bonuses CareFirst executives were scheduled to receive if the deal went through.

Economic Analyses

Market Structure

        CareFirst executives and consultants have suggested in their filings that the markets in

which the CareFirst plans operate are so competitive as to constrain their ability to raise

premiums or lower quality without losing enrollees to other local health plans. They imply that

CareFirst, if it were allowed to convert to for-profit status, would not take such actions (raising

premiums or lowering quality) because the loss of enrollment would decrease profits.

Traditionally, economists have used market share summary measures as proxies for market

competitiveness. The belief is that greater concentration of market share among a smaller

number of firms is likely to result in higher prices.

        Computing market shares in practice requires definition of the market and detailed data

for each firm. Market definitions can have large effects on both measures of concentration and

market shares for individual firms. In this section, I examine the extent of market concentration

in the District of Columbia (DC) using data on HMO and managed care enrollment. 12 I am able

to obtain relatively complete enrollment data for health plans licensed to do business in DC;

these detailed data facilitate analyses of market share by consumer segment and product type.

However, CareFirst sells policies in Maryland, Virginia, and Delaware. A complete analysis of

the market power possessed by CareFirst would require comparable analyses in these other

geographical markets.




12
  These enrollment data are drawn the mandatory reports filed with the Insurance Commissioner’s Office by health
plans licensed to do business in the District of Columbia and from the national databases assembled by InterStudy.
The InterStudy data are limited for the purpose of examining total health plan enrollment (HMO and non-HMO) in
the following manner. While InterStudy is recognized as the leading source of data on health plans offering HMO
products, the universe of plans in these data excludes health plans that do not offer an HMO product, but includes
data on non-HMO products for health plans that also offer an HMO. Hence, the sample of health plans in
InterStudy is incomplete in its inclusion of purely non-HMO plans.


                                                       17
DC Health Plan Enrollment

        Table 1 reports the health plan enrollment and market share for each health plan licensed

to sell health insurance policies in the District for the years 2000 and 2001.13 In 2001, there were

a total of 14 health plans most of which fall into one of three categories. Four national for-profit

companies (Aetna U.S. Healthcare, AMERIGROUP, Cigna, and United Healthcare) did a small

amount of business in DC (combined market share of roughly 10.1%). Three other health plans

could be characterized as relatively small regional plans (George Washington University Health

Plan, Optimum Choice, and MD-Individual Practice Association) because they operate in a small

number of adjacent states. In 2001, these regional plans account for 15.6% of the market. Four

health plans offered products only in the District (Health Right Inc, DC Chartered Health Plan,

Advantage Health Plan, and Capital Community Health Plan); together these plans accounted for

3.5% of the market.

        Omitted from this categorization are two CareFirst plans and the Kaiser plan. CareFirst

operates two health plans in the District: CareFirst BlueChoice (hereafter BlueChoice) and

Group Hospitalization and Medical Services, Inc. (GHMSI). Together these plans represent

50.9% of the market, however GHMSI with 48.5% share dominates in this market. Kaiser

Foundation Health Plan has the second largest share of the DC market (19.8%) and does not fit




13
  These enrollment and market share data were obtained from the health plan filings with the DC Insurance
Commissioners Office except for the enrollment data for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
The form filed with the Insurance Commissioners office does not list FEHBP enrollment, but does list the total
premiums collected by the plan for this product. The InterStudy database contains data on FEHBP enrollment for
nearly all of the health plans operating in the District. The CareFirst plan operating under the name of Group
Medical and Hospitalization Services, Inc. (GHMSI) does not offer an HMO product and is therefore not included in
the InterStudy database. FEHBP enrollment for GHMSI was imputed in the following manner. Using the premium
data from the DC Insurance Commission filings and enrollment data from InterStudy, I computed the average
FEHBP premium for all health plans offering an FEHBP plan in the District except for GHMSI. I then imputed
FEHBP enrollment for GHMSI by dividing its total FEHBP premiums by the average FEHBP premium in the
District.


                                                       18
neatly into any of the above three categories. It is affiliated with the only national not-for-profit

health plan in the U.S.

       Total health plan enrollment in DC grew 2.9% from 2000 to 2001. All national for-profit

plans lost market share over this time period with the exception of AMERIGROUP (which

gained 200 enrollees). Prudential Health Care operated a plan in 2000, but terminated this local

plan in 2001 following its acquisition by Aetna Health Plans. Two regional plans experienced

substantial increases in enrollment (MD-IPA +41,000; Optimum Choice +18,600); the third

regional health plan, George Washington University Health Plan lost roughly 18,000 enrollees.

GHMSI experienced the largest absolute enrollment gains during this period (> 45,000

enrollees).

DC Enrollment by Consumer Segment

       As shown in Table 2, health plans operating in the District sell policies to a number of

different consumer segments; however, enrollment in two of these segments (the commercial

group and FEHBP segments) constitutes 91.5% of all health insurance policies sold in DC. The

largest market segment is the commercial group market which accounts for 47% of all health

insurance policies; GHMSI and BlueChoice together hold a 51% share of this segment.

Commercial group products are typically sold to employers (large and small) who in turn offer

these health plans as a benefit to their employees at some fraction of the per enrollee cost to the

employer.

       The second largest segment is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP);

the FEHBP segment is very similar to the commercial group segment in that the Federal

government essentially acts as a large employer. One difference between these two segments is

that any health plan meeting a minimum set of criteria may participate in the FEHBP program




                                                 19
(i.e. offer a health plan to federal employees); private-sector employers typically selectively

contract with a very small number of health plans. The FEHBP market segment is nearly as

large as the commercial group segment (44% of policies). Six health plans in the District offer a

policy designed specifically for federal employees, but GHMSI alone holds 51.7% of the market.

Health Plan Enrollment by Product Type

        Managed care companies typically offer a variety of health insurance products in the

commercial group segment of the market. These products vary in terms of the health care

providers that members may receive care from and who bears the risk that total premiums may

not equal total expenses during the time the policy is in effect. At one end of the spectrum is the

HMO product; for HMO policies, the managed care company bears all the risk14 and members

are restricted to a pre-specified provider network. At the other end of the spectrum is the

indemnity product; for indemnity policies (which are very rare today), the policyholder and the

managed care company jointly share risk up to some maximum benefit. Policyholders may

receive care from any licensed provider.

        In between these two extremes are Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) products and

Point of Service (POS) products. In both PPO and POS plans, the sponsoring managed care

company identifies a preferred list of providers. In the case of a POS, this preferred list of

providers is usually the provider network for an HMO product; in the case of a PPO, the

preferred providers have entered into contracts with the managed care organization in which they

have discounted the fees they charge. When a member of a PPO or a POS seeks care from a

provider not included on the preferred provider list, the member will be responsible for a

coinsurance payment – a fixed percentage of the total amount the non-preferred provider charges


14
  Managed care companies may transfer some of this risk to health care providers through contracts that involve
prospective payment (i.e. capitation).


                                                       20
the health plan for his or her services. When a member of a POS plan receives care from a

preferred provider, there will typically be no coinsurance payment. When a member of a PPO

receives care from a preferred provider, there will typically be a smaller coinsurance payment

compared to when services are obtained from a non-preferred provider. Because of differences

in their provider networks and their benefit design, PPO products are imperfect substitutes for

HMO products.

        Table 3 presents statistics on total health plan enrollment by product type in 2001 for

health plans operating in the District.15 Approximately 71% of all health insurance products

marketed by these health plans in the DC-MD-VA region are HMO products. The next largest

category is the PPO product; this product represents 21% of all health insurance products sold in

this region by health plans that participate in the DC market. Note that all health plans offer an

HMO product except for GHMSI, and that only GHMSI offers a PPO product or an indemnity

product; GHMSI does not compete with any other managed care firm in these two product

markets and has the largest market share (~45%) in the POS product market. CareFirst

BlueChoice membership represents a further 24% market share in the POS product market.

Market Concentration

        Economists frequently employ the Herfindahl measure to quantify the extent to which

market share is concentrated in a small number of firms. The Herfindahl concentration measure

is computed as the sum of squared market shares for all firms in the market. If there is only one

firm in the market (i.e. monopoly), the Herfindahl equals one. If there are two equally sized

firms in the market, the Herfindahl equals 0.5. Economists are interested in market

15
  The data on health plan enrollment by product type was taken from health plan filings with the DC Insurance
Commission. These data are aggregated at the health plan level and geographical breakdowns were not available
(e.g. the number of GHMSI PPO enrollees in the District of Columbia). Furthermore, FEHBP enrollment was not
included in these data. With the exception of GHMSI, it appears that all of the FEHBP health plans offered in the
District are HMO plans.


                                                        21
concentration because they believe it is related to a firm’s bargaining power with suppliers and

the ability of individual firms to affect the price at which the market clears.

        The Herfindahl statistic for the entire District of Columbia health insurance market is

0.29; this is roughly equivalent to having three to four equally sized firms in the market. In some

more narrowly defined market segments, the Herfindahl statistics are substantially higher. For

example, the Herfindahl statistic in the individual market (policies sold to individual consumers

and not through group purchaser) is 0.54; GHMSI’s share of this market is 72%. The Herfindahl

in the FEHBP segment is 0.34 and GHMSI’s market share is 52%. In the District, GHMSI is the

only managed care firm in the PPO and Indemnity market segments (Herfindahl=1.0). Table 4

presents the Herfindahl statistic and GHMSI’s market share for each market segment in which it

participates.

Market Dynamics

        Point in time statistics on enrollment and market share provide an incomplete picture of

the competitive nature of a market. One might like to know which products, if any, have gained

popularity in recent years. Comparable historical data from health plan filings with the DC

Insurance Commission were not available to construct a longtitudinal version of Table 1.4.

However, enrollment by product type was available from the InterStudy database for the years

1999 and 2001 for any health plan offering an HMO.16

        Table 5 reports changes in the sum total of enrollment by product type for health plans

that offer an HMO and whose primary service area is the District of Columbia, Maryland, or

Virginia. These enrollment changes are also broken down by plan ownership type: National For-


16
  Recall that the sample of plans included in the InterStudy database is defined by any plan offering an HMO
product (hence GHMSI is not included in the InterStudy database). However, once included in the sample,
InterStudy reports enrollment in all types of products (not just HMO products). Because of the sample selection,
InterStudy may underestimate enrollment in non-HMO products.


                                                        22
Profit, Virginia Blue Cross Blue Shield, Independent (includes for-profit and not-for-profit) and

CareFirst. A list of health plans in each ownership category is included as Exhibit 1.

       Market-wide, the largest decreases in total enrollment occurred in the commercial group

HMO product line and in the open-panel HMO product line. The largest increases occurred in

PPO enrollment and enrollment in other non-HMO products. Data in this table suggest that the

national for profit firms decreased enrollment in commercial group HMO products and made up

for about 83% of this HMO enrollment decrease with enrollment increases in PPO and other

non-HMO products. Unlike other health plans in the DC-MD-VA market, CareFirst plans

increased their commercial group HMO enrollment but decreased enrollment in all other HMO

products. However, these decreases were more than offset by large increases in PPO enrollment

and enrollment in self-insured products.


       Comparable nationwide enrollment changes between 1999 and 2001 are presented in

Table 6. Similarities between trends in the DC-MD-VA markets and nationwide include a

substantial increase in PPO enrollment, a substantial decrease in commercial group and POS

enrollment, and a decrease in non-group direct enrollment products. In contrast to nationwide

enrollment trends, total managed care enrollment, FEHBP enrollment, and public program

enrollment decreased in plans offering an HMO in the DC-MD-VA market while they increased

nationwide. Overall, however, it seems that enrollment trends in the DC-MD-VA market area

are very similar to enrollment trends nationwide.

       In summary, the market share analysis indicates that the CareFirst plan, GHMSI,

dominates the DC health insurance market. GHMSI has very large market share in the largest

consumer segments. Furthermore, the markets in which GHMSI dominates are also very

concentrated. This combination suggests that GHMSI possesses market power in DC. The next



                                                23
largest plan in the DC market is the Kaiser plan; it is noteworthy that the national for-profit

health plans that CareFirst managers perceive as their primary competitors hold relatively small

market shares in DC. Since the market structure analyses were limited to the DC market, it is not

possible to speculate whether other CareFirst plans possess similarly favorable positions in the

Maryland and Delaware markets.

       National and local enrollment trends suggest a decline in traditional HMO and POS

products and increases in PPO and other non-HMO products. CareFirst plans are at the forefront

of this trend in the PPO market but lag behind the national for-profit firms in the market for other

non-HMO products.

Economies of scale

       CareFirst executives and consultants have argued that the firm’s acquisition by Wellpoint

will lower CareFirst costs because of economies of scale. Strictly speaking, economies of scale

are present when average unit costs fall with increased output. Average unit costs may decrease

over some range of output for two reasons. First, large capital investments represent fixed costs

that lead naturally to declining average costs up to some capacity constraint. Second, marginal

costs may fall over some range of output because of learning curves, specialization, or volume

discounts from suppliers.

       In the health insurance market, economies of scale would be present when the average

total cost of insuring an individual are lower with high levels of total health plan enrollment than

with low levels of total plan enrollment. There are a number of intuitive reasons why economies

of scale might be present in managed care operations. First, insurance is largely an information

business and requires substantial capital investment in computers and software to manage that

information. As long as the information systems are not at some capacity constraint, the IT costs




                                                 24
of processing information for an additional enrollee is essentially zero; hence health plans can

lower average costs by spreading these fixed costs of capital investment over a larger enrollment

base. In a similar vein, health plans with a larger enrollment base may be able to support a larger

R&D group and have more opportunities for lower cost experimentation with new products and

processes. There are also fixed costs associated with negotiating contracts with health care

providers and purchasers.

       Second, greater health plan enrollment may increase the bargaining power that the health

plan can exercise in its negotiations over reimbursements with health care providers (e.g.

doctors, hospitals, pharmaceutical companies). The extent to which increased enrollment

translates into greater bargaining power and lower medical care costs (and hence lower average

total costs) will depend on local market characteristics. In markets where providers are

themselves consolidated into large bargaining units, or in which there is strong demand for

certain types of providers (e.g. a high quality teaching hospital), the health plan’s financial return

to greater enrollment that derives from increased bargaining power will be lower.

       A third potential source of economies of scale in health insurance relates to the amount of

financial reserves that a health plan must hold to meet statutory requirements. For statistical

reasons, the per-enrollee amount of financial reserves that a health plan is required to hold will

be less for health plans with larger enrollment bases.

       If we define economies of scale as average costs falling with increased enrollment, then it

is possible to test for the presence of economies of scale in health insurance using a dataset on

health plan costs, enrollment, and other characteristics. The following paragraphs report the

results of such an analysis.




                                                 25
       Most states require health insurance plans to file quarterly and/or annual reports with the

state insurance commissioner using a common format created by the National Association of

Insurance Commissioners (NAIC). These data are publicly available. The Weiss Ratings

Company collects and compiles these data and sells reports based on these data. In the data

compiled by Weiss Ratings are reports of total health plan administrative expenditures, total

health plan medical expenditures, total health plan enrollment, and a number of characteristics on

the health plan and the insurance products it markets.

       The sample for analysis was created by selecting all health plans classified as HMOs in

the Weiss data reporting positive enrollment in 2001. These selection criteria yielded a sample

size of 439 health plans. Health plans that exclusively enrolled Medicare beneficiaries (11 plans)

or Medicaid beneficiaries (60 plans) were dropped from the analysis. Health plans reporting

fewer than 5000 enrollees (27 plans, 5 of these plans were Medicaid only or Medicare only

plans) were also dropped from the sample. The remaining health plans were matched with the

InterStudy database to collect additional information about the plans (321 matches out of final

Weiss sample of 347). Missing data for variables used as regressors led to a final sample size of

299 plans.

       Figures 4 and 5 show substantial variation in the measure of administrative and medical

expenses per member. The correlation between administrative and medical expenses is positive

but not very large (correlation coefficient = 0.55). There is no reason to expect that scale

economies in administrative expenses would be the same as scale economies in medical

expenses. In fact, the earlier discussion suggests different sources of scale economies in the two

types of expenditures. For this reason, separate analyses were conducted to test for scale

economies in medical expenses and administrative expenses.




                                                26
       Figure 6 is a frequency distribution of health plan enrollment. This distribution is heavily

skewed to the left; there are a relatively small number of plans with very large enrollment (i.e.

>500,000). On the lower end of the plan size distribution, note that 56% of health plans in this

sample have HMO enrollment under 100,000 members. One indication of the presence of scale

economies is the distribution of medical and administrative expenses for health plans in the top

enrollment decile. If scale economies were present, one would expect to see an over-

representation of these high-enrollment plans in the lowest deciles for average per member

medical and administrative expenses. Figures 7 suggest that this is not the case; the high

enrollment plans are evenly represented in the administrative expense deciles and overly-

represented in the higher medical expense deciles.

       Figure 8 is a scatterplot of administrative expenses per member against health plan

enrollment. Though many health plans are clustered in the low enrollment / low administrative

expense quadrant of the graph, there does appear to be a negative relationship between average

administrative expense and enrollment. In contrast, there appears to be no relationship

discernible from the scatterplot of per member medical expenses and enrollment (Figure 9).

       A number of health plan characteristics could influence average administrative and

medical expenses independent of scale. Accounting practices in non-profit health plans tend to

result in a larger number of expenses classified as administrative compared to for-profit health

plans. There are also reasons to suspect that the average administrative and medical

expenditures may differ by product line because of the variation in costs of delivering care to

enrollees in different market segments. The InterStudy data records enrollment in several

different product lines including commercial HMO, FEHBP, Medicare Risk HMO, Medicare

supplemental, Medicaid Risk HMO, POS, PPO, and FFS. Not all plans offer all of these




                                                27
products. In addition to the types of products offered by health plans, the total number of

products may be positively related to average administrative costs. Since different product lines

will require product-specific investments in marketing, regulatory compliance, and provider

networks, health plans concentrating their enrollment in fewer products would be more likely to

experience lower administrative expenses and possibly greater economies of scale.

       Administrative and medical expenses per member may also be related to the health plan’s

provider network organization. There are four basic types of provider networks: (1) the staff

model in which physicians are employed by the health plan and located in a small number of

clinics, (2) the group model in which health plans contract with physicians practicing in medical

groups that may also contract with other health plans, (3) the Independent Physician Association

(IPA) model in which physicians in solo and group practice contract with an intermediary (the

IPA) which in turn contracts with the health plan, and (4) the network model in which health

plans contract directly (not through an IPA) with a mix of solo-practice and group-practice

physicians. Today, the provider networks of most health plans are a mix of these four model

types. The organization of the health plan’s provider network is related, but not identical to, the

breadth of the network (measured as the number of physicians per member). Health plans with

predominantly IPA-based networks tend also to have larger networks.

       Health plans contracting with a large number of providers for a given membership size

will likely have larger administrative costs per member due to the additional transaction costs

involved in negotiating and executing a larger number of contracts. It is also plausible that

health plans with larger provider networks (controlling for membership size) will have higher

medical expenses per member for three reasons: (1) adverse selection, (2) the health plan will

find it more difficult to control utilization with a larger network and a smaller number of




                                                28
enrollees per provider, and (3) the health plan will be less able to negotiate lower provider

reimbursement rates when providers see few of the plan’s enrollees.

         In addition to the network characteristics discussed in previous paragraphs, the method of

provider payment may influence average administrative and medical costs. Consider two

primary reimbursement methods: fee for service and capitation. Fee for service reimbursement

requires the processing and payment on a claim to an individual physician every time a service is

delivered. In contrast, capitation reimbursement sometimes involves no filing and processing of

individual claims and only a monthly per member payment to the physician or the practice. In

some cases, health plans employing capitation will require providers to submit dummy claims

that the health plan will then process, but the health plan will still make payments less frequently.

It is also likely that capitation would reduce per member medical costs.

         In the last decade there has been substantial consolidation of enrollment into a relatively

small number of national and regional health plans. This trend might be explained by either a

scale economies or a market power argument and has important implications for the empirical

estimation of scale economies. Consider a local health plan that is owned by a managed care

company with a national presence (i.e. one of the local Aetna Health plans). A statistical

analysis of the relationship between local health plan enrollment and local health plan

expenditures (both medical and administrative) that failed to account for affiliation with a

national managed care company would underestimate the true extent of scale economies.17

Affiliation with a national or regional managed care company should convey economies of scale

to a local plan to the extent that the cost of centralized services (i.e. claims processing) can be

spread over a national or regional enrollment base.


17
  This is true only to the extent that local health plan enrollment is independent from (not correlated with) total
regional or national enrollment.


                                                          29
       Finally, a health plan’s medical and administrative expenses may depend on

characteristics of the local health care markets in which it operates. There is substantial

geographical variation in the organization of the provider sector, regulatory environment, and the

extent of mandated benefits that could lead to differences in health plan cost structures.

       Any one of these health plan or market characteristics could have an impact on average

health plan administrative and medical expenditures. To empirically assess whether there are

economies of scale in health plan enrollment it is necessary to statistically control for these other

factors. Consequently a regression analysis was undertaken to assess the relationship between

health plan enrollment and average per-member administrative and medical expenses.

       Table 8 presents the results of two regression analyses. In column two, the dependent

variable is administrative costs per member; in column three, the dependent variable is average

medical costs per member. A fixed effect for the health plan’s primary state of operation (the

state in which the health plan had the greatest enrollment) was included in each regression to

control for regional variation in expenses. The estimated coefficients presented in columns two

and three indicate small but significant economies of scale are present in both administrative

expenses and medical expenses. Because both the dependent variable and the enrollment

variables are measured in natural logs, the coefficients on the enrollment variables in the

regression may be interpreted as elasticities (e.g. the percentage change in administrative

expenses associated with a one percentage change in enrollment). The estimated coefficient on

“within-plan” enrollment is -0.05 for administrative expenses and –0.06 for medical expenses

indicating that a one percentage increase in the health plan’s enrollment is associated with a .05

to .06 percentage point decrease in average administrative and medical costs, respectively.

These estimated relationships are graphically depicted in Figures 10 and 11.




                                                 30
       Recall that for plans affiliated with National or Regional Managed Care Companies, the

total national or regional enrollment was entered separately into the regression. The coefficients

on these variables indicate the extent to which the additional scale (enrollment) present in a

national or regional managed care company is associated with higher or lower administrative

expenses per member in the local plan. The point estimates on these enrollment variables in both

regressions are essentially zero and insignificant.

       Given that the topic of this paper, it is perhaps worthwhile to note that this regression

analysis suggest that non-profit health plans have significantly higher per member administrative

costs but not significantly different average medical costs. However, as noted earlier, this

finding may be an artifact of non-profit accounting customs.

       In summary, the regression analysis finds evidence of modest economies of scale in both

administrative and medical costs. The estimated scale economies are nearly exhausted at an

enrollment of roughly 800,000. Only 12 health plans in our sample have an enrollment greater

than this. In addition, it appears that there are no additional scale economies to be gained

through membership in a regional or national managed care company.

Quality of care

       Consumers, providers, managers, and researchers all acknowledge that quality in health

care is multi-dimensional and difficult to measure. These characteristics of quality lead to

difficulties in contracting for a specified level of quality and challenges in holding individuals

and organizations accountable for the quality of health care services delivered. Quality of care

arises as an issue in health plan conversions because there is the potential opportunity and

financial incentive for a for-profit health plan to skimp on the aspects of quality that are difficult

consumers to observe and verify.

           Differences in quality between health plans do exist and are sometimes large. For

example, the Centers for Disease Control estimates that nearly 16 million Americans have

diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes. If not properly managed, diabetes can have devastating

health consequences and can consume lots of expensive health care resources. To manage their

disease, diabetics and their physicians must know the level of the patient’s Hemoglobin A1c

(HbA1c) and this information is obtained through a simple blood test. In the sample of plans

reporting data to the National Committee on Quality Assurance in 2000, the percentage of

diabetic plan members who had their HbA1c tested ranged from 24% to 97%. This range

suggests substantial variation in performance and ample room for improvement. Research has

shown that health plans that undertake diabetes disease management programs can effect

substantial improvements in care and short-term outcomes for diabetics.

           Published health services research documents correlations between health plan

performance on some quality measures and a variety of health plan characteristics.18 Though the

root causes of these patterns are not well understood, local independent and non-profit health

plans frequently outperform for-profit publicly-traded national managed care plans. These

findings are important for public officials to consider as they determine whether particular

conversions are in the interest of health care consumers. In the following paragraphs, I compare

the performance of CareFirst, Wellpoint, and other health plans operating in their respective

markets on a variety of measures of health plan quality.

Measures of Health Plan Quality

           In 1997, the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) began reporting the

performance of some health plans on a selected set of quality measures. This set of measures

(called HEDIS – the Health plan and Employers Data Information Set) was chosen by a group of
18
     Woolhandler & Himmelstein, Landon et al.,


                                                  32
health care purchasers and medical professionals and has been expanded over the years. Health

plans voluntarily submit performance data (most is audited) to the NCQA who then publishes

these data in a product called Quality Compass. Consumers and employers have used these data

to help them make health care purchasing decisions; academic researchers have used these data

to study the causes of variation in health plan quality.

       The HEDIS measures convey information about the extent to which the health plan’s

enrollees are obtaining preventive services and diagnostic tests necessary for managing certain

chronic diseases (see Exhibit 3 for a list of HEDIS measures used in the analyses presented in

this report). The HEDIS set also includes a few measures of health care outcomes for the health

plan’s enrolled population that signal, overall, how well the health plan is doing at helping its

members stay healthy.

       The second set of measures used in this analysis of health plan quality is derived from a

survey instrument called the “Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Survey (CAHPS)”. The

survey is administered by an independent party to a random sample of the health plan’s enrollees

to collect data on consumers’ experiences in seeking and obtaining health care. Health plans

often submit their performance on CAHPS to organizations that publish comparative health plan

data (such as the federal government, the NCQA, and local health care purchasing groups). The

federal government has mandated the collection and reporting of these survey data for Medicare

beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare HMOs.

       The CAHPS instrument generates hard to find data on the quality of enrollees

interactions with providers and health plans (see Exhibit 4 for a list of CAHPS measures used in

the analyses presented in this report). Health plans can take many actions to facilitate

consumers’ access to care, to educate and involve consumers in their own health care, to ease the




                                                 33
administrative burden of dealing with insurance claims, and to select and support a provider

network that routinely delivers high quality patient-friendly care. The CAHPS measures provide

health plans an opportunity to distinguish themselves in these areas.

HEDIS comparisons

       CareFirst operates three separate health plans in the Mid-Atlantic region that reported

1999 HEDIS data to NCQA (the data are published in Quality Compass 2000): CapitalCare Inc.,

Delmarva Health Plan Inc., and FreeState Health Plan Inc. In the analyses that follow, an

average score is computed for all three CareFirst plans weighted by HMO enrollment. Wellpoint

operates the Blue Cross of California health plan (BC-CA) in California; this plan reported a

limited set of 1999 HEDIS data to NCQA. Performance on HEDIS measures may be influenced

by some factors beyond the health plan’s control such as socio-demographic characteristics of

the plan’s membership, local organization of providers, and state health initiatives. To control

for variation in some of these factors across markets, the HEDIS scores of each plan have been

adjusted for the region of the country in which the health plan operates.

       Table 8 presents HEDIS data comparing the average performance of the CareFirst plans

to Wellpoint’s California plan and to the national average on three types of measures: preventive

care, chronic care, and mental health care. CareFirst performs least well on the preventive care

measures; it’s scores exceed the national average on 4 out of 10 measures and BC-CA

outperforms CareFirst on 6 out of the 7 measures for which data were submitted by BC-CA. The

second group of measures relates to care for enrollees with chronic disease. BC-CA reported

only one out of eight measures in this group and its performance on this measure falls

significantly below CareFirst’s performance. CareFirst outperforms the national average on six

out of 8 measures in the chronic care category. Finally in the third group measures relating to




                                                34
mental health care, CareFirst outperforms BC-CA on the two measures for which Wellpoint

submitted data. CareFirst outperformed the national average on 3 out of 5 measures in this

category.

       These comparisons between the CareFirst plans and the Wellpoint-CA plan suggest that

each of these plans has its strengths and weaknesses and that neither plan dominates the other on

HEDIS measures. It is noteworthy that at least one CareFirst plan reported data for every

HEDIS measure (23 measures in all), while the Wellpoint-CA plan reported data on just less than

half of the measures. The collection and public reporting of plan performance on HEDIS

measures signals a plan’s commitment to improving health care quality.

       Table 9 facilitates a comparison of performance by CareFirst and Wellpoint-CA on

HEDIS measures to the Kaiser plans operating in the CareFirst and Wellpoint-CA markets. The

Kaiser Foundation is the holding company for the only truly national not-for-profit managed care

plan in the United States. Virtually all other not-for-profit managed care companies have only a

local or regional presence. The Kaiser Foundation plans in California and the mid-Atlantic

region reported a full set of 1999 HEDIS data to NCQA.

       Comparing the second and third columns of the table in Table 9, one notes that Kaiser of

the Mid-Atlantic outperforms CareFirst on nearly every HEDIS measure (19 out of 23). Second,

comparing the second and third columns of the table, one notes that the Kaiser plans of

California outperform Wellpoint on nearly every measure for which Wellpoint reported data (10

out of 11). Finally, Kaiser mid-Atlantic outperforms Kaiser California on 16 out of the 23

measures. This comparison of the two Kaiser plans raises the concern that the method used for

controlling for systematic geographical variation was not completely successful. However, the




                                               35
magnitude of the differences between the Kaiser plans and CareFirst and Wellpoint plans

suggests systematic differences even within region.

       In summary, there are three major conclusions that emerge from these comparisons on

HEDIS measures. First, the CareFirst and the BC-CA plans each have strengths and weaknesses

on HEDIS measures and neither plan dominates the other; BC-CA compares favorably on

preventive care measures while the CareFirst plans compare favorably on chronic care and

mental health care measures. Second, both the BC–CA plan and the CareFirst plans are

outperformed by the Kaiser plans in their respective markets on HEDIS measures.

CAHPS comparisons

       This section of the report presents comparisons of the performance of several health plans

on the set of CAHPS composite measures published in Quality Compass 2000. Examination of

Table 10 shows that the CareFirst plans outperform the BC-CA plan on 8 out of 10 CAHPS

measures (the plans are essentially equal on two measures). The largest differences between the

health plans’ performance relate to access to care – getting care quickly and getting needed care.

Table 10 also facilitates a comparison of the BC-CA and CareFirst plans to the national average.

BC-CA performs below the national average on 8 out of 10 CAHPs measures; CareFirst

performs better than the national average on 7 out of ten measures. It is also noteworthy that the

average for national publicly-traded for-profit health plans is below the average for all plans

nationally that submitted data on all ten measures.

       The Kaiser mid-Atlantic plan outperforms the CareFirst plans on 2 out of the 10 CAHPs

measures; in contrast, the Kaiser California plan outperforms the BC-CA plan on 9 out of 10

measures (Table 11).




                                                36
       In summary, the analysis of CAHPs quality measures suggests that CareFirst members

have had more favorable experiences in obtaining health care services compared to the Wellpoint

plan in California.   Comparisons to local Kaiser plans in each market reinforce the findings of

the head to head comparison of BC of California and the CareFirst plans.

Post-script in the CareFirst Conversion Case

       The Maryland Insurance Commissioner, Stephen Larsen, initiated hearings on CareFirst’s

conversion petition prior to the insurance commissioners in the District of Columbia and

Delaware. As part of the Maryland hearings and in anticipation of formal hearings in DC, a

number of consultants were hired to value CareFirst; most of these valuations exceeded

Wellpoint’s offer of $1.3 billion. In the course of the hearings, there were also concerns raised

about the process used by the board of CareFirst to solicit bids and the board’s selection of the

Wellpoint offer. Finally, the terms of the deal appeared to personally enrich CareFirst

executives.

       On March 5, 2003, Commissioner Larson denied the petition by CareFirst to convert and

to be acquired by Wellpoint. Both the District of Columbia and Delaware suspended their

conversion proceedings. In reviewing the research and evidence, Commissioner Larson found

three reasons to deny the conversion. First he found that CareFirst had been operating like a for-

profit company despite legal requirements to adhere to a non-profit, public-interest mission.

Second, he found that the CareFirst board failed to consider CareFirst’s obligations as a non-

profit entity and that the Board did not negotiate the best price for CareFirst and was offering to

sell at less than fair market value. Third, and finally, Commissioner Larson found that CareFirst

did not demonstrate a need to convert to for-profit status in order to remain viable.




                                                 37
       On April 8, 2003, the Maryland legislature ratified Larsen’s decision and passed Senate

Bill 772. The bill is in essence, an attempt to restructure CareFirst as a well-functioning non-

profit health plan that will execute its mission. It calls for replacement of all Maryland-

appointed CareFirst board members, compensation paid to board members, officers and

employees to be consistent with similar non-profit organizations, establishes a Joint Nonprofit

Health Service Plan oversight Committee to oversee CareFirst operations in a manner consistent

with the interests of Maryland citizens, and prohibits the acquisition of CareFirst for 5 years. In

terms of health plan conduct, it requires that CareFirst to: 1) offer health care products in the

individual and small group markets, 2) administer and subsidize the Senior Prescription Drug

Program in Maryland, and 3) devote any remaining avoided taxes to a public interest project.

       Far from closing the chapter on CareFirst’s petition to convert, the Maryland legislation

sparked controversy in the District of Columbia and action by some of the parties. The D.C.

Commissioner claimed that the Maryland legislation could render the CareFirst plan in D.C.

uncompetitive and not viable. The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association revoked CareFirst’s

use of the BCBS brand. Finally, Wellpoint abandoned hopes of acquiring CareFirst and

announced a deal to acquire the publicly traded holding company of BCBS of Wisconsin.

4.     Summary and Suggestions for Future Research

       The health insurance industry has undergone substantial consolidation in recent years.

This consolidation has coincided with, and in part been caused by, the growth of for-profit,

publicly traded health insurance companies. These changes in health insurance markets have led

industry and government leaders to question the current and potential role of non-profit health

plans. Some of these leaders believe that many, if not all, non-profit health plans are already

conducting themselves like their for-profit competitors and hence question the value of giving a




                                                 38
tax exemption to these plans. However, among people holding this view, there is little

agreement about what should be done when these non-profit health plans apply to convert to for-

profit public stock companies. The lack of agreement derives from uncertainty about the

viability of non-profit health plans in a market dominated by for-profit plans and from ignorance

about governance structures that could hold non-profit health plans (or foundations) accountable

to a public interest mission.

       The governance structures necessary to consistently implement a public interest mission,

and the viability of a non-profit health plan executing such a mission, form the foundation upon

which the welfare consequences of potential changes in conduct of a converting health plan

should be evaluated. The welfare consequences of conduct changes must be evaluated in

conjunction with the set of feasible alternative institutions for executing the public-interest

mission. For example, it may well be that a converting health plan would abandon unprofitable

markets and raise premiums in other markets. However, denying the petition to convert does not

ensure that unprofitable markets will be better served or that premium increases will be limited

to cost increases; furthermore, it does not ensure that the non-profit plan will survive or

otherwise be financially capable of these tasks.

       Health policymakers are in need of economic research to answer a few basic questions.

First, how might unregulated market competition thwart a non-profit health plan in executing its

mission? In other words, what are the threats to viability? Second, what market interventions

might ensure viability of the mission? Only after these questions are answered can one then pose

the social value question: Is the mission worth it? To answer this question, economists and

others will have to assess the costs and benefits of alternative regulatory institutions. Finally,

creating a conducive environment for a non-profit health plan is not sufficient. Policymakers




                                                   39
need empirical and theoretical research on the types of governance structures that will guide

faithful execution of the non-profit health plan’s mission.

       While research and experience have identified important gaps in our knowledge,

economic analyses have made valuable contributions to the evaluation of conversions. The case

study analysis of CareFirst confirms prior research findings that there are differences in health

plan quality related to ownership structure. To enhance the usefulness of these findings, we need

to understand the causal mechanisms underlying the correlation between quality and health plan

characteristics. We do not know for instance whether non-profit plans have higher quality on

average because they consider this part of their mission and allocate surplus to achieve this

higher quality, or because the organization of non-profit health plans differs from for-profit

health plans in ways that facilitate higher quality at the same cost. These are of course not the

only two possible explanations and further research is needed to identify and articulate the

mechanisms by which health plans influence quality.

       The analyses of scale economies presented in this chapter have generated evidence of the

relationship between health plan size and average costs. In the case of CareFirst, with over 3.1

million members, there appears to be little or no cost-savings to be achieved through expanded

enrollment. This finding calls into question CareFirst’s claim that it needs greater access to

capital in order to finance future health plan acquisitions.

       Finally, the market structure analyses demonstrate the importance of examining distinct

product and consumer market segments.       Market share analyses for the District of Columbia

suggest that the CareFirst plan, GHMSI, possesses substantial market power in some segments.

Whether GHMSI was exercising self-restraint in pricing the policies it sold in this market was

not possible to determine from the available data. Note that health plan costs by product would




                                                 40
be necessary to assess price cost margins, and that cost data for every product would be

necessary to evaluate a health plan’s strategy to cross-subsidize.

         The findings presented in this study are subject to a number of caveats and limitations.

First, because of its limited scope, there are several health policy issues not addressed by this

study. For example, this study did not address the participation by non-profit health plans in

traditionally underserved markets. In addition, lack of data prohibited a careful examination of

health plan underwriting practices and health plan – provider relationships. Second, it was

beyond the scope of the CareFirst case study to examine the extent to which CareFirst was

fulfilling its mission, the long-term viability of such a mission, and the governance structures that

would facilitate implementation of this mission.19 More generally, this case study analysis

highlights the need for research elucidating the characteristics of markets that influence the

viability of non-profit health plans and scope for welfare improving market interventions.

Finally, I began this chapter by noting that every conversion petition is unique; the analyses of

CareFirst, the mid-Atlantic markets in which it operates, and the arguments in support of against

conversion will not necessarily generalize to health plans petitioning conversion in other

markets. However, the framework exposited in this chapter is entirely general, and I hope, will

make a contribution to those charged with the challenging tasks of analyzing and evaluating the

complex public policy issues surrounding health plan conversions.




19
   I was originally hired as a consultant by D.C. Appleseeds to examine the potential consequences of CareFirst converting to
stock ownership and being acquired by Wellpoint. It was not until the formal conversion proceedings were well underway that it
became clear to me that issues of viability and governance structures would play a central role in the decision calculus of
policymakers and regulatory officials.

  Because enrollment by product type is only reported at the health plan level for the entire DC-MD-VA
market area, the Herfindal and GHMSI market share statistics are difficult to interpret. It is possible that
there are managed care companies offering POS products in Maryland and Virginia but not in the District
of Columbia. This would cause the Herfindahl and GHMSI market share statistics in Table 1.7 to overstate
the true measures. However, it could also be that in the District, GHMSI is the only health plan offering a
POS product, in which case the reported Herfindahl and GHMSI market share would understand the true
measures.

Exhibit 1: Descriptions of Health Insurance Products as Defined by InterStudy

Health Insurance Product Description
Direct Pay Enrollment    Enrollees are individuals who are not members of a contracting
                         group (i.e. they are enrolled under an individual coverage
                         option).
FEHBP                    Enrollees are federal employees and participate in the Federal
                         Employees Health Benefits Program
Commercial Group         Includes individuals enrolled through employer-sponsored
                         group HMO policies, as well as conversion members (persons
                         who are no longer members of an employer group, but under
                         COBRA regulations, are still eligible for HMO services at a
                         group rate)
Public programs          Recipients of Medicaid and Medicare who are enrolled in an
                         HMO
Point of Service (POS)   Enrollees have access to and financial incentives to use a
                         managed care provider network, often the HMO’s provider
                         panel, but in contrast to the open-panel HMO, POS enrollees
                         are not prepaid enrollees of the HMO (they pay indemnity
                         premiums)
Open-Ended HMO           Enrollees are prepaid members of the HMO and may receive
                         non-emergency services from providers outside the HMO’s
                         network. There is usually a substantial deductible, co-payment
                         or need for coinsurance for use of non-panel providers
Preferred Provider       A fee-for-service product where beneficiaries receive care from
Organization (PPO)       a selected panel of providers. Providers agree to a discounted
                         fee schedule when contracting with the PPO. PPOs offer a wide
                         variety of benefit plans, some including the option to use non-
                         panel providers if beneficiaries pay out-of-pocket costs.
Managed Fee For Service  The insurer pays the cost of covered services after services have
(FFS)                    been received and according to an agreed upon fee schedule.
                         Various managed care tools such as pre-certification, second
                         surgical opinion, and utilization review are used
Self-Insured             The HMO providers deliver health services to an individual, but
                         rather than being prepaid enrollees, or premium paying
                         beneficiaries, services received are paid for directly by the
                         enrollee’s employer.
Supplemental Medicare    A Medicare wrap-around plan that covers some co-payments,
                         deductibles, and services not covered under traditional
                         Medicare. Beneficiaries are given financial incentives to use
                         HMO providers but are not restricted to the HMO’s panel
Other Non-HMO Plans      This category primarily includes enrollees in flexcare plans,
                         self-insured Medicare plans, managed indemnity, indemnity,
                         exclusive provider organizations (EPOs), and out-of-area plans
