                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the evolving importance of banks and securities markets during the process of
economic development. We find that as countries develop economically, (1) the size of both banks
and securities markets increases relative to the size of the economy, (2) the association between an
increase in economic output and an increase in bank development becomes smaller, and (3) the association
between an increase in economic output and an increase in securities market development becomes
larger. The results are consistent with theories predicting that as economies develop, the services provided
by securities markets become more important for economic activity, while those provided by banks
become less important.

1. Introduction

Several lines of economic theory stress that banks provide different services to the economy

from those provided by securities markets, predicting that both the operation of banks and the

functioning of securities markets will have independent influences on economic development.

For example, Acemoglu and Zilibotti (1997), Allen and Gale (1997, 1999), Boot and Thakor

(1997, 2000), Dewatripont and Maskin (1995), Holmstrom and Tirole (1993), and Rajan (1992)

argue that banks have a comparative advantage in reducing the market frictions associated with

financing standardized, shorter-term, lower-risk, well-collateralized endeavors, while

decentralized markets are relatively more effective in custom-designing arrangements to finance

more novel, longer-run, higher-risk projects relying more on intangible inputs. Consistent with

these theories, Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998), Levine and Zervos (1998), and Beck

and Levine (2004) provide evidence that better functioning banks and securities markets exert

robust, independent positive effects on economic activity.

       A substantial body of economic theory also emphasizes that the comparative importance

of banks and markets for economic activity changes during the process of economic

development, with markets becoming relatively more important for economic activity. For

example, the concepts articulated in Goldsmith (1969), Allen and Gale (1995, 2000), Boot and

Thakor (1997, 2000), Boyd and Smith (1998), Weinstein and Yafeh (1998), Morck and

Nakamura (1999), and Song and Thakor (2012) suggest that (1) banks and markets provide

different, though sometimes complementary, financial services and (2) the services provided by

markets become comparatively more important for promoting economic activity as countries

develop economically. In particular, these theories suggest that as economies develop, more

projects require customized financial arrangements rather than standardized contracts and more
                                                                                                      2


projects rely on intangible assets rather than on easily collateralized capital inputs. Since these

models also suggest that banks have a comparative advantage in financing standardized, well-

collateralized endeavors, while securities markets are better at custom-designing arrangements to

finance more novel projects that rely on intangible inputs, these theories imply that the services

provide by securities markets will have a bigger impact on economic activity as economies grow,

while those provided by banks will become less important for economic activity.

       Empirical research, however, has been largely unsuccessful at clarifying the evolving

importance of banks and markets during the process of economic development, as exemplified

by Beck and Levine (2002), Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002), and Levine (2002).

Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2001) show that banks and securities markets tend to become more

developed as economies grow and that securities markets tend to develop more rapidly than

banks. Thus, financial systems generally become more market-based during the process of

economic development. But, this pattern could simply reflect reverse causality. Perhaps,

economic progress boosts the development of securities markets more than it boosts bank

development. The observation that financial systems tend to become more market-based as

economies develop does not necessarily imply that securities markets exert a larger impact on

economic activity in more economically advanced economies.

       In this paper, we evaluate empirically the changing importance of banks and securities

markets as economies develop in two steps. We first reassess with a new database how banks

and securities markets evolve as economies develop. That is, as countries develop economically,

what happens to the size of banks and securities markets relative to the size of the overall

economy? We then examine how the associations between economic activity and both bank and

stock market development change as countries develop economically. That is, we regress
                                                                                                     3


economic activity on both bank and securities market development and assess how the estimated

coefficients change as countries develop economically. This provides information on how the

associations between economic activity and different components of the financial system evolve

during economic development.

       The primary methodological contribution of this paper is using quantile regressions to

assess how the associations between economic activity and both bank and securities market

development evolve as countries grow (Koenker and Basset, 1978). Ordinary least squares

(OLS) regressions provide information on the association between, for example, economic

development and bank development for the “average” country, the country at the average level

of economic development. But, quantile regressions provide information on the relationship

between economic activity and bank development at each percentile of the distribution of

economic development. As we emphasize throughout the paper, these quantile analyses do not

yield a sharp causal interpretation. Rather, they show how the estimated coefficients on the

financial development indicators vary at different levels of economic development. In this way,

we illustrate how the associations between economic development and both bank and securities

market development change during the process of economic development.

       We also contribute new data to the analyses of finance and development. We construct a

database that covers 72 countries over the period from 1980 through 2008. We aggregate the data

into 5-year averages (data permitting), so that we have a maximum of six observations per

country. Besides using standard indicators such as bank credit to the private sector as a share of

Gross Domestic Product (GDP), stock market capitalization relative to GDP, and the value of

stock market transactions relative to GDP, we also assemble data on the capitalization of private

domestic bond markets relative to GDP.
                                                                                                     4


       We first find that both banks and securities markets become larger relative to the size of

the overall economy as countries develop economically, confirming the results in Demirguc-

Kunt and Levine (2001). These findings hold across various measures of bank and securities

market development, including measures incorporating private domestic bond markets. It is

important to notice that the measures of bank and securities market development are scaled by

GDP. Thus, our findings show that the growth of marketable securities and bank loans outpaces

the growth of economic activity as countries develop economically.

        We also find that (1) the association between economic activity and bank development

decreases with economic development, but (2) the association between economic activity and

securities market development increases as countries grow. Put differently, as economies

develop, the marginal increase in economic activity associated with an increase in bank

development falls, while the marginal increase in economic activity associated with an increase

in securities market development rises. Although we do not use instrumental variables to identify

a causal effect, these results are consistent with the predictions emerging from the large body of

theoretical research discussed above: As economies develop economically, the services provided

by securities markets will become more important for future economic development while those

provided by banks will become less important.

       This research is policy relevant. First, if the optimal mixture of banks and markets

changes as an economy develops, then this advertises the costs of policy and institutional

impediments to the evolution of the financial system. Indeed, this is the first paper to show that

the association between economic activity and stock market development increases as economies

grow, while the association between economic activity and bank development decreases. Second,

this work suggests that the associations between economic activity and both bank and securities
                                                                                                    5


market development change with economic development. This implies that the estimated

elasticities from past research regarding the impact of changes in bank or stock market

development on economic development will yield misleading information about countries with

incomes far from the sample average. Past studies do not account for the evolving importance of

banks and markets during the process of economic development.

       This paper contributes to a better understanding of the dynamic relationships among

economic development, financial institutions, and securities markets, but these contributions

come with qualifications and limitations. First, although the analyses are policy relevant, we do

not examine policy instruments. Thus, the results suggest that impediments to the evolution of

financial systems will hinder economic activity, but they do not provide guidance on exactly

which types of policies will foster the healthy development of financial systems.

       Second, although the analyses reduce concerns about reverse causality, they do not nail

down a particular causal mechanism, nor do they rule out reverse causality or omitted variable

bias. More specifically, a substantial body of theory predicts that as economies develop, financial

systems will become more market-based and the marginal impact of securities markets on

economic activity will increase while that of banks will decrease. Our findings are consistent

with these predictions. These findings are inconsistent, however, with simple reverse causality

stories. While a simple reverse causality scenario might predict that economic development will

boost the size of banks and securities markets relative to the size of the overall economy and

such a scenario might also predict that securities markets will grow faster than banks, the simple

reverse causality story does not yield predictions about the differential change in association

between economic activity and bank and securities market development as economies grow.

That is, the simple reverse causality scenario does not predict both that the association between
                                                                                                     6


economic activity and bank development diminishes in magnitude but the association between

economic activity and securities market development increases in magnitude as countries

develop economically. Although these differential effects might be accounted for by

sophisticated reverse causality scenarios, potential omitted variable biases, or as yet to be

formalized theories of finance and development, this paper provides the first empirical evidence

that is consistent with an influential theoretical literature predicting that securities markets

become more important for economic activity, and bank become less important, as countries

develop economically.



2. Data and Summary Statistics

       2.1. Financial system indicators

       We use several measures of bank and stock market development to analyze the

relationship between economic activity and the structure of the financial system. We would like

to have indicators of the degree to which banks and markets ameliorate market frictions and

thereby (1) improve ex ante information about possible investments, (2) enhance the monitoring

of investments after financing occurs, (3) facilitate the trading, diversification, and management

of risk, (4) ease the mobilization and pooling of savings, and (5) foster the exchange of goods,

services, and financial claims. We would also like information on how the mixture of banks and

markets affect the provision of these services. But, such empirical proxies do not exist for a

broad cross-section of countries over the last few decades. Instead, we rely on standard measures

of the size and activity of banks and securities markets. These measures are constructed over the

period from 1980 to 2008, and Table 1 provides the primary sources of these indicators.
                                                                                                    7


       To measure “bank” development, we use Private credit, which equals deposit money

bank credit to the domestic private sector as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Private

credit isolates credit issued to the private sector and therefore excludes credit issued to

governments, government agencies, and public enterprises. Private credit also excludes credits

issued by central banks. Not surprisingly, there is enormous cross-country variation in Private

credit. For example, averaging over the 1980-2008 period, Private credit was less than 10% of

GDP in Angola, Cambodia, and Yemen, while it was greater than 85% of GDP in Austria,

China, and United Kingdom. Table 2 indicates that the annual average value of Private credit

across countries was 39% with a standard deviation of 36%.

       To measure “market” development, we primarily use Stock value traded, which equals

the value of stock market transactions as a share of GDP. This market development indicator

incorporates information on the size and activity of the stock market, not simply on the value of

listed shares. Earlier work by Levine and Zervos (1998) indicates that the trading of ownership

claims on firms in an economy is closely tied to the rate of economic development. There is

substantial variation across counties. As shown in Table 2, while the mean value of Stock value

traded is about 29 percent of GDP the standard deviation is about double this value. In Armenia,

Tanzania, and Uruguay, Stock value traded annually averaged less than 0.23% over the 1980-

2008 sample (10th percentile). In contrast, Stock value traded averaged over 75% in Hong Kong,

Saudi Arabia, Switzerland, and Unites States (90th percentile).Also, we confirm this paper’s

results using other market development indicators. In particular, we examine Stock market

capitalization, which simply measures the value of listed shares on a country’s stock exchanges

as a share of GDP and Securities market capitalization, which equals the capitalization of the

stock market plus the capitalization of the private domestic bond markets, divided by GDP.
                                                                                                    8




       2.2. Other data

       As a measure of economic activity, we use Log Real GDP per capita, which equals the

logarithm of GDP per capita in constant 2000 U.S. dollars. And, to assess the independent link

between finance and economic development, we control for many other country characteristics

that have been employed in the development literature. In some specifications, we use “standard

controls” to evaluate the independent relationship between finance and economic activity. These

standard controls include: years of schooling, openness to trade, inflation, government size, the

initial GDP per capita of the economy in 1980, and dummy variables for the 5-year periods of

analysis. Consistent with theories guiding the empirical analyses (which are discussed in the

Introduction), we examine Log Real GDP per capita rather than GDP per capita growth

because we want estimates of the association between economic activity and both bank and

securities market development. With the current specification, the estimated coefficients provide

information on how Log Real GDP per capita changes when, for example, securities market

development changes. Table 1 gives the detailed definitions and sources of these data and Table

2 provides descriptive statistics.
                                                                                                    9


        2.3. Correlations

        The correlations in Table 3 highlight key features about the financial system and

economic development. First, bank and securities market development are positively correlated

with economic development. Second, bank and securities market development are positively

correlated, suggesting that financial development involves both bigger banks and bigger markets.

Though simple correlations, we will see that these basic patterns hold when controlling for many

other national traits.



3. The Relationships among Banks, Markets, and Economic Development

        3.1. Quantile regressions

        To assess how the relationships between economic activity and both bank development

and stock market development evolve with economic development, we use quantile regressions

with data averaged over non-overlapping 5-year periods. Ordinary least squares (OLS) provide

information on the relationship between Log Real GDP per capita and financial development for

the country at the average level of economic development. But, OLS does not provide

information on how the relationship between economic activity and financial development

differs for countries at different levels of economic activity.

        Our quantile regressions model the relation between Log Real GDP per capita and

financial development at the specific percentiles (or quantiles) of Log Real GDP per capita.

Thus, in a quantile regression of Log Real GDP per capita on Private credit, the procedure is able

to yield a different estimated coefficient on Private credit for each percentile (or quantile) of Log

Real GDP per capita. For example, the estimated coefficient at the 50th percentile is a median

regression, yielding the estimated relationship between Log Real GDP per capita and Private
                                                                                                     10


credit at the median level of economic activity. By computing the quantile regression for each of

the 5th to the 95th quantiles, we assess how the relationship between economic activity and

financial development differs across distinct levels of Log Real GDP per capita.

       In neither the OLS nor the quantile regressions do we identify the causal impact of bank

and securities market development on economic development. Rather, the goal is to explore

whether, and how, the relation between changes in economic activity and changes in both bank

and market development varies with the level of economic development.



       3.2. Illustrating the quantile regression results

       In Panel A of Figure 1, the graph on the upper-left-hand-side plots the coefficients from

91 separate quantile regressions for each percentile from the 5th through the 95th percentiles of

Log Real GDP per capita, where the dependent variable is Log Real GDP per capita and the

main regressor is Private credit. We also control for Stock value traded. A circle represents each

coefficient estimate produced by the quantile regression associated with the corresponding

percentile. The left axis provides information on the values of the coefficient estimates. Thus, the

estimated coefficient depicts the “sensitivity” of Log Real GDP per capita associated with a

change in Private credit at each percentile of economic development. These estimates are

statistically significant, and we provide additional information on the sensitivity of these

estimates below. The graph also plots the actual values of Private credit at each percentile, which

are designated with a triangle. The scale of the values of Private credit is provided on the right

axis. The graphs in the remainder of Panel A of Figure 1 provide similar information on the

relationship between economic activity and stock market development. The upper-right graph

provides information for Stock value traded. The lower-hand-side charts confirm the increasingly
                                                                                                     11


relevant role for securities markets by documenting similar upward trends for both Securities

market capitalization and Stock market capitalization.

       Panel B of Figure 1 provides the same types of quantile analyses, while controlling for

other characteristics of the national economies. We use as “standard controls:” Log Real GDP

per capita in 1980, Government size, Openness to trade, Inflation, Average years of schooling,

and period-fixed effects.

       In each of the eight graphs in Panels A and B of Figure 1, we provide two additional

pieces of information. First, the horizontal dotted line is the OLS estimate of the coefficient on

the financial development indicator. Thus, in the graph on the upper-left-hand-side of Figure 1-

Panel A, this line is simply the coefficient on Private credit from an OLS regression of Log Real

GDP per capita on Private credit for the full sample of country-year observations, controlling for

Stock value traded. When moving away for the mean Log Real GDP per capita, the quantile

estimates become statistically different from the OLS estimates, and we explore the nature of

these deviations below. Second, the solid line shows the estimated linear relationship between

each estimated coefficient of the financial development indicator (i.e. the circles) and the GDP

per capita percentile associated with the coefficient. As a specific example, consider the graph in

the upper-right quadrant of Figure 1-Panel B. We first collect the estimated coefficients on Stock

value traded after conditioning on the standard controls and period-fixed effects. We then regress

these estimated coefficients on the GDP per capita percentile associated with the estimates. Panel

A in Table 4, column (4) provides the results from this regression. The estimated coefficient for

each GDP per capita percentile provides the trend line graphed in Figure 1. We discuss these

results in greater depth below.
                                                                                                       12


        3.3. Discussing the quantile regression results

        In terms of bank development, Figure 1 shows that as Log Real GDP per capita rises, two

things happen: (1) Private credit rises (triangles) and (2) the marginal increase in Log Real GDP

per capita associated with an increase in Private credit falls (circles). Put differently, the level of

bank development increases, but its association with economic activity falls. We formally test

this in Panel A of Table 4. In this panel, the dependent variable is the estimated linear association

between economic activity and either bank development or securities market development at

each percentile of the distribution of GDP per capita underlying Figure 1. Regressions (1) and (2)

show that this relationship is statistically significant: as economic activity increases, there is a

significant reduction in the estimated coefficient on Private credit.

        The results are the opposite for securities market development. As Log Real GDP per

capita rises, (1) Stock value traded rises and (2) the marginal increase in Log Real GDP per

capita associated with an increase in Stock value traded also rises. That is, as countries develop

economically, securities market development increases and its association with economic

activity also increases. Regressions (3) and (4) in Panel A of Table 4 show that this effect is

statistically significant: the association between economic activity and Stock value traded

increases as Log Real GDP per capita rises. These results suggest that the relationship between

bank development and economic activity differs from the one between securities market

development and economic activity.

        Figure 1 suggests that there might be a nonlinear relationship between (1) economic

activity and bank development and (2) between economic activity and securities market

development. To assess the sensitivity of our findings and provide more information on the

nature of the relationship, we examine this more rigorously in Panel B of Table 4, which includes
                                                                                                    13


a quadratic term to allow for a potential nonlinear, parabolic relationship. This makes it possible

to estimate the level of economic activity at which the associations between financial and

economic development start to decrease as the economy develops further.

       Consistent with Figure 1, the Table 4-Panel B regression results suggest that there is a

nonlinear association between economic activity and both bank and securities market

development. At very low levels of economic development, the association between economic

activity and bank development is increasing in economic development, but the slope quickly

becomes negative. In particular, regressions (1) and (2) of Panel B indicate that the slope of the

association between economic activity and bank development becomes negative after real GPD

per capita reaches $1,032 in 2000 US dollars (36th percentile). For securities market

development, Table 4-Panel B indicates that the association between economic activity and

securities is always increasing in the 5th -95th percentile interval of economic development, but at

a decreasing rate (regressions (3) and (4)). In other words, only the upwards sloping part of the

estimated parabola is relevant. For example, the regression (4) estimates suggest that as

economies grow and move to the next percentile, the coefficient increases by more than 5

percent for countries below the 20th percentile. In contrast, the coefficient increases by just 0.7-

1.0 percent for each additional percentile from the 78th percentile upwards.



       3.4. Broader implications of quantile analyses

       The evidence is consistent with several lines of theoretical research on the evolving

importance of banks and financial markets during the process of economic development. As

noted in the Introduction, Allen and Gale (2000), Boot and Thakor (1997, 2000), Boyd and

development, economies require the types of custom-designed financial arrangements that ease

the financing of more novel, longer-term investment that often employ more intangible inputs

than the types of projects that dominate economic activity at lower levels of economic

development. These theories predict that securities markets are comparatively better than banks

at financing such activities. Thus, influential lines of theoretical analysis predict that the services

provided by securities markets will become more important for fostering economic activity as

economies grow, while those provided by banks will tend to become less important. The

quantile regression results are consistent with these predictions. At the same time, the quantile

regression results are inconsistent with the view that economic development is simply associated

with an increase in bank and stock market development with no differential effect on their

association with economic activity. That is, we find that as countries development economically,

the association between economic activity and bank development tends to weaken while the

association with securities market development tends to strengthen.



4. Conclusions

       This paper provides an empirical exploration of the evolving importance of banks and

markets during the process of economic development. As economies grow, both the banking

system and financial markets become more developed, but the association between economic

activity and bank development tends to fall while the association between economic activity and

securities market development tends to increase. Although this paper does not use instrumental

variables to identify the separate causal impacts of bank and securities markets development on

economic development at different stages of economic development, we do provide quantile

regressions that for the first time directly assess the predictions emerging from an influential line

of theoretical work on financial structure. That is, this paper’s results are consistent with the

view that (a) financial institutions provide different financial services from those provided by

financial markets and (b) as economies grow, the services provided by securities markets become

more important for promoting economic activity while those provided by banks become less

important. As such, this research suggests that policies and institutions that impede the evolution

of the structure of financial systems as economies grow can have detrimental ramifications on

economic development.

Figure 1: Quantile coefficients for Private credit and Securities Market Activity
The dependent variable is Log real GDP per capita. The figures depict the coefficients of quantile
regressions of Private credit, Stock value traded, Securities market capitalization and Stock market
capitalization as independent variables for each of the 5th to 95th percentiles of the GDP per capita
distribution on the left axis. Private credit is defined as deposit money bank credit to the private sector as %
of GDP. Stock value traded is the value of stock value transactions as % of GDP. Stock market
capitalization is the value of listed shares on a country’s stock exchanges as % of GDP. Securities market
capitalization is defined as Stock market capitalization plus Domestic private bond market capitalization as
% of GDP. Percentile values are reported on the right axis. Data are 5-year non-overlapping country
averages. Panel A does not control for additional variables. Panel B controls for Standard controls: Initial
GDP per capita, Government size, Openness to trade, Inflation, Average years of schooling, and time-fixed
effects. The horizontal dotted line depicts the OLS estimate. The solid lines represent linear fits.

Table 4: Robust regression results of linear regression fits of Figure 1
The table displays robust regressions results of the linear fits depicted in Figure 1. The dependent variables
are coefficients of quantile regressions of Private credit and Stock value traded for each of the 5th to 95th
percentiles of the GDP per capita distribution, respectively, on 5-year non-overlapping country averages.
Panel A reports a linear model, where the regressors are a constant and the income percentile associated
with the coefficient. Panel B shows the results for the quadratic model using the same independent variables
in the linear model plus the square of the percentile associated with the coefficient. Columns 1 and 3 use
coefficients of quantile regressions without additional controls (Panel A of Figure 1). Columns 2 and 4 use
coefficients of quantile regressions that include standard controls: Initial GDP per capita, Government size,
Openness to trade, Inflation, Average years of schooling, and time-fixed effects (Panel B of Figure 1). The
p-values in brackets are based on robust country-level clustered standard errors. *, **, *** denote
significance on the 10, 5, and 1-percent level, respectively.
