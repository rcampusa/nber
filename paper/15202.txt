                                             ABSTRACT

Using longitudinal elementary school teacher and student data, we document that students have larger
test score gains when their teachers experience improvements in the observable characteristics of their
colleagues. Using within-school and within-teacher variation, we further show that a teacher’s students
have larger achievement gains in math and reading when she has more effective colleagues (based
on estimated value-added from an out-of-sample pre-period). Spillovers are strongest for less-experienced
teachers and persist over time, and historical peer quality explains away about twenty percent of the
own-teacher effect, results that suggest peer learning.

      Abstract: Using longitudinal elementary school teacher and student data, we document that
      students have larger test score gains when their teachers experience improvements in the
      observable characteristics of their colleagues. Using within-school and within-teacher variation,
      we further show that a teacher’s students have larger achievement gains in math and reading when
      she has more effective colleagues (based on estimated value-added from an out-of-sample pre-
      period). Spillovers are strongest for less-experienced teachers and persist over time, and historical
      peer quality explains away about twenty percent of the own-teacher effect, results that suggest
      peer learning.


        Economists have long been concerned with human capital spillovers, given that these
have strong implications for the optimal distribution of workers both within and across firms.
When workers and their colleagues are complementary inputs in production, improvements in
coworker quality may increase a worker’s own productivity. There is evidence of such spillovers.
Workers’ wages are higher in firms with more educated coworkers [Harminder Battu, Clive R.
Belfield, and Peter J. Sloane (2003)], and wages for educated workers are higher in cities where
the share of educated workers is higher [Enrico Moretti (2004b)]. Using direct measures of
productivity, Pierre Azoulay, Jialan Wang, and Joshua Graff Zivin (2008) find that scientists
have fewer grants and publications after a high-profile scientist leaves their institution. Peer
quality may affect worker productivity, even if worker output is independent, by changing the
social context. It has been documented that supermarket checkout workers worked faster while in
the line of sight of a high-productivity worker [Alexandre Mas and Moretti (2009)], the
productivity of berry pickers converges to the productivity of their close friends when those
friends are present [Oriana Bandiera, Iwan Barankay, and Imran Rasul (forthcoming)], and the
shirking of workers who move branches is positively correlated with the average shirking of their
coworkers [Andrea Ichino and Giovanni Maggi. (2000)]. However, Jonathan Guryan, Kory
Kroft, and Matt Notowidigdo (forthcoming) find no evidence of peer effects between randomly

assigned golf partners in professional tournaments, suggesting the importance of context.
        Although much research on empirical peer effects has focused on motivation and shirking,
peer learning is an important mechanism. According to modern macroeconomic growth models
[Robert Lucas (1988); Paul Romer (1990)], knowledgeable and skilled individuals increase the
skill and knowledge of those with whom they interact, generating more ideas and faster
macroeconomic growth. Despite the importance of peer knowledge spillovers both for firms’
personnel practices and for the economy as a whole, there is little documented evidence of their
existence.1 Documenting peer learning is difficult because (1) output may be produced jointly, (2)
there may be self-selection such that observed peer ability may be endogenous to unobserved
ability, (3) peer knowledge is difficult to observe, and (4) unobserved factors could affect both
output and peer quality.
        We fill this gap in the literature, providing evidence of peer learning among teachers,
using a unique longitudinal dataset of student test scores linked to teacher characteristics in
North Carolina. Specifically, we test whether changes in a teacher’s peers affect the test score
growth of her own students, and we investigate possible mechanisms. Our empirical strategy is
to estimate a student achievement value-added model with the inclusion of teacher peer attributes
as covariates. To avoid the reflection problem [Charles F. Manski (1993)], we use two measures
of peer quality that are not determined by contact with peers: (1) observable peer characteristics
that change exogenously, such as experience and certification test scores, and (2) unobservable
peer quality based on teacher-specific, time-invariant value-added estimates from pre-sample
data. We ensure that spillovers are not driven by students having direct contact with their
teacher’s colleagues by focusing on elementary school students who only have one teacher for
the entire year.2 To ensure that we do not use changes in peer quality due to teacher self-selection,
we identify the changes in the performance of a teacher’s students that are correlated with
changes in the composition of her peers within the same school by including teacher-school fixed
effects. Lastly, we define a teacher’s peers to be all other teachers at the same school with
students in the same grade. This allows us to deal with the possibility that changes in a teacher’s

  We also remove all classrooms with teacher aides or team teachers to further eliminate the possibility of direct
contact between students and their own teacher’s colleagues. Students with an Alternative Education Program may
be exposed to guidance counselors and special educators. This is not a problem, however, because none of these
other teachers are used in our data to form the peer group.
                                                                                                 3


peers’ attributes could be correlated with changes in school attributes or school policies (i.e., a
school decides to de-emphasize math and gets rid of its best math teacher), by including year
fixed effects for each school. Because teachers may be affected by teachers in other grades, our
narrow definition of peers will provide a lower bound on the estimate of the importance of peers.
We identify the effect of peers by comparing the changes in a teacher’s students’ test scores over
time as her peers (and therefore the characteristics of her peers) change within the same school,
while controlling for school-specific time shocks.
       We find that students perform better when their teachers’ peers have better observable
characteristics. In models that use teacher value-added (based on historical student achievement
gains) as a measure of teacher quality, we find that students experience greater test score gains
when their teacher’s peers have higher mean estimated value-added in both math and reading.
These effects are robust across a variety of specifications and to our two distinct measures of
teacher peer quality. Despite the predictive power of a teacher’s peers, a failure to account for
contemporaneous peer quality has a negligible effect on the own-teacher effect. Although we are
careful to control for a variety of possible confounding influences, we do not have random
assignment of students to teachers or of teachers to peers. Because the possibility of spurious
correlation remains, we present several specification and falsification tests. These indicate that
our results are not driven by (1) endogenous peer quality changes across grades within schools or
(2) the non-random dynamic sorting of students into classrooms.
       To help disentangle peer learning from other forms of spillovers, we test for empirical
predictions that are most consistent with peer learning. We find that (1) less experienced teachers
who are still acquiring “on-the-job” skills are most sensitive to changes in peer quality, (2)
teachers with greater labor-market attachment are more sensitive to peer quality, (3) both current
and historical peer quality changes affect current student achievement, and (4) historical peer
quality explains away between 18 and 25 percent of the own-teacher effect. These findings are
consistent with either direct learning from peers or what we refer to as peer-induced learning
(learning induced by one’s peers influencing one’s decision to acquire work-related skills). This
paper provides some of the first credible empirical evidence of learning associated with one's
peers in the workplace.
       This paper contributes to the nascent literature questioning the validity of standard value-
added models by evaluating the assumption of no spillovers across teachers—a key identification
                                                                                                                  4


assumption in teacher value-added models. 3 Also, the findings here should give pause to
advocates of individual-level merit-based pay because such pay schemes could reduce teachers’
incentives to help their colleagues and could undermine peer learning.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section I presents the theoretical
framework, section II presents the identification strategy, Section III presents the data, Section
IV presents our different measures of peer quality, Section V present the results, Section VI
presents specification and falsification tests, Section VII presents evidence supporting the
learning hypothesis, and Section VIII concludes.


I       Theoretical Framework
        We aim to observe how, and try to explain why, the performance of an individual
teacher’s students is affected by arguably exogenous changes in the quality of that teacher’s
peers. 4 In this section, we outline three potentially important sources of spillovers between
teachers and outline a framework for thinking about learning between teachers.
        1. Joint production and shared resources. Even when teachers have direct contact only
with their own students, they may affect the time and other resources available to their peers’
students. Teachers may share duties outside the classroom that require time and effort, so better
peers may reduce the burden of these shared tasks. Similarly, the resources that teachers get from
the school may be affected by the activities of their colleagues. The direction of this effect is
ambiguous because more effective teachers may be better at lobbying for shared resources,
increasing the amount available for each teacher, or may take a greater share of the resources
available to the grade. A joint production explanation should yield a very simple prediction that a
teacher may be positively or negatively affected by the quality of her contemporaneous peers.
Under such an explanation, there may be substantial response heterogeneity, reflecting the fact
3
  Jesse Rothstein (2007) finds that value-added models may perform poorly in the presence of student tracking, such
that future teachers have as much predictive power as current teachers in many standard value-added models. In
contrast, Thomas J. Kane and Douglas O. Staiger (2008) use data from a random-assignment experiment and find
that several non-experimental specification estimates of teacher effectiveness have strong predictive power in an
experimental setting where students are randomly assigned to teachers. They find that patterns of fade-out over time
are very similar across experimental and non-experimental settings. Cory Koedel (2008) tests for joint production
among secondary school teachers but finds no evidence of cross-subject spillovers among high school teachers.

  There is a large literature on peer effects for students [this includes Caroline Hoxby (2000); Bruce Sacerdote
(2001); Joshua Angrist and Kevin Lang (2004); Hoxby and Gretchen Weingarth (2005); Victor Lavy and Analia
Schlosser (2007)]. There is also a literature documenting the importance of social networks [this includes Esther
Duflo and Emmanuel Saez (2003); Ron Laschever (2005); Alan T. Sorensen (2006); Dora Costa and Mathew Kahn
(2007)].
                                                                                                     5


that particular types of teachers are likely to be given certain types of tasks. Another prediction is
that all peer effects should be contemporaneous, such that they do not persist over time.
       2. Motivation and Effort. A teacher’s peers can also affect her classroom performance by
changing her own teaching effort. The presence of good teachers may motivate their colleagues
through contagious enthusiasm or through embarrassment over the unfavorable direct
performance comparison. Because overall school or grade performance may be used to evaluate
schools, the introduction of a better teacher to the grade could make free-riding more attractive.
However, Edward Kandel and Edward Lazear (1992) suggest that peer pressure may force
teachers to internalize their spillovers. If peer pressure is sufficiently strong, it could push
teachers with better peers toward higher performance. A motivation or effort explanation will have
ambiguous empirical predictions; however, the empirical work on such mechanisms in the workplace
suggests that teachers are likely to perform better if they have better peers. A simple motivation or
effort explanation implies that all peer effects should be contemporaneous.
       3. Peer Learning. Improvement in teacher effectiveness over time, particularly in the
first few years of teaching, is a consistent finding in the literature. This finding suggests that on-
the-job learning is very important for teachers. Therefore, we are interested in whether learning
is a major avenue for the transmission of peer effects. We believe that learning has several
important features that help distinguish it from other peer-effects explanations, and we examine
these empirically. (1) On average, one can learn more from better peers, so we should observe
positive correlation between peer quality and own-student performance. (2) Learning requires
investment, so teachers with greater labor-force attachment and less experience (who have more
years of teaching remaining and therefore have more years in which to benefit from investing in
their teaching skills and learning from their peers) should be more likely to invest in learning and
more sensitive to peer quality. (3) Learning is cumulative, so students should be affected by the
composition of their teacher’s past peers. (4) Because teaching ability is a combination of innate
ability and learned skills, historical peer quality should explain some of the own-teacher effect.
       One can easily distinguish a simple motivation story or a simple shared-task story from a
learning explanation by testing empirical features (1) through (4) above. However, although
these patterns imply a learning explanation, they do not necessarily imply learning directly from
one’s peers. It is possible that having better peers allows teachers to spend less time on other
shared tasks and more time learning how to be a better teacher. Also, it is possible that when
                                                                                                              6


teachers have good peers, they are motivated to be better teachers and therefore invest in learning
how to be a better teacher. Both these explanations are learning stories, but they explain peer-
induced learning rather than direct learning from peers. Because understanding how teachers
acquire human capital is important and relatively understudied, being able to distinguish any
kind of learning from other explanations is useful. Because all learning explanations could yield
the same empirical predictions, we are unable to distinguish a peer learning story from the peer-
induced learning story. We are, however, able to test for peer-related learning (either through
peers inducing a teacher to learn or through peers teaching their peers).

II      Identification Strategy
        In our analysis, a teacher’s peers are defined as those teachers in the same school who
teach students in the same grade in the same year. As discussed below, excluding peers from
other grades is crucial to our identification strategy because that allows us to control for school-
specific time shocks that could affect both student outcomes and teacher peer quality. Using
variation in the quality of all a teacher’s potential peers (teachers in all grades in the school)
could lead one to confound school shocks with changes in peer quality. This is clearly
undesirable. Teachers are more likely to be affected by their peers in the same grade, but because
teachers may be affected by teachers in other grades, our estimates, using own-grade teachers,
will provide a lower bound of the full effect of peers. Because establishing that peer effects exist
is of first-order importance, and quantifying the full effect is secondary, we focus only on that
variation that is credibly exogenous to other changes (that is, variation in own-grade peer quality
conditional on school-specific shocks).
        To infer the effect of a teacher’s peers on student test scores, we begin with our baseline
specification, a value-added model augmented to include measures of teacher peer quality.
[1]                       Ait   Ait 1   X it  W jt   P j 't   gt   ijgst .

In [1], we simplify the notation so that Ait represents Aijgst , which is the achievement score of

student i with teacher j in grade g of school s in year t. Similarly, Ait 1 represents Aijt 1 gt 1st 1t 1 ,

which is the score of student i with teacher jt-1 in grade gt-1 of school st-1 in the previous year. X it

is a vector of student characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, and parental education level, W jt

is a vector of characteristics of teacher j in year t,  gt is a grade-by-year fixed effect, and  ijgst is
                                                                                                 7


the idiosyncratic error term. P j 't is a measure of teacher peer quality. We discuss our measures
of peer quality in Section IV.
       One of the major problems in identifying credible peer effect estimates is the fact that
individuals often self-select to their peers. To avoid bias due to self-selection to peers, we
remove all potentially problematic variation in peer characteristics that occurs as a result of the
teacher’s own movement by adding a teacher-school fixed effect to [1]. As such, we identify our
effects based on changes in the characteristics of a teacher’s peers and changes in the
performance of her students, when the teacher has remained at the same school over time. By
relying only on variation within the scores of students of a given teacher within a given school,
all variation in peer quality comes from either (1) a teacher being re-assigned to another grade
within the same school or (2) the movement of peers in or out of her school and grade.
       Another major difficulty in identifying peer effects, particularly where individuals are not
randomly assigned to peers, is that changes in peer quality may be correlated with omitted
factors that also affect own outcomes. For example, a disruptive event, such as a hurricane, could
cause good teachers to leave the school at the same time that students perform poorly. Any
school-specific shock that has a deleterious effect on both peer quality and student achievement
would produce results that look like positive peer effects. To address this concern, we make
comparisons only within groups of teachers at the same school at the same time (i.e., teachers
who are subject to the same school-level shocks but teach in different grades and therefore have
different peers). We do this by also adding a school-by-year fixed effect to [1]. The school-by-
year effect removes those confounding factors that affect all grades in the school that could also
have an effect on teachers’ peer quality. Because peer quality for each teacher in a particular
school is identified at the school-grade-year level, we cannot include school-grade-year effects.
With the inclusion of school-year and grade-year and school-grade fixed effects, our estimates
will be biased only in the unlikely event that higher quality teachers are added to grades within
schools at the same time as other improvements are made that are particular to that grade within
the school. We present evidence that this was not the case in Section VI.
       Our preferred model is therefore an augmented version of the student achievement model
in equation [1] that includes teacher peer quality as an input, while also controlling for teacher-
school fixed effects and school-by-year fixed effects. Specifically, we estimate [2] below.
[2]                    Ait   Ait 1   X it   js   P j 't   gt   st   ijgst .
                                                                                                                      8


All variables are as before,  js is a teacher-school fixed effect, and  st is a year fixed effect for

each school. Although it is tempting to include as many fixed effects as possible to remove
confounding factors, such an approach often leads to weak identification, undermining the
overall objective of identifying the parameter of interest [William Anderson and Martin Wells
(2008)]. Although our preferred specification includes teacher-by-school fixed effects and
school-by-year fixed effects, to show that our results are robust across a variety of empirical
specifications, we report results from a series of regressions with the same basic specification
described in [1] but with different sets of fixed effects.


III      Data
         We use data on all third-grade through fifth-grade students in North Carolina between
1995 to 2006 from the North Carolina Education Research Data Center. 5 Our student data
include demographic characteristics, standardized test scores in math and reading, and codes
allowing us to link the data to information about the schools the students attend and the teachers
who administered their tests. We use changes in student test scores as the dependent variable, so
our regression analysis is based on the outcomes of fourth and fifth graders. According to state
regulation, the tests must be administered by a teacher, principal, or guidance counselor.
Discussions with education officials in North Carolina indicate that tests are always administered
by the students’ own teachers when these teachers are present. Also, all students in the same
grade take the exam at the same time; thus, any teacher teaching a given subject in a given grade
will almost certainly be administering the exam only to her own students. This precludes our
misspecifying a teacher as her own peer. We take several steps to limit our sample to teachers
who we are confident are the students’ actual teachers. We include only students who are being
administered the exam by a teacher who teaches math and reading to students in that grade, and
we remove teachers who are co-teaching or have a teaching aide. This process gives us roughly
1.37 million student-year observations matched to teachers we are confident taught the students
the material being tested. Summary statistics for our data are presented in Table 1.

  These data have been used by other researchers in different contexts to look at the effect of teachers on student
outcomes [Charles Clotfelter, Helen Ladd, and Jacob Vigdor (2006, 2007); Clotfelter, Ladd, Vigdor, and Justin
Wheeler (2007); Rothstein (2007)], the effect of schools on student achievement [Justine S. Hastings, Richard Van
Weelden, and Jeffrey Weinstein (2007); Hastings and Weinstein. (2007)], the effect of student demographics on
teacher quality [C. Kirabo Jackson (2009)], and the effect of schools on housing prices [Kane, Staiger, and
Stephanie Riegg (2005)].
                                                                                                                   9


        The students are roughly 62 percent white and 29.5 percent black, and are evenly divided
between boys and girls (similar to the full state sample). About 65 percent of students are the
same race as their teacher, and about 50 percent are the same sex. The average class size is 23,
with a standard deviation of 4. About 11 percent of students’ parents did not finish high school,
43 percent had just a high school diploma, roughly 30 percent had some post-high school
education but no four-year college degree, and roughly 14 percent of the students had parents
who have a four-year college degree or graduate degree as their highest level of education. The
test scores for reading and math have been standardized to have a mean of zero and unit variance,
based on all students in that grade in that year. The average year-to-year test score growth is zero,
with standard deviation of 0.583 for math and 0.613 for reading. Students in our sample attend a
total of 1,545 schools, and schools on average had 101 students and 6.6 teachers.
        About 92 percent of teachers we successfully match to students are female, 83 percent are
white, and 15 percent are black. The average teacher in our data has thirteen years of experience,
and roughly 6 percent of the teachers have no experience.6 Roughly 20 percent of teachers have
advanced degrees. The variable “regular licensure” refers to whether the teacher has received a
regular state license or instead is working under a provisional, temporary, emergency, or lateral
entry license. About 67 percent of the teachers in our sample have regular licensure. We
normalize scores on the Elementary Education or the Early Childhood Education tests that all
North Carolina elementary school teachers are required to take, so that these scores have a mean
of zero and unit variance for each year in the data. Teachers in our sample perform near the mean,
with a standard deviation of 0.81. Lastly, about 4 percent of teachers have National Board
Certification.
        For part of our analysis, we use the mean characteristics of the other teachers in the same
school and grade to indicate peer quality. Table 1 includes summary statistics for these measures.
The variation we exploit comes from the movement of peers into or out of a school grade, so we
look at several summary statistics to get a better understanding of this process in our data. First,
we consider the distribution of peer group size. The average teacher in our data has about three
other teachers in the same school grade and year that appear in our data. More than 90 percent of
teachers have six or fewer colleagues in our data. The small number of teachers per school grade

salary; therefore, it should reflect total teaching experience in any school district.
                                                                                                                    10


suggests that the relevant quality of peers in a teacher’s own grade may change substantially with
the introduction or exit of just one or two good or bad teachers. During the years 2001 through
2006, 65.8 percent of teachers are in the same school and grade as the most recent previous year
they appear in the data (going as far back as 1996), 6.0 percent are in the same school but
teaching a different grade, 7.4 percent have moved from another school in our data since the
most recent previous year, and 20.9 percent do not appear previously in our data. These high
levels of mobility aid our identification.
           We are also interested in which teachers are moving between grades and schools so we
compared the observable characteristics of teachers who are in the same grade and school as the
previous year, the same school but different grade as the previous year, a different school as the
previous year, and new to the data. The characteristics of these groups of teachers are quite
similar (with the obvious exception of experience for teachers new to the data) suggesting that
teachers who move between schools or grades are similar to teachers who do not. To see if
mobile teacher moved to schools and grades with systematically better or worse peers, we
computed the difference between each teacher’s own characteristics and the average of her new
peers’ characteristics. Teachers who move from a different grade in the same school differ from
their peers only in that they are slightly more likely to have regular licensure. Teachers moving
between schools are more likely to have advanced degrees and regular licensure than their new
peers. However, both these differences are economically small. These comparisons suggest that
teachers who change schools or grades are similar to their new colleagues.7


IV         Measures of Teacher Peer Quality
           A naïve empirical strategy to test whether teachers exert spillover effects on each other’s
students would be to estimate standard student value-added regressions with the inclusion of the
mean test score growth of a teacher’s peers’ students. We do not pursue this strategy because the
performance of a teacher’s peers’ students is itself a function of the teacher’s own attributes. We
address this problem with two different measures of peer quality that are not co-determined with
a teacher’s own performance. The first approach is to use the observable characteristics of peer
teachers, and the second is to use the value-added of peer teachers estimated in an out-of-sample
pre-period. The two different approaches complement, and provide a robustness check on, each

7
    The characteristics of mobile teachers and their new peers are summarized in Table A2 in the Online Appendix.

other. In both approaches, our models identify the social interaction effect, which is a
combination of the effect of group characteristics on individual outcomes and the effect of group
behavior on individual behavior [Manski (1993)].
Observable characteristics as a measure of quality
        For the first proxy for peer quality, we compute the average characteristics for each
teacher’s peers. For each school-year-grade cell, we compute the mean attributes of all other
teachers in that cell, so that peer quality for teacher j in grade g at school s in year t, W j ' gst , is the
mean characteristic of all other teachers j′ in grade g at school s in year t. These peer averages
are summarized in Table 1. We include these peer averages as a measure of peer quality P j 't in
equation [2]. Changes in this measure of peer quality occur when the characteristics of a
teacher’s peers change (e.g., becoming more experienced or obtaining regular licensure) or when
the identity of a teacher’s peers change. Because observable teacher characteristics such as
experience vary exogenously with time, and because teachers are unlikely to obtain certification
as a result of their peers, this approach is unlikely to be subject to the reflection problem. Our
second measure of peer quality, however, relies solely on changes in the identity of a teacher’s
peers. The first approach has the advantage of being straightforward and allowing us to include
data on almost all teachers, but, as in previous research, we find these characteristics are weak
predictors of teacher quality. For this reason, we prefer our second approach for most of our
analysis.
Estimated value-added as a measure of quality
        Our main proxy for teacher peer quality is the historical estimated value-added of a
teacher’s peers. Because a teacher’s value-added could be due to exposure to high-ability peers,
it is important to identify variation in peer quality (as measured by value-added) that is not
subject to spillover bias in the estimation equation. We address this problem by using out-of-
sample estimates of teacher value-added based on data between 1995 and 2000, while estimating
the effect of changes in estimated peer value-added on changes in own-student outcomes using
data from 2001 through 2006. Using changes in peer quality addresses the concern that the level
of a teacher’s peer quality could have been affected by her own quality in the pre-sample period.
        Using pre-sample (1995 through 2000) data, we estimate teacher value-added by
estimating a student achievement model of the form [1] with the inclusion of indicator variables
denoting if the student i is in class with teacher j (for each teacher). A detailed description of the
                                                                                                                    12


value-added estimation, including the estimation equation and the results, is included in the
Online Appendix. The coefficients on the teacher indicator variables, the  j ’s, are standardized

and normalized and are used as measures of teacher quality in the estimation sample (2001
through 2006 data). As with the observable teacher characteristics, peer quality for teacher j in
grade g at school s in year t,  j ' gst , is the mean estimated value-added of all other teachers j′ in

grade g at school s in year t. These estimated teacher value-added effects do not vary over time,
so all of the variation in mean peer value-added comes from changes in the identity of a teacher’s
peers and, as such, is not subject to the reflection problem.
           This value-added approach has the disadvantage that teachers who are not in-sample
between 1996 and 2000 will have no estimated value-added. New teachers, teachers from out of
state, and non-elementary school teachers therefore will have no estimated value-added in our
estimation sample (2001 through 2006). Because we would like to include all teachers in our
estimation sample and would like to use all of a teacher’s peers, we use the full sample of
teachers, and we assign the mean of the distribution to teachers with no estimated teacher value-
added as well as including control variables for the proportion of a teacher’s peers with no
estimated value-added. The proportion of teachers in a teacher’s peer group with no estimated
value-added serves as a proxy for the characteristics of teachers with missing peers. To ensure
that our treatment of teachers with missing value-added does not drive our results, we estimated
models that (1) include dummies for having missing peers, (2) use imputed teacher value-added
based on observable characteristics for those teachers with missing teacher effects, (3) include
the number of new teachers to the grade in a given year, and (4) used the mean only of those
teachers with estimated value-added. Across all these models, the results are virtually
unchanged.8


V        Results
         First we consider the effect of the average of teachers’ peers’ observable characteristics
on teachers’ own performance (i.e., estimating equation [2] while using observable peer
characteristics as our measure of peer quality). Table 2 presents these results. We report the


8
 Using the mean only for those teachers with estimated value-added results in peer effects that are 14 percent
smaller in math and 4 percent smaller in reading. Because ignoring teachers without value-added introduces
additional measurement error, a reduction in the estimated effect is expected. In practice, the reductions are small.
                                                                                                    13


results for math and reading test scores in the left and right panels, respectively. Although we
focus on our preferred models, we present results obtained with school fixed effects, student
fixed effects, and including both teacher-by-school and school-by-year effects. The effects of
own-teacher characteristics across all models are reasonable for both math and reading. Students
have higher test scores in both subjects when their own teacher has a regular teaching license,
has higher scores on her license exam, is fully National Board certified, and has more years of
experience. Having a teacher with no previous experience is particularly detrimental, and having
a teacher with an advanced degree appears to be negatively correlated with test scores,
conditional on the other covariates.
       We now turn our attention to the effect of peer characteristics. We focus on the results for
our preferred model in columns 3 and 6. In this specification, for both math and reading, the
coefficients on all the peer experience categories are positive and statistically significant.
Because the omitted variable is the share of peers with no years of experience, this indicates that
having more peers with more than one year of teaching experience has a statistically significant
positive effect. The differences between other experience categories are smaller and generally
not statistically significant. Average peer licensure score and the share of peers with advanced
degrees have small and statistically insignificant coefficients for both math and reading. One can
reject the joint hypothesis that the coefficients of the teacher peer characteristics are equal to zero
at the 1 percent level for both math and reading. Looking to specific characteristics, one can
reject the joint hypothesis that teacher peer experience coefficients are equal to zero at the 10
percent level for both math and reading. One cannot reject, however, the joint hypothesis that
coefficients for teacher peer characteristics, other than peer experience, are equal to zero at
traditional levels for either math or reading.
       To summarize the effect of observable peer quality, we compute the value-added
associated with a teachers own observable characteristics (from Columns 1 and 4 in Table 2),
and then use this crude estimate of value-added as a summary statistic for all of a teacher’s
observed characteristics. We then re-estimate the models replacing teacher characteristics with
these summary statistics and mean teacher peer characteristics with the mean summary statistics
of her peers. We find that a one standard deviation increase in own-teacher value-added due to
observable characteristics is associated with a 3.6 and 2.6 percent of a standard deviation
increase in math and reading test scores, respectively. Also, a one standard deviation increase in
                                                                                                                   14


peer value-added due to observable peer characteristics is associated with a 0.8 and 0.6 percent
of a standard deviation increase in math and reading test scores, respectively. These peer effects
are statistically significant at the one percent level and yield coefficients that are about a quarter
of the size of the own-teacher effect. As previously noted, observable teacher characteristics are
relatively weak predictors of a teacher’s own quality, so these results are likely to be a lower
bound on the true peer effects. We now examine the results that use pre-period value-added as a
potentially more powerful indicator of peer quality.


Peer Value-Added Results
         Table 3 shows the effect of a teacher’s peers’ estimated value-added (estimated out-of-
sample using 1995 through 2000 data) in math and reading on her own students’ math and
reading test score growth (using data from 2001 through 2006). To ensure that the teacher value-
added results are not driven simply by the observable teacher characteristics, we estimated
models that included both estimated peer quality and observable peer characteristics. The
coefficients on the observable peer characteristics are not statistically significant when estimated
peer quality is included, and the inclusion of observable teacher peer characteristics has very
little effect on the peer value-added estimates.9 This suggests that the peer value-added estimates
are not driven by any of the observable peer characteristics summarized in the previous section.
Because observable teacher peer characteristics have little predictive power conditional on
estimated teacher value-added, and because including them does not change the results in any
meaningful way, we omit observable teacher peer characteristics from this part of the analysis.
Note that all models include the full set of controls from Table 2.
         The results for both math and reading are robust across specifications that include school
fixed effects, school and student fixed effects, and our preferred model, so we focus on the
preferred specifications. The preferred model uses only within teacher and school variation to
remove any selection of teachers to better peers, and it includes school-by-year effects to account
for any school policies or school-specific shocks that could affect both peer quality and student



9
  In models that include both teacher peer experience and teacher peer value-added, one cannot reject the null
hypothesis of no teacher peer experience effects (conditional on peer value-added) at the 20 percent level for either
math or reading. In contrast, for both math and reading, the hypothesis that peers’ value-added is equal to zero
(conditional on peer experience) is rejected at the 1 percent level.
                                                                                                                   15


test scores.10 Columns 1 through 3 show the effects on math test scores. The coefficient on peer
value-added for math in column 3 is 0.0398, suggesting that a one-standard-deviation increase in
the mean estimated value-added of a teacher’s peers is associated with a 3.98 percent of a
standard deviation increase in math test scores. This is more than twice the size of the effect
estimated using observable peer characteristics. For the average teacher with three peers,
replacing one peer with another that has one standard deviation higher value-added will increase
her students’ math test scores by 1.3 percent of a standard deviation. This corresponds to
between one tenth to one fifth of the own-teacher effect. Columns 4 through 6 show the effects
on reading test scores. The effects are qualitatively similar to those for math; however, the
magnitudes are smaller (a consistent finding in the teacher quality literature). The preferred
model, in column 6, includes teacher-by-school and school-by-year effects. It shows that a one-
standard-deviation increase in mean peer value-added is associated with a statistically significant
0.026 standard deviation increase in student reading test scores. For the average teacher with
three peers, replacing one peer with another that has one standard deviation higher value-added
will increase her students’ test scores by 0.86 percent of a standard deviation. As for math, this
corresponds to between one tenth and one fifth of the own-teacher effect.11
         One implication of significant teacher peer effects is that failing to take teacher peer
inputs into account when estimating own-teacher value-added could lead to inconsistent
estimates. Although peer effects are important in explaining variation in student test scores, the
amount explained by teacher quality is virtually identical in models that include or do not include
peer value-added. In math, the proportion of the variance in test scores associated with the
teacher fixed effects, Cov( Aij , j ) / Var ( Aij ) , is 0.141 when peer attributes are included and

0.1432 when they are not included. In reading, Cov( Aij , j ) / Var ( Aij ) is 0.067 when peer

attributes are included and 0.069 when they are not included. This suggests that the explanatory
power of teacher effects is very slightly reduced when contemporaneous peer value-added is
included.12

   This was implemented using the “felsdvreg” command written by Thomas Cornellisen, described in Cornellisen
(2006), based on the three-way error model proposed by John Abowd, Robert Creecy. and Francis Kramarz (2002).
11
   A model that includes student fixed effects and teacher-school effects yields a coefficient on math peers of 0.026
with a standard error of 0.008, along with a coefficient on reading peers of 0.0196 with a standard error of 0.01.

   If some students were taught by their homeroom teacher’s peers but were wrongly classified as being taught by
the homeroom teacher, the explanatory power of the own teacher would be lower when peer attributes are included.

VI      Specifications and Falsification Tests
        Because students are not randomly assigned to teachers and teachers are not randomly
assigned to schools or classrooms, it is important that we isolate variation that is not confounded
by student selection, teacher-self-selection, or correlated with confounding factors that also
affect student achievement. Although including teacher-by-school effects credibly addresses the
self-selection of teachers to peers, and although the inclusion of school-by-year effects credibly
addresses the concern that schools that see improvements in peer quality may be improving in
other areas, a few endogeneity concerns remain. We address these below.
Dynamic sorting could bias the estimated teacher effects and lead to spurious peer effects.
        It is possible that our results are confounded by dynamic sorting (or tracking) that would
not be fully controlled for with a time-invariant student fixed effect or time-changing lagged test
scores for two reasons. First, one of the identifying assumptions required to obtain unbiased
teacher fixed effects on average, is that unobserved student characteristics are uncorrelated with
true teacher ability, conditional on the included covariates. Dynamic sorting not captured by
lagged test scores and other observable student characteristics could lead to bias in the estimated
teacher value-added. Second, one of the identifying assumptions in the peer value-added models
is that changes in a teacher’s peers are uncorrelated with unobserved student characteristics. This
may not be true with dynamic student sorting. For example, suppose principals assign “difficult”
students to teachers with the highest value-added and assign the “easiest” students to less
experienced or less able teachers. In such a scenario, when a strong older teacher retires and is
replaced by a weaker and less experienced teacher, incumbent teachers will be more likely to
receive the “difficult” students. Sorting of students across classrooms in such a manner would
make it look as though having weaker peers hurts the incumbent teacher if the econometrician is
unable to control sufficiently for student ability. This particular dynamic sorting story would be
problematic because it would generate a negative correlation between true teacher quality and
unobserved student ability.
        Since these are important potential threats to validity of our results, we present a
falsification test of our identifying assumption that the unobserved student error term is not
correlated with teacher value-added (i.e. E[ i |  ]  0 ) in Table 4. Because a student’s future


The fact that the explanatory power of the own teacher is unchanged when peers are also included is consistent with
our contention that the spillovers are not due to the actual teacher being misclassified as the teacher’s peer.
                                                                                                    17

teacher should have no causal effect on that student’s current test score performance, any non-
zero effect would indicate bias. We contend that if there is positive/negative selection, the
estimated value-added of the teacher the student will have in the following year will be
positively/negatively correlated with the student’s achievement in the current year. If there is
positive/negative   selection,   those    teachers   who    are   systematically    associated    with
contemporaneous gains should be predictive of test score gains/losses for their future students.
       Columns 1 and 2 show the coefficients of the estimated value-added (estimated out of
sample) of a student’s current teacher and her future teacher for math and reading respectively.
These models include all student and teacher characteristics, school fixed effects, and grade-by-
year fixed effects. (The main conclusions are invariant to the specification chosen.) Although the
coefficient on the current teacher effect is 0.12 for math and 0.052 for reading (both significant at
the 1 percent level), the coefficients for the future teacher’s effect are only 0.002 and -0.002 for
math and reading, respectively (both have p values greater than 0.3). Teachers that we identify as
effective have a strong positive effect on their current students’ test scores but no effect on their
future students’ test scores. The null hypothesis of equality of the current teacher effect and the
future teacher effect is rejected at the 1 percent level, the future teacher’s coefficients are both
less than one tenth the size of those for contemporaneous teachers, and the future teacher effects
for reading and math have opposite signs. This last fact is inconsistent with systematic selection
because the math and reading teachers are, in fact, the same teacher. Furthermore, the standard
errors on the future teacher value-added are small, indicating that the true values, if not actually
zero, are very close to zero. These results suggest that no systematic student sorting occurs.
        While we show that the estimated value-added of a student's future teacher does not
predict their current test scores, it is helpful to show that a student's teacher's future peers do not
affect the student's current test scores. Because teachers cannot learn from their future peers,
future peers should have no effect on current student outcomes. As such, if our results were
picking up some spurious correlation due to dynamic sorting, one might expect to find similar
effects for a teacher's future peers as that of her current or past peers. We test this hypothesis by
estimating the peer value-added model while including a teacher’s current peers, her peers in the
two previous years, (lagged peers) and her peers in the following year (future peer). These results
are presented in columns 7 and 8 of Table 4.
        For neither reading nor math scores is the coefficient on mean peer quality the following
                                                                                                   18

year statistically significant. In contrast, the effect of lagged peers is large and statistically
significant for math, and the second lag is large and statistically significant for reading. Also, the
point estimates are smaller than those of either of the lags or the contemporaneous effects for
both math and reading. This test supports the validity of our strategy for three reasons. First, the
future teacher effects are not even marginally statistically significant. Second, the future teacher
effects are smaller than the current effects and the lag effects for both math and reading, which
under the null hypothesis of no causal effect and independence would happen only with
probability ((0.5)3 ) 2  0.0156 . Third, one can reject the null hypothesis that the future teacher
effect is the same as at least one of the lags or contemporaneous effects for both subjects at the
10 percent level. These results suggest that the identification strategy is valid.
Changes in peer quality within schools may be endogenous, so that peer quality
improvements coincide with other grade specific interventions
     The remaining endogeneity concern is that schools may be more likely to shift good
teachers across grades or to hire better new teachers into a grade (at the same time as the schools
shift other resources) when particular grades are performing poorly relative to other grades in the
school. In this scenario, even with controls for school-by-year effects, some peer effects could be
confounded by other resources and efforts in that grade. We believe that bias resulting from new
hiring being correlated with other grade-specific changes is unlikely because schools do not have
much control over when teachers leave and because new hiring is likely to take place because of
changes in class size or from vacancies occasioned by voluntary turnover. It is possible, however,
that principals shift teachers across grades in response to poor grade performance at the same
time that they implement other grade-specific improvements. We empirically test the possibility
of endogenous peer changes both from outside the school and from within the school into a grade.
       Specifically, we test for whether, conditional on school-by-year effects, current student
performance, lagged students performance, or current peer quality affect the likelihood that a
given grade in a given school receives a new peer. We test separately for receiving a peer from
the same school, having a new peer in the grade from a different school in North Carolina, or
having a new peer in the grade from outside the data. We present the results in Online Appendix
Table A3. Across various specifications, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the arrival of a
new teacher to a particular grade within a school is unrelated to the historical level and growth of
test outcomes, or to the estimated value-added of incumbent teachers in the grade, in both
                                                                                                   19

reading and math. However, teacher experience variables do have predictive power, as one
would expect given that experience is a strong predictor of retirement. In sum, we find no
evidence of endogenous peer changes.


VII    Suggestive Evidence of Learning
       We show in Section V that teachers perform better when their peers are better, in terms of
both observed and unobserved quality. As discussed in Section I, peer spillovers could exist for a
variety of reasons. In this section, we test the four empirical predictions described in Section I
that would be consistent with peer learning or peer-induced learning. All results from this point
on include teacher-school and school-year fixed effects.
       As discussed in Section I, since learning requires some investment on the part of a
teacher we might expect those teachers with the most to gain from these investments to do so. As
such, if the results we observe are the result of teachers investing in job specific human capital,
we might expect the effects of peers to be largest among teachers who ex ante would experience
larger benefits from job specific human capital investments. Most models of job specific human
capital suggest that workers with longer time horizons to benefit from learning such as younger
workers and workers with greater labor force attachment will be most likely to invest in job
specific human capital [Gary S. Becker (1962); Boyan Jovanovic (1979)]. We test for these
patters in our data by testing if the marginal effect of peers is larger for teachers with fewer years
of experience, teachers who are National Board certified, and teachers who are fully licensed.
The results are presented in Online Appendix Table A4.
       For both math and reading, first-year teachers are more responsive to peer quality
changes than teachers with 1 or more years of experience. The null hypothesis of equality of
effects is rejected at traditional levels for math (p value = 0.001) but not for reading (p value =
0.54). However, for neither math nor reading are the marginal effects monotonic in experience.
Given that the first year of teaching is the one when teachers acquire the most on-the-job
knowledge (as evidenced by the very steep experience value-added profile), these findings
support a learning interpretation. The results by National Board certification status and license
status also support a learning interpretation. Specifically, the interactions between peer quality
and being a fully licensed teacher are positive and statistically significant at the 10 percent level
for both math and reading. The interactions between peer quality and being fully certified yield
                                                                                                                     20

positive, albeit not statistically significant, point estimates for both math and reading. In sum,
while not conclusive, the results are consistent with the notion that teachers with greater labor
market attachment are more sensitive to peer quality changes.
           One of the principal differences between the alternative explanations for the peer
effects observed in our main results is that if these peer effects are caused by learning, they
should (1) be persistent over time and (2) have the same sign. Although differences in resources
or motivation caused by having better peers should have little effect once the teacher’s peers
change, any learning that has occurred should stay with the teacher. We test whether peer quality
continues to affect a teacher in future years by including the first and second lag of the teacher’s
average peer quality, along with the contemporaneous measure of the quality of peers in that year.
Results are presented in columns 5 and 6 of Table 4. Consistent with a learning interpretation,
the peer effects are persistent. For math, in column 5, the coefficient on the contemporaneous
effect is 0.031, the coefficient on the first lag is 0.037, and the coefficient on the second lag of
the peer effect is 0.01. The contemporaneous effect and the lagged effect are both statistically
significant at the 1 percent level, while the second lag is statistically significant at the 10 percent
level. For reading, in column 6, the coefficient on the contemporaneous effect is 0.033, the
coefficient on the first lag is 0.021, and the coefficient on the second lag of the peer effect is
0.018. All effects are statistically significant at the 5 percent level. For both subjects, the null
hypothesis that the historical effects are equal to zero is rejected at the 5 percent level. These
findings support a learning interpretation. These results suggest that the total effect of peers is
larger than what we estimate in the main baseline regression. A one-standard-deviation increase
in teacher peer quality that persists over time is associated with a 0.078 standard deviation
increase in student test scores in math and a 0.072 standard deviation increase in student test
scores in reading after two years.13
         Because learning is a cumulative process, another prediction of the learning model is that
historical peer quality should “explain away” some of the predictive power of teacher fixed
effects. If teachers learn from their peers (or as a result of exposure to their peers), and if learning
becomes part of teacher ability, then there should be less variation attributable to the time-
invariant teacher indicator variables conditional on the history of their peers. We test this

13
  The persistence of peer quality over time also provides compelling evidence that our results are not driven by
direct contact between students and their teacher’s current peers and is further evidence that our central findings are
not driven by dynamic student sorting.

hypothesis by comparing the fraction of the variance in test scores explained by the individual
teacher effects in models that do and do not control for lagged peer quality. In models that
include only contemporaneous peer quality, Cov(Aij, θj) / Var(Aij) is 0.141 for math and 0.067
for reading. In models that include the first and second lags of peer quality, Cov(Aij, θj) / Var(Aij)
is 0.117 for math and 0.052 for reading. These differences suggest that between 18 and 24
percent of the contemporaneous own-teacher effect can be attributed to her peers in the two
previous years. This suggests learning and indicates that the observed spillovers are not due to
transient changes in motivation or the allocation of non-classroom tasks as a result of
contemporaneous peer quality changes.14
         In sum, the empirical predictions that suggest peer learning are supported by the data.
Although not all of the interaction effects yield statistically significant estimates, all the point
estimated are consistent with a peer learning interpretation of the spillovers. Although we cannot
prove that the spillovers are due to peer learning, the evidence, taken in its entirely, suggests that
teachers either learn directly from their peers (direct peer learning) or make the decision to invest
in the learning as a direct result of exposure to better peers (peer induced learning).


VIII     Conclusions
         We document that a teacher’s own performance is affected by the quality of her peers. In
particular, changes in the quality of a teacher’s colleagues (all other teachers in the same school
who teach students in the same grade) are associated with changes in her students’ test score
gains. Using two separate measures of peer quality, one based on observable teacher
qualifications and the other on estimated peer effectiveness, we find that teachers perform better
when the quality of their peers improves within the same school over time. This within-teacher
relationship is robust to including school-by-year fixed effects to account for changes in school
attributes over time that could be correlated with changes in the make-up of the teacher


14
  As a test of whether teachers acquire grade-specific knowledge such as how to teach fourth-grade math or more
general teaching skills that would apply to all grades, we interacted the lagged peer value-added with indicators for
whether the teacher moved to a new grade at the same school. If teachers acquired grade-specific skills, one would
expect there to be greater persistence of peer effect for teachers who remain in the same grade. For math, the
interactions are all positive and statistically insignificant, indicating that grade-specific knowledge may drive the
spillovers for math. The joint hypothesis that all the interactions are equal to zero is rejected at the 10 percent level.
For reading, however, the results are mixed. The second lag is less persistent, while the first lag is more persistent
for mobile teachers. The joint hypothesis that all the interactions are equal to zero is rejected at the 5 percent level.
In sum, the results of this test are mixed and inconclusive.

population. Findings are also robust to including student fixed-effects. In our preferred model, a
one–standard-deviation improvement in observable teacher peer quality is associated with a
0.008 and 0.006 standard deviation increase in math and reading scores respectively. Using
estimated value-added (estimated out-of-sample to avoid simultaneity bias), which is a much
better predictor of subsequent student achievement, we find that a one-standard-deviation
improvement in estimated teacher peer quality is associated with a 0.0398 standard deviation
increase in math scores and a 0.026 standard deviation increase in reading scores. Across both
these measures of teacher quality and different specifications, for the average teacher with three
peers, replacing one peer with another that has one standard deviation higher value-added
corresponds to between one fifth and one tenth of the effect of replacing the own teacher with
another that has one standard deviation higher value-added. We present a variety of falsification
tests showing that our results are probably not driven by non-random dynamic student sorting
across classrooms, or by the endogenous movement of teachers across grades or schools.
       In an attempt to determine the mechanisms behind these spillovers, we test for empirical
patters that are consistent with peer related learning. First, we show that less experienced
teachers are generally more responsive to changes in peer quality than more experienced teachers.
We also find that teachers who are certified and have regular licensure are generally more
responsive to peer quality. The most compelling piece of evidence supporting the learning
hypothesis is that the effect of teacher peer quality is persistent over time. Most peer effects that
operate either through the education production function or through peer monitoring/pressure
will have a contemporaneous effect. We show that for both math and reading, the quality of a
teacher’s peers the year before, and even two years before, affect her current students’
achievement. For both subjects, the importance of a teacher’s previous peers is as great as, or
greater than, that of her current peers. The cumulative effect over three years of having peers
with one standard deviation higher effectiveness is 0.078 standard deviations in math and 0.072
standard deviations in reading. Because teachers have about three peers on average, this is about
one third of the size of the own-teacher effect, suggesting that over time, teacher peer quality is
very important. Lastly, we find that peer quality in the previous two years “explains away” about
one fifth of the explanatory power of individual teachers. This suggests that a sizable part of the
own-teacher effect is learned as a result of exposure to her previous peers. Although we
acknowledge that we cannot prove peer related learning, we believe these pieces of evidence
                                                                                                   23

lend themselves most naturally to a peer related learning interpretation (either learning directly
from peers, or peer induced learning).
       As a theoretical matter, knowledge spillovers are tremendously important in canonical
models of economic growth, despite relatively little empirical support. Our findings provide
important micro evidence of this type of productivity spillover. From a policy perspective, the
finding that teachers learn as a result of their peers is important because it has direct implications
for how teachers should be placed in schools and how they should be compensated. For example,
compensation schemes that reward a teacher’s performance relative to her peers may be
detrimental to fostering peer learning. Also, the fact that weaker and less experienced teachers
are more responsive to peer quality than stronger and more experienced teachers suggests that
novice teachers should be exposed to effective experienced teachers. This would imply that the
high concentration of novice teachers in inner-city schools could be particularly detrimental to
student performance at these schools in both the long and the short run.
       Although we find little evidence, in our data, that a failure to account for
contemporaneous peers lead to biased estimates of the effect of own-teachers on student test
scores, we do show that the assumption of no spillovers across teachers is not valid. Although
our results are particularly relevant for the education setting, they add to the broader literature on
peer effects. They highlight the type of data necessary to find evidence of peer effects and some
of the features that may distinguish peer related learning from other types of peer spillovers.
Although teachers in elementary school may be a somewhat unique group, the existence of peer
effects and the suggestion of peer learning in this environment are suggestive that such spillovers
may exist in other settings.

Notes: Estimated using data from 2001 through 2006. All models include indicator variables for the gender
and racial matches between the teacher and the students, class size, and year-by-grade fixed effects. All
regressions include student demographic control variables except models that include student fixed effects.
All regressions include teacher control variables except models that include teacher fixed effects (note that
teacher experience is included in all models). All models include indicators for missing estimated value-
added as well as the proportion of peers with no estimated value-added. The omitted teacher experience
group is teachers with missing experience data.

Notes: Estimated using data from 2001 to 2006. The variable “peer effect” is the mean estimated value-added of a teacher’s
peers (all other teachers at the same school in the same grade during the same year). All models include indicator variables
for the gender and racial matches between the teacher and the students, class size, student demographic control variables,
teacher experience, indicators for missing estimated value-added, the proportion of peers with no estimated value-added, and
year-by-grade fixed effects. The omitted teacher experience group is teachers with missing experience data.

teachers at the same school in the same grade during the same year). All models include indicator variables for the gender and racial
matches between the teacher and the students, class size, student demographic control variables, teacher experience, indicators for missing
estimated value-added, the proportion of peers with no estimated value-added, and year-by-grade fixed effects. The omitted teacher
experience group is teachers with zero years of experience.
a. Best Teacher and Worst Teacher are indicator variables that take the value of one if the teacher has the highest or lowest estimated
value-added among her peers, respectively, and zero otherwise.

Appendix Note 1: Estimating Teacher Fixed Effects

       There are several specifications used in the literature to estimate teacher value-added [e.g.
Aaronson et. al. 2007, Rockoff 2004, Hanushek, Kain, and Rivkin 2005, Jacob and Lefgren
2008]; however, the predictive power of estimated teacher fixed effects are generally robust to
the chosen specification [Kane and Staiger (2008)]. We estimate teacher fixed effects using the
adjusted test score growth model described in Section II. Specifically, teacher effectiveness
comes from estimation of equation [3] using data from 1995 through 2000.

All variables are defined as before, with the addition of  j ,which is the effect of teacher j. ˆ is
the coefficient on lagged test scores in a test score growth model obtained from a 2SLS
regression using the second lag of test scores as an instrument for lagged test scores. Because we
use the first year of data to compute test score growth for 1996, the actual estimation sample
used spans the years 1996 through 2000. Because we need estimates of teacher value-added that
can be comparable across schools, grades, and classes, we do not include school or student fixed
effects but rather include a set of demographic controls for the students and schools.1
        Researchers have pointed out that there is substantial measurement error in test scores
such that the coefficient on lagged test score would be downward biased.2 Under the assumption
that measurement errors in test scores are not correlated over time, many researchers have used
the second lag of test scores as an instrument for the lagged test score [as proposed in Anderson
and Hsiao (1981) and Todd and Wolpin (2003)]. One downside of this approach is that it
requires several years of data for each student and is impractical to implement in models that
include large vectors of three fixed factors. We propose a method that builds on this solution but
allows one to use more of the available data. The basic idea is that if using the second lag of test
scores as an instrument for the lagged test score results in a consistent estimate of  , then one
can use this estimate to adjust the test score growth outcome variable for the full sample and
obtain consistent estimates on the coefficient for other characteristics that may be correlated with
lagged test scores. We present a proof of this below.
          This is implemented by first estimating the instrumental variables regressions on the
full sample, where the second lag of test scores is used as an instrument for the first lag of test
scores. The consistent estimates of the coefficient on lagged test scores is therefore estimated in
sample. Because this can be estimated only for students with two lags of test scores, this 2SLS
model uses only grade 5 outcomes. We then estimate the sample analog of equation [4]

  Specifications that include student or school fixed effects identify teacher value-added based on within-school or
within-student variation. If teachers are very different across schools, then much of the variation in teacher quality
(i.e., the cross-school variation) will be absorbed by the school fixed effect, making estimated effects across schools
impossible to compare. Including student fixed effects further exacerbates this problem by allowing only
comparisons of teachers who teach the same groups of students. If those teachers who teach the gifted and talented
students are of different average quality from those who teach the regular students, the estimated teacher value-
added can be used only to compare teachers who share the same students, so that comparing teachers who teach
different students (even within the same school) may be misguided.

  This is the same as saying that there is attenuation bias on the coefficient of lagged test scores in [3] due to
measurement error in test scores. If lagged test scores are correlated with other covariates (very likely), this will bias
the coefficients for all covariates.

(replacing  with ˆ ) using all the observations for which lagged test score are available. As a
practical matter, although the 2SLS coefficient on lagged test scores (between 0.97 and 0.95) is
much smaller than the OLS estimates (between 0.70 and 0.76), the peer effects results are similar
across models, so that our results are not driven by any modeling assumptions from this
procedure. However, the teacher value-added estimates perform better in the falsification test of
Section VI (as would be expected if the 2SLS adjustment removes measurement error bias from
the teacher estimates).

Proof : Consider the following. We can rewrite [3] as Ait   Ait 1   H it   it where H it denotes
all observable covariates and teacher, grade, and school subscripts are suppressed. Suppose we
have a consistent unbiased estimate ˆ of  such that lim n  ˆ   and E (ˆ)   . Where test
scores are measured with error such that Aˆ  A  u and one uses ˆ in the place of  , this can
                                                      it      it    it

Equation [4] can be directly estimated using OLS where the unobserved error term
is  uit 1  uit   it . Because H it is uncorrelated with uit 1 , uit , and  it by assumption, the OLS
estimate  of  from [4] will be unbiased and consistent iff E[Cov           ( H , (  ˆ ) A )]  0 where
                                                                                     it         it 1
