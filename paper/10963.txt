                                            ABSTRACT


In 1971 President Nixon declared war on cancer and increased the federal funds allocated to cancer
research dramatically. Thirty years later, many have declared this war a failure. Overall cancer
statistics confirm this view: age-adjusted mortality in 2000 was essentially unchanged from the early
1970s. At the same time, age-adjusted mortality rates from cardiovascular disease have fallen quite
dramatically. Since the causes underlying cancer and cardiovascular disease are likely to be
correlated, the decline in mortality rates from cardiovascular disease may be somewhat responsible
for the rise in cancer mortality. It is natural to model mortality with more than one cause of death as
a competing risks model. Such models are fundamentally unidentified, and it is therefore difficult
to get a clear picture of the progress in cancer. This paper derives bounds for aspects of the
underlying distributions under a number of different assumptions. Most importantly, we do not
assume that the underlying risks are independent, and impose weak parametric assumptions in order
to obtain identification. The theoretical contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to
estimate competing risk models with interval data and discrete explanatory variables, both of which
are common in empirical applications. We use our method to estimate changes in cancer and
cardiovascular mortality since 1970. The estimated bounds for the effect of time on the duration until
death for either cause are fairly tight and we find that trends in cancer show much larger
improvements than previously estimated. For example, we find that time until death from cancer
increased by about 10% for white males and 20% for white women.

1        Introduction

In 1971 President Nixon declared war on cancer. As a result the Nixon administration created a
National Cancer Program administered by the National Cancer Institute, and increased the federal
funds allocated to cancer research dramatically.1 Thirty years later, however, many have declared
this war a failure (Bailar and Smith (1986), Bailar and Gornik (1997), etc). Overall cancer statistics
confirm this view. Age-adjusted mortality from cancer increased from 198.7 (per 100,000) in 1973
to 213 in 1993, and then it fell to about its 1973 levels (198.6) in 2000. Incidence rates show a
similar pattern, increasing from 385 in 1973 to 509.85 in 1992, and then decreasing to 477 in 2000
(SEER (2004)).
        At the same time, age-adjusted mortality rates from cardiovascular disease have fallen quite
dramatically. (See Figure 3.) It has been hypothesized that the decline in mortality rates from
cardiovascular disease is somewhat responsible for the rise in cancer mortality. In other words,
perhaps if there had been no progress in cardiovascular disease, we might have observed different
trends in cancer mortality. The intuition behind the hypothesis that observed cancer trends are
biased is that the fall in mortality rates from cardiovascular disease leaves more and perhaps
different individuals at risk for cancer. Indeed for younger individuals, for whom cardiovascular
disease is not a large competing risk, there have been large improvements in cancer: since 1973,
cancer mortality for children and adolescents (under age 20) has fallen by more than 50% across
all types of cancers, and it fell by 20% for young adults ages 20 to 44. Moreover these reductions
have occurred in spite of the increases in cancer incidence for both groups (Doll (1991)). The
same is not true for older adults. Although it has long been recognized that dependent competing
risks can affect trends in cancer mortality, no estimates of cancer trends exist that account for this
possibility.2 In fact in 1990, the Extramural Committee to Assess Measures of Progress Against
Cancer recommended “additional research on how cancer statistics are affected by changes in other
causes of death.”
        This paper derives bounds for aspects of the underlying distributions under a number of different
assumptions. Most importantly, we do not assume that the underlying risks are independent,
and impose very weak parametric assumptions in order to obtain identification. The theoretical
contribution of the paper is to provide a framework to estimate competing risk models with interval

        Chiang (1991), Rothenberg (1994) and Llorca and Delgado-Rodriguez (2001) have investigated the effects of
cardiovascular mortality trends on trends in cancer mortality. However as Wohlfart and Andersen (2001) point out,
these authors assume that risks are independent in their analyses.

data and discrete explanatory variables, both of which are common in empirical applications.
There are a number of economic applications of the competing risks model in economics. For
example, Flinn and Heckman (1982) investigated the duration of unemployment where an employed
individual could terminate a spell of unemployment either by finding a job or by leaving the labor
market. Katz and Meyer (1990) used the competing risks model to study the probability of leaving
unemployment through recalls and new jobs. Other applications include studies of age at marriage
or cohabitation (Berrington and Diamond (2000)), Ph. D. completion (Booth and Satchell (1995)),
and mortgage termination (Deng, Quigley, and Van Order (2000)). The competing risks model is
also closely related to the Roy (1951) model studied in Heckman and Honoré (1990) and Heckman,
Smith, and Clements (1997).
        This framework is then applied to mortality data from the US to estimate the trends in cancer
mortality, which are the most widely used measure of overall progress against cancer.3 We find
that trends in cancer show much larger improvements than previously estimated.


2        Data

We use mortality rates by single year of age, gender, race (black and white) and cause of death.
These were calculated by matching population data from the Census Bureau and number of deaths
from the Multiple Cause of Death Mortality files from 1970, 1980, 1990 and 2000. We computed
mortality rates for three causes of death: cardiovascular disease (hereafter CVD), cancer and all
other causes. (For data sources and details see the appendix.) We restrict the sample to individuals
over age 45, so all the results we present are conditional on survival to that age. For 1970, population
counts exist by single year of age up to age 79, and by 5-year intervals over age 80. To obtain
consistent results over time, we therefore censor durations for all years at age 80.
        Table 1 presents summary statistics of the data (prior to censoring at age 80) for each census
year and for four demographic groups defined by gender and race. It documents the well-known
    3
        There are several measures used to assess progress in cancer, including age-adjusted incidence rates, 5–year
survival rates conditional on diagnosis, and mortality rates. Both survival rate conditional on diagnosis and incidence
rates are affected by improvement in diagnosis technology. Better diagnostic tools allow for detection of tumors at
earlier stages, generating a mechanical increase in survival rates that does not reflect improvements in prevention
or treatment (Welch, Schwartz, and Woloshin (2000)). Similarly, improved detection increases observed incidence,
even though disease rates may not have changed. Additionally, diagnosis is a function of access to care, further
complicating the interpretation of changes in incidence and 5-year survival rates. For these reasons, when reporting
to the Senate Appropriations committee in 1990, the Extramural Committee to Assess Measures of Progress against
Cancer concluded that age-specific cancer mortality is the best measure of progress again cancer.

patterns in mortality. As of 1970, between 55 and 70% of individuals died from CVD. However
there were large differences across demographic groups in age at death from all causes and from
cancer and CVD: white women lived the longest, followed by white men, black women and lastly
black men. From 1970 to 2000, all groups experienced an increase in the age at death; and the
share of individuals dying from cardiovascular disease fell dramatically while the share dying from
cancer increased for all groups (although it fell in the 1990s for all except white men). But again
there are some important differences across groups: the increase in life expectancy was largest for
black females, the reductions in the percentage of CVD deaths were largest for whites and the
percentage increases in deaths from cancer were largest for black men. Because of these differences
we analyze the results separately for each group.
    With our data we can calculate the observed hazard rates using a discrete time Kaplan–Meier
estimator. Figures 5 and 6 show these sub–hazards for white males, white females, black males and
black females, for cancer and CVD separately. These hazard rates present in more detail the same
trends that the summary statistics show. Hazard rates from CVD declined quite significantly in
every decade for all groups. On the other hand, there is no discernible trend in cancer hazard rates.
It is also clear that hazard rates are fairly different across demographic groups. From these graphs
we also note that hazard rates are much more volatile among blacks, especially at older ages. This
is true for both causes of death, but it is more pronounced for cancer rates. Censoring at age 80
alleviates the problem somewhat since hazard rates become even more volatile for older ages (not
shown).


3     Competing Risks

In this section we review the theory on competing risks, illustrating issues and methods in the
context of cancer and cardiovascular mortality and using the data we just described.


3.1   Set–up

Formally, a competing risks model is a duration model where the observed duration is the shortest
of a number of latent durations. In addition it is typically also assumed that the identity of the
shortest duration is observed. Mathematically, we observe T and δ where

                      (T, δ) = (min {T1 , T2 , ..., TK } , arg min {T1 , T2 , ..., TK }) .

See, for example, Kalbfleisch and Prentice (1980) or Crowder (2001). Much of the terminology
in this literature is motivated by medical applications where Tk could be the unobserved (latent)

                                                       5
duration until death from a specific cause (risk) such as cancer or cardiovascular disease, T the
observed duration until death and δ the cause of death. In order to simplify the exposition and to
present the theory related to the specific case we analyze, we will focus on the case where K = 2 in
what follows. The general case requires no additional ideas, but the notation is substantially more
cumbersome in that case.
   In this paper we will use the notation

                               T ∗ = min {T1 , T2 } ,       δ = 1 {T1 < T2 }

and the object of interest will be features of the distribution of (T1 , T2 ) given a set of explanatory
variables X. Knowledge of the joint distribution of the unobserved, latent distributions T1 and
T2 (given X) allows one to answer policy questions that one could not answer on the basis of the
distribution of (T ∗ , δ) (given X). For example, the latter will not allow one to evaluate the effect
of eliminating one of the risks on the distribution of the duration until death.
   As discussed below, applications of competing risks models have often, though not always, as-
sumed that the underlying latent durations are statistically independent. While such an assumption
is reasonable in some contexts, there are at least two related reasons why one could suspect it to
be violated in specific situations.
   The first reason why the latent durations might be dependent is that the same underlying
process affects both risks. In the case of CVD and cancer, there are several common risk factors
that affect both. The American Heart Association lists smoking, drinking alcohol in large amounts,
and obesity as factors that increase the likelihood of coronary heart disease, stroke, high blood
pressure and hypertension. Moderate alcohol consumption and exercise on the other hand reduce
blood pressure and coronary heart disease. The National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer
Society also document that the same factors affect the risk of certain cancers. Smoking increases
cancers of the respiratory system, as well as other cancers. Obesity increases the risk of cancer of
the uterus, breast and prostate cancer among others. Excessive alcohol use increases the risk of
cancer of the mouth, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, liver, and breast. Exercise is thought to reduce
the risk of colon and breast cancers, and moderate alcohol consumption may lower the risk of
leukemia, skin, breast and prostate cancers. This evidence suggests that at the individual level,
cancer and CVD are not independent risks.
   Additionally, heterogeneity across individuals can cause the underlying latent durations to be
dependent even if the risks are independent for every individual in that population (Vaupel and
Yashin (1999)). There is substantial evidence of genetic differences across individuals with respect
to their susceptibility to both CVD (Nabel (2003)) and cancer (e.g. Lynch and de la Chapelle (2003),

                                                        6
Wooster and Weber (2003)).4 This will cause the latent duration until death from CVD and cancer
to be correlated. Furthermore there are large differences in the population in terms of exposure
to environmental factors and behaviors that increase particular death risks. For example in 2000,
high school dropouts were more than twice as likely to smoke than college–educated individuals;
women below poverty level were twice as likely as women in the highest income levels to be obese;
married individuals were less likely to exercise than those who have never married; and Hispanics
were less likely than non-Hispanics to drink (Schoenborn, Adams, Barnes, Vickerie, and Schiller
(2004)).
      This suggests that it is interesting to consider competing risks models with dependent latent
durations.


3.2      Identification

The identification of the competing risks model is tricky. The key result in this literature is that for
any joint distribution of (T1 , T2 ), there exists (unique) univariate distribution for S1 and S2 , such
that if S1 and S2 are independent, then the distribution of (min {T1 , T2 } , 1 {T1 < T2 }) equals that of
(min {S1 , S2 } , 1 {S1 < S2 }) See Cox (1962) and Tsiatis (1975). In other words, for every dependent
distribution of (T1 , T2 ), one can find an independent distribution that generates observationally
equivalent data. Since this exercise can be carried out conditional on a set of explanatory variables
X, the relationship between T1 and T2 conditionally on X is fundamentally unidentified, and it is
not possible to use observational data only to test whether or not the risks are dependent. It is
therefore necessary to make additional assumptions if one wants to answer questions that require
exact knowledge of the joint distribution of (T1 , T2 ).
      Broadly speaking, there have been three approaches to dealing with the identification problem
in competing risks. The first is to make no additional assumptions and to estimate bounds for the
object of interest, for example the marginal distributions of the underlying durations. The second
approach is to assume that the risks are independent (conditional on a set of observed covariates)
in which case estimation of competing risks models amounts to estimation of duration models with
random censoring. The third broad approach is to specify a parametric or semiparametric model
for (T1 , T2 ) conditional on the covariates. The approach taken in this paper is a combination of the
first and the third approach.
      If one is willing to assume independence then it is straightforward to estimate the hazard
function for each of the underlying distributions. For the case of cancer, the hazard rates in Figure
  4
      See the web pages of the American Heart Association and the National Cancer Institute for additional cites.



                                                          7
5 are sufficient to conclude that there has been a very small improvement in cancer mortality, if
any at all. Of course, imposing independence when the risks are indeed dependent, will result in
inconsistent estimates of the cause-specific hazard rates and of the effect of covariates on those
hazards.5 Given that the medical evidence suggests that CVD and cancer are dependent, it is
therefore not possible to reach definite conclusions by looking at the observed hazards, as we did
above.
       Alternatively, one can make no assumptions on the joint distribution of the underlying durations,
and estimate bounds on the objects of interest. Following the approach of, for example, Peterson
(1976) and Manski (2003), it is straightforward to generate bounds on the marginal distributions
of T1 and T2 . These bounds are given in Peterson (1976), who also provides bounds on the joint
distribution of T1 and T2 . It is easy to understand the basic idea behind these bounds. For example
suppose that by age 60, 15% of individuals have died of CVD and 10% have died of cancer. The
survival rate6 from cancer at age 60 can be bounded between 75 and 90%. Although this approach
is very appealing, the nonparametric bounds are generally very wide (see the numerical example
in Peterson (1976)), making it difficult to draw conclusions. In Figure 4 we present the bounds for
the survival from cancer in 1970 and 2000 for our four demographic groups. It is evident from these
graphs that it is not possible to make any statement about whether survival from cancer increased
or decreased in this period.
       The results presented in Figure 4 and the potential problems with assuming independence,
suggest that it might be fruitful to ask what features of the conditional distribution of (T1 , T2 ),
given some explanatory variable X, can be identified if one is willing to impose restrictions on those
conditional distributions. At the extreme, one could specify a fully parametric model and estimate
the parameters of such a model by maximum likelihood. This is the approach taken in most of
the applications cited in the introduction. The weakness of a fully parametric approach is that
the results may be entirely driven by the functional form assumptions. A number of papers have
therefore studied identifiability of semiparametric competing risks models.
       Heckman and Honoré (1989) show (essentially) that with a mixed proportional hazard model
   5
       For example, when studying mortality by cause, one may be willing to assume that drug X affects only S1
but by imposing independence we will estimate that drug X also affects S2 . Slud and Byar (1988) provide such an
example. Vaupel and Yashin (1999) illustrate the problems that arise if one assumes independence in the presence
of unobserved population heterogeneity (which results in dependent population hazards).
   6
       The epidemiology literature on cancer often uses the term “survival rate” to refer to the fraction of people who
are alive five years after being diagnosed. In this paper we do not condition on diagnosis and we do not only consider
five year periods.




                                                            8
or an accelerated failure time model on the marginal distributions of T1 and T2 , the full model is
identified if one is willing to assume that the support of the effect of X on the hazard functions
for T1 and T2 is <2+ . A recent paper by Abbring and van den Berg (2003) relaxes these conditions
somewhat by showing that the unbounded support assumption can be dispensed with if one is
willing to make additional assumptions. However, as discussed by Crowder (2001) the conditions
for identification are restrictive and often unrealistic as the covariates of interest have bounded
support and are not continuous in many applications. For example, analyses of mortality use data
from death certificates, which contain demographic information that is all categorical, such as race,
gender and marital status. Moreover, the proofs in Heckman and Honoré (1989) and Abbring
and van den Berg (2003) rely crucially on the duration, T , being observed exactly. However, the
durations are observed in groups in many data sets. This raises the question of what can be
learned in competing risks models if one is willing to impose restrictions that are weaker than those
in Heckman and Honoré (1989) and Abbring and van den Berg (2003). This is the subject of the
next section.
    Competing risks models are a subset of sample selection models. The research presented here
is therefore closely related to the literature on bounds in sample selection models (see for example
Manski (1990)), although the results here take advantage of the special structure of the competing
risks model.


4    Bounds in Some Specific Competing Risks Models

As mentioned above, one of the motivations for this paper is that many data sources contain interval
observations of durations, whereas the results on identification of semiparametric competing risks
models assume that durations are observed exactly. Following, for example, Prentice and Gloeckler
(1978) and Meyer (1990), we assume that (T1 , T2 ) has a continuous positive density conditional
on X, but that T ∗ = min {T1 , T2 } is grouped so we observe events like (T, δ, X), where T = tk if
tk < T ∗ ≤ tk+1 for k = 1, .., M and tM +1 = ∞. In the following we assume M is finite, so that there
is only a finite number of possible outcomes. We also assume that δ is unobserved when T ∗ > tM .
In other words, we allow T ∗ to be censored at tM .
    The main methodological contribution of the research presented in this section is to show how
parametric assumptions can help tighten the bounds on the object of interest in unidentified compet-
ing risks models. This is interesting because the nonparametric bounds that make no assumptions
can be quite wide. Since different assumptions will lead to different sets of identified regions, we
will consider a number of examples. In each of the examples, we will use the fact that for any


                                                 9
distribution of (T1 , T2 ) given X, there exist an observationally equivalent discrete distribution for
which the probability of a tie is 0. This follows from the fact that only a discretized version of T
is observed. If X can take a finite number of values, this means that for all the cases we consider,
there will be an observationally equivalent case in which the vector of all the random variables has
a discrete distribution with a finite number of points of support.


4.1   The effect of explanatory variables with parametric restrictions.

We first consider the case where a binary explanatory variable, X, has a multiplicative effect on
both of the latent distributions,
                                  
                                   (min {S1 , S2 } , 1 {S1 < S2 })       for X = 0,
                    (T ∗ , I) =                                                                    (1)
                                  
                                      (min {αS1 , βS2 } , 1 {αS1 < βS2 }) for X = 1,
where (S1 , S2 ) is independent of X, and the multiplicative effect, α, is the main object of interest.
In the next section we also consider the case where no assumption is made on the effect of X on T2 .
This model is an example of an accelerated failure time model, which is commonly used to describe
mortality. It was originally introduced by Cox (1972), who gave it a physical interpretation in
the context of mortality. From the equivalence between proportional hazard models with Weibull
baseline hazards and Weibull accelerated failure time models, it follows that a model where the
marginals obey a Weibull proportional hazard assumption, are consistent with our functional form
assumption. It is also a special case of the kind of general sample selection models that have been
considered in the econometric literature. Specifically, if the durations are not grouped, then one
can write the model in (1) as a switching regression model. See Amemiya (1985). Specifically, let
εk = log (Sk ) and consider log (T1 )

                                          log (T1 ) = X · log (α) + ε1

where log (T1 ) is observed only if

                                   X · (log (β) − log (α)) + (ε2 − ε1 ) < 0

The standard sufficient conditions for identification of such models require that X has “full rank”
conditional on the probability that the selection criterion is satisfied (i.e. conditional on the so–
called propensity score). See for example Ahn and Powell (1993). This sufficient condition is not
satisfied here. Moreover, it is clear that a model with a finite number of points of support for
the explanatory variable and a discrete outcome variable will not be point–identified (by the same


                                                      10
intuition why a semiparametric discrete choice model is not identified if the explanatory variables
take only a finite number of values).
      Because the parameters in (1) are not point–identified, we will construct bounds on them. To
see that one can obtain bounds on the parameters under (1), consider a simple case in which
observations are censored after 2 time–periods, and one observes

                       P ( T = 0, I = 0| X = 0) = P ( T = 1, I = 0| X = 0) =

                       P ( T = 0, I = 1| X = 0) = P ( T = 1, I = 1| X = 0) =
                                                  1

If a = b = 2 then this has a number of implications for the distribution of (T, I) when X = 1. For
example, all observations that were censored when X = 0 will still be censored when X = 1, as will
observations with T = 1 (so T ∗ is between 1 and 2). On the other hand, none of the observations
with T = 0 (so T ∗ is between 0 and 1) will be censored. This means that the probability of censoring
must be 0.6 when X = 1. So, if one observes that the probability of censoring when X = 1 is 0.5,
then one would rule out a = b = 2. Of course, in this case there are additional constraints, for
example P ( T = 0 or 1, I = 0| X = 1) = 0.2. The main insight in this section is to keep track of all
such implications for a given (a, b). To do this, we make use of the fact that for any parameter value
which is consistent with the observed distribution of the data, there is a discrete distribution of the
underlying random variables that makes it consistent with the data. In asking whether particular
values of α and β are consistent with the observed distribution of the data, there is therefore no loss
in generality by assuming that the underlying distributions are discrete (with support that depends
on α and β). The points of support will be denoted by (s1 , s2 ), and the associated probabilities by
p (s1 , s2 ). In this case, the relevant probabilities are

    It is clear that the probabilities of those events would be unchanged if one redistributed proba-
bility within each of the polygons depicted (in solid lines) in the third graph. There is therefore no
loss of generality in assuming that the distribution of (S1 , S2 ) is discrete, with one point of support
in each of the regions.

(where the first four equations hold for all k = 1, .., M ).
       These equations have exactly the same structure as the constraints of a linear programming
problem. Analogous to Honoré and Tamer (2004) and Molinari (2004), one can check whether a
feasible solution to such a linear programming problem exists for a given a and b by solving an
auxiliary linear programming problem and checking whether its optimal value is 0 (the alternative
being that it is negative). We will show that as suggested in Honoré and Tamer (2004), one can
consistently estimate the identified region for (α, β) by maximizing the optimal value in the sample
analogs to the auxiliary linear programming problem.
       Specifically, for given a and b consider the linear programming problem

This linear programming problem has a feasible solution:

                       p (s1 , s2 ) = 0          for all (s1 , s2 )

and the optimal function value in (11) is 0 if the equations (6)–(10) have a solution and it is strictly
negative otherwise.
   It is clear that the approach generalizes to the case where there are more than two latent failure
times, and to the case where the (vector of) explanatory variable(s) takes more than two values.
   Theorem 2 (and the accompanying corollary) of the appendix establishes that fb(a, b) converges
uniformly to f (a, b) where the former has been defined by the same linear programming problem
but with all the probabilities, P , replaced by consistent estimates. Moreover, the uniform rate
of convergence equals that of Pb to P . It therefore follows by the argument in Manski and Tamer
(2002) that the identified region can be consistently estimated by the set of parameter values, (a, b),
such that fb(a, b) ≥ max fb − εn where εn is some sequence that converges to 0 more slowly than
the rate of convergence of Pb.
   The consistency argument with the corresponding rate of convergence is quite generic. For the
particular problem studied in this paper, it is possible to establish additional results based on the
following Lemma which is proved in the Appendix.

Lemma 1 The functions f (a, b) and fb(a, b) are both piecewise constant over the same finite num-
ber of regions.

   Lemma 1 essentially makes the parameter space discrete with a finite number of elements.

    Note that the setup in (11) forces one to underestimate all the probabilities. While this does
not affect the consistency of the resulting estimator of α and β, it may be intuitively unappealing.
It might therefore be more attractive to consider the linear programming problem
                                                                        X

problem. In the application below, we will therefore focus on the first formulation.

where the last set of equality constraints captures the constraint that the marginal distribution
of S1 should be the same whether it is calculated from the distribution of (S1 , S2 ) or from the
               ³        ´
distribution of S1 , Se2 . These equations again have the structure of the constraints of a linear
programming problem.
       As in section 4.1, one can estimate the identified region as a set of maximizers of a function
that is defined as the optimal function value for a linear programming problem.


5.2       Counterfactuals

The explanatory variable, X, is often a time–dummy. In that case, it natural to ask what the
distribution of T would have been if only the distribution of T1 had changed.
       Consider for example the setup on section 4.1 and define

                                                    Te1∗ = min {αS1 , S2 }

This is the duration that one would observe if X has the hypothesized effect on the first latent
duration but has no effect on the second duration. This could then be compared to the distribution
of T ∗ given X = 1 in order to find the effect that X has on T through T2 alone (keeping the
distribution of T1 where it would be when X = 1).8 It might also be interesting to know the effect
   8
       Other effects of this type could be considered. For example, one could compare the distribution of

                                                         min {S1 , βS2 }


                                                                16
of eliminating a risk altogether. This suggests comparing the distribution of T ∗ given X = 1 to the
distribution of
                                                      Te2∗ = αS1

(or the distribution of T ∗ given X = 0 to the distribution of S1 ).
       Unfortunately, such an exercise is not literally possible if T ∗ is grouped. In that case one can
only get the distribution of the grouped version of T ∗ given X = 0 or given X = 1. It is therefore
natural to also consider the distribution of the grouped version of Te1∗ or T2∗ . This is the equivalent
of considering the distribution function for Te∗ at the points t1 , t2 , . . . etc.
       For a given α and β and a given p (·, ·) we have
                                 ³        ´
                              P Te1∗ < tk       = P (min {αS1 , S2 } < tk )
                                                        X
                                                =                p (s1 , s2 )
                                                          s1 <tk /α or s2 <tk

The last expressions are affected by the fact that the points of support are not uniquely determined.
Before proceeding, it is therefore necessary to consider every polygon depicted in solid lines in the
third graph of Figure 1 and determine whether the location of a point within the region changes
whether the event {s1 < tk /α or s2 < tk } occurs. If it does9 , then one must place two points of
support in the region corresponding to whether or not {s1 < tk /α or s2 < tk }.
                                                          ³         ´
    One can then calculate population bounds on P Te1∗ < tk by minimizing and maximizing (over
                     P
a and b) the function s1 <tk /α,s2 <tk p (s1 , s2 ) subject to (6)–(10). Unfortunately, the sample analog
of this (which replaces P ( T = tk , I = i| X = x) by Pb ( T = tk , I = i| X = x)) will not produce a
                                                                 ³       ´
consistent estimator of the upper and lower bounds on P Te∗ < tk . The reason is that there is no
guarantee that the sample version of (6)–(10) will have a solution for any value of a or b.
       It is also not possible to estimate the upper and lower bounds by referring to the solution to (11).
The reason for this is that for a given (a, b), the solution for p (·, ·) need not be unique. However,
this suggests constructing consistent estimators for the upper and lower bounds as follows. Let Θ   b
be the set of maximizers of
                                                                          X
                                            f (a, b) =      max               −vi                                (13)
                                                         {vi },{p(·,·)}


to the distribution of T ∗ given X = 0 in order to find the effect that X has on T through T2 alone (keeping the
distribution of T1 where it would be when X = 0).
   9
       For the polygons between the two lines, s1 = s2 and as1 = bs2 , the statement {s1 < tk /α or s2 < tk } is never
ambiguous as one considers different points in the polygon. Likewise, for polygons located above both of the lines and
located entirely above s2 = tk , it does not matter which point one considers in the polygon as all of the points will
lead to {s1 > tk /α and s2 > tk }. The same is true for polygons located to the right of both of the lines and located
entirely to the right of s1 = tk /α. This means that the ambiguity affects only a relatively small number of polygons.

5.3       Exclusion Restrictions

Exclusion restrictions are sometimes useful in improving identification. One way to model an
exclusion restriction in the competing risks model is to assume that the explanatory variable X is
independent of one of the latent durations
                                (
                                  (min {S
                                  ³    n 1 , S2 }o, 1 {S
                                                       n1 < S2 })o´ for X = 0,
                    (T ∗ , I) =
                                   min Se1 , S2 , 1 Se1 < S2        for X = 1,

This model generalizes the competing risks model considered by, for example, Faraggi and Korn
(1996), and it is in the spirit of many econometric models in which exclusion restrictions are used
to obtain point–identification.
    In this section, we will discuss how to obtain bounds on difference in the distribution functions
for S1 and Se1 . This is essentially done as in the same way that the Peterson bounds were con-
structed, but with the added restriction that the marginal distribution for S2 is the same in the
two subsamples given by X = 0 and X = 1.
       Suppose that we are interested in bounding P (T1 ≤ t |X = 1 ) − P (T1 ≤ t |X = 0 ) for some t.
In this case, the relevant points of support are given in Figure 2.10 Most of the points of support
are self–explanatory. There are, however, two main differences relative to the points of support in
the first panel of Figure 1. The first is that for each region that includes T1 = t in its interior, one
must allow for one point to the left of t and one to the right. The second complication is that for
each region, one must allow for a point of support corresponding to each of the discrete values of
T2 that fall in the region. This is needed because one needs these to enforce the restriction that the
marginal distributions of T2 are the same in the two periods. Except for that, the points of support
are as they would be in the first panel of Figure 1.
       The lower bound for P (T1 ≤ t |X = 1 ) − P (T1 ≤ t |X = 0 ) is then the value of
                                                              X                         X

5.4    Bounds with Continuous Covariates or Non–grouped Durations

In the discussion above, we focused on the case where the explanatory variable X is discrete and
the durations are grouped. This is the case in which the competing risk model with the parametric
assumptions is most obviously not identified, and it therefore represents a worst–case scenario. On
the other hand, it is also a case in which all the observed variables have a discrete distribution.
This is essential for the simple approach taken above.
    Each of the two complications, discrete covariates and grouped durations, violate the assump-
tions in for example Heckman and Honoré (1989) or Abbring and van den Berg (2003). It is
therefore not know whether the parameters of the resulting models are point–identified. In this
section we demonstrate that it is in principle easy to derive expressions for the identified region for
those parameters (whether or not this is a single point).
    First assume that X is continuous and the durations are grouped. If the model is

                     (T ∗ , I) = (min {α (X) S1 , β (X) S2 } , 1 {α (X) S1 < β (X) S2 })

with the normalization α (0) = β (0) = 1, then the identified region for (α (·) , β (·)) is the set of

subject to         p (s1 , s2 ) ds1 ds2 = 1 and p (s1 , s2 ) ≥ 0 where g (·) is a positive weighting function. As
discussed in Honoré and Tamer (2004), this can be turned into a feasible estimator of the identified
region of (a, b) by replacing terms like P ( T = tk , I = 1| X) with the nonparametric estimates and
replacing a, b and p with approximations. The weighting function g (·) is useful because it can
be used to control for the fact that P ( T = tk , I = 1| X) will be imprecisely estimated in the tails
of the distribution of X. In particular, it is straightforward to prove consistency of the estimator
of the identified region for (α, β) if one uses g (·) to be the estimated density of X. Parametric
restrictions on α (·) and β (·) can be incorporated by minimizing the function above, subject to
those restrictions.
    Next consider the case where X is discrete with two points of support and the durations are
not grouped. In this case, the identified region is given by the set of (a, b) for which there exists

6     The Change between 1970 and 2000 in the Mortality from Can-
      cer and Cardiovascular Disease

In this section, we apply the methods described above to estimate the trends in disease-specific
mortality between 1970 and 2000.


6.1    Results assuming independence

As a baseline, we start by constructing bounds under the commonly used assumption of indepen-
dence. In doing so, we assume that the time dummy has a (different) multiplicative effect on the
duration until death for both cancer and CVD. In order to provide a fair comparison with the rest

                                                                          23
of our results, we use the identical estimation method, except that we estimate the bounds for the
parameters separately rather than jointly. Except for the fact that we account for the grouping, this
amounts to estimating a standard accelerated failure time model for each survival time. For details
on the estimation, see the appendix. The conclusions from this estimation should be qualitatively
similar to the conclusions we reach by looking at the raw hazard rates: the main differences here
are that improvements are expressed in terms of increases in the time until death rather than in
decreases in the hazard rates; that we impose a multiplicative functional form; and that we treat
the data as grouped.
       We compute bounds for four demographic groups separately, and for three different periods,
1970 to 1980, 1970 to 1990, and 1970 to 2000. Recall that if the duration until death has not
changed since 1970, then we will find bounds around one, i.e. the duration until death in 1970
will be identical to the duration until death in a later period. Bounds above one will signal
improvements. The results are in Table 2. Not surprisingly the results show large improvements
from 1970 to 2000 in CVD for all groups: the duration until death from CVD increased between 30
to 40% relative to 1970. On the other hand, we find a very small, albeit positive, improvement in
cancer for all groups. The survival until death from cancer increased by about 6% for white men
during the same period, by about 9% for white women, and it increased by about 2% for black men
and women.
       For completeness, and for future reference, Table 2 also includes the results for cancer exclusive
of lung cancer and from lung cancer alone. These are given in the last two rows for each panel.


6.2       Main Results

We now present our main results which construct bounds without assuming independence, as in
section 4.1.11 We do assume that the potential duration to death from other causes is independent
of the potential duration until death from cancer and the potential duration until death from CVD.
       The results are in Table 3. For all groups we find that the CVD duration increased substantially
from 1970 to 2000, by about 40% for white males, 33% for blacks and 24% for white females. This
increase was not concentrated in a single decade but was rather constant.
       Age until death from cancer also increased for all groups during this period. This increase was
about 10% for males and 15-20% for women by 2000, certainly smaller than the percentage increases
  11
       We are using estimates of the cause–specific probabilities of dying at different ages. The theory presented earlier
therefore requires one to define the interval estimates as the set of parameter values for which the function value is
within some εn of its maximum. Since measurement erros is likely to be more important than estimation uncertainty,
we ignore this issue in this application..


                                                             24
for CVD, but not negligible. However for white males the increase was mostly concentrated in the
1990s; from 1970 to 1990 the increases were small, about 2 to 4%. The same is not true for females,
who saw some significant improvements in every decade. For black males there were very small
improvements in each decade.
   We compare these results with those we presented in the previous section (Table 2). The
coefficients for CVD are similar with or without independence, especially for white men, but the
estimated improvements are larger when we do not assume independence. On the other hand the
coefficients for cancer are much larger when we do not assume independence: the improvements
more than double for all groups.
   Overall, these bounds support the idea that there was significant progress in cancer. Importantly
note that all the bounds are tightly estimated (the range of the bounds is about 0.003 and the largest
range is 0.028), and they never include one. This is true whether or not we assume independence.


6.3   Policy applications: Counterfactuals

We next use the results to answer two questions. First we ask what the contribution of cancer
improvements to changes in mortality would have been either in the absence of improvements for
cardiovascular disease, or with the observed improvements in CVD. We estimate these counterfac-
tuals as described in Section 5.2. Since we have censored the data at age 80 (and the model is likely
to be unreliable in the tail of the distribution), we consider the effect on the probability of surviving
past age 75, and on life expectancy (censored at 80). This number can be used to evaluate the
progress that had been obtained thus far. Secondly we ask what the changes in mortality would be
if we could eliminate cancer as a cause of death. This will give a maximum on the value of further
progress in the fight on cancer.
   The results are presented in Table 4. In the first row for each group we report the actual
probabilities in each period. In the next row we report (bounds for) the fitted probability of
surviving past age 75 in 1970. These fitted values are based on estimation using data from 1970
and 1980, 1970 and 1990, and 1970 and 2000, respectively. This explains why one should not
expect the numbers in this row to be identical, although we would have considered it as evidence
against the multiplicative function form if they had differed by a great deal. Similarly in the fifth
row we report the fitted probability of surviving past 75 in 1980, 1990 and 2000, respectively.
Comparing the fitted values in rows two and five to the actual values in the first row reveals that
the fitted values are consistently very close to the actual values. This provides some evidence that
our functional form assumption is not inconsistent with the data. It is also worth noting that the
fitted values are always consistently below the actual values. This should be expected since our

                                                   25
linear programming program always underestimates the probabilities (see the end of section 4).
   In the third row of Table 4 we report (bounds for) the probability of surviving past age 75 in
the absence of any progress in cancer (but including progress in CVD) and in the next row we
report this probability in the absence of progress in CVD (but including progress in cancer).
   In the case of white males, the probability of surviving past age 75 increased by about 19.5
percentage points, from 56.1% in 1970 to 75.6% in 2000. From row 3 we see that in the absence
of cancer progress this probability would have been between 66% and 73.8% in 2000. Therefore
from this vantage point progress in cancer ranges from 2 to 10.6 percentage points and accounts
for somewhere between 10% to 55% of the total increase in survival.
   Alternatively we can look at what the probability of survival would have been in the absence of
CVD progress by looking at the fourth row. In the absence of CVD progress survival rates would
have been between 57.4% and 59.5% rather than 57.4%, therefore we find that for white males
cancer progress accounts for about for 0-11% of the total increase in survival in this period.
   The difference in the estimates is driven by the choice of baseline: the first estimate uses the
later year as a baseline and therefore computes counterfactuals that allow progress in CVD. The
second set of estimates use 1970 as a baseline and are computed in the absence of progress in CVD.
The difference tells us about the extent to which progress in cancer (in the form of reductions in
cancer mortality) cannot occur without concurrent progress in CVD (and vice-versa) which depends
on the extent to which the diseases are correlated (at the extreme, if the diseases were very highly
correlated eliminating one would have almost no noticeable impact on mortality because everyone
would die seconds later).
   Similar calculations for other groups show that cancer progress accounts for 22%-100% of the
total increase in survival for white women using 2000 as a base, or 0% to 25% using 1970; for black
women the range is 3.7% to 40% in 2000 and 0% to 11% in 1970. Finally for black men cancer
progress accounts for 5%-59.6% of improvements in 2000, but only for 0 % to 11.8% in 1970.
   It is clear that the bounds on the changes discussed above are potentially too wide as they are
based on a comparison of bounds for two parameters. Alternatively we can estimate bounds on the
change directly. These alternative bound estimates are in Table 5. The bounds that are estimated
directly are somewhat tighter, although the general pattern and the qualitative conclusions do not
change.
   Table 4 also presents estimates of the effect of eliminating either cancer or CVD on the prob-
ability of surviving past age 75. These can be used to estimate upper bounds on the potential
benefits of additional medical innovation in one of the two causes of death, without any changes
in the alternative cause of death. One conclusion to be drawn from these results is that in 1970


                                                 26
reductions in CVD would have much larger impacts in the overall survival, compared to cancer for
males. In 2000 improvements in cancer and CVD have comparable potential benefits. For women,
the results are somewhat different in that the potential gains from improvements in cancer and
CVD are comparable throughout the period.
         We also use our model to calculate changes in life expectancy conditional on survival to age
45 (and with censoring at 80). The results are presented in Table 6. The results in this table are
very similar to those in table 4, except that we can express changes in the survival distribution in
terms of additional years of life, which can be used in cost benefit analysis if we have estimates
of the dollar value of an additional year of life. For example, for white males the actual increase
from 1970 to 2000 is approximately 3.3 years. In the absence of progresses in cancer, progress in
CVD disease would account for 0.9 to 2.6 years. One estimate of the progress in cancer is therefore
the remaining 0.7 to 2.4 years of life. Given the progress that occurred in CVD, the maximum
increase that could have occurred is between 3.3 and 4.3. For white females, the comparable bound
is between 1.6 and 2.8 years, so the potential gains from improvements in cancer appear smaller
than those for white males. This is somewhat unintuitive since cancer is a relatively larger risk for
females than for males. However this is partially due to the fact that the parameter of interest is
lifetime censored at 80. Since whites females live the longest (see table 1) the censoring results in
lower progress estimates for women. For this reason we prefer the estimates in Table 4.
         It is worth noting that the fitted values in this table are always lower than the actual values.
Again, this can be explained by the fact that we underestimate all the probabilities and they
therefore do not add up to one.


7         Estimation issues

7.1         Specification checks

Because lung cancer accounts for a large fraction of cancer deaths (about 50% for men and 10%
for women) and it is mostly affected by smoking behavior throughout life, we may be interested in
estimating trends for all cancer except lung cancer.12 As mentioned earlier, the results assuming
independence for cancer excluding lung cancer are in Table 2. Assuming independence, the esti-
mated trends are somewhat larger if we exclude lung cancer (around 7-9% for men), especially for
women. In Table 7, we present the same bounds without assuming independence. We find much
    12
         Deaths from lung cancer diminished in the 1990s because of decreases in smoking that started to take place
in the 1960s and that are unrelated to progress in prevention and treatment since 1973 (Andersen, Remington,
Trentham-Dietz, and Reeves (2002)).


                                                          27
larger improvements when we exclude lung cancer for all groups. The trends are about twice as
large as those that include lung cancer, about 19 and 46% for white men and women respectively,
and 9 and 45% for black men and women. Again these improvements are much larger than those
in Table 2 (when we assumed independence).Because lung cancer and CVD have a common risk,
smoking, it may be incorrect to include lung cancer with the third cause of death which we treat
as independent. We could re-estimate non-lung cancer trends by grouping all other causes of death
into the “other” category, including CVD. But notice that this would not be correct either since it
estimates a single trend for all other causes of death.
   This suggests that it may not be appropriate to estimate trends for cancer as a whole, but rather
that it would be preferable to separate cancers. As mentioned earlier, it is conceptually straightfor-
ward to extend our method to estimate trends for more than two causes of death without assuming
independence. It would also be straightforward to include additional categorical covariates. How-
ever both of these extensions are computationally difficult as both the number of constraints and
number of unknown parameters in the linear programming problem increase linearly in the number
of causes of death and in the number of different values of the covariates. We have therefore not
pursued them here (except to the extent that we estimate separate models based on gender and
race).
   Interestingly, excluding or including lung cancer has only a small effect in our estimates of CVD
progress. The imposition of independence does not greatly affect the trends either, even though
our results do suggest that cancer and CVD are dependent. Intuitively this occurs because CVD is
the largest risk. One way to understand this result is to think of dependence as a form of sample
selection. The potential for sample selection to generate bias depends not only on how different the
excluded sample is, but also on how (relatively) large this group is. In this sense, the potential for
sample selection bias is largest for the smallest risks. In practice, these results suggest that it may
not be very important to consider dependence if one is interested in CVD, but it may be extremely
important for all other risks, especially for smaller ones.
   Another important limitation of our estimation method is that it imposes a multiplicative effect
of the time dummy on both cancer and CVD durations. Alternatively we estimate bounds for cancer
that impose a multiplicative effect on cancer only (as in section 5.1). These results are presented
in Table 8. In all cases, relaxing the parametric assumption for CVD results in bounds that are
very large, typically ranging from about 0.5 to about 2.3. Furthermore, of the 12 bounds, only one
set of bounds does not contain one (white females 1970–2000). It is therefore difficult to draw any
conclusions from these results. Intuitively, this is not surprising: since CVD is the largest cause of
death, imposing structure on its hazard improves estimation dramatically.


                                                  28
       Finally, we did some of the calculations using the alternative formulation of the linear pro-
gramming problem given in (12). As discussed this is intuitively more appealing as it does not
systematically underestimate the probabilities. The results from this are very close to those ob-
tained from those reported here. For example, the estimated intervals for the coefficients for the
change between 1970 and 2000 for white males changed from (1.389, 1.391) to (1.392, 1.400) for
CVD and from (1.134, 1.153) to (1.134, 1.142) for cancer.


7.1.1       Some Data Issues

There are several data issues in calculating age-specific mortality rates using matched data from
the census and the death certificate files that are potentially problematic because they may affect
our trend estimates.
       Age misreporting both in the census and in death certificates are an important concern. To the
extent that this error is not random, it may result in biased death rates. More importantly, these
biases may have changed over time.
       In the census there is evidence of age heaping: individuals ages 50 and above tend to overstate
their ages by “rounding up,” which results in an unusually large population for ages ending in
either 5 or 0. In our data age heaping is mostly an issue for blacks. Another important issue (that
cannot be fully separated from age misreporting) is that the census undercounts certain groups
of the population, especially blacks, and the undercount varies with age. Furthermore, the extent
of the undercount varies with the census year (Schenker (1993)). This problem is again larger for
blacks than for whites.
       In the death certificates, there is also error in the age at death, but this error seems to be mostly
confined to blacks over the age of 65, who tend to understate their age. There is no evidence of
bias in ages among whites even for those above 85 (Hill, Preston, and Rosenwaike (2000)). The
overall effect of age misreporting is to downward-bias mortality for older cohorts (Preston, Elo, and
Stewart (1999)).
       In the absence of additional data, there is no obvious way to correct mortality rates for these
problems. Overall age misreporting appears to be a very important issue mostly among blacks.
These data issues suggest that our results for blacks must be taken with caution.
       Another issue is whether causes of death are correctly specified in the death certificate.13 More
importantly the issue is whether there have been significant changes from 1970 to 2000 in the
  13
       For example Welch and Black (2002) report that deaths that follow surgery from cancer are not attributed to
the cancer for which surgery was performed.




                                                         29
accuracy with which causes of death are reported. There were two changes in the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) during our period, one in 1978 (from ICD8 to ICD9) and another
in 1998 (to ICD10). These changes have affected trends in mortality rates by cause, but previous
research has suggested the effects of these classification changes are small for broad causes of death
such as cancer and CVD (Jemal, Ward, Anderson, and Thun (2003), Klebba (1980) and Anderson,
Minio, Hoyert, and Rosenberg (2001)). Furthermore, studies that have compared the causes of
death reported in the death certificate with the cause of death from an autopsy, have found that
the quality of death certificate reporting has not changed much since the 1960s, except perhaps for
the very old (Hoel, Ron, Carter, and Mabuchi (1993)). Overall changes in the observed causes of
death have not significantly changed over time for broad causes of death.


7.1.2       Additional evidence

Our findings provide support for the claim that there has been progress in cancer, measured in
terms of the increases in the underlying cause-specific duration. In this section we provide evidence
from other sources consistent with our findings.
       We looked for any evidence that there were indeed innovations in terms of cancer treatment
during the period we study, starting in the 1970s for women and mostly in the 1990s for men.
We focus on improvements for the major cancer sites (excluding lung14 ), namely breast, prostate,
colorectal and ovarian cancer. Survival from colorectal cancer, which disproportionately affects
men, has improved because of a combination of earlier detection and improved treatment at earlier
stages. Standard treatment for colorectal cancer changed in 1990, following a National Institutes
of Health Conference recommendation, to include a combination of 5FU and leucovorin, two previ-
ously existing drugs (NIH Consensus Conference (1990)). Although treatment for prostate cancer
remains controversial, clinical trials in the 1990s showed promising effects of hormonal treatment
(Howe, Wingo, Thun, Ries, Rosenberg, Feigal, and Edwards (2001)).
       Improvements to treat women’s cancers started earlier. Mammographies started being routinely
offered in the 1970s and studies in the 1970s and 1980s showed that early detection substantially
improved mortality, especially for women over 50.15 Breast cancer treatment also changed in the
  14
       The fight against lung cancer has mostly focused on reducing tobacco consumption. This effort began with the
Surgeon General Report in 1964 that first publicly announced that smoking increased the risk of lung cancer, and
continues today. These efforts are reflected in the trends in lung cancer many years later. To our knowledge there is
no evidence of other forms of progress in lung cancer.

1980s with the dissemination of adjuvant chemotherapy, including multi-agent chemotherapy and
tamoxifen, and then additional changes in treatment were implemented in the early 1990s for
postmenopausal women (Mariotto, Feuer, Harlan, Wun, Johnson, and Abrams (2002)). Treatment
for ovarian cancer was modified in 1986 (NIH Consensus Conference (1995)) to include surgery
and chemotherapy with a platinum compound (cisplatin or carboplatin) after publication of results
from randomized trials which showed their effectiveness (Omura, Blessing, Ehrlich, Miller, Yordan,
Creasman, and Homesley (1986)).
    In spite of the fact that this evidence is consistent with our trend estimates, it is worth keeping
in mind that the trends that we estimate can also reflect changes in lifestyle and demographic
characteristics, some of which may reflect prevention, and some which may be completely unrelated
to scientific advances in cancer. Ultimately we cannot say with certainty that the trends we estimate
are uniquely related to progress in treatment or whether they also reflect prevention and cohort
effects.


8    Conclusions

In this paper we show that relatively weak parametric assumptions can dramatically improve iden-
tification in competing risks models. Using a semi-parametric framework we estimate trends for
cancer mortality without assuming that other risks are independent. We make no parametric as-
sumptions on the nature of the dependence between risks, and consider an accelerated failure time
model with categorical covariates and grouped durations. Because this model is not point–identified,
we estimate bounds for the effects of the categorical covariates.
    We use our method to estimate changes in cancer and cardiovascular mortality since 1970. The
estimated bounds for the effect of time on the duration until death for either cause are extremely
tight, much tighter than the bounds one can obtain without making any assumptions at all (Peterson
(1976)). Such bounds can therefore be obtained under many more situations and making fewer
assumptions than the previous literature has suggested.
    Previous research has estimated trends in cancer mortality by assuming independence and has
found little or no progress. We find that trends in cancer show much larger improvements than
previously estimated. We find that time until death from cancer increased by about 10% for white
males and 20% for white women from 1970 to 2000 for all cancers, and by about 19% for white
males and 40% for white women if we exclude lung cancer. These estimates are more than twice as
large as estimates derived under independence. These improvements are not all due to changes in
smoking for younger cohorts. Also we find that not all improvements took place in the 1990s; for


                                                  31
women, we find significant improvements going back to the 1970s. Although less robust, we find
similar results for blacks.

where P () is a vector of probabilities and the functions π m (j; θ) non–negative and bounded from
above. Then
                              |f (θ; P1 ) − f (θ; P2 )| ≤ const · (1 − c1 ) + const · (1 − c2 )

Proof: Consider a particular value of θ.
    For that θ, the linear problem clearly has a feasible solution for any vector of probabilities, P
(namely vj = P (j) for j ∈ J , v0 = 1 and pm = 0 or m = 1, ..., M ). Now consider a vector of

9.2     Proof of Lemma 1.

The proof is broken into two steps.
     First consider a particular choice of (a, b), (a1 , b1 ). Figure X ..... The linear programming prob-
lem () assigns probabilities to each region of the figure for (a1 , b1 ). Now imagine that one perturbs
(a, b) to (a2 , b2 ). Unless new regions are created by this or existing regions disappear, location of
the regions will move continuously with (a, b). In other words, one can (uniquely) associate the
regions created by (a2 , b2 ) with the regions created by the original values (a1 , b1 ) (provided that
no new regions were created and no existing regions eliminated). One can therefore consider the
feasible solution to the linear programming problem for (a2 , b2 ) that leaves the probabilities for each
region at the values that were optimal for (a1 , b1 ). This will leave the objective function at (a2 , b2 )
at the optimal level for (a1 , b1 ). It therefore follows that f (a1 , b1 ) ≤ f (a2 , b2 ). By interchanging
(a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ), it follows that f (a1 , b1 ) = f (a2 , b2 ) for two sets of parameter values (a1 , b1 )
and (a2 , b2 ) as long as the change from (a1 , b1 ) to (a2 , b2 ) moves the regions without eliminating or
creating any.
     In the second step of the proof, we will now argue that as one varies (a, b) regions will be created
or eliminated only a finite number of times. This will establish that f takes on only a finite number
of values.
     Consider the figure. The solid lines are the ones that are independent of (a, b). Step one
of the proof implies that the function value only changes when the configuration of (a, b) moves
the new lines in a way that creates or eliminates region. It is convenient to reparameterize from
         ¡      ¢
(a, b) to ab , b . As one varies ab from 0 to ∞, the line s2 = ab s1 will touch the intersection of a
vertical and horizontal solid line only a finite number of times. Now consider a particular value of
a                                                       a
b   and consider the effect of varying b (holding
                                                fixed). Each value of b (along with the implied
                                                        b

]0, 1[, [1, 1], ]1, 2[, [2, 2], ]2, 3[, [3, 3],... ]Tmax − 1, Tmax [, [Tmax , Tmax ]. Since the number of points

                   b , a , a , ..., a     is finite and the number of sets into which they are allocated are
                                          a
finite, it follows that this particular   b   will generate only a finite number of regions.

  4. 2000 White population counts obtained from Census table PCT12A, Black population counts
        from table PCT12B and total population counts from PCT12. All three tables were found at
        the US Census Bureau’s website: http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet


9.3.2      Death rate–causes of death classification

Deaths from cardiovascular diseases included ICD8 and ICD9 codes 390-458, and ICD10 codes
G45, G46 and I00-I99. Deaths from cancer included ICD8 and ICD9 codes 140-239, and ICD10
codes C00 through D48. Lung cancer includes ICD8 and ICD9 codes 162, and ICD10 code C34.
All other diseases were counted under the category “other causes of death”.


9.4     Details about the Calculations

The function value that defines the identified region was calculated over three grids.
   The first grid was defined by the rectangle {0.90, 0.95, 1.00, ..., 1.40} × {0.90, 0.95, 1.00, ..., 1.40}.
   The second grid was defined by first calculation the set of maximizers over the original grid.
Let θmin

and let θmin
