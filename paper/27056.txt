Loan Types and the Bank Lending Channel

                                          ABSTRACT

Using credit-registry data for Spain and Peru, we document that four main types of commercial
credit--asset-based loans, cash-flow loans, trade finance and leasing--are easily identifiable and
represent the bulk of corporate credit. We show that credit dynamics and bank lending channels
vary across these loan types. Moreover, aggregate credit supply shocks previously identified in
the literature appear to be driven by individual loan types. The effects of monetary policy and the
effects of the financial crisis propagating through banks' balance sheets are primarily driven by
cash-flow loans, whereas asset-based credit is mostly insensitive to these types of effects.

    Worldwide, much of commercial credit consists of four distinct types of loans: (i)
asset-based loans, (ii) cash flow loans, (iii) trade finance agreements, and (iv) leases. 1
All of these loans are senior and secured; however, they differ in the type of
collateral that backs them (or, to be precise, the net recovery from the sale of
collateral). This separation of commercial credit is widely acknowledged in practice,
but has only been partially recognized in academic research. In particular, to date, the
work relying on the use of credit registry does not make this distinction, treating all
credit of the same firm as directly comparable. Using credit registry data from both
an advanced economy, Spain, and an emerging market, Peru, we document the
universal use and economic importance of these types of credit and empirically
examine how these different types of credit impact the bank credit channel.
    The core characteristics of collateral are its liquidation value, pledgeability, and
durability. These characteristics are at the heart of the existence of different types of
commercial credit. Although some of these differences are not due to intrinsic
characteristics of the physical asset used as a collateral, but differences in
repossession of collateral, as in the case of asset-based loans versus leasing (e.g.,
Eisfeldt and Rampini, 2009; Gavazza, 2011; Rampini and Viswanathan, 2013).
Leasing is an arrangement where the creditor finances an asset and the firm uses it in
exchange for fixed rental payments. From a collateral perspective, asset-based loans
are comparable to leases: both are secured by large, typically registered physical
assets with a relatively clear liquidation value (for example, a building or an
airplane). The difference, as emphasized by Eisfeldt and Rampini (2009), is that
leasing separates ownership and use of the asset, making it easy to repossess the asset
by the lender in case of a default. So the pledged physical asset can be (and often is)
identical across these two different types of loans, but the recovery in default is
different due to the difference in pledgeability.



1
  These different types of credit are widely acknowledged by the industry and bank
regulators. We abstract from factoring, which is the sale of accounts receivable, as
opposed to borrowing against them as one would do in cash flow-based financing.
Factoring generally constitutes a negligible fraction of commercial credit.
                                                                                   1
    A significant fraction of commercial credit consists of cash flow loans. Lian and
Ma (2018) estimate that as much as 80% of syndicated credit in the U.S. is cash-flow
based. The difference between asset-based loans and cash flow loans can again be
understood from the perspective of the collateral used to secure the credit. As already
mentioned, in the case of asset-based loans, the borrower pledges specific physical
assets to secure the loan. In the case of cash flow loans, the lender has a senior claim
on all unencumbered assets of the company; that is, the lender has a first claim on all
proceeds from asset liquidations (excluding assets that were already pledged). 2
Overall, the collateral in cash flow loans differs from asset-based loans and leases in
several dimensions: it is oftentimes less durable, has lower liquidation value due to
its less standardized nature, and has lower pledgeability due to uncertainty about its
value (e.g., intellectual property or retailer inventory) or lack of title (e.g., computers
and office furniture). Indeed, a typical credit agreement for a cash flow loan does not
have a comprehensive list of what represents collateral in the transaction. It is its
senior secured position in the capital structure--and not the claim over specific
assets--that allows it to have recovery in case of a default. 3 As a result, in the credit
assessment of the cash flow loan, the emphasis is not on the value of collateral (as in
the case of an asset-based loan), but on the borrower's ability to pay the interest and
amortization (hence, the label "cash flow" loan).
    The last significant category of commercial credit--trade finance--backs
business-to-business (B2B) transactions. 4 This type of credit is backed by a bilateral
contract, such as a contract for delivery of goods. Amiti and Weinstein (2011)




2
  It is common for a company that has many hard assets to split its collateral using a
subsidiary structure and get an asset-based loan backed by hard assets in parallel to a
cash-flow based loan backed by all other remaining assets. This has a direct parallel to
person credit: it is common for an individual to have a separate mortgage, car loan, and a
student loan.
3
  A standard credit agreement also includes a series of "catch-all" restrictions on asset
sales, which helps to preserve the recovery in default.
4
  Not to be confused with "trade credit," which is credit granted directly by companies to
their business clients.
                                                                                          2
provide a detailed insight into the working of trade finance. 5 The loan in this case is
backed by the goods that are being transacted, so the collateral is well identified,
valued (and insured), and the title of the good is in transfer (so it is not yet part of
what will become collateral of a cash flow loan). Trade finance agreements are
probably closest to cash flow loans, but the pledgeability of the collateral in this case
is higher. To be fair, there are other unique features of trade finance agreements, as it
involves multiple counterparties and the credit risk in this case is no longer simply
that of the borrower.
    There are also other distinctions in terms of processes and sources of capital
among the four lending categories. However, we want to highlight that in practice
one often observes that borrowers have multiple loans outstanding of different loan
type, and that the collateral for these different loan types can be partitioned without
generating conflict among creditors. Importantly, what emerges from the earlier
discussion is that different loan types carry different credit risks and involve different
practices for mitigating negative shocks. Different loan types would also be
differentially affected by fluctuations in the value of collateral.
    As we will show--precisely because of its ubiquity--accounting for loan type
using representative credit registry data appears to be straightforward. Moreover,
accounting for the loan type is pivotal for several reasons:
    First, failing to account for loan type leads to a mismeasurement of the credit
channel effect. The methodology in Khwaja and Mian (2008), henceforth KM,--the
workhorse of the literature focused on transmission of financial shocks to the real
economy--performs a within-firm cross-sectional comparison of lenders' behavior.
This approach relies on the assumption that firm-specific changes in credit demand
are constant across lenders, hence the estimated differences can be attributed to
differences in credit supply. But, to the degree that there is a correlation between
investment opportunities and credit type, and if different lenders provide different
loan types to a given borrower, the identifying assumption that the borrower's credit


5
  Although Amiti and Weinstein (2011) focus on international trade, the arrangements
used in local trade have similar feature, as trade concerns a delivery of contracted goods.
                                                                                            3
demand is fixed across lenders is violated. 6 (See Appendix 1 for a more detailed
description of the biases that arise when using the KM methodology without
accounting for loan heterogeneity.)
    Second, the caveat of the KM methodology, which relied on borrowers with
multiple lenders at a given point in time, is that it discards a significant fraction of
the borrowers in the economy (the single lender borrowers). 7 Thus, the
generalizability of the conclusions emerging from such identification, as well as the
policy implications, are dependent on the broader distribution of credit. Indeed, we
show that a substantial number of borrowers in most economies rely on a single loan
type. Historically, this number was 60% in Spain and 42% in Peru. Moreover, the
type of loans used by these firms tends to be extremely persistent. Note that just
because a borrower has a relationship with one lender does not mean that it relies on
one loan type. However, we find that the overlap, at a given point in time, between
the sample of borrowers that rely on one lender and the sample of borrowers that rely
on one loan is substantial: about 79% of single-lender borrowers are also single-loan
type for Spain; this number is 69% for Peru.
    Finally, there is a large body of literature that shows that bank credit shocks affect
economic activity. The focus of more recent literature has not been on whether such
connections exist, but on the measurement of the sensitivity of real output to bank
funding shocks, and the economic mechanisms underlying this connection. Thus,
recognizing that these sensitivities vary by the type of credit is an important advance

6
  We know that large lenders can provide any loan type. This is not to say that you could
easily switch the type of credit across existing lenders. For example, if a given borrower
has a cash flow loan with bank "A" and an asset-based loan with bank "B", then it is
likely to go back to bank "A" when it needs to increase its cash flow loan. As we said,
different loan types are about different credit risk, the type of screening and monitoring is
likely to be specific to a given loan type. So information frictions in lender switching--
for a given loan type--are likely.
7
  Using monthly observations, Ioannidou, Ongena and Peydró (2015) find that 46% of
borrowers in Bolivia have only one lender at a given point in time. Bolton et al. (2016)
show that this number for Italy is 60%, and, according to Morais et al. (2019), 79% of
Mexican firms tend to have one lender. Quarterly data used in Khwaja and Mian (2008)
for Pakistan, Iyer et al. (2014) for Portugal, and Baskaya et al. (2017) for Turkey show
that the fraction of borrowers with one lending relationship is 90%, 25%, and 54%,
respectively.
                                                                                            4
in both of these directions. Specifically, because the differences between the types of
commercial credit are rooted in the nature of collateral, it would likely affect young
and old firms differentially, as well as firms in different industries. Although this
implication of our findings is outside of the scope of this paper, it could lead to a
better understanding of the sources of financial constraints in the cross-section of
firms, and over a firm's lifecycle.
   Our empirical analysis is based on the credit registry data from Spain and Peru.
We start by showing that in both countries the bulk of bank commercial credit can be
grouped into four main types: asset-based loans, cash flow loans, trade finance
agreements, and leases. The first two types of loans are the most common type of
credit in both countries, both in terms of number and volume of loans. For instance,
in 2004, asset-based loans accounted for 39.1% and cash flow loans accounted for
48.2% of the volume of total commercial credit by banks in Spain. For Peru, these
figures are 43.5% and 35.8%, respectively. The average size of asset-based loans is
much larger than that of the other forms of credit, averaging about 1.0 million euros
in the case of Spain and 6.4 million soles in the case of Peru.
   Thus, the first contribution of our paper is to give a comprehensive insight into
the prevalence of different loan types in representative economies, and provide a
transparent methodology for identifying loan-type in a credit registry data. The
second contribution is to show that what we know about the magnitude of the credit
supply effects is driven by specific loan-types. To do so, we reexamine several
notable studies, zooming in on individual loan types.
   Applying the methodology proposed by Amiti and Weinstein (2018), we find that
aggregate credit supply shocks constructed using their methodology differ
substantially across loan types. In particular, in the Spanish data, we find that
aggregate credit supply shocks are most strongly correlated with supply shocks in
asset-based loans, while the correlation is weaker for cash flow loans, trade finance,
and leasing.
   We re-estimate the baseline specifications in Jiménez, Ongena, Peydró and
Saurina (2012), Paravisini, Rappoport, Schnabel and Wolfenzon (2015) and


                                                                                     5
Bentolila, Jansen and Jiménez (2018) separately for different loan types. 8 Jiménez et
al. (2012) uses Spanish data to assess how variation in bank capital interacts with
changes in monetary policy rates to influence credit growth. Consistent with a risk-
taking channel of monetary policy, they find that lower interest rates spur loan
growth especially at lowly capitalized banks. Paravisini et al. (2015) and Bentolila et
al. (2018) build on the KM methodology using shocks to banks' liquidity following
the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, in Peru and Spain, respectively. Using variation
in bank exposure they quantify relative effects of the credit channel. We find that the
results in all of these papers are sensitive to the type of loan considered. Moreover,
they appear to be driven mainly by cash flow loans, while asset-based loans exhibit a
different pattern in the estimates.
    Bernanke and Gertler (1989, 1995) argue that monetary policy affects the
external finance premium of firms by altering the agency costs associated with
asymmetric information between borrowers and lenders about the quality of firm
investments. Easing monetary policy increases cash flows and collateral value, thus
leading to a reduction in agency costs, which, in turn, makes it easier for the firm to
borrow. While this theory does not have clear predictions for different loan types,
arguably, the liquidation value of cash flow loans is more sensitive to changes in
agency costs, in which case monetary policy should affect cash flow loans more so
than loans based on hard collateral. Similarly, if in the financial crisis the rise in
agency costs was dominating the impact on collateral, it would explain why we find
that cash flow loans appear to be driving contraction in credit supply during the
financial crisis.
    In this paper, we build on and contribute to a number of strands of literature.
First, we contribute to the literature on how the supply of credit is influenced by
monetary policy and financial shocks including Kashyap, Stein and Wilcox (1993),
Bernanke and Gertler (1995), Kashyap and Stein (2000), Ivashina and Scharfstein
(2010) and the set of papers that trace the impact of credit market disruptions on real

  Note that these are cross-sectional estimates, whereas Amiti and Weinstein (2018)
focus on the time-series behavior of the credit shocks. We will elaborate on the
assumptions and methodological differences in these papers later on.
                                                                                  6
outcomes including Kashyap, Lamont and Stein (1994), and Chodorow-Reich
(2013).
   Naturally, our paper contributes to the large body of empirical studies that build
on the empirical approach in Khwaja and Mian (2008) and use loan-level data to
measure effects of credit shocks and their transmission. As already mentioned, we
will specifically replicate Jiménez et al. (2012), Paravisini et al. (2015) and Bentolila
et al. (2018). Perhaps closest to our research are recent papers by Paravisini,
Rappoport and Schnabl (2017), which considers lender specialization, and Jiménez,
Mian, Peydró and Saurina (2019), which incorporates firm-level general equilibrium
adjustments. Both studies refine the KM methodology. We contribute to this
literature by considering the importance of loan types. We show that this
differentiation is grounded in actual lending practices of banks and that credit growth
dynamics and bank lending channels vary across loan types.
   Finally, there is the emerging literature focused on quantifying the aggregate
effects of credit shocks on real outcomes, such as investment and output. We
specifically build on Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and show that accounting for loan
types is also relevant in evaluating the drivers of aggregate effects.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 discusses the data from the Spanish and
Peruvian credit registry. Section 2 shows patterns of use of different types of
commercial loans by borrowers. In Section 3, we present results of estimating effects
of credit supply accounting for loan heterogeneity. Section 4 concludes.

   1. Data
   In the analysis, we use credit registry data from two countries: Spain and Peru.
Credit registries (or credit bureaus) are depositories of loan level information
typically collected and maintained by the central bank for purposes of monitoring
and regulation. They are also regularly used by local lenders to verify the credit
history of a prospective borrower. To the extent that the type of credit is key
information for assessing credit risk, information on the type of credit should be
recorded in a credit registry and in any other major loan-level database. That is


                                                                                       7
indeed the case in Spanish and Peruvian credit registries. 9 We elaborate on this
below.
    Typically, a credit registry tracks loan stock, that is, outstanding credit amount
with monthly or quarterly frequency. One cannot observe individual loans in such
data, but instead one observes lending relationships for a given borrower at a given
point in time. Empirical work building on Khwaja and Mian (2008) generally
constrains the analysis to observations in periods when the borrower has more than
one lending relationship outstanding. As discussed earlier, this substantially limits
the sample of borrowers used in the estimation. In our data, restricting the sample to
firms with multiple lending relationships drops the number of unique borrowers by
50 percentage points for Spain and 39 percentage points for Peru. Naturally, once
one accounts for loan type, this further restricts the sample of unique borrowers
covered in the analysis. This is because, in the KM approach, borrowers that had one
lender per loan type would be part of the analysis (as long as there is more than one
lender/loan type). Once we account for the loan type, these borrowers drop from the
sample. Given this constraint, in what follows we will consider quarterly
observations as a less restrictive time-unit of observation.


    1.1 The Spanish CIR Dataset
    The Central Credit Register (Central de Informaci´
                                                     on de Riesgos or CIR in
Spanish) is maintained by the Banco de España in its role as primary banking
supervisory agency, and contains detailed monthly information on all outstanding
loans over 6,000 euros to non-financial firms granted by all banks operating in Spain
since 1995. Given the low reporting threshold, virtually all firms with outstanding
bank debt will appear in the CIR. We also use a dataset on loan applications, or,
more precisely, bank requests for firm information, which are interpreted as loan




9
  Similarly, in the United States, widely available data on syndicated loan origination
such as DealScan can be used to identify the types of credit by looking at Market
segment and Loan type.
                                                                                      8
applications. 10 By matching the monthly records on loan applications with the stock
of credit, we infer whether the loan materialized. If not, either the bank denied it or
the firm obtained funding elsewhere. This loan granting information is available from
February 2002 onwards and is the same data used by Jiménez et al. (2012). Because
several of the results will build on Jiménez et al. (2012), we restrict the Spanish
sample to the 2002-2010 period. However, the descriptive statistics by loan type
generalize to a longer sample.
     In the Spanish data, we identify four main loan types based on two first-order
variables: Clase or loan-risk class and Garantia or collateral. 11 From the indicator of
type of risk, we consider the following three categories: 12 trade finance or Crédito
comercial (clase A) in Spanish, commercial and industrial (C&I) loans or Crédito
financiero (clase B), and leasing or Operaciones de arrendamiento financiero (clase
K). That is, leasing and trade finance in the Spanish data can be identified using
solely Clase variable. To separate between asset-based and cash-flow based loans,
we turn to information on collateral. Spanish credit registry focuses on non-personal
collateral (Garantia real) that includes assets like real estate, naval mortgages,
securities, deposits, and merchandise (i.e., hard collateral). As mentioned earlier, it is
the senior secured status (and contractual restriction on asset sales) that imply that
the loan has collateral. The definition of collateralization in Spanish and Peruvian
credit registries only concerns whether the loan is collateralized by hard assets. In the
Spanish data, we know whether the value of the loan is collateralized by hard assets
at (i) 100%, (ii) (50%; 100%); or (iii) is not collateralized. However, 98% of the
loans in the data either have 100% real collateral or no real collateral. We categorize
C&I loans "with collateral" as asset-based loans, and as cash flow loans otherwise.

10
    Banco de España can fine those banks requesting information without intent of loan
origination.
11
   For full details, we refer to Circular 3/1995, de 25 de septiembre, a entidades de
crédito, sobre la Central de Información de Riesgos (available at:
https://www.boe.es/buscar/pdf/1995/BOE-A-1995-22113-consolidado.pdf).
12
    We exclude guarantees and other contingent claims that are recorded in the Spanish
data: "avales, cauciones y garantías" account for around 10% in number of loans and
"riesgo indirecto" for around 6%. All the other types represent between 0.02% and
0.89% and are thus negligible. In terms of volume, these figures are even smaller.
                                                                                      9
     Consistent with our categorization of loan types, in Appendix Table A1, we use
balance-sheet information taken from Almunia et al. (2018) available for the firms in
the Spanish sample, and confirm that firms with a higher share of fixed assets over
total assets rely more on asset-based lending. In particular, asset tangibility has a
strong economic and statistical power in explaining borrower's reliance on asset-
based loans, yet practically no economic power on whether it uses leasing. On the
other hand, the correlation between asset tangibility and borrower's share of cash
flow lending is negative. These results are robust to inclusion of controls for firm's
age, size, leverage, and industry.

     1.2 The Peruvian CIR Dataset
     Similar to the Spanish data, the Central Credit Register of Peru is maintained by
the bank supervisory agency, which in this case is the Superintendencia de Banca y
Seguros (SBS). The data available to us covers a period between January 2001 and
April 2018. 13 The sample is constraint to credit to firms with sales above 20 million
soles in sales (about $6 at the current exchange rate). We further focus on lending by
banks, finance companies and cajas (savings banks). 14 Microcredit institutions are
excluded from the sample.
     We assign loans into four basic types using the variable called Cuenta, which
describes the type of loan as well as the collateral used in this transaction. We assign
as asset-based credit the following loan types: garantía hipotecaria, garantías
preferidas, garantías preferidas autoliquidables, garantías preferidas de muy rápida
realización, and otras garantías. That is, we treat loans with the following collateral
as asset-based loans: real estate, other collateral with stand-alone title, deposits and
other liquid financial securities, and other collateral. The values of Cuenta that are
assigned to cash flow-based lending include: líneas de crédito (revolving lines) and

13
   Peruvian data has a structural break in 2010:Q2, at which point the Credit Registry
applied a new size filter for corporate loans. This should not affect the estimates of the
supply shocks; however, this compositional shift in the data will be apparent in the
descriptive statistics.
14
   Several countries have community banks and savings banks. Their origin and stated
main objective is different than that of commercial banks; however, they often act as
traditional lenders.
                                                                                             10
préstamos (loans). Créditos-comercio exterior (loans for international trade) are
assigned to the trade finance category. Finally, leasing is identified as arrendamiento
financiero. The types of credit that do not fall into one of these categories represent,
on aggregate, about 10% of all loans and 20% of total commercial loan volume. For
Peru, we only capture international trade, whereas for Spain we capture all types of
credit to firms. As such, the behavior of trade financing is not directly comparable
across the two countries.

   2. Use of Different Types of Secured Bank Credit
   In Table 1, we report descriptive statistics by loan type for 2004, 2008, and 2012.
Panel A corresponds to the Spanish sample, and Panel B presents the same statistics
for Peru. In line with evidence from the U.S. syndicated loan market presented by
Lian and Ma (2018), cash flow loans are an essential form of bank credit
representing about half of all commercial credit in Spain and about a third of all
commercial credit in Peru by loan volume or loan number. However, the universe of
bank credit shows that asset-based credit is also pivotal, and perhaps not surprisingly
even more so for an emerging economy. According to Djankov et al. (2008), debt
enforcement tends to be weaker in emerging markets, making it more difficult to
recover value in case of a default, rendering collateralized debt more attractive.
Asset-based loans correspond to about 40% of lending volume in Spain, but only
about a quarter of all outstanding loans; whereas in Peru, asset-based loans in the
past ten years had represented about 50% of the lending volume and close to 40% of
all loans.


                 TABLE 1--DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS BY LOAN TYPE

The numbers correspond to the full sample of loans, including borrowers with one
lender. Both panels exclude loans that do not fall into one of the four loan type
categories.

     Turning to the evolution over time, Figure 1 illustrates that there is heterogeneity
in the patterns across loan types suggesting that the Spanish credit boom was mostly
driven by asset-based lending. The average size of asset-based loans doubled during
the boom, but it was then adjusted. Also, the increase in total credit was fourfold
during the boom for asset-based loans while it was three- and two-fold for leasing
and cash-flow lending, respectively. Similarly, the rise in asset-based lending seems
to be at the heart for the credit expansion experienced in Peru. 15 Consistent with the
weaker creditor protection that we expect for an emerging market, leasing (often a
direct alternative to asset-based loans) plays a substantial role as well.

   As mentioned earlier, in 2010 Peru has reclassified corporate loans. Figure 1 only includes
borrowers that appear in the credit registry after the reclassification. This softens the structural
break in the data, but it can still be seen. The focus on the growth of leasing and asset-based loans
however is unaffected by the methodology for constructing this graph, and is clearly there even in
the raw sample.

   In order to account for loan-specific heterogeneity when revisiting the bank
lending channel literature, we need to condition the sample not only on borrowers
with multiple lending relationships in a given quarter, but also require that there are
multiple relationships within the same loan type. Note that this does not necessarily
mean that the number of observations would drop relative to the sample in a KM-
style estimation. For example, if a borrower has two lenders and each lender has an
asset-based loan and a trade-financing loan outstanding, our sample would have two
borrower-quarter clusters (with two observations each), whereas KM-style estimation
would have one (with two observations). However, if each lender has only one loan
type, and the loan types are non-overlapping, our sample would have zero qualifying
observations (KM-style estimation would still have one observation). Also, while the
number of overall observations could increase, the number of unique borrowers, or
number of observations per loan type cannot exceed the one in KM-style estimation.
   Table 2 gives insight into the overall impact on the sample. In the Spanish data,
the number of unique borrowers drops by 13% once we account for loan type. In the
                                                                               14
 Peruvian data, the drop is 8%. In both datasets the average loan size goes down
 because previously it was aggregated at the lender-quarter level across different loan
 types. We also see that the typical number of lenders per borrower after conditioning
 on loan type is about 3.


                 TABLE 2--SAMPLE SIZE ACCOUNTING FOR LOAN TYPE

 Empirical models that use within borrower-quarter variation in lenders behavior rely
 on the sample of borrowers with multiple lending relationships outstanding at a given
 point in time. The purpose of this table is to illustrate the effect on the sample of
 accounting for the loan type. For Spain, loan amounts are expressed in thousands of
 euros. For Peru, loan amounts are expressed in thousands of Peruvian Soles. On
 average for the sample, $1 USD = S/. 3.13.

This figure illustrates the fraction of firms that use different loan types. We exclude
loans not classified as asset-based loans, cash flow loans, trade financing, or leasing.
The maximum number of loan types a borrower can use is 4. The sample otherwise
corresponds to the full credit registry, unconditional on the number of lenders per
borrowers. For each year, we use the last quarter.

     To emphasize the importance of accounting for loan type for the
generalizability of results out of sample, in Figure 2, we show the fraction of
firms that use different loan types. This figure is constructed using the four loan
types for the last quarter of 2004, 2008, and 2012. The sample corresponds to the
full credit registry, unconditional on the number of lenders per borrower. For
Spain, we find that the majority of borrowers rely on one loan type: in 2004, this
number was 60%, and it increases slightly in later years. For Peru, we can see that
at least prior to the financial crisis (that is, before the "Peruvian miracle" period) a
large fraction of the borrowers relied on a limited number of loan types: in 2004,
83% of borrowers relied on two or one loan type, and, in 2008, this number was
73%. 16   17


     Table 3 instead provides insight into the persistence of usage of a particular
loan type. For each country, we present three matrices that correspond to different
periods. The analysis follows borrowers that at the end of a given year have only
one loan type; each row corresponds to the starting loan type. (We count all
borrowers with one loan type at the year end, even if in the past they had loans of
other types.) The first matrix looks at the probability that 1 year later (at the end
of the next year) the borrower has a given loan type (indicated in columns). The
sample is conditional on the borrower remaining in the credit registry sample at
the end of the period. That is, borrowers that leave the sample are not counted. To
summarize the results, we first take an average across borrowers within a year,
and then report the average across years. The borrower can migrate to more than
one type of credit. As a result, each row can add up to more than 100%. That said,
if loan types are irrelevant, and the assignment is random, the benchmark would
be 25%.
     Taking Peru as an example, we see that 94.9% of borrowers that have asset-
based loans will have an asset-based loan next year, and only 0.6% of them will
completely substitute to a different loan type. However, we can see that about

16
   These differences in the use of one or more loan types do not appear related to borrowing
from one or more banks. Figure A1 shows that the distribution of loan type is broadly similar
for borrowers with multiple lenders and borrowers with single lenders.

17% of borrowers that exclusively rely on asset-backed loan expand into cash-
flow based loans. The typical maturity of a loan in Peru is about one year, so this
result is unlikely to be mechanical. However, we also report results for a 3-year
window (bottom panel). Overall, even at the longer horizon, the loan type appears
to be very persistent for each of the loan types. There is also little mobility of the
loan type during the financial crisis (middle panel). Similarly, we see very little
loan migration in the Spanish sample, indicating that loan type choices are
persistent.


              TABLE 3--PERSISTENCE OF LOAN TYPE FOR BORROWERS

This table follows the migration of loan type for the same borrower (i) one year
later, and (ii) three years later. We also separately report the result for the
financial crisis period 2007-2009. The sample is conditional on borrowers that
start with one loan type and remain in the Credit Registry. We consider loan
migrations to be cases where the borrower took out new loans of a different loan
type rather than its loan types in the previous year. The columns correspond to the
loan type in the subsequent years. The numbers correspond to the average across
years, that is, years are equally-weighted in the calculation. The borrower can
migrate to more than one type of credit. As a result, each row can add up to more
than 100%. Each individual number is capped at 100%. In Panel B, all reported
numbers are different from zero at 1% confidence level.

    3. Credit Supply Shocks and Loan Heterogeneity
    In what follows, we incorporate loan types into the existing studies of the
shocks to credit supply that use micro-data. Specifically, we will replicate core
results in three prominent papers that isolate the effects of credit supply: Amiti
and Weinstein (2018), Jiménez et al. (2012), and Paravisini et al. (2015).
Conveniently, Jiménez et al. (2012) look at the Spanish markets, and Paravisini et
al. (2015) look at the Peruvian market, which is the data that we have, and it will
help us confirm that our results are not driven by sample differences. However, a
more profound reason for selecting these three studies is that they use related but
different methodologies: they deviate in the strength of the assumptions required
for identification of credit supply and, consequently, the generality of their
insight. Amiti and Weinstein (2018) present an empirical methodology for
constructing time-series of aggregate supply and demand shocks. As the authors
themselves emphasize, their shortcoming is that shocks to supply are identified
from the data using a stringent structure for the behavior of supply and demand.
(We present a detailed discussion of the identifying assumptions in the
Appendix.) On the other side of the spectrum are studies that use a direct
exogenous shock that impacts the balance sheet of the banks: an anticipated
nuclear test in Pakistan that led to the collapse of the dollar deposit funding
                                                                                 19
(Khwaja and Mian, 2008), or shortages in foreign funding to Peruvian banks
following the Lehman collapse (Paravisini et al., 2015). These studies rely on
differential exposure of banks to such shocks; they "cleanly" identify marginal
effects in the cross-section, but do not provide a path for measuring an aggregate
impact.
   We want to stress that it is not our intention to opine on the usefulness or
validity of these different methodological approaches. We take these studies as a
state of empirical literature on the credit channel. Our core insight is that--
regardless of the approach--the credit channel operates differentially for separate
loan types.

   3.1 Credit Supply Shocks in the Time-Series
   Amiti and Weinstein (2018), henceforth AW, develop an empirical
methodology for constructing aggregate supply and demand shocks using
matched bank-firm loan data (the AW application is based on a sample of around
150 banks and 1,600 listed firms in Japan from 1990 to 2010). As the authors
point out, many studies have shown that bank shocks matter for loan supply;
however, that tells us little about how important bank loan supply in determining
aggregate variables such as investments and employment is. The AW
methodology builds on the following specification:

                       ln  =  +  +                                           (1)

where  refers to loan growth by firm f from bank b in time t measured as
log changes,  refers to the "bank lending channel," and  refers to the "firm
borrowing channel." One approach to identify both channels is to empirically
estimate (1) in a regression framework that is saturated with firm-time and bank-
time fixed effects. AW show that this procedure is inefficient because it ignores
general equilibrium considerations. For instance, a firm cannot borrow more
without at least one bank willing to lend more (and vice versa). The core of AW's
methodological insight is that one can account for general equilibrium conditions
at the aggregate level by imposing that total credit growth is recovered by
summing up the sequences of the estimated fixed effects so that the R-squared of
the regression is equal to one by construction.
   Using annual data from the Spanish and Peruvian credit registry, we estimate
equation (1) with the AW methodology and recover a sequence of bank-year and
                                                                                   20
firm-year fixed effects that can be interpret as bank credit supply shocks and firm
demand shocks. These shocks are labelled as "All loans (ALL)" because they are
based on total credit encompassing all loan types at the bank-firm-year level as in
the original AW approach. We next construct four alternative samples in which
each bank-firm-year observation refers to credit exposure from a particular loan
category. The AW methodology is then applied to each subsample and four
different supply shocks are estimated for each bank in the sample: asset-based
loans (ABL), cash flow loans (CF), trade finance loans (TF), and leasing loans
(LEA) shocks.

   Figure 3 compares the original AW shocks estimated from total credit at the
bank-firm level with the bank shocks resulting from each loan category. Panel A
corresponds to Spain, while Panel B corresponds to Peru. The takeaway is that the
correlation is positive but relatively small. For Spain, the R-squared ranges from
0.001 in the case of leasing to 0.282 for asset-based loans. For Peru, the range is
from 0.001 to 0.266; the lowest and highest numbers correspond to leasing and
cash-flow lending. It is striking that--with the exception of "trade finance"
category, which captures different things for the two countries--the range of the
magnitudes of errors resulting from omission of accounting for loan type are very
similar for the two countries. Wide variation in errors across loan types suggests
that banks' credit supply is different depending on loan type contrary to the
implicit assumption in the AW approach. Indeed, there are banks with an
estimated positive shock from total credit (AW original setting) and a negative
shock identified from, for instance, cash flow loans, which definitely indicates
that loan heterogeneity matters for the identification of bank supply shocks. Note
that we focus here on bank shocks, but the patterns are similar in the case of the
estimated firm shocks shown in Figure A2 in the Appendix.
   Table 4 presents correlations of AW credit supply shocks across different loan
types. While the evidence in Figure 3 is already suggestive, the patterns in Table


                                                                                                                                                         22
4 are even more revealing of the importance of loan heterogeneity for identifying
bank credit supply shocks. In particular, Table 4 shows that in all the six cases the
estimated correlations are basically zero for both countries, which clearly points
to loan-specific credit supply shocks at the bank level.


      TABLE 4--VIS-À-VIS COMPARISON OF LOAN-SPECIFIC BANK SHOCKS

This table presents regression coefficients of regressing Amiti and Weinstein
(2018) bank shocks estimated by loan type on each other. The R-squared is
reported in parentheses. For example, regressing bank shocks estimated using
Spanish data for asset-based loans on bank shocks estimated for cash flow loans
produces a slope of -0.05 and an R-squared of 0.003.


Panel A: Spain

   Finally, in unreported results, we also estimated equation (1) considering two
alternative sets of fixed effects. In the Spanish data, if we regress credit growth on
firm-quarter fixed effects, we explain 28 percent of the total variation in credit
growth (R-squared = 0.28). However, if we instead include (firm × loan type ×
quarter) fixed effects, the variation explained increases to 39 percent (R-squared =
0.39). The corresponding numbers for Peru are 0.23 and 0.42. This shows that
loan type heterogeneity matters to explain differences in credit growth across
banks within each firm.
   Overall, in line with the evidence in Figure 1, the AW methodology reveals
stark differences in behavior of bank credit shocks for different loan types over
our sample period.



                                                                                   23
   3.2 Bank Lending Channel of Monetary Policy
   In this section, we re-estimate the baseline specifications in Jiménez et al.
(2012), which uses Spanish data. This study gets closer to the Khwaja and Mian
(2008) setting, in that it relies on within-borrower differential response of lenders
to monetary policy. One potential critique of this study, however, is that it does
not have a clean exogenous credit supply shock, but instead looks at the ECB's
changes in interest rates for the euro area.
   As before, our idea is to incorporate loan-type into the analysis and to see if
credit supply substantially differs across core loan types. Our identification is thus
based on differences across banks within the same firm and loan type pair.
Intuitively, we compare the same firm which has cash flow loans from two (or
more) banks that are differentially exposed to changes in monetary policy.
   The complete replication exercise follows the following econometric model:
                =   × -1 +   × -1 +
                                                                                     (2)

  +  × -1 +   × -1 +-1 +  + 


where f, b, and t refer to firm, bank, and quarter, respectively. l refers to the loan
type, and  corresponds to (firm × loan type × quarter) fixed effects. Even
though a large fraction of the borrowers relies on one loan type, many borrowers
use more than one lender by loan type, which is what ultimately allows us to do
the replication exercise. We consider two alternative dependent variables, namely,
credit growth for the intensive margin and issuance of new loans for the extensive
margin. Credit growth is based on annual log differences winsorized at -100% and
+200%, and the new loan dummy takes value 1 when a bank-firm-loan type
triplet first appears in the sample and zero otherwise. IRt is the annual change in
a 3-month Spanish interbank interest rate. GDPt is annual growth of real GDP.
CAPbt-1 and LIQbt-1 refer to the capital and liquidity ratios at the bank level.
   With a minor exception, controls are as in Jiménez et al. (2012). Banks
characteristics include log total assets, doubtful assets ratio, return on assets,
capital ratio, and liquidity ratio. Firm controls include: (i) ratio of equity over total
assets, (ii) ratio of the current assets over total assets, (iii) the log of the total
assets of the firm (in 2008 euros), (iv) the log of one plus the firm's age in years,
(v) return on assets, (vi) a dummy variable that equals one if the firm had doubtful
loans the month before the loan was requested and zero otherwise, (vii) a dummy

                                                                                      24
variable that equals one if the firm had doubtful loans any time previous to the
month before the loan was requested and zero otherwise, (viii) the log of one plus
the duration of the relationship between firms and bank (in months), and (ix) the
log of the number of bank relationships. Regressions also include doubtful loan
ratio of the industry in which the firm operates, and the log of the number of
banks in the province where the firm is located. In terms of explanatory variables,
the only differences between our analysis and Jiménez et al. (2012) are twofold.
First, GDP data is not the same due to data revisions by the National Statistics
Institute (e.g. new base year in 2010). Second, some controls (e.g. Herfindahl
index in the sector and number of banks in the province) are not included because
they are not readily available.
   Estimates are reported in Table 5. In order to analyze the role of loan
heterogeneity, we cannot use loan application data because we do not observe the
loan type of the rejected applications (i.e., the zeros). Instead, in columns (1)
through (4), we start by replicating the results in Jiménez et al. (2012) using credit
registry data. Regressions in columns (5) through (8) control for (firm × loan type
× quarter) fixed effects and are the results of interest.
   Overall, the explanatory power increases, but the magnitude of the effects
seems relatively unaltered when including loan type fixed effects. Note however
that the estimates in Table 5 can be interpreted as a weighted average of the
different effects by loan type with weights given by the number of observations.
In Table 6, we report the estimates by loan type. All specifications include firm-
quarter fixed effects. The strongest specifications, the ones that can be interpreted
as identification of credit supply, are the ones corresponding to interactions with
bank capitalization and liquidity (Table 6, Panel B).
   The estimates in Table 6 indicate that cash flow loans are at the root of the
overall results in Jiménez et al. (2012). Indeed, cash flow loans represent around
53% of the total number of loans (about 11 million out of 21 million
observations). Interestingly, asset-based loans, which were central to the Spanish
credit boom, present a different pattern in the estimates.

This table reports the estimated coefficients from re-running specifications (1) through (4) in Table 5 by loan type. For example,
regressions (2.a) though (2.d) that appear in Panel B correspond to Table 5, specification (2). The four columns correspond to four key
loan types. As in Table 5, the variables of interest are: the annual change of Spanish 3-month interbank interest rates (IR); the annual
change of Spanish GDP in real terms (GDP); the ratio of bank's equity over total assets (CAP); and the ratio of bank's liquid assets over
the total assets (LIQ). All regressions include the same controls as in Table 5. For each column, Panel A and B have the same number of
observations and bank-quarter clusters; these are reported at the end of Panel B. Standard errors are reported in parentheses.

   3.3 The Global Financial Crisis and the Bank Lending Channel
   As mentioned earlier, the "gold standard" of measurement of credit supply in
the cross-section requires a credible exogenous shock to banks balance sheet to
instrument for the supply of credit. In that sense, some might argue that earlier
results that built on Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and Jiménez et al. (2012) reflect
a violation of identification assumptions in those studies. So, for completeness,
we look at Paravisini et al. (2015) which uses Peruvian data. As in their study, we
combine three data sets: bank-level data on Peruvian banks; loan-level data on
credit in the domestic banking sector; and customs data for Peruvian firms
containing record of exports at the 4-digit product level. There is only one
difference between our data and the data used in Paravisini et al. (2015): our
sample excludes the smallest companies. The average loan size to an exporting
firm in our sample is $2.37 million, as opposed to $1.01 in their sample. Our data
was obtained several years apart, and, in the most recent years, the Peruvian
financial regulator prohibited access to the information on the smallest firms for
purposes of external research. That said, on many dimensions our sample seems
to match reasonably close. For example, their sample includes 41 lenders whereas
ours has 40 lenders. So, put simply, any differences in estimates in our paper
should be attributed to any differences between small and large companies.
   We use the same filters in our analysis: (i) the sample is constrained to July
2007-June 2009, with July 2007-June 2008 corresponding to the period prior to
the foreign capital flow reversal caused by the 2008 crisis (the credit supply
instrument in their study); (ii) we only include banks and cajas (i.e., savings
banks); (iii) we only look at firms with non-zero credit in the pre-crisis period;
(iv) by construction, we only look at the universe of exporters; and (v) we look at
the volume of exports measured in kilograms.
   We focus on two key results in Paravisini et al. (2015). The central insight of
their paper can be already seen in the cross-sectional analysis that they report in
their Table 3. The explanatory variables are the share of lenders' assets funded
with foreign debt, and an indicator variable of whether that share exceeds 10%
(which is the sample mean for commercial banks for that time period.) The results
are reported in Table 7. The estimates in column (1) closely match the results in
Paravisini et al. (2015). Overall, this result shows that a banks' foreign funding

                                                                                29
was negatively correlated with its change in supply of credit following the
financial crisis. This insight is the core building block of their study.

foreign funding of bank b. D(FDb >10%) is a dummy that signals whether foreign

Paravisini et al. 2015). Standard errors are clustered at the bank level and are
reported in parentheses.

     As before, our goal is to illustrate that this aggregate result is limited to some,
though not all loan types. The rest of Table 7 reports the same regression, but
estimated within a sample of individual loan types. Once again, what seems to
emerge is that cash-flow appears to be behind the core underlying mechanism.
Asset-backed loans display a sharp difference compared to other types of credit;
the statistical significance of the aggregate result comes from the loan types other
than asset-based loans. Overall, the structure of this empirical model substantially
reduces the number of observations for individual loan types, which likely also
impacts the statistical significance of the results. 18
     Table 8 instead uses a firm-product-destination level panel of export volumes
to estimate intensive margin elasticity of exports to credit shocks. Credit supply is
instrumented using banks reliance of foreign funding. Paravisini et al. (2015)
emphasize that their empirical strategy relies on accounting for shocks to export
demand and input cost which they achieve by looking at variation within product-
destination. As with Table 7, our estimates are higher than in the original paper,
but reasonably close. Separation of the result by loan-type indicates that the

18
  Inclusion of (firm × loan type) fixed effects preserves the signs, but reduces the economic
and statistical significance of the results.
                                                                                          30
aggregate result does not generalize to leasing or international trade, although in
this result, contraction in asset-backed loans does lead to substantial contraction
in exports. As before, cash-flow loans continue to play a significant role in
economic terms.

dummy that signals whether foreign funding of bank b is above 10%, the mean
among the commercial banks (as in Paravisini et al. 2015). Standard errors are
clustered at the product-destination level and are reported in parentheses.

    As a final insight, we look at another study that is also focused on the
financial crisis as a source of a shock to banks liquidity, but uses Spanish data,
that is Bentolila et al. (2018). This paper exploits differences across banks that
were bailed out by the Spanish government ("weak banks") versus the rest
("healthy banks"). Following Khwaja and Mian (2008), Bentolila et al. (2018)
consider a first-stage regression at the bank-firm level showing that weak banks
curtailed lending relative to the other banks during the global financial crisis. We
re-estimate the first-stage regression in Bentolila et al. (2018) at the bank-firm-
loan type level. More formally:


                                                                                    (3)
           =   +  +    +  + 


where, as before, f, b, and l refer to firm, bank, and type of loan, respectively. The
dependent variable is credit growth between 2006:Q4 and 2010:Q4. The unit of

                                                                                     31
observation is bank-firm-loan type level. Weak bank, a dummy identifying
bailed out banks, is the explanatory variable of interest. Z is the log of (one plus)
the length of the bank-firm relationship, measured in months. Bank is a vector of
bank controls, namely, log total assets, doubtful assets ratio, return on assets,
capital ratio, and liquidity ratio. In the first specification of equation (3) we
include firm fixed effects, as in Bentolila et al. (2018). All other specifications
include firm-loan type fixed effects.

   TABLE 9--WEAK BANK ATTACHMENT AND CREDIT GROWTH BY LOAN TYPE

Column (1) replicates the results in Table 3 of Bentolila et al. (2018) using loan-
level data. Column (2) includes firm-loan fixed effects. Columns (3) to (6) re-
estimate this equation for different loan types. The dependent variable is credit
growth between 2006:Q4-2010:Q4. The estimated coefficients are obtained from
linear probability models estimated using least squares. Weak bank which is a
dummy equal to 1 if the bank was bailed by the Spanish authorities and zero

   The results are reported in Table 9. Column (1) corroborates the finding in
Bentolila et al. (2018) that, for a given firm, weak banks reduced credit supply
vis-a-vis healthy banks. Column (2) shows that this result is similar when
including firm-loan type fixed effects. However, results by individual loan type
indicate that cash-flow based loans are at the root of this finding. Estimated
effects are not significant for asset-based loans and trade finance. Also, the
number of cash flow loans is larger than that of the other loan types together.


   4. Conclusions
   Practitioners commonly refer to four distinct loan types: asset-based loans,
cash flow loans, trade financing, and leasing. At the heart of this distinction is the

                                                                                   32
speed and size of recovery in default. Some of these types of credit had been
directly or indirectly studied in the literature; however, this distinction has been
overlooked by the literature focusing on the conditions of bank credit supply. Yet,
as we show, such distinction is important as a large fraction of companies in any
economy relies on a single loan type, and these loan types tend to be very
persistent. Moreover, given that the quality of measurement of supply effects is
central to several of the studies using narrow fixed effect identification,
accounting for the loan type is an important identifying assumption.
    This paper uses bank-firm matched credit-registry data from two largely
unrelated countries--Spain and Peru--to show that four loan types are easily
identifiable in the data. We show that these four loan types represent the bulk of
commercial credit in both economies, and, importantly, that the bank lending
channel varies by loan type.
   An important contribution of this paper is that we use the micro data to gain
insight into what type of data drives the existing findings on credit supply by
replicating several notable studies that tackle different questions and use different
methodologies. Using the approach in Amiti and Weinstein (2018), we show that
the time-series of aggregate credit supply shocks is driven by individual loan
types. In the Spanish data, the aggregate credit supply shocks are most strongly
correlated with supply shocks in asset-based loans, while the correlation is weaker
for other types of credit including cash flow loans (one of the two most prominent
types of credit). Instead, in Peru, aggregate bank shocks are mainly associated
with cash flows loans and international trade credit behavior. Replication of
studies looking into cross-sectional variation reveals that much of what we know
from these studies is attributable to cash flow loans, and not to asset-based loans.
Overall, our results imply that not accounting for loan heterogeneity can bias
estimates of the bank lending channel and more generally suggest that it is
important to account for heterogeneity in loan type in analyses of the economic
significance of credit market disruptions. While our study makes a first step to
quantifying the importance of loan heterogeneity, more research is needed to
improve our understanding of the credit type choices that firms make, and how
these choices influence the transmission of financial shocks.

        APPENDIX 1. ESTIMATES OF CREDIT SHOCKS IN THE PRESENCE OF LOAN
                                 HETEROGENEITY

   Consider the following regression model of loan growth typically used in
studies that build on methodology in Khwaja and Mian (2008):

                      ln  =  +  +                                            (A1)

where  refers to loan growth by firm f from bank b in time t,  denotes a
bank-specific shock (e.g., a liquidity shock due to nuclear tests in the case of
Khwaja and Mian, 2008), and  refers to a firm-specific demand shock. The
expectation of the error term is assumed to be zero:  [ ] = 0. This type of
empirical specification has been used to disentangle the firm-borrowing channel
(demand shock  ) from the bank lending channel (supply shock  ). The
inclusion of time-varying firm fixed effects implies that identification is based on
variation in credit across banks with the same firm, keeping firm credit demand
constant across banks.
   The crucial assumption is that firms' credit demand is the same across all
banks. This assumption may be violated if firms' credit demand is bank specific.
Such would be the case if different lenders are providing different types of credit.
For example, a firm pursuing an acquisition of another company could get a cash-
flow based loan from bank "A", and in parallel, it could get an asset-based loan to
finance an equipment purchase from bank "B". Now, imagine a given firm
experiences a demand shock leading to an increase in its demand for credit of the
second type. If this were the case, the demand shock would apply only to the
asset-based loan (bank "B") instead of overall credit (from both banks "A" and
"B").
   We can formalize the bias that arises when the true specification includes
firm-loan specific shocks by decomposing the firm demand shock  into two-
components:  =  +  , namely, an overall firm demand shock ( ) and a
firm-loan specific shock ( ), where l denotes the loan type. The true model to
be estimated would then be:
                  ln  =  +  +  +                                             (A2)
where  refers to loan growth of loan type l by firm f from bank b in time t.

                                                                                 34
   We can assess the magnitude of the bias by comparing different estimates of
equation (A2). In particular, we can first estimate  by including time-varying
firm fixed effects  in equation (A2) but without including time-varying firm-
loan fixed effects  :

                                 ( ,  )                                   (A3)
                          =  +
                         
                                 ( )

   We can then estimate  by including time-varying firm-loan type fixed
effects ( ) in the regression. The inclusion of firm-loan type fixed effects
implies that identification is based on variation across banks in credit with the
same firm and the same type of loan. Since  =  , we can obtain the
magnitude of the bias:
                                    ( ,  )                                (A4)
                     -  =
                    
                                   ( )

   The empirical model in (A1) can be generalized, following Amiti and
Weinstein (2018), to:
                         ln  =  +  +                                      (A5)


where  refers to loan growth by firm f from bank b in time t,  refers to
the bank-lending channel (bank-specific supply shock), and  refers to the firm
borrowing channel (firm-specific demand shock).




                                                                              35
       APPENDIX 2. ASSUMPTIONS FOR IDENTIFICATION OF CREDIT SUPPLY

   In the existing literature, there exist three approaches to identifying credit
supply using loan level data. These approaches vary in the strength of the
assumptions required for identification of credit supply and in the generality of
their application. In this Appendix, we set out the assumptions of each method,
starting with the method that is the most general but also requires the strongest set
of assumptions.
   The first approach is introduced by Amiti and Weinstein (2018) and it
estimates the following model of credit growth:
                      ln  =  +  +                                         (B1)

where  refers to loan growth by firm f from bank b in time t,  refers to a
bank-specific shock, and  refers to a firm-specific shock. The authors interpret
 as a (bank-specific) supply shock and  as a (firm-specific) demand shock.
   The key assumptions underlying the identification in AW are: (i) credit
demand is firm-specific, not bank-specific; and (ii) credit supply is bank-specific,
not firm-specific. Any shock that leads banks to lend more to some firms than
others will result in supply being misinterpreted as demand. Such firm-specific
supply of credit by banks could originate from lender specialization, differences
in market power, or the value of bank relationships. Similarly, any shift in firm's
credit demand from some banks relative to others may lead to credit demand
being misinterpreted as supply. Such bank-specific demand by firms could
originate from borrower specialization in certain type of credit products,
differences in the type of collateral used for credit, or the existence of different
loan types more generally.
   The approach proposed by Khwaja and Mian (2008) instead estimates the
following model of credit growth:
                     ln  =  +  +  .                                       (B2)

The difference is in  which denotes a bank-specific shock (typically a liquidity
shock of some sort). Focusing on an exogenous bank shock imposes more
structure on the model and potentially allows for stronger identification ­ to the
extent that  relates to bank-specific shocks ­ at the loss of generality. The
                                                                                  36
key assumptions underlying KM are: (i) credit demand is firm-specific, not bank-
specific; (ii) the time variation in  is not correlated with shifts in credit
demand; and (iii) the coefficient  is constant across banks and firms.
   The first assumption is identical in both approaches. Any shift in firm demand
for loans from some banks relative to others (e.g. originating from differences in
type of credit) may lead to demand being misinterpreted as supply, rendering this
assumption invalid. The second and third assumptions are strictly weaker than the
first assumption in AW. If there is lender specialization and firm demand is bank-
specific, then these two assumptions are not met. This would be the case, for
instance, if in response to a demand shock, firms demand more credit from banks
that specialize in the type of credit that the firms demand (e.g. export credit).
   Paravisini et al. (2017) extends the KM approach by estimating:
                 ln  =  +  +  +  .                                          (B3)
The new element,  , denotes a demand shock that varies by firm and bank.
Paravisini et al. (2017) interpret  as a source of variation related to credit
demand that varies with lender specialization. In their study, they look at banks
specializing in specific export markets. This approach allows for stronger
identification to the extent that  relates to bank-specific firm demand.
   The key additional assumption in Paravisini et al. (2017) is that the coefficient
 is constant across banks and firms. This assumption is not met if the
relationship between bank-specific firm demand and credit growth is not stable
over time. For instance, this could be due to changes over time in the type of
firms that banks specialize in or shifts in bank market power that cause
disproportionate shifts in the demand for certain type of loans. In the application
of Paravisini et al. (2017) this would be the case if the type of banks operating in
the firm's export markets suddenly changes (for instance, due to regulation or
firm entry). In that case, the term  may capture bank-specific supply shocks
that will be misinterpreted as demand. However, to the extent that lender
specialization is stable over time, the assumption underlying the approach in
Paravisini et al. (2017) is likely to be met. This approach, therefore, requires the
weakest identifying assumption of the three methods considered. Its application
is, however, also more limited given the additional structure imposed on the
model and the need to find suitable proxies for  .

This figure plots the distribution of loan type for borrowers with multiple lenders
in a given quarter (KM sample) and for single lender borrowers. The idea is to
understand whether the estimates in the KM-style approach are based on a sample
with a similar distribution of loan types as in the sample of single lender
borrowers. We first compute the distribution for each year in the sample and then
take the average across years.

                  TABLE A1--ASSET TANGIBILITY AND LOAN TYPE


This table provides support for our loan classification. For Spanish firms, we have
financial information from a source that is independent of the credit registry,
taken from Almunia et al. (2018), for the period 2002:Q1-2010:Q4. Our focus is
on assets' tangibility, measured as PPE/Total assets. Each observation in the
sample is firm-quarter. The dependent variable is the share of credit of each loan
type: asset-based loans, cash flow loans, trade financing, and leasing,
respectively. Controls include: firm age, total assets, leverage ratio, a set of
industry-year dummies, and year fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the
firm level and are reported in parentheses.
