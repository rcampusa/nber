                                        ABSTRACT

Recent policy attention has focused on proposals to reduce prices for drugs that have received
public funding. From an implementation perspective, such policies rely on public disclosure of
government support for research. In this paper, we highlight two conceptual problems with past
attempts to measure these public disclosures, and construct a new data set which corrects for
these problems. Our corrected measures suggest that under-reporting of public research support
is less of an issue than previously thought.
