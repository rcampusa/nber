            REAL EXCHANGE RATE OVERSHOOTING AND THE OUTPUT COST
                       OF BRINGING DOWN INFLATION

      Implementing   a 'gradualist' policy of monetary contraction, in an

 open economy with a freely floating exchange rate but with nominal inertia

 in domestic labor costs, can lead to prompt and substantial changes in

 the nominal and real exchange rate. One of the virtues claimed for such

 exchange rate 'overshooting', however, is its immediate effect on the

 price level and so on domestic wage and price inflation.

      In this paper we show that, in a model which is 'super—neutral' and

has nominal inertia in both the level of labor costs and their trend or

core rate of growth, this early overshooting of the exchange rate does

not succeed in cutting the output costs of reducing steady—state inflation.

Those output and unemployment costs which are initially avoided by over—

valuing the currency have to be paid later when this overvaluation is

corrected. Relative to other policies which achieve the same effect on

steady—state inflation, exchange rate overshooting brings inflation down

more quickly.

1. Introduction

        The proposition that under a floating exchange rate regime restrictive

   monetary policy can lead to substantial "overshooting" of the nominal and

   real exchange rate is now accepted fairly widely.     The fundamental reason

   is the presence of nominal stickiness or inertia in domestic factor and

   product markets cohibined with a freely flexible nominal exchange rate.

   Current and anticipated future monetary policy actions are reflected

   immediately in the nominal exchange rate, set as it is in a forward-looking

   efficient auction market, while they are reflected only gradually and with

   a lag in domestic nominal labour costs and/or goods prices.    Nominal

   appreciation of the currency therefore amounts to real appreciation - a

   loss of competitiveness.   Since in most of the simple analytical models

  used to analyse the overshooting propositions there is no long-run effect

  of monetary policy on the real exchange rate, any short-run real appreciation

  implies an overshooting of the long-run equilibrium.     The transitory (but

  potentially quite persistent) loss of competitiveness is associated with a

  decline in output below its capacity level.   This excess capacity is one

  of the channels through which restrictive monetary policy brings down the

  rate of domestic cost and price inflation.


       One of the virtues claimed for the sharp initial appreciation of the

  nominal and real exchange rate in response to a previously unanticipated

  tightening of the stance of monetary policy is its immediate effect on

  the domestic price level.   The domestic currency prices of those inter-

  nationally traded goods whose foreign currency prices can be treated as

  exogenous will decline by the same proportion as the increase in the value

 of the domestic currency.    To a greater or lesser extent the same holds

 even for those internationally traded goods where the home country is

 large in relation to the world market.   Both through its effect on the
                                       —2—

prices of internationally traded final goods and through its effect on the

price of imported raw materials and intermediate inputs, a sudden step

appreciation of the exchange rate will immediately bring down the domestic

price level.   In this paper we shall argue that the effect of such exchange
                             the cost of reducing
rate jumps is merely to redistribute'inflation over time: early gains have

to be "handed back" later as the equilibrium level of competitiveness is

restored.   Crucial to this argument is the assumption of stickiness of
                                        f
              by our assumption o a predetermined nominal money wage nd
some nominal domestic cost component.   In our model this is built in/through

our specification of the behaviour of the "core" or underlying rate of

inflation, it     ,    the   augmentation term in the wage Phillips curve.     Subject

to one quite significant qualification, the core rate of inflation is viewed

as predetermined with its behaviour over time governed by a first order

partial adjustment mechanism.          It can be thought of as an adaptive

expectations mechanism for the labour market although we do not favour that

interpretation.        In our view the core rate of inflation,which is a

distributed lag on past rates of inflation, stands for all the factors in

the economy that give inertia to built-in trends in wages and prices.

Also, while the level of the money wage is always treated as predetermined,

71   , while   determined by a "backward—looking" process,can make discrete

jumps at a point in time.         This will happen whenever there is a discrete

jump in the general price level.            In our model this can occur either if

the exchange rate jumps or if there is a change in indirect taxes.           Since

the exchange rate is a forward-looking price which responds to "news"

about current and future shocks, the underlying rate of inflation indirectly

and to a limited extent also responds to such shocks.


       To put the present paper in perspective it is useful to relate our

current approach to that of an earlier paper (Buiter and Miller [1981]).

This is done in Section 2 where a simple model of real exchange rate
                                                     —3—

       overshooting is discussed.             Section 3 contains some modifications of the

       simple model.            It is here that we discuss the implications of assuming

       flexibility of domestic nominal wage costs.               While we do not believe

       that such a "neo-classical" specification is appropriate for the analysis

    of an advanced industrial economy like the U.K., the discussion of this

    case helps bring out the crucial nature of the assumption of nominal

    inertia in the behaviour of domestic costs.                  Section 4 analyzes in some

   detail the behaviour of the model with sluggish "core" inflation.




2. A Simple Model of Real Exchange Rate Overshooting

             A slightly simplified version of the model in Buiter and Miller [1981]

   is given in equations (1) —              (5).      All variables except for r,
                                                                                     rd
                                                                                           r

                                                                      T )t




         Equation (1) is the LM curve:          m denotes a fairly wide monetary aggregate

such as £M3 which consists, to a significant extent (50—60%),of interest—

bearing deposits.              We therefore measure the opportunity cost of holding

money by the interest differential between the loan rate, r , and the own

rate on time deposits (rd).               Equation (2) is the IS curve.      Demand for

domestic output depends on the short real interest rate and on the relative

price of foreign and domestic goods.             A fiscal policy variable could be

added without difficulty.              Preferable alternative specifications include

replacing the short real interest rate by the long real interest rate and

modelling output as predetermined, with its rate of change depending on

the excess of ex ante effective demand over the level of real output.                This

would preclude the unrealistic immediate jumps in real output in response

to e.g. a loss of competitiveness which are a feature of the current model.

               *
takes         p    as given.      It is large in the world market for its exportables.

No explicit distinction is made between traded and non-traded goods.

Equation (3) is the augmented Phillips curve.              By choice of units (the

logarithm of) capacity output is set equal to zero.              The augmentation term

ii      is   identified, in (4), with the right-hand side time-derivative of the

money supply.           Thus even if m were to make a discrete jump, the price
                                              —5—

 level would not jump.                This is one way of imposing the crucial property

of nominal inertia, stickiness or sluggishness.                    Equation (5) reflects

 the assumption of perfect capital mobility and perfect substitutability

between domestic and foreign bonds.                 Risk—neutral speculators equate

the uncovered interest differential in favour of the domestic country,

net of any tax on capital imports, to the expected rate of depreciation of

the domestic currency.                 The country is small in the world financial

markets and r              is treated as given.       The assumption of rational
                                                                    L',eo]
expectations,      employed in Dornbusch [1976J, Liviatan/and Buiter and

Miller [1981] is equivalent to perfect foresight in our deterministic

model.        It is used in equations (2) and (5).             For simplicity the foreign
                       *
price     level, p         ,   is   assumed to be constant.    Choice of units sets it

equal to zero, so competitiveness is measured by e-p.


      The own rate of interest on money is assumed exogenous.                   In a

competitive banking system with a binding required reserve ratio h

(0   <h   <   1) on all bank deposits, the loan rate r and the deposit rate

rd are linked by: rd = (l-h)r(TD+DD)TD1

TD is the volume of interest-bearing time deposits and DD the volume of

non-interest-bearing demand deposits.                 If demand deposits are only a small

fraction of the total, then rd                  (l-h)r .    This   can be used to eliminate

rd from the model.              The main consequence is to reduce the interest sensitivity

of money demand.               We prefer treating r as exogenous so that discretionary

changes in rd can be used to describe policy actions to alter the degree

of competitiveness of the banking system.                  The dynamics of the system is

conveniently summarized in terms of the two state variables £ and c

           Real liquidity, L ,      is   a backward-looking or predetermined variable.

It only makes discrete jumps when the policy instrument m changes

discontinuously.            Real competitiveness c is a forward-looking or jump

variable.           It jumps whenever e jumps.           The state—space representation

of the model of equations (1) — (6) is:

        We now briefly summarize the effects on competitiveness and output

of   a mmber of      policy actions similar to the ones implemented by the

Thatcher government.


       a) AJI    unanticipated   and immediately implemented reduction in the
rate of monetary growth.

       There     is no long—run effect    on competitiveness associated with a

reduction in the monetary growth rate.           The steady—state stock of real

money balances increases owing to the lower nominal interest rate associated

with the lower steady—state rate of inflation.            The dynamics are described
in   Figure 1 .     The   reduction   in Dm is implemented as soon as it is first

anticipated.        The initial long—run equilibrium is at            the   new one
                                                               E1 ,
at E     .      For convenience we assume that the initial position is also at
                                                                                        E1
To achieve convergence to the new equilibrium the nominal exchange rate

jumps so as to put the system on the saddlepath SS'           through E2 .       With
p predetermined, a jump in e corresponds to a jump in C .               This

jump-appreciation of the real exchange rate to E12 in response      to an
unanticipated    reduction in the rate of monetary growth is associated with

a decline in output and a fall in the nominal interest rate.      Note from

equations (3) and (4) that "on impact" the reduction in Dm lowers the

rate of inflation by more than the change in the rate of growth of the

money supply:    cet.   par. there is a one-for-one relationship between Dp

and Dm+.      The induced decline in output further lowers the rate of

inflation.      This somewhat implausible feature of the model will be removed

below in Section 4.


      From the LM equation (1) it can be seen that with rd and B exogenous

and   P.   predetermined, r and y have to move in the same direction in

response to any exogenous shock.      The nominal interest falls in response

to the monetary growth deceleration, reflecting the current and anticipated

future success of the anti-inflationary strategy.      To equate the demand for

money to its predetermined real supply, output falls.      The reduction in

output is achieved both through appreciation of the real exchange rate and

through the increase in the real interest rate. To avoid the conclusion

of our model that a reduction in the rate of growth of the money stock

lowers the nominal interest rate, the money demand function would have to be

modified.     Possible modifications are the following.      The inclusion

of a long rate of interest in the money demand function.      Even if the

nominal interest rate on long term debt declines in response to the anti—

inflationary strategy, the short rate        may rise in the short run.

Similar conclusions foi the behavioxof the short rate would follow if the

(expected) rate of inflation were to have a negative effect on the demand

for money.      Finally, wealth effects on the demand for money could be

included.     A fall in the long term nominal interest rate means an upward
                                        —9--


 revaluation of private sector holdings of long—dated public debt.               This

 would raise the demand for money, thus rendering a decline in output

 consistent with an increase in the short nominal interest rate.


      b) A previously unanticipated future reduction in the rate of monetary
 growth.

        If the   unanticipated    reduction in monetary growth does not occur until

 an interval of length T has lapsed after the announcement, the behaviour

 of c and i in Figure 1 follows the path                      —   —
                                                         E2 T E2
                                                        —


 When   the   "news"   breaks there is a jump appreciation of the real exchange
 rate to          .    This places the system on that unique unstable trajectory,
 drawn with reference to        the initial equilibrium, which will cause it to

 arrive on the unique convergent path SS'          through E2 after an interval
of   duration T .        In   the absence of further "news" no other discrete

 jumps in e and c occur, reflecting the assumption that the behaviour of

risk—neutral speculators will eliminate anticipated future jumps in e

as these would be associated with infinite anticipated rates of capital

gain or loss.


        c) The medium term financial strategy

        The medium term financial strategy (MTFS) of the Thatcher government

had as its centrepiece an announced sequence of 4 annual one point reductions

in the target range of monetary growth.          Approximating the range by its

central value, the response of the system to the unanticipated and immediate

introduction of the MTFS can be depicted as in Figure 2.                If there

were only a single unanticipated one point reduction in the rate of

monetary growth, c would jump immediately to                on S1S1 -      If   the

entire 4 point reduction in Dm were to be implemented immediately, the

system would jump to              on S4S4

The actual effect is intermediate between these two extremes.                    The

initial jump in c takes it beyond E12 to a point such as T

because the magnitude of the initial jump in c is a function of the

announced future reductions in monetary growth.                  Under rational

expectations the system must follow a path which will, without future

jumps in competitiveness, put it on S4S4 when the fourth and final

year of the MTFS dawns .            We   assume that no further reductions in

monetary growth are planned after the fourth year.                  If a non-inflationary

rate of monetary growth is the long-term target and if the MTFS is

likely to be extended to achieve this purpose, a further 5 or 6 years of

successive one percentage point reductions in Dm should be added to the

pictu'e of Figure 2.             The initial jump in c would be correspondingly

greater.        All this assumes of course that the inflationary mechanism,

and more specifically the degree of nominal inertia in the level of p

remains unchanged, regardless of how far in advance monetary growth

reductions are announced and irrespective of the degree of belief attached

to these announcements.            The four year MTFS leads in Figure 2 to

immediate loss of competitiveness, which places the system at T                     below

E12 .    After     this there is a sequence of connected one—year-long paths

(T - T      ,   T - T    ,   T   - T )   which will place the system on the convergent
 o      1        1   2       2      3

divergent trajectory, drawn with reference to the long-run equilibrium E.

because during the th year the system is "driven" by the values of the

forcing variables for that year.

     d) An unanticipated increase in indirect taxes

     To model the important monetary aspects of the Conservative government's

fiscal policy, we consider a fiscally-neutral increase in the rate of indirect

taxation,      0 .   There is assumed to be no direct effect on aggregate demand

because the increase in indirect taxes is matched by a reduction in direct

taxes.      The price equation "at factor cost" is assumed unaffected by the

reduction in direct taxes.         To justify this assumption for the wage

component of factor costs, one could plausibly postulate a labour supply schedule

that is perfectly inelastic with respect to the after—tax real wage.                   The

long—run effect of an increase in 0 is an increase in          2.. =   m —    p     by the

same amount as the increase in 0 .-"           With the path of m exogerxus,
prices net of indirect tax decline so that market prices follow their

previous path and m -    p   — 0    is unchanged in the steady state.          The

dynamic behaviour of the economy is described in Figure 3 .              It    is

qualitatively the same as that following a reduction in Dm .                 The exchange

rate jump—appreciates and output declines.         Figure 3 also describes the

consequences of an unanticipated immediate            increase in rd .       The

abolition of the corset, which we model (crudely) as an increase in

rd ,    is   estimated to have increased money demand by about 4%.


        e) An unanticipated increase in the level of the money stock

       An unanticipated and immediately implemented once-and-for-all

increase in m does not alter the long—run equilibrium real money

stock or level of competitiveness.          With p predetermined, an increase

in m is an increase in L .          The behaviour of the economy when subjected

to such a shock is described in Figure 4.            The initial and final

equilibrium are both at E1 .         The initial real money stock is           =             —
                                                                                    m1               p1

                                                                                                 -
                                                                                                      p1
     > in1 .    The real exchange rate jump-depreciates to E12 to place the
m2

system on the convergent saddlepath SS' through E1 .             Output expands and
the nominal interest rate falls on impact.            Note the difference between an

increase in m and an increase in Dm.                Both are expansionary in the




                                                                 SI

short—run, but while an increase in Din raises the nominal interest rate,
an increase in in lowers it.          Neither policy action affects long-run

competitiveness, but while a once-and-fcr-all increase in the level of the

nominal money stock leaves long—run real balances unchanged, an increase

in the rate of growth of the nominal money stock will, by raising inflation

and the nominal interest rate, reduce the long—run stock of real money

balances.


        Comparing Figure 4 with Figures 1 and 3 suggests a way of avoiding

the excess capacity and the loss of competitiveness associated with policies

to reduce the rate of inflation by reducing the rate of monetary growth and

with switches from direct to indirect taxation.        Consider an initial

equilibrium at E1 in Figure 5.          An unanticipated immediate reduction

in Dm (or increase in 0 or rd) would, by itself, move the economy to

E12 ,   with     real exchange rate appreciation and excess capacity resulting

during the transition to the new long—run equilibrium E2 .         The reason

for this costly disequilibrium adjustment is stickiness of the real money

supply.     This is the result of the combination of price level stickiness,

    an assumed feature of the private economy, and stickiness in the level of

    the   nominal   money stock, the result of a deliberate policy choice.    It is

    easy in the present model to calculate the increase in the level of the

    nominal money stock that would immediately achieve the required long—run

    increase in real balances without any need for the price level path to be

    adjusted downward.      Without a "jump" in the level of the nominal money

    stock the price equation Dp = 4y + D+in       tells us that the only way of

    lowering p relative to            is through excess capacity.   The required

                                 in



    nominal money stock jump is simply R2 —              By itself, an increase

    in in   by that amount would move the system to E2 .        A combindation

    of a reduction in Din (or an increase in 0 or in rd) and an increase

    in in   of   the right magnitude will immediately and without transitional

    loss of competitiveness and output, place the economy at E2 .         The jump

    appreciation associated with the reduction in the rate of monetary growth,

    the increase in indirect taxation or the increased competitiveness of the

   barking system, and the jump depreciation associated with the increase in

    the level of the money stock cancel each other out exactly.        It can be

   argued that the government's decision not to try to recoup the large

   overshoot during the second half of 1980 of the £M3 target amounts to an

    (involuntary) in-jump of the kind advocated here.      Whatever the motivation,

    it has prevented a further massive deflationary jolt to an economy already

   going through the worst recession since the 1930's.



3. Real Exchange Rate Overshooting and the Wage—price Process

          A crucial component of all models exhibiting disequilibrium overshooting

   of the real exchange rate is the wage-price process.        The price equation

   used in the paper so far, as in many others (e.g. Buiter and Miller [1981],

   Dornbusch [1976]) has a number of weaknesses.        It is important to perform
                                          — 16 -


 a "sensitivity analysis" of the specification of this equation in order to

 establish the robustness of the overshooting proposition.


        a) A direct effect of the exchange rate on the domestic price level

        Even if domestic wage costs are sticky in nominal terms, so that the

 money wage rate, w , can be treated as predetermined, the domestic price

 level might in an open economy still be capable of making discrete jumps

 at a point in time.             This will be the case if the domestic currency price

of internationally traded goods is a function of the exchange rate.

A convenient way of representing this notion is to express the domestic

price level, p , as a weighted average of the sticky domestic money wage

and the domestic currency value of an appropriate (trade—weighted) index

of                           *                                                 *
      world prices, p .            Making the small country assumption that p is
                                               *
given and choosing units such that p = 0              we have:


(8)     p     ciw + (l—a)e                    0 a     1   .




Equation (3) is then replaced by:

'(9) Dwy+ir

For the time being we still assume that


(4)     Ir=D+m


With a < 1        ,   the   domestic price level is no longer predetermined.   The

jump appreciation of the nominal (and real) exchange rate in response to

e.g. an unanticipated teduction in the rate of monetary growth will have

the immediate effect of lowering the price level.             However, as long as

a > 0   ,   the   earlier analysis is not affected qualitatively.      We redefine

our state variables as follows:
                                             — 17 —



(lOa)       £=m-w

(lob) c=e-w

As before, 9 is predetermined (except when m jumps) and c is a

jump variable.         The state space representation of the model given in

equations (1), (2), (8), (9), (4) and (5) is:



            DZ                                  ct(XcS—y(l—ct))

                                                                                                         U

It is easily seen that (7) is the special case of (11) with                              ct =   1

A necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a unique saddle-point

equilibrium is cLy(A4-k) -            A <   0   ,   which again has the interpretation that,

at a given level of competitiveness, an increase in aggregate demand shifts

the Is curve to the right.                The single convergent path is again upward-

sloping and the real exchange rate overshooting results of Section 2

carry over to the more plausible model under consideration here.                                    The main

change from the previous analysis with c = 1                      ,   is   that the exchange rate

appreciation consequent upon restrictive monetary policy actions (or increases

in U or rd) now has an immediate beneficial effect on the price level

although as long as           >   0   ,   a given percentage appreciation of e will

be associated with a smaller percentage reduction in p
                                     —18-

     The special case c.         0 represents the "law of one price" for all

goods or instantaneous purchasing power parity (PP.P.).         Although few

propositions in economics have been rejected more convincingly by the data

than P.P.P. (Kravis and Lipsey [1978], Frenkel [1981], Isard [1977]) it is

mentioned briefly for completeness.        With the domestic price level moving

perfectly in line with the exchange rate, the wage equation (9) which still

incorporates stickiness in the level of the money wage, ceases to be

relevant to the rest of the model.         The relative price of domestic and

foreign goods is constant.         Real output is a function of the exogenous

real interest rate.       Unless we impose the requirement that steady—state real

wages are constant, output need not be at its full employment level.

Alternatively we could add an equation making output a (decreasing) function

of the real wage.       As this model has little to recommend it, we shall not

pursue it any further here.


         b) Money wage flexibility and real wage flexibility

                We now consider the case where both the money wage and the

  real wage are perfectly flexible, and output is always at its equilibrium

  or capacity value,       0.    We can view this as the case where the core rate

  of wage inflation, ii      ,   equals the expected (and actual) rate of wage
  inflation, i.e.

  (4')     1T     Dw




  The model of equations (1), (2), (8), (9), (4) and (5) has the following

  very simple state—space representation:

With both e and w freely flexible, neither of the two state variables

9.   and c is predetermined.                A unique convergent solution trajectory

exists because there are now two unstable characteristic roots (A1 and y).

The system is also recursive, with Dc independent of                           2.   and also of the

policy instruments 1Dm ,

in   the foreign real interest rate r + T) will affect the dynamics and

steady state behaviour of c.


       The diagrammatic representation of the system is given in Figure 6.

Without loss of generality we assume that the D2. = 0 locus is downward-

sloping.        Consider an unexpected, immediately—implemented reduction in Dm.

The initial equilibrium is at E1 ,               the new equilibrium at E2 .                Ibte   that

these equilibria are completely unstable.                      Since the cut in the monetary

       with no change in C .              Monetary disinflation is costless.               If we

consider a previously unanticipated future reduction in 1Dm , £                           will jump

to an intermediate position like E12 between                          and E2 at the moment

the future policy change is announced.                 After that it moves gradually in

a straight line from                 to E2 where the system arrives at the moment

that 1Dm is actually reduced.                 Again there is no effect on competitiveness

in the short run or in the long run.

shock such as an increase in r + T , analysed in Figure 7.            The steady—

position such as E12 after which it proceeds gradually to E2 where

of the real exchange rate is an equilibrium phenomenon, taking place at

a constant level of output.   There is never any effect on competitiveness

of monetary shocks.

       c) Money wage flexibility and real wage rigidity

       Some recent work on wage and price behaviour can be interpreted as

combining the assumption of perfectly flexible money wages with the

assumption of sluggish adjustment in the real wage.             The latter is treated

as predetermined because of (generally unspecified) transactions and

adjustment costs.


       Consider e.g. the following specification for       ii




(4")     ii   = Dp — ri(w—p)           nO

Equation (4") ,      in   combination with (9) yields


(14)    Dw=y+Dp—n(w-p)

or


(14') D(w—p) = $y           fl(w—p)

       Equation (14) can be viewed as a rational expectations version of the
       kind of equation proposed by Sargan [1980].                            It is also very close to

       an equation found in Minford [1980] although his equation incorporates

       nominal stickiness.              The state—space representation of the model with

       nominal flexibility and real stickiness is given in equation (15) below:

              Note that real wage rigidity implies real exchange rate rigidity, as

       w -    p   = (ct—1)c.       With a flexible money wage, Z now is a jump variable.

       The roles of £ and c as predetermined and jump variables is the exact

       reverse of what it is in the model with sticky money wages (and flexible

       real wages) of Section 2. The two characteristic roots of equation (15)
                                           +
       are A1 and —                                    .     The sign of the second root -_                 the one

       governing the behaviour of C —-depends on the sign of l-ct(1+y4).                                     This

       has the following interpretation.                     Add an exogenous demand shock f to

       the IS equation (2) .            This yields y            -   y(r—Dp) + tS(e-p) +       f   .        It   is

       readily checked that

and

The IS curve can therefore be written as

                                                                 (l-c)

For 0 .< c < 1    ,    l-c(1+y4)   must be positive if an exogenous increase in

demand is to raise output at a given level of competitiveness.                   We shall

make this assumption.        It implies that the root governing c is negative.

Note that with equation (14') governing the behaviour of the real wage,

there is no automatic tendency for the level of output to converge to its

capacity level 0 .          In long—run equilibrium we have (setting D(w-p) =               0),

(17)    y =     (w-p) =            ac


The system is still dichotomized, and the behaviour of c ,                 w-p   ,   y   and

r-Dp is independent of monetary shocks, but even if we start at full

employment, real shocks will not necessarily be followed by a return to full

employment.      Only if r (— the coefficient on the lagged real wage in the

wage equation) is zero will the system tend to full employment.                      This can

be shown as follows.         In long-run equilibrium the IS equation is

                   *
 (18)   y =   - y(r    +T) + c + f


Combining (17) and (18) gives

        Apart from the absence of an automatic return to full employment the

behaviour of the flexible money wage—sticky real wage model is qualitatively

the same when n = 0               and when r >       0   .    The response to an unanticipated

reduction     in Din    is shown in Figure 8.

        It is interesting to see that happens to the wage equation (14') when

the exchange rate has no effect on the price level, i.e. when a = 1

In that case the price equation (8) bccomes


(20a) p=w

while the wage equation reduces to


(20b)     4y = ri(w-p)


Equations (20a,b) imply that y = 0                    at each instant.               The model now is

in many ways the same as the model with money wage and real wage flexibility

discussed in Section 3b and summarized in equation (13).                                The link between

the real wage and the real exchange rate, given by w—p =                              (a-1)c   in the

general model, disappears.              Even though the real wage is still predetermined

(and indeed remains constant throughout at 0 ),                      the      real exchange rate

again becomes a jump variable.                  Because w still is a jump variable,

2.   also stays that way.           The state-space representation of this version of

the model is given in (21)

    The response of this system to nominal and real shocks is qualitative

similar to that described in Section 3b and Figures 6 and 7.


    d) Rational expectations in the labour market with money wage stickiness

    Without changing the equation for the core rate of inflation (4'') and the

associated wage equation (14) of the previous section, a single change of

assumption concerning the behaviour of the money wage destroys the classical

policy implications of that model.       The crucial change in assumption is to

rule out discrete jumps in w ,    that   is to require w to be a continuous

function of time .   The exchange rate, however, is still free to make discrete

jumps at a point in time.    This change in assumption does not rule out a

rational expectations interpretation of (14).         This is particularly

obvious if we assume that r =    0.   The behaviour of this rational expectations

model of the labour market is, however, very different from the classical

behaviour of the models of Sections 3b and 3c.        Instead it resembles the

behaviour of the sticky money wage model of Section 2 and 3a.       Monetary

shocks lead to real exchange rate overshooting and departures of actual from

                     ite that this kind of behaviour is ruled out when        ci.   =1
capacity output.

This "closed economy" representation means that rational expectations

automatically rule out departures of output from capacity      output.' With

the assumed asymmetry in the behaviour of c and w , and with a direct

effect of e on p , monetaryshocks will alter the real wage and the real

exchange rate and cause departures from full employment.


     With the sticky money wage interpretation of equation (14),       9.    and c

again assume the roles of Section 2.       9.   is predetermined while c (via e

can jump in response to "news".


     The response of the system to an unanaticipated reduction in Dm is

sketched in Figure 10..

     If the reduction in Dm takes place immediately c       jump appreciates

to E2 . After      that it moves gradually to E2 along     S'S'.   From

equation (l6d) we see that this jump-appreciation of c     will be assoáiated

with a fall in output.    An anticipated future reduction in Dm will be

associated with a smaller immediate jump-appreciation of    c when the news
                                            — 29 —



arrives, to    E1j2 say.     This jump places c and                      on the divergent path,

driven by the values of the forcing variables determining E1 that will

put it on the convergent path through E2 (S'S') when the cut in Dm

is actually implemented.        An equal reduction in Dm at a more distant

future time will again be associated with a smaller initial jump-appreciation

of c (to E123 say) after which c and 9 follow the unstable trajectory

(drawn with reference to               )    that       will put it on S'S' when Din is

actually cut.         There always wil be a finite initial jump in C when the

news of a future reduction in Dm arrives, except in the limiting case when

the announced monetary growth reduction is infinitely far in the future.

One implication is that if a monetary deceleration is planned, the loss of

output and competitiveness is smaller the further in advance the proposed

policy action is announced.

Assume the system starts in long-run equilibrium at t = 0                      .   The

net cummulative loss of output p-" following a monetary deceleration is

         0


c(°°)
        is the steady—state real exchange rate which is the same in the initial

and the final long-run equilibrium.                     c(co) -   c(O) is therefore just the

initial jump in the real exchange rate.                     The cummulative loss of output

is minimized by minimizing the initial jump in c .                         This is achieved, for

a given proposed reduction in Dm by announcing the reduction as early

as possible.

       The assumption made so far, that w(t) is a continuous function of

time can be derived from two more basic assumptions.                   The first is that

w(t) cannot jump instantaneously in response to new information.                        In

principle this would still permit discrete jumps in w(t) at some

t >    t0   ,   where   t
                         0
                               is the instant at which new information becomes available.

The second        assumption is an arbitrage condition for the labour market,

which asserts that efficient speculative behaviour in the labour market

eliminates all profit opportunities associated with anticipated future

jumps in w .            This   assumption is analogous to the arbitrage condition

we have used to rule out anticipated future jumps in e                   ,   although   its

application to the labour market is rather less convincing than its use

in th foreign exchange market.


       e) Gradual adjustment of core inflation with occasional jumps

       The final specification of the equation for the core rate of inflation

that we shall consider is given in equation (4")


(4")         DTT = (Dp + DO — it)                       >0


This   adaptive process for it        does   not rule out discrete jumps in it

although        it is consistent with our assumption that the level of the money

wage is predetermined.             Equation (4") defines     ii   as   a backward—looking

weighted average of past rates of inflation with exponentially declining

weights

ir(t)   =
                    e_t_(Dps+D0s))ds

Because ir(t) is backward-looking it will be associated with a stable

                             It is, however, not predetermined.                           ir(t) depends also on

we    come to consider the                         specification of the boundary conditions of this

The jump in                 ir       is         times the sum of the jumps in p and 0

Rewriting (24) in terms of the state variables we get


 (24')           ir(t)      -     ir(t)    =

If    there are no level jumps in m this becomes

4.   The Real Exchange Rate and the Output Cost of Monetary Disinflation in
     a Model with sluggish "Core" Inflation

          In this Section we solve the model of equations (25) and (26) for the

     time paths of selected variables, using a particular set of "plausible"

     parameter values.   The numerical example is designed to focus on the role

     of the real and nominal exchange rate in monetary disinflation.   Two

     common channels of the monetary transmission mechanism are intentionally

     closed off.   Thus "core" inflation in the lalxur market is backward looking

     (although     will jump i.f.f. e jumps) and in addition, it is assumed

     that aggregate demand is interest inelastic: the IS curve is vertical.

     The real exchange rate continues to function as an effective channel of

     monetary policy, which is successful in bringing down steady-state inflation.

     We refer to this as policy A.


          We examine the mechanism through which inflation is reduced and calculate

     the costs in terms of lost output, incurred in the process.   We also examine

     an alternative policy, referred to asP0l]CYE, which reduces the long run

     rate of inflation by the same extent without varying the real exchange rate,

     but following the same path of output.   We note that these policies differ

     in their effects on the price level, even in the long run.    In the short run,

     the recession induced by an overvalued exchange rate will show a sharper fall

     in the rate of inflation than the recession of equal magnitude induced by the

     alternative policy that keeps the real exchange rate constant.    In the former

     case, there will also be an immediate fall in the price level, which is

     absent in the latter.   Since the long-run real exchange rate is independent

     of the rate of monetary growth, the initial jump decline in c = e - w     under

     policyA will be followed by a gradual increase in e - w   back to its initial

     level.   On balance, during the adjustment process, De exceeds Dw

     While e - w is unchanged in the long-run, the new steady state paths of

     both e and w under       A lie below the initial steady state paths and are
                                     — 35 —



also   lower relative to the path of the nominal money stock, since the lower

steady state rate of inflation is associated with a higher stock of real money

balances.      It is possible (but not necessary) for e to overshoot its new

steady state path) In that case De will not only exceed Dw on

balance during the adjustment process, it will also on balance exceed the

new, lower, rate of monetary growth.           (See Buiter and Miller [1981]).       The

alternative policy has the same real long—run equilibrium, including the same

stock of real money balances but its long—run price level path lies           ahovu t1e

price   level path of pOliCYA.       Its endogenously determined long-run nominal

money stock path also lies above the exogenously determined nominal money

stock path of poiicyA.


        We noted that under      A on balance after the initial jump appreciation,

De > Dw     while with the alternative policy of model B, De         Dw   .   This   does

notmean that De will typically be larger with policy A than with B
because the levels of the new steady state paths of e and w are lower in
 the   former than in the latter.

                                     another
        We also briefly consider /    policy   designed to attain the same reduction

in the rate of inflation as            A, but without any loss of output.        This

policy involves a cut in indirect taxes and (in general) a change in the level

of the nominal stock of money.



        As long as w is predetermined, the output cost of achieving a given

 reduction in the steady state rate of inflation (defined as the cumulative

 net amount of excess capacity) is entirely independent of the exchange rate.

 While it may be possible to bring forward the anti—inflationary gains, it is

 not possible to reduce the net output cost of bringing down inflation by

 engineering an early appreciation of the real exchange rate.

        dy =   ct   dc =
                           }dc      1.1 dp


so output will change by roughly the change in the rate of monetary growth.


        The rate of wage settlements will jump on impact as a result of

both the shift in          it    and of the recession as follows:


        d(Dw) =     dy   + dir =
                                   (c   + (l_a)) dc =         0.3   dTl




        The long run equilibrium

        In a system which is super..neutral, one would not expect a change in

monetary growth to affect the equilibrium real interest rate or the real

exchange rate, though nominal interest rates will reflect the monetary slow-

down.      By setting the left hand side of equation (27) at zero and differentiating

with respect to i, we can            confirm   that a change in u has no long run effect on c,

but changes           it one—for—one.        As the equilibrium nominal rate of interest

will    also   move in line with p, the impact on real balances in the long run

is   -Xciii



        The dynamic behaviour of the system



                                                                           in
        The dynamic behaviour of the variables in the system is summarised

Table 1.         In the first column of panel (a) are shown the "starting values"
                                                               deviations from their

new equilibrium values after a one point slowdown                   in monetary growth at

t =   0.           (All variables are scaled by 100 so a one point slowdown in monetary

growth will appear as djl =                -1.0).     The second column shows D2, Dir, Dc at

       These startirvalUeS are chosen so as to place the system on the two

dimensional stable manifold, on which the stable path of 2, iT, and c can be

described by


       x(t) =                        wt + B2sin wt) = BePtcos(wt - c)
                        ePt(B1cos

where the values for B1 , B2                  ,   Band c are calculated from the initial

conditions in the first two columns.


       The same parameters, calculated in the same manner, are shown for

                   Dc       and Dp in the second panel of Table 1.        These variables
y , Dw         ,



are also measured as deviations from their new equilibrium values.                       For


output, y               ,    this   is zero, by construction, but for wage and price inflation

(Dp and Dw) the new steady state will correspond to the new rate of monetary

growth (ii).                 For convenience, in what follows, we will assume that the newly

chosen rate of monetary growth is zero, so that there is no inflation in

the new equilibrium.


       A check on the calculations contained in the table, and some indication

of how the policy works, is obtained by integrating the paths shown there

 for Dw and Dp .                     The formula!I which gives the required integral is

The discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that the price level shows

an instantaneous discrete fall at time zero, which is not picked up in

the integration.   The fall will be simply (l-ct)dc , where      dc measures

the initial impact of the monetary policy for competitiveness.       The

initial loss of competitiveness is — 2.864 (see the first entry in the

third row of the table), arid 1—ct is 0.25, which provides a figure of

-0.7156 for the initial fall in the price level.        Together with the integral

reported above, this gives a total of —2.0 for the long run effect on the

price level.   Thus the real wage is unchanged in the long run, as one would

expect from a model which is "super neutral".       (The 2% fall in the price

level is required to increase real balances to satisfy the higher demand for

liquidity at the lower nominal interest prevailing when prices are stable).


     The cyclical path towards this long run value is sketched in Figure 11

    In the top panel of Figure 11,     by choice of units,both the price level

and the money stock can be represented by the same line, CB, until the time

t0 of the monetary slowdown.       The money stock levels off at point B, and

the price level jumps down (because of the jump-appreciatLon of e) and then

rises for a while as shown by the path labelled AA.

and the rate of price inflation (TA) are shown.       It is evident from the fact

that the initial rate is only a little above zero that this policy has a

prompt effect upon inflation.      This effect is due to two factors; the

immediate fall in core inflation (by about 4 from 1.0 to 0.6422, see T.able

1, column 1, row 2) and the recession in output (of just over 1.0, see

Table 1, column 1, row 4).

     This   rapid fall in inflation might lead one to be optimistic about

the costs of eliminating inflation as measured by the size and duration

of the recession.BUtif we measure the output costs of checking inflation

simply by the unweighted integral of y (which means that some of the

recession is cancelled out by subsequent boom as output cycles towards

equilibrium) the following expression for the cumulative net loss of output

can be obtained:

    Jy(t)dt =


    With    i-p =   -1.0   and   = .25    ,   the   cumulative net output cost

required to bring down the steady—state inflation rate by 1 percentage point is

four "point years" loss of output)-'



    Our model          ignores possible benefits from bringing down inflation

slowly due to non-linearitieS in the Phillips curve which might cause two

years with 5% excess capacity to have a stronger counterinflationarY effect

than 1 year with 10% excess capacity.          The evidence on this is, however,

by no means clear.


     We now consider alternative policies which specifically avoid any

fluctuations in competitiveness.      We see how they compare with what we have

just seen for the policy A                           in terms of the speed with which

inflation is reduced and the cost in terms of lost output.




     Alternative policie.s

     In order to see how much the initial loss of competitiveness contributes

to the speed with which inflation is reduced and to cutting the cost of

reducing inflation we consider alternative policies which keep competitiveness

constant at its long-run equilibrium value throughout.            If competitiveness
                                           — 43 —


is   thus kept constant and c = e — w = o             ,   the   price level and the wage

rate will move together, as can be seen from equation (8).                   As a consequence

the inflation process in the model reduces to the familiar augmented

Phillips curve commonly used to charactarize closed economies.                    We get



(J) Dp=4y+r

(4 UI)   Dir = (Dp—ir)


The stabilization of the real exchange rate precludes both the discrete

adjustment to the core rate of inflation ir ,                which was a feature of the

previous             policy, as well as any discrete jumps in the price level.

Both ir     and   p are predetermined.              Given the initial level of core

inflation ir(o) =        = 1.0   ,   the   initial value of the price level p(o)

and a path for real output, equations (28) and (4") will by themselves

generate the entire path to be followed by the price level.                    Note that,

by construction, money has become a complete "side-show".                    Two of the

transmission mechanisms, the real balance effect and an interest rate effect

in the goods market, have been ruled out from the start.                    Now that the real

exchange rate is also kept constant, there is no feedback from money on real

output.      Since the model has the standard homogeneity properties, it will

of course still be true that in the long run the rate of inflation equals

the rate of growth of the money supply.                   As will become clear, however,

the truism that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon"

should in the current example be turned around: money here is an inflation

phenomenon.


         The first alternative policy (CalkdB) takes the path of output to be

precisely the same as that generated by the monetary contraction just described

with policy A.This can be achieved e.g. by adding a fiscal instrument g to

the IS curve so that
                                                      —44 —


(29)       y =     ctc      +    g                    > o


       With c kept constant at 0 , we can duplicatepOlicyA'S real output

path by making rjg follow the exact path of                           óczc   under A.       The real

exchange rate could e.g. be stabilized by adopting the exchange rate

management rule that De = Dw                      .     This      then implies of course that De = Dp.

With the exchange rate thus managed, the nominal money stock is endogenously

determined.            When De =           Dw   = Dp, the nominal interest rate is given by

r=r    *
           + De =          r*    + Dp .      The LM equation (1) then becomes

                                  *                           *
(30)       m   =   p   -        X(r   +Dp) + ky = p -       Ar + (k—A4)y —    Xii



With p and                 ri    predetermined and y determined by                  (29) with c = o
equation (30) determines the nominal money stock.                              Other ways of stabilizing

the real exchange rate such as a variable tax on capital inflows (subsidy

on outflows) can be thought of.                             In the present example the inflation generated

by equations (2C), (4") and (29) (with c = o) is the dog wagging the money

supply tail through equation (30).                            Given equations (2) and (4") it will of cours'

always be the case that the path of inflation is determined once a path for output

is specified.                    If other transmission mechanisms of monetary policy, such as

an interest rate effect and a real balance effect in the output market, are

included in the model, however, it is less straightforward (although possible)

to specify an output path without reference to the money supply.


       The results of the alternative policy for inflation are shown in the

bottom row of Table 1.   Inflation starts at a significantly higher level
                  policy
than before with!    A because the starting value for core inflation ii is

now p = 1.0            .          The path followed by inflation has the same damping factor

p and frequency w as the output path but the amplitude is smaller and

the inflation cycle leads the output cycle. The rate of inflation will, as
                                       - 45   —




before,   be reduced to zero at a net cost of 4 point-years of output.              The

price level towards which the system converges under the alternative policy

is, however, higher than the long-run price level of policyA.                This can he

seen from the coefficients in Table 1.             While JA(t)dt = -2         for

Model A, as we have already discussed, integrating the path for inflation under

Model B yields a smaller fall, as follows

                    —
    0
        JDPB(t)dt
                         0.4633

                                      2           =•    2




         These results are illustrated in Figure 11 where the path followed

 by the price level and the rate of inflation under policj B are plotted

 alongside those already described for polacyA.                     In the top panel the

 price level under the alternative policy proceeds from point B without any

 "jump" along a path which cycles around a steady state level which is of

 a point below the line BF showing the level of the money stock, which is

  of a point above the corresponding steady state shown               for2olicyA.

        In the bottom panel the rate of inflation is shown starting at point

 and cycling towards zero along the pathBB .                  Thus inflation starts at

a higher level under the alternative policy than under the floating exchange

rate case.      The determination of those "starting values" and the subsequent

comparison of inflation can be seen from Figure 12                                   There,

labelled SRPCB ,    is   the "9hort-run Phillips curve" which determines initial

inflation under policy B where                    p .       This value of it determines

the intercept of SRPCB , and the value of y(o) determines the value of

inflation shown as DPB(o).            From this point inflation and output cycle

towards the origin as shown by the path labelled BB.

The path of Dp is therefore sinusoidil

                     4
the   figure of -          as the long-run difference in the price level resulting

from   the two policies.

       What is apparent from the above is that the policy of fighting inflation

by cycles in output and in the real exchange rate (with an initial recession

associated with an overvalued exchange rate) does not lead to any change in

long run inflation, compared to the same output cycle and a stable real

exchange rate.           The loss of competitiveness does however reduce inflation

more quickly early on, as shown in Figure l; the early lead established

by this policy over the alternative is whittled away later when competitiveness

is regained in the boom, but we are left with the conclusions that inflation

Figure l.   Inflation under the two policies



     The fiuctuatiorof the real exchange rate can therefore be seen to have

effects on inflation not unlike those attributed to temporary incomes policies

by those who argue that the latter hold down inflation in the short run,

but have no effect on the inflation rate in the long run.       If that is true,

then a temporary rout of incomes policy would change only the long run price

level without changing the long run growth of prices, which is what we have

found to be characteristic of the policy of permitting the real exchange rate

to vary.

 "Efficient     disinflationary policies".

     Once we permit changes in the indirect tax rate, 0 , we have a way of

costlessly reducing inflation.                            Consider the money demand function and

 the wage equation:


     m - p -        0   =        - Ar   +   ky
     Ow = cy +          IT




                                                                                      -
Given a reduction in the rate of monetary growth by dii = ii                              ,   we can

 easily calculate the change in 0 required to jump                         it   to   its new long-run

equilibrium value,                 ji   .    Holding p constant, equation (24) shows that
dir(t) =   d0(t)        .         The required change in 8 is therefore given by


     dO =      1dn           =


 From the money market equilibrium condition we obtain that, since the long

 run interest rate changes in line with p


      d(m-p--O) =            - Adr      =   - Adp

Holding p constant this yields


     din   -   dO   = - Adp


or

     din =     (—A +


Therefore a change in the rate of monetary growth by dp                          ,   accompanied
by a change in indirect taxes by 1dp and a change in the level of the

nominal money stock of C—                    A   +   dp    will immediately move the system to the

new steady—state equilibrium with the lower rate of inflation.                                Output
and the real exchange rate are unaffected.                       With our choice of parameter

values(A=2 and =.5),dO=2dp and din=O.
                               — 49 —



          The mechanism permitting the required reduction in inflation to be

brought about without loss of output is the following. First, the cut in

0 (in general together with the change in m) permits the long—run change in

the stock of real money balances to be brought about immediately without

any need for a jump in nominal prices, including the exchange rate.         Second,

the cut in 0 achieves the immediate change in the core rate of inflation

to its new long-run value.     The use of indirect taxes to facilitate the

process of bringing down inflation has been advocated frequently by Okun

[1978].



           Alternatively, incomes policy can be used to jump ir.      If incomes

policy can be identified with a once—and-for-all reduction in i,         without

any other "overwriting" of the behavioural equations of the model, then it

will lower the cost of disinflation.           If monetary licy changes or announce-

ments themselves directly change        iT,   as is the case in the model of Section

2., then disinflationary monetary policies will also be "efficient" in the

sense we are using that term here.



5.    Conclusion



      After a summary of various approaches to the modelling of the inflationary

process in an open economy with a floating exchange rate, we have studied the

way in which a monetary slowdown might be expected to work in an economy where

core inflation is sluggish, and adjusts to actual inflation with a significant

 mean lag.
                                    —5 0 -

        Despite such sluggishness we found that core inflation can be reduced
 quickly by jumps in the price level induced by jumps in the exchange rate.

 In the simple model used to focus on this particular aspect of the monetary

transmission mechanism we found that, even without any direct real balance and

real interest rate effects on aggregate demand, a monetary slowdown might

nevertheless cut inflation promptly via its impact on the nominal and the

real exchange rate.       Indeed our numerical example has the property that the

inflation    rate responds immediately by almost the full extent of the monetary
slowdown       Thus reduction of inflation follows, in our   example, from the
effects    of announced monetary policy on the exchange rate.    The appreciation

of the exchange rate cuts the inflation rate in two ways, first by reducing

core inflation and second by cutting the level of output.       Both of these

effects involve sharp changes in the real exchange rate.


        Since the model is "super-neutral", however, such changes in the real

exchange rate and in real output must ultimately be reversed.       Pursuit of a

constant growth rate of money generates a cyclical convergence for these

variables.      The net output costs associated with a steady state reduction in

inflation are found to be given by a simple formula, dp/ where dji

shows  the change in steady state inflation, 4 is the slope of the short—run
Phillips curve and     measures the speed of adjustment of core inflation.
 Thus for      =    =     the net output loss associated with reducing monetary

growth and steady state inflation by 1% is 4 point years of GNP.


        For comparison we considered an alternative where the real exchange was

held constant but output was constrained to follow the same path as before.

Such an alternative, whose net output loss is of course identical, was found

to achieve the same effect on steady state inflation, but the path taken by

inflation was different.      The prompt anti—inflation success due to the loss

of competitiveness being absent, inflation starts fro a higher level under

this alternative.       The early lead achieved by the policy of "overvaluing"
                                           —      —




the currency is never entirely lost, so that the long run price level              is

lower than is true for the alternative policy.


          In a super-neutral model, with core inflation modelled in the way we

have, it turns out that any path for output which exibits a cumrnulativc 4
point—year loss of output will (if       ¼) reduce steady state inflation

by 1%, irrespective of the path taken by the real exchange rate (provided

it starts and finishes at the same level).                Thus the freedom to vary the

r(al exchange        rate in order   to   reduce inflation does not succeed   in reducing

the    output     costs of changing steady state inflation; it does however        change
the time path of inflation, relative to other policies which exhibit the same

output path.


          While the numerical model makes no claim to being a realistic model of

the U.K., we would point out that the sort of output costs associated with

reductions in medium term inflation in Treasury evidence to the Treasury

Committee suggested a figure of 4 point years of output for each 1 point off

medium term inflation.          A more detailed analysis of simulations on an

earlier version of the Treasury model, when the slope of the Phillips curve

was flatter and the mean lag of core inflation longer, showed even higher

costs (see Miller [1979])


          In considering tiefficientil disinflationary policies, we noted that a cut

in indirect taxes could reduce the output costs of curing inflation by

securing an immediate          jump reduction in the price index at market prices and

in the core rate of inflation.                 In our model a reduction in the rate of growth

of money by dp accompanied by a cut in indirect taxes of                   di will

immediately and costlessly achieve a reduction in steady state inflation of

dp    .     (In   general a change in the level of the money stock will also be

required).
                                 — 52 —


     In   the U.K., a one point cut in VAT is reckoned to cut the rate of

indirect taxation by half a point.    A 4 point reduction in VAT would

therefore avoid the four point year of output loss otherwise associated

with a point reduction in monetary growth.    The present administration's

decision to raise VAT by 8 points early in their term of office, at the

same time that a programme of successive reductions in monetary growth was

announced, would in our model increase the cost of bringing down inflation.

In the short run however, the adverse consequences of the VAT increase on

the price level are countered by the appreciation of the exchange rate.


     Those who argue that incomes policies can secure a step reduction in

core inflation, would of course advocate their use as a way of cutting the

output costs of reducing inflation (see, for example, Tobin [1977)).       We

have not examined this case in detail in this paper.    We have however,

considered the possibility that announced monetary policy could immediately

and directly reduce core inflation in just such a fashion.     If announced

monetary policy has this sort of direct expectational effect, then it will

save output costs, just as a similarly successful incomes policy would.

If, however, monetary targets only secure immediate effects on core inflation

by a sudden loss of competitiveness, this will not constitute an "efficient"

way of reducing inflation.

        Appendix:


    Derivation of the initial conditions



    First, we note that when aggregate demand is completely interest inelastic

        (i.e. y = 0)            ,   the term in (25) and (26) becomes —A and, omitting 0, i
    and rd equatiOn (25) simplifies to:



           D9                                     —1                                                              Dm]

(Al)      Dir       =       —(1—a)A1         —(1—cL)         (1-ct)X1(1—a +          kc)   +              ir + o
          Dc                    —A                —1           X1(1— + k5c)            —                  c


where the determinant of the coefficient matrix A in (27) is given by

   =                    >   0       and the characteristic equations                f(p) =   0   ,   where    p

is a root, is




          p3 -          (X1 - ) (1-a)         +   (kX1   -   ) aJp2

                -       [(x - )              + (l-a)X1]p         -   Q   =   0.



          As can be seen from the characteristic equation, f(0) <                                    0   as

Q > 0      ,    but f(p) tends to infinity when p tends to infinity; hence
there exists one positive root, which is not surprising given the presence

of the forward looking variable, c .                                              The other two roots must

be stable for the model to make sense.                            (For most plausible

values of the parameters these other roots will turn out to be complex, as

we see below).


          The row eigenvector v' associated with any root must satisfy the

condition that v' [p1-A] =                     ' where               denotes the zero vector.                 Normalizing

the eigenvector appropriately, this means

where the last column is no given in cull for simplicity.                                              This implies

            To ensure stability, the path to be followed by the system must not

depend on the eigenvector associated with the positive (unstable) root.

Avinash Dixit [1980] has shown that for a previously
                                                                                           unanticipated,immediately

implemented shock this can be achieved by ensuring that the product of this

eigenvector with the initial values of the variables (measured as deviations

from the new long—run equilibrium) equals zero, i.e.


            v (2(o) —           i)    +      V2 (h(o)   —    h)   —   (c(o)   —   c) = 0

       Ii    and      C       are    the new long—run equilibrium values of £                      ,    h   and c
and V1         and        v2 are elements associated with the unstable root.


        Let Dm                 .     The terms measuring iitia1 disequilibrium following an

unanticipated change in i , denoted                                   dp ,   can be evaluated as follows:


            1(o) —         = Adii

(PA)        rr(o) —        = ir(o) — , where                          denotes the new value of i.

            c(o)   — C =       dc,        the jump      in   competitiveness.
                                    —55 —


From equation (24" ) we know that


     dir =   (l—ct)dc

and so the initial disequilibrium in 11          becomes


     i(o) —ir=(l—c)dc—dP

Hence equation (29) can be rewritten as


        Ad                dc   -        -   dc = 0
                                   d)

1/   For simplicity, the term DO in equation (2) has been ignored.

     We consider it in Section 4



2/   The equilibrium is a saddlepoint if the state matrix has one stable

     arid one unstable characteristic root.                      A necessary and sufficient condition

     for this is that the determinant of the state matrix be negative.



3/   It is easily checked that r declines less than Dp

     Note also that we can use (2) and (5) to obtain:
                                  *
     y = - yDc   + <SC -    y(r       +T).     Immediately following the unanticipated

     reduction in     Dxii ,   c        is lower and Dc becomes positive.                             This

     causes y to fall.



4/ We assume that the policy announcement was unanticipated and credible

     --   perhaps a doubtful assumption.



5/   The Thatcher government's 8% increase in VAT has beep estimated to be

     equivalent to a 4 percentage point increase in the average rate of

     indirect taxation, 0



6/ A more general approach is the following.                         Let                      be the price of

     domestically produced goods.                       It is a weighted average of unit labour
                                                                                                       *1
     costs, w , and unit imported intermediate input costs: e + p                                            ,   i.e.
                                               *1
     (12')       =         + (ll) (e+p                       0           1       .    The domestic price level

     or c.p.i. is a weighted average of the price of domestically producea
                                                                                     *F
     goods and the price of imported final goods e + p                                    ,    i.e.

     is lost by using the simpler formulation in (12).                                    An alternative

     interpretation in terms of traded and untraded goods is also possible.

7/   These issues are discussed for the fixed exchange rate case in
     Buiter [1978, 19791.


8/ Since the adjustment path of output is monotonic in all our examples,
    y does not change sign during the transition.   The net output loss
    therefore also equals the gross output loss.

9/ The D term is again omitted.                 It will be discussed in Section 4.

10/ The slope of this path equals the new rate of monetary growth.

12/ As a measure of economic waste, I           y(t)dt   is only really useful if

     y(t) does not change sign on the interval lo, c). Zero net output
     loss is consistent with periods of prolonged and large excess supply
     followed by periods of prolonged and large excess demand. A more
     appropriate index of economic waste might be

                    I   y(t)   Idt ,    which penalizes all deviations of output
                t
     from capacit output in the same way.
