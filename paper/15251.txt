                                             ABSTRACT

We develop a simple model featuring search frictions and a nondegenerate labor supply decision along
the extensive margin. The model is a standard version of the neoclassical growth model with indivisible
labor with idiosyncratic shocks and frictions characterized by employment loss and employment opportunity
arrival shocks. We argue that it is able to account for the key features of observed labor market flows
for reasonable parameter values. Persistent idiosyncratic productivity shocks play a key role in allowing
the model to match the persistence of the employment and out of the labor force states found in individual
labor market histories.

1    Introduction

Analyses of aggregate employment are dominated by two frameworks. One is the frictionless

version of the standard growth model with an endogenous labor leisure choice, as in Kyd-

land and Prescott (1982), but modified as in Hansen (1985) to include the indivisible labor

formulation of Rogerson (1988). The other is the class of matching models a la Diamond-

Mortensen-Pissarides, as described in Pissarides (2000). Loosely speaking, the former can

be viewed as a model of labor force participation, while the latter can be viewed as a model

of unemployment conditional on a participation rate. Cross country data reveal that there

are significant diﬀerences across countries along all three margins: employment, unemploy-

ment and non-participation. Moreover, it seems reasonable to think that participation rates,

employment rates and unemployment rates are all jointly determined, in the sense that any

policy that aﬀects one margin is likely to aﬀect both of the other two margins. This suggests

that a comprehensive model of the aggregate labor market should explicitly incorporate all

three labor market states.

    This paper takes a first step toward the development of a unified model of participation,

unemployment and employment. The model can be seen as a hybrid of the two classes of

models discussed above, extended to allow for idiosyncratic shocks. Abstracting from labor

market frictions, an individual in our model solves a textbook problem of labor supply in a

dynamic setting with indivisible labor. That is, the individual must decide what fraction of

his or her life to spend in employment, and how to arrange the timing of employment relative


                                              2
to the idiosyncratic shocks that they experience. A key property of our calibration is that

the solution for lifetime labor supply is interior, i.e., that individuals do not want to work in

every period of life. An individual in our model also faces frictions just like a worker in the

textbook Pissarides model: when employed the individual faces a probability of becoming

non-employed, and when not employed, the individual finds an employment opportunity only

with some probability.

   A natural criterion for assessing the empirical reasonableness of such a hybrid model of

employment, unemployment and participation is that it be able to account for both the dis-

tribution of workers across the three labor market states and the flows of workers between

them. Although our model is purposefully simplified, we show that empirically reasonable

versions of it satisfy this criterion. Persistent idiosyncratic shocks play a critical role in al-

lowing the model to match the patterns found in the worker flow data. Without idiosyncratic

shocks the model is the same as that studied in Krusell et al (2008), and we show that such

a model is unable to match the flows of workers across states. In addition to capturing the

key features of labor market flows, the model also does a reasonable job of accounting for

several other regularities in the data, such as the distribution of months worked during the

year, and the reasons for separations from employment.

   The idiosyncratic shocks in our analysis are intended to capture all of the important shocks

faced by individuals that influence the static return to working versus not working. Likely

candidates for these shocks are shocks to market opportunities, health shocks, preference



                                                3
shocks, and family shocks. An important finding of our analysis is that the model is able

to account for the labor market flows as long as the shock process is fairly persistent and

the shocks are sizeable. Both of these seem to be very reasonable assumptions about the

nature of idiosyncratic shocks. In this sense we conclude that our model does a good job of

accounting for the flows even though we do not have good measures of some of the underlying

shocks that our model is seeking to capture.

   While we view our benchmark model as being successful in accounting for the key features

of aggregate labor market flows, there are discrepancies between the model and the data

along some dimensions. Given the simplicity of our model, we believe it presents a natural

framework to be used to assess the role of various extensions in resolving these discrepancies.

   Our analysis is related to many papers in the literature. In addition to the work cited

above, our paper is similar to Merz (1995), Andolfatto (1996), Alvarez and Veracierto (1999),

Gomes et al (2001) and Veracierto (2008) in that these papers all introduce frictions into

an otherwise standard version of the growth model. Ljungqvist and Sargent (2006, 2008)

consider models that feature indivisible labor and frictions. Merz, Andolfatto, Gomes et al

and Ljungqvist and Sargent do not consider unemployment and nonparticipation as distinct

states. The other two papers do consider all three labor market states but their model only

puts restrictions on the stocks of workers in the three states and does not pin down labor

market flows. A further key distinction between our model and all of these analyses is that

these models all have the property that if frictions were removed, the employment rate would



                                               4
be equal to one, with labor supply adjustment occurring only along the intensive margin.

      Beginning with Burdett et al (1984), there are also several papers that have extended the

simple matching model to allow for nonparticipation.1 These models assume linear utility

and therefore implicitly impose assumptions on the income and substitution eﬀects that

govern labor supply that are not consistent with standard specifications of labor supply.

Additionally, they cannot address issues in which risk sharing plays a key role.

      Lastly, our work is related to a recent literature that studies labor supply in settings with

incomplete markets and idiosyncratic shocks, including papers by Domeij and Floden (2006),

Floden and Linde (2001), Chang and Kim (2006, 2007) and Pijoan-Mas (2006). None of these

papers allows for trading frictions. Similar to us, Meghir et al (2008) consider a model with

frictions and a nondegenerate labor supply decision. They consider a richer model of frictions

and income support programs, but their analysis is partial equilibrium and they address very

diﬀerent issues than we do.

      An outline of the paper follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section 3 describes the

calibration of the model and presents the implications of the benchmark calibrated model

for labor market flows. Section 4 considers an alternative calibration procedure and Section

5 examines sensitivity of the results to changes in the idiosyncratic shock process. Section 6

concludes.

                                                  5
2    Model

The economy is populated by a continuum of workers with total mass equal to one. All

workers have identical preferences over streams of consumption and time devoted to work

given by:
                                     ∞
                                     X
                                           β t [log(ct ) − αet ]
                                     t=0

where ct ≥ 0 is consumption in period t, et ∈ {0, 1} is time devoted to work in period t,

0 < β < 1 is the discount factor and α > 0 is the disutility of work. The restriction that et

is either zero or one reflects the assumption that labor is indivisible, so that all adjustment

occurs along the extensive margin. A key feature of the model is that workers are subject to

idiosyncratic shocks that aﬀect the relative payoﬀs to working or not working in a particular

period. In reality there are many shocks that serve this role: shocks to market opportunities,

shocks to home production opportunities, health shocks, family shocks, preference shocks,

etc... To maintain parsimony, we model the net eﬀect of all of these shocks as a single shock,

and represent it as a shock to market opportunities. In particular, we assume that workers are

subject to idiosyncratic shocks that aﬀect the quantity of labor services that they contribute

if working. We denote this value by s and assume that it follows an AR(1) stochastic process

in logs:

                                   log st+1 = ρ log st + εt+1


where 0 < ρ < 1 is the persistence parameter and the innovation εt is a mean zero normally

distributed random variable, with standard deviation σ ε . This process is the same for all

                                                  6
workers, but realizations are iid across workers. The reader should keep in mind that these

market opportunity shocks are standing in for the combined eﬀect of many shocks that aﬀect

the relative value of working versus not working. As a practical matter, we could have

alternatively assumed that the single shock aﬀects the disutility of working α instead of the

return to working.

       We formulate equilibrium recursively. In each period there are competitive markets for

output, capital services and labor services.2 In particular, as in Huggett (1993), there are

no insurance markets, so individuals will potentially accumulate assets to self-insure. In

what follows we will focus on steady state equilibria, so that factor prices will be constant.

We normalize the price of output to equal one in all periods, let r denote the rental price

for a unit of capital, and let w denote the rental price for a unit of labor services. If a

worker with productivity s chooses to work then he or she would contribute s units of labor

services and therefore earn ws in labor income. We assume that individuals are not allowed

to borrow, which is equivalent to assuming that capital holdings must be nonnegative. There

is a government that taxes labor income at constant rate τ and uses the proceeds to finance

a lump-sum transfer payment T subject to a period-by-period balanced budget constraint.

In steady state, the period budget equation for an individual with kt units of capital and

productivity st is given by:


                          ct + kt+1 = rkt + (1 − τ )wst et + (1 − δ)kt + T.
   2
   As in Lucas and Prescott (1974), we assume that frictions influence a worker’s access to the labor market.
But conditional on access, the market operates competitively.


                                                     7
   The production technology is described by a Cobb-Douglas aggregate production function:


                                        Yt = Ktθ L1−θ
                                                  t   .


Kt is aggregate input of capital services and Lt is aggregate input of labor services:

                                                  Z
                                     Kt =             kit di
                                                  Z
                                      Lt =            eit sit di.


Output can be used either as consumption or investment, and capital depreciates at rate δ.

We let Et represent aggregate employment:

                                                  Z
                                        Et =          eit di


and let St represent the average productivity of employed workers, i.e.,

                                              R
                                                  eit sit di
                                       St =                  .
                                                   Et

It follows that Lt = St Et .

   To capture frictions in the labor market, we assume that there are two islands, which

we refer to as the production island and the leisure island. At the end of period t − 1 an

individual is either on the production island or the leisure island, depending upon whether

they worked during the period. That is, as of the end of period t − 1, a worker who worked in

period t − 1 will be on the production island, and an individual who did not work in period

t − 1 will be on the leisure island. At the beginning of period t each individual will observe

the realizations of several shocks. First, each individual receives a new realization for the

                                                  8
value of their idiosyncratic productivity shock. Second, each individual on the production

island observes the realization of an iid separation shock: with probability σ the individual

is relocated to the leisure island. Third, each individual on the leisure island, including those

that have been relocated on account of the separation shock, observes the realization of an

iid employment opportunity shock: with probability λw an individual is relocated to the

production island. Loosely speaking, σ is the exogenous job separation rate, and λw is the

exogenous job arrival rate. After all of these shocks have been realized, each individual on

the production island decides whether to work and how much to consume. An individual

who is on the production island and chooses not to work will then be on the leisure island at

the end of period t and will therefore not have the opportunity to return to the production

island until receiving a favorable employment opportunity shock. An individual who is on

the leisure island after the realization of all of the shocks is not allowed to supply labor,

so his or her only choice is how much to consume. Note that this individual still has two

sources of income: income from renting out capital services and the transfer payment from

the government. This individual will be on the leisure island at the end of period t.

   A worker’s state consists of his or her location at the time that the labor supply decision

needs to be made, the level of asset holdings, and productivity. Let W (k, s) be the maximum

value for an individual who works given that they have productivity s and capital holdings

k, and let N (k, s) denote the maximum value for an individual who does not work given that




                                               9
he or she has productivity s and capital holdings k. Define V (k, s) by:


                                 V (k, s) = max{W (k, s), N (k, s)}.


The Bellman equations for W and N are given by:


      W (k, s) = max
                   0
                     {log(c) − α + βEs0 [(1 − σ + σλw )V (k0 , s0 ) + σ(1 − λw )N (k0 , s0 )]}
                  c,k




                          s.t. c + k 0 = rk + (1 − τ )ws + (1 − δ)k + T




                                           c ≥ 0, k 0 ≥ 0


and

               N (k, s) = max
                            0
                              {log(c) + βEs0 [λw V (k0 , s0 ) + (1 − λw )N (k0 , s0 )]}
                           c,k




                                  s.t. c + k0 = rk + (1 − δ)k + T




                                           c ≥ 0, k 0 ≥ 0.


Let μ(k, s, l) denote the measure of individuals over individual states after all of the idiosyn-

cratic shocks have been realized and before any decisions have been taken, where l indexes

location and can take on the two values 0 and 1, with l = 1 indicating the production island.

There are three decision rules: one for c, one for k 0 , and one for e (which can only take on

the values of 0 or 1).

                                                 10
2.1   Properties of Decision Rules


It is useful to discuss some features of the decision rules in order to gain some intuition

about the forces that shape individual choices in the steady state equilibrium. It is trivial to

show that the value functions are increasing in both assets and the level of the idiosyncratic

productivity shock. One can then show that the decision rules have some simple reservation

properties. Specifically, for a given level of assets, it turns out that the work decision for

an individual on the production island is characterized by a reservation rule in terms of the

idiosyncratic productivity: work if productivity is above some threshold s∗ (k). Similarly,

one can show that for a given productivity level, the work decision for an individual on the

production island is also characterized by a reservation rule in terms of assets: work if assets

are below some threshold k∗ (s). It also follows that s∗ (k) and k∗ (s) are both increasing

functions. The fact that s∗ (k) is increasing reflects the fact that higher assets lead to a

positive wealth eﬀect, eﬀectively lowering labor supply. The fact that k∗ (s) is increasing

reflects intertemporal substitution eﬀects of optimal labor supply: an individual wants to

work when productivity is high and enjoy leisure when productivity is low.


3     Accounting for Labor Market Flows

The model described in the previous section is a relatively simple extension of the standard

growth model that serves as the benchmark for many aggregate analyses. In this section we

assess the extent to which this extension can account for the salient features of labor market



                                              11
flows in addition to the standard aggregate observations. Given the simplicity of the model

there is no presumption that it can account for all the features found in the data. The issue of

interest here is to assess the extent to which it can capture the key features of the flows that

are found in the data, and isolate those dimensions, if any, along which the model cannot do

a good job of replicating the data.

3.1   Measurement of Flows


In this section we describe how we will connect our model with the data on labor market flows.

Our model oﬀers a very natural distinction among non-employed workers. In particular, there

are some non-employed workers who would like to work but do not have the opportunity, and

others who do not want to work even if presented with the opportunity. To us it seems natural

to label the first group as unemployed (U ) and the second group as non-participants (N ).

While this notion of unemployment is diﬀerent than that used by statistical agencies, data

gathered by the BLS does allow us to compute the counterpart to this notion of unemployment

in the data. That is, the BLS does ask people if they would like to work independently of

whether they engaged in active search in the previous four weeks. In what follows, we will

use this notion to compute the unemployment rate in the data. This leads to a larger pool

of individuals in the unemployment state than does the standard definition, which is based

largely on the individual’s level of search eﬀort. For the period 1994-2007, which is the

period for which consistent data is available, the standard unemployment rate for the US

averages 5.1%, whereas our expanded notion of unemployment averages 8.3%. Given that


                                              12
we provide a diﬀerent split of the non-employed into the unemployment and out of the labor

force states, we also need to correct the data on flows between the states. The appendix

details the procedure that we use to construct these flows. Table 1 shows the eﬀects of the

adjustment.

                 U      0.276   0.501   0.223         U     0.248   0.517   0.235
                 N      0.044   0.026   0.929         N     0.036   0.045   0.919

   The eﬀect of this adjustment is quite minor. As one would expect, there is a slight decline

in the flow rate from U to E, since we are expanding the size of U and including those who

in general transition into employment with lower probability. Note also that the alternative

notion of U has relatively little eﬀect on the flows between U and N ; in fact, these flows are

now somewhat larger.

   Given the fact that the flows for the two diﬀerent definitions are so similar, there is rel-

atively little need to think about which measure is preferable. Nonetheless, we think some

discussion about our choice of a non-standard split between unemployment and out of the

labor force is worthwhile. While our model oﬀers a sharp distinction between these two

groups, in reality the distinction is somewhat less clear. Standard practice among statistical

agencies is to use information on the extent of search eﬀort as the key criterion to divide

the non-employed between unemployment and not in the labor force. A recent literature has


                                                13
questioned whether the rules by which statistical agencies allocate individuals between these

three states is the most useful from the perspective of characterizing economic behavior.

Using data from Canada, Jones and Riddell (1999) showed that the active search criterion

used by many statistical agencies to determine the allocation of workers between the unem-

ployed state and the out of the labor force state is potentially misleading because it excludes

a group of workers (whom they call marginally attached) who say that they would like a

job but have not actively searched in the last four weeks. These workers do have somewhat

lower transition rates into employment than do active searchers, by about twenty-five per-

cent, though the job finding rates for the marginally attached workers are the same as those

of active searchers who report reading job ads or visiting a public employment oﬃce as their

sole method of active search. In contrast, the marginally attached workers have transition

rates into employment that are more than 4 times as high as the other non-participants. We

conclude from this that the marginally attached workers (i.e., passive searchers) are more

similar to unemployed workers than they are to nonparticipants. These same findings have

emerged when this analysis has been repeated for many other countries.3

       A related issue was noted much earlier by Clark and Summers (1979), who argued that

in many cases what the statistical agencies view as a series of short unemployment spells

punctuated by spells of nonparticipation are in fact better interpreted as a long spell of
   3
    For example, see Brandolini, Cipoline and Viviano (2006) for an analysis of several European countries,
Garrido and Toharia (2004) for Spain, Gray, Heath and Hunter (2005) for Australia and Marzano (2006) for
the United Kingdom.




                                                    14
unemployment where the individual’s reported search eﬀort varies over time.4 This may

occur, for example, when an individual has already applied to many jobs and is simply

awaiting responses. It may also reflect the fact that an individual is expecting an oﬀer from

earlier search activity and is therefore not currently engaged in active search, even though

he or she is actively pursuing particular employment opportunities.

      A final issue has to do with the cost of active search. The relatively new American

Time Use Survey that is conducted as part of the Current Population Survey reveals that

active searchers devote very little time to search, typically less than one hour per week. This

suggests that the cost of active search is best thought of as being quite small. If the cost

of active search is actually very small, and given the dynamic nature of search, the decision

of whether to engage in active search at a given point in time may not be very meaningful.

This would also suggest that allocating individuals to various states on the basis of active

search may not be prudent. Consistent with the evidence that the cost of active search is

very small, our model has not placed any emphasis on search costs and likewise our definition

of unemployment also does not stress search eﬀort.

      Having raised all of these issues, we note that there is an interpretation of our model that

would also fit with standard definitions of unemployment based on active search. Specifically,

if we assumed that the search eﬀort decision is a binary decision, and that the cost of search

is positive but arbitrarily small, then it would follow that all individuals who prefer working
  4
    Abowd and Zellner (1985) and Poterba and Summers (1986) have devised methods to purge the data of
truly spurious transitions between unemployment and not in the labor force.




                                                 15
to nonworking given their current state would engage in active search. In this sense one could

connect our model with the active search criterion used by the BLS and use the standard

measure of unemployment. However, because the flows are not very much aﬀected by the

definition of unemployment, this alternative way of connecting with the data has little impact

on the results of our analysis. Put somewhat diﬀerently, if one views the standard definition of

unemployment and our definition of unemployment as two extreme choices, with a continuum

of intermediate choices lying in between these two, the basic message is that this choice is not

very important for the issues that we address here. Nonetheless, in what follows we will base

our comparison on the adjusted numbers in Table 1 since we think those numbers represent

the most natural way to connect the model with the data.

3.2    Flows for Subgroups


Before proceeding to the calibration of the model we think it is of interest to look at labor

market flows for some subgroups in the population. We begin by looking at how labor market

flows diﬀer for men and women. If these flows were dramatically diﬀerent it might suggest

that our approach of using a model with single agent households to account for aggregate

flows is questionable. Table 2 presents the flows for men and women.5
   5
    In the interest of space we do not present the flows for standard definitions of U . Similar to the case of
the aggregate data, there is little diﬀerence between the adjusted and unadjusted for the subgroups as well.




                                                      16
                                             Table 2
                                    Flows For Men and Women
                             Men                                    Women

                            E         U       N                      E         U       N
                  E       0.961     0.022   0.017         E        0.959     0.021   0.020

   The table shows that most of the flows are very similar. The two exceptions seem to be

the flows from U to E and from U to N . Women experience much larger flows from U to N,

with a roughly similar decrease in the rate at which they flow from U to E. Conditional on

not moving into N , the flow rates from U to E are more similar, .349 for men and .297 for

women. We shall return to a discussion of U to N flows later in the paper, as this will prove

to be a dimension along which our model does not perform well.

   A second dimension of interest is age. The data that we presented above was for all

individuals aged 16 and older. One concern might be that the bulk of the action in terms of

labor market flows comes from the very young and the very old. Table 3 reports the flows

for individuals between the ages of 21 and 65.

   Eliminating the youngest and oldest workers does not appreciably change the nature of

the flows, neither at the aggregate level or disaggregated by gender. For future reference we

note again that the flows from U to N are decreased relative to the total population.

   Lastly, we consider an even narrower group, examining the flows for individuals aged 25

to 54. The results are in Table 4.



                                             Table 4

               E       U       N              E       U       N                 E       U       N
      E      0.978   0.017   0.006    E     0.966   0.017   0.017      E      0.972   0.017   0.011

   The patterns remain very similar to those in the earlier tables. In particular, we want

to emphasize that both the magnitude and qualitative properties of the flows seem to be

quite similar across the population, suggesting that abstracting from explicit modeling of

demographic factors such as age and gender seems a reasonable starting point.

3.3       Benchmark Calibration


Having described how we will measure flows across states in the data and the model, in this

section we consider the issue of how well this model can account for the data in Table 1.

The model has nine parameters that need to be assigned: preference parameters β and α,

production parameters θ and δ, idiosyncratic shock parameters ρ and σ e , frictional parameters

σ and λw , and the tax rate τ . The length of a period will matter for many of the parameter

                                              18
values. We will be interested in the behavior of worker flows between labor market states and

since this data is available at a monthly frequency, we set the length of a period equal to one

month. Because our model is a variation of the standard growth model, we can choose some

of these parameter values using the same procedure that is typically used to calibrate versions

of the growth model. Given that our model assumes incomplete markets and uncertainty, our

steady state cannot be represented analytically in the same fashion as the standard growth

model, and in particular one cannot isolate the connection between certain parameters and

target values. Nonetheless, it is still useful and intuitive to associate particular targets and

parameter values. Specifically, we set θ = .3 to target a capital share of .3, choose δ so

that the steady state ratio of investment to output is equal to .2, and choose the discount

factor β to target an annual real rate of return on capital equal to 4%. The other preference

parameter α, which captures the disutility of working, is set so that the steady state value

of employment is equal to .632. This is the value of the employment to population ratio for

the population aged 16 and older for the period 1994 − 2007.6

       The tax rate is set at τ = .30. Following the work of Mendoza et al (1994) there are

several papers which produce estimates of the average eﬀective tax rate on labor income

across countries. Examples include Prescott (2004) and McDaniel (2006). There are minor

variations in methods across these studies, which do produce some small diﬀerences in the

estimates, and the value .30 is chosen as representative of these estimates.7
   6
    We calibrate to values for the period 1994-2007 because this is the period for which we have consistent
measures of labor market flows for our definition of unemployment.
  7
    Note that Prescott (2004) makes an adjustment to the average labor tax rate to arrive at a marginal tax


                                                    19
    The remaining parameters are the two frictional parameters, λw and σ, and the two

parameters of the shock process, ρ and σ ε . Our basic goal is to assess the extent to which

there are values of these four parameters for which our relatively simple model can account

for the distribution of workers across the three labor market states and the flows of workers

between these states, and if so, to what extent these values seem reasonable. It is important

to recall that we want to think of our shock process as capturing a variety of diﬀerent types

of shocks that influence the relative value to working and not working, so that we do not

want to limit our attention to a single component of this process, such as wage shocks.

    One way to proceed would be to search over parameter vectors (λw ,σ,ρ,σ ε ) so as to

minimize the diﬀerence between a set of moments in the model and the data. It turns out

that there are many specifications that do similarly well at accounting for the data, and hence

we feel that it is more informative to proceed in a slightly diﬀerent manner. In particular,

we will calibrate the two frictions so as to match two targets in the data, and then ask how

the resulting labor market flows are aﬀected by diﬀerent specifications of the shock process.

    Note first that λw is a key parameter in generating unemployment in our model. Specifi-

cally, if λw = 1, then everyone always has the opportunity to work, and as a result there will

be no workers unemployed according to the definition that we are using. As λw is lowered

from one there will be more workers in the situation of wanting to work but not having the

opportunity. Motivated by this, we choose λw so that the steady state unemployment rate
rate that is roughly 40%. For purposes of computing the eﬀect of changes in taxes this adjustment plays no
role.




                                                   20
in our model (i.e., U/(E + U )) is equal to .083, which is the average value for our notion of

the unemployment rate in the US data for the period 1994 − 2007.

   Next consider σ. Intuitively, this parameter will play a large role in shaping the transitions

from employment to unemployment. The reason for this is that anyone who transitions from

employment to unemployment must have been hit with a separation shock, since otherwise

they would still have an employment opportunity and could therefore not end up both not

working and wanting to work. Although there is a strong relationship between the incidence

of separation shocks and transitions from E to U , they are not identical, for two diﬀerent

reasons. First, an individual may experience both a separation shock and a negative shock

to idiosyncratic productivity, and hence prefer not to work. Second, our timing convention

allows a worker that experiences a separation shock to also obtain a new employment oppor-

tunity in the same period, so that he or she would not show up as unemployed. Nonetheless,

there is still a close connection between the flow from E to U and the value of σ, so we will

use this flow to pin down the value of σ. For our benchmark case we target the flow rate

from employment to unemployment of .021, which is again the average value for this flow for

the period 1994 − 2007. Note that for the two reasons just mentioned, the value of σ will be

larger than this value.

   The above procedure describes how we set the values of all other parameters for given

choices of ρ and σ ε . By construction we will necessarily generate the same distribution of

workers across states as is found in the US data, since our procedure targets both E and U.



                                              21
What we seek to assess is the extent to which the model can capture the key features found

in the flow data, and if so whether the resulting values of ρ and σ ε seem to be empirically

reasonable. The main result of this exercise is that the flow data generated by the model are

quite similar for a very large set of values for ρ and σ ε . As we show below in more detail, the

results are quite similar as long as the shocks are relatively persistent, say with an annualized

persistence parameter at least equal to .5, and for a wide range of values of σ ε .

      In terms of describing the results it is useful to initially focus on one particular speci-

fication, even though there are other specifications that seem equally reasonable. For our

benchmark we choose values for ρ and σ ε so that if the annualized data were estimated by

an AR(1) it would have persistence parameter .92 and standard deviations of innovations

equal to .21.8 These values correspond to one set of estimates of idiosyncratic wage shocks

for prime-aged working males, as reported in Floden and Linde (2001).9 We emphasize again

that we do not consider wage shocks to be the only important source of shocks, and that in

addition we want to capture shocks that are relevant for all individuals, not simply prime

age employed males. Nonetheless, the available evidence suggests that other shocks, such as

health shocks, are also persistent, so we think a persistent shock process seems a reasonable

benchmark.

      Table 5 shows our calibrated parameter values for our benchmark model.

3.4      Properties of the Steady State


The only flow rate that we targeted in the calibration was the flow from E into U . Next we

examine the predictions of the calibrated model for the other flows as well. Table 6 shows

the flow rates from the data and from our calibrated model.


                                                Table 6

       Given that flows out of each state must sum to one, there are really six independent

values in the data. Our calibration procedure targeted the flow rate from E to U , leaving

five independent flows.10 Two key features of the data are the very high persistence for both

the E and N states. Our calibrated model not only generates a lot of persistence in these two

states, but also matches the corresponding values in the data very well. Persistence in the

unemployment state is much less than in the other two states. Our model also captures this

regularity, though the model generates slightly more persistence in this state than is found
  10
     Given that we target the shares of E, U and N in the data we do implicitly impose some additional
restrictions on the flows. But when we consider the case of no productivity shocks we will see that this by
itself does not generate a close match for the flows.




                                                        23
in the data. One simple metric to gauge the model’s ability to capture the persistence of

the three states is to compute expected spell durations for each state. Measured in months,

the duration of E, U , and N spells in the model are 18.7, 2.1 and 13.0 respectively. The

corresponding values in the (adjusted) data are given by 22.5, 2.0 and 14.3. These values are

all close.

    Given the high persistence of the E and N states and the fact that the model accounts

for these values quite well, it follows that the remaining flows out of E and N are also

necessarily quite close in the model and the data. The flows for which the discrepancies are

largest between the model and the data are the flows involving U : the model predicts that

the U to U flow is too large, that the U to N flow is too low and that the U to E flow is

too large. Several remarks are in order concerning these discrepancies. First, because we

calibrate the model to as to match the level of unemployment and the flow of workers into U

from E, there is a sense in which a large discrepancy in the U to N flow will necessarily do a

large discrepancy in the U to E flow. To see this, note that given a flow of workers entering

unemployment, the same number must leave unemployment in order to maintain the stock.

So if they are not leaving to N they must instead by leaving to E. From this we conclude

that the large discrepancy concerning flow out of U is really one dimensional in nature.

    An alternative measure of interest is the probability that a worker moves from U to E

conditional on not moving to N . In the data this value is .36, while in the model it is

.43. Although a discrepancy remains, the diﬀerence is much smaller than the discrepancy in



                                             24
flows from U to E. A second and related issue that is relevant for this comparison is that

discrepancies associated with flows out of the E and N states are necessarily magnified in

terms of consequences for flows out of the U state. The reason for this is that the stock of

workers in the U state is much less than in the other two states. In relative terms, the stock

of employed workers is more than ten times the stock of unemployed workers, and the stock

of nonparticipating workers is more than five times the stock of unemployed workers. To see

why this matters, note that the flow of workers leaving the employment state in the model is

about one percent too high relative to the data. Given that we target the stock of employed

workers, it follows that the flow into employment must also be higher in the model than in

the data. But a one percent discrepancy relative to the stock of employed workers is roughly

a ten percent discrepancy relative to the stock of unemployed workers.

       The relatively large flow between U and N in the data relative to the model can be

interpreted in many ways. First, empirical evidence suggests that this flow is dominated by

transitions that are reversed in the following period. Specifically, based on the analysis in

Jones and Riddell (2006), one finds that the transition rate from U to N at a five month

horizon is only a fraction of what would be predicted on the basis of the monthly numbers.11

This implies that these flows are transitory in nature. One possibility is that this reflects

survey response error, since those individuals who are not employed and are nearly indiﬀerent

between working and not working might be expected to have noisy answers to the question
  11
    The analysis of Jones and Riddell is based on Canadian data, but given that the patterns in the monthly
flow data are similar, there is good reason to think that their findings would also apply to US data.




                                                    25
of whether they would like to work. A second possibility is that there is a transitory shock

which induces a lot of high frequency transitions between the two states.

       A simple back of the envelope calculation is somewhat informative. Assume, for example,

that in each period, 15% of people in the U state misclassify themselves as being in N , and

simultaneously, the same number of workers in N misclassify themselves as being in U . If we

simply recompute the flows out of N and U using the flows as in Table 5 but weighting each

group using the appropriate weights for the fraction of each type in N and U , the results

are as follows. The flow from U to N increases to .26 and the flow from U to E decreases

to .351. The flow from N to U increases to .076 while the flow from N to E is eﬀectively

unchanged at .044. We conclude that this mechanism, whether driven by survey response

error or temporary shocks, can go quite far in reconciling some of the discrepancies between

the flows in Table 5 and those in the data. We do not pursue this issue further in this paper,

but note that to the extent that much of the discrepancy reflects transitions for individuals

near an indiﬀerence boundary, we suspect that it is not of first order importance.

       One final comment is that if one compares the flows in the benchmark model to those

reported earlier for males aged 21-65 or 25-54, the model flows are quite a bit closer, and

even a relatively small amount of survey response error makes them very similar.12

       One additional statistic implied by the flows that is of interest has to do with the nature

of flows into employment. As noted in the introduction, one of the objectives of the current
  12
    One qualification that should be noted concerning this comparison is that the distribution of workers across
states for men aged 21-65 or 25-54 is not the same as that for the total population, though the diﬀerences are
not so large.


                                                      26
paper is to develop a model in which transitions into employment from both U and N occur in

equilibrium as opposed to being all from either one or the other as in the standard frictionless

and frictional models. From this perspective it is of interest to compute the mass of workers

that move into E from each of the other two states. These volumes are given by multiplying

the mass of workers in the respective states by the corresponding flow rate into E. In the

data the mass of workers moving from U to E and from N to E are .014 and .011 respectively.

In the benchmark calibration displayed above these values are .023 and .011. It follows that

our benchmark has relatively too many of the workers that enter employment coming from

unemployment. This is related to the fact that the flow from U to E is somewhat too high in

the model relative to the data, an issue that we discuss more below. However, if we believe

that there is response error in how individuals classify themselves between U and N , then

some of the U to E flows in our model would presumably show up as N to E flows in the

data, which would also bring the model’s values closer to those in the data. In fact if we

were to do the same crude calculation as above, these values would be .020 and .013, which

is closer to those found in the data.

   To summarize, while our model with a single source of heterogeneity and constant frictions

across individuals does not perfectly replicate the flows found in the data, it does capture

many of the key features of the flows observed in the data, both qualitatively and quanti-

tatively. The one caveat concerns the flows of workers from U to N , which is concentrated

among certain subgroups of the population. We conclude that the benchmark calibration



                                              27
displayed above represents an empirically reasonable description of the relative importance

of standard labor supply considerations and frictions in the overall US economy.

3.5   Additional Statistics


While our emphasis in evaluating the performance of the model was on the flows as reported

in Table 1, there are many other statistics that are also of possible interest. In this section

we report on some of these additional statistics.

   The first statistic that we consider has to do with reasons for transitions out of em-

ployment. Specifically, in our model we can isolate three diﬀerent reasons for a worker to

transition out of employment. One is that the worker might receive a lower value of the

idiosyncratic shock and choose not to work. A second is that the worker receives a separa-

tion shock and does not simultaneously receive a new employment opportunity shock. And

third, it is possible that a worker does not receive any shocks but still chooses to transition

out of employment. This could result if the worker were to accumulate assets beyond the

reservation value k ∗ (s) defined earlier. As a practical matter it is possible that a worker

receives multiple shocks, thereby complicating this labelling process. We label the reasons

for leaving employment as follows. We first ask whether the worker has the opportunity to

work. If the answer is no, and the worker would have worked given the current realization

of s and their current assets, then we say that the reason for the transition of out E is a

separation shock. If the individual did have the opportunity to work, then we check whether

the individual would have worked this period if instead of their current realization of s they


                                              28
had the same value for s this period as last period; i.e., whether they would have worked if

there had been no change in the value of their productivity. If the answer to this is yes, then

we say that the reason for the transition out of employment is the productivity shock. The

residual is what we label ”other”. The results are shown in Table 7.

                                           Table 7
                               Reason for Transitions out of E

                                 .41        .47         .12

   Note that productivity shocks are the dominant source of transitions out of E. A related

statistic concerns reasons for the flow into unemployment. In our model there are two flows

into unemployment: one from employment and the other from not in the labor force. Those

that flow from employment into unemployment are necessarily individuals who were hit by

the σ shock. In this sense it is natural to label them as job losers. In steady state, 38% of

the new flows into unemployment represent job losers.

   Both of these statistics can be compared to measures in the data. Over the period 1994-

2008 the fraction of new flows into unemployment accounted for by job losers is around 49%,

so our model is a bit low on this measure. In the JOLTS data set, which covers 2000-2008,

38% of all separations are labelled as involuntary. Some care needs to be taken in comparing

this statistic to our model since we do not have any job to job flows in our model, and in

reality many voluntary separations are associated with job to job flows. Additionally, the

work of Davis et al (2008) shows that due to sampling issues, the JOLTS figures tend to

underestimate involuntary separations. Their revised numbers suggest that the fraction of

all separations that are involuntary is closer to 45%.

       Another statistic that we can look at is the distribution of months worked during a

particular year.13 Both in the data and in the model the transitions between states are not

iid over time; that is, there is substantial heterogeneity across workers in terms of expected

transition rates, and the persistence of these rates. Looking at how time spent employed

accumulates over the year is one way to assess the model’s ability to capture these more

complex aspects of the flow data. Figure 1 plots the distributions of weeks worked during

the year for both our model and the data.



       The data represent averages for the CPS over the period 1994-2008. While the data

has slightly more mass in the two tails, the model does a reasonable job of capturing the
  13
    In the data respondents report data on weeks worked during the previous year. We convert this to months
by rounding to the nearest integer number of months.



                                                    30
distribution found in the data. In the next section we will consider sensitivity to changes in

the idiosyncratic shock process. Some of the alternative processes that we consider produce

slightly more persistence in the E and N states, and yield an even closer match to the months

worked distribution.


4         An Alternative Calibration: Matching the U to E Flow

One of the properties of our benchmark calibration is that it generated too large of a flow

from U to E. We argued that this discrepancy was mitigated somewhat by dealing with the

U to N flow. Because the U to E flow seems central in many applications, we think it is

important to demonstrate that there is nothing inherent in our model that prevents us from

matching the U to E flow as well as the other flows (with the exception of the U to N flow).

To show this, in this section we adopt a diﬀerent calibration strategy in which we explicitly

target the U to E flow instead of the stock of workers in U . This would be consistent with

a view that many of the U to N flows are spurious transitions for individuals who should be

continuously classified as U .14

         In our benchmark calibration we chose the value of λw so as to target the level of unem-

ployment in the steady state, having argued that there was intuitively a close link between

the two. We begin by displaying the nature of this relationship. To do this we set λw to

an arbitrary value and then calibrate all of the remaining parameters in the same fashion as

above, except that we no longer match the steady state unemployment rate in the data. Note
    14
         More generally, we could also consider some mismeasurement of E, and so not match the employed stock.



                                                        31
that we continue to set the preference parameter α so that the steady state employment rate

does match the target value of .632 found in the data. Table 8 gives the results.

                                         Table 8
                       λw and the Steady State Unemployment Rate
                  λw = 1.0    λw = 0.6   λw = 0.436    λw = 0.4    λw = 0.2
                    .000        .056         .083         .090       .155

   In the extreme case in which λw = 1, any individual who wants to work at the going wage

rate can do so, and hence there are no individuals who would like to work but are unable,

implying that the unemployment rate is equal to 0. It is important to note that the elasticity

of U with respect to λw is quite large, in the sense that moving from our calibrated value of

.436 to a value of .2 leads to a more than 75% increase in unemployment, while increasing

λw to .6 leads to a drop of more than 25% in unemployment. It follows that our calibration

procedure pins down the value of λw quite precisely.

   As we noted earlier, our benchmark equilibrium leads to a flow rate from U to E of .41,

whereas in the data this flow is only .25. The equilibrium flow rate from U to E turns out to

be just slightly less than λw , so that in order to match the flow rate from the data one would

require λw = .26. But as Table 8 shows, this would lead to a steady state unemployment

rate equal somewhat above 10%. Table 9 shows the implications for flows for the λw = 0.4

and 0.2.

    The main message from this table is that one can target the flow rate from U to E rather

than the stock of people in U with relatively little eﬀect on the model’s ability to match the

flows out of the E and N states. These alternative calibrations continue to have the same

issue regarding U to N transitions.

    Changes in λw also influence the reasons for transitions out of employment. As explained

above, the greater the frictions the more individuals want to hold on to employment op-

portunities once they have them. As a result, separation shocks become more important in

accounting for transitions out of employment. Table 10 shows this.

5    Sensitivity: The Idiosyncratic Shock Process

The previous sections presented results for one particular specification of the idiosyncratic

shock process. An important question is to assess the extent to which the model’s implications

for worker flows are aﬀected by changes in the values for ρ and σ ε . Is it the case that the

                                                  33
model accounts for the flows only if these values lie in very narrow intervals, or do the results

look similar for a wide range of these values? This section addresses this question.

       As a first step it is instructive to note the importance of the idiosyncratic shocks. To

do this we consider a model that abstracts from the idiosyncratic shocks. In particular, we

shut down the idiosyncratic productivity shocks (ρ = 0, σ e = 0) in our benchmark model

and calibrate the model to the same targets. Table 11 shows the results. The parameters are

λw = 0.88, σ = 0.34, and α = 0.97.
                                                Table 11
                                         Flows Without s Shocks

                                                  E         U       N
                                        E       0.488     0.021   0.491
                                        U       0.880     0.120   0.000
                                        N       0.880     0.120   0.000

       Recall from Table 1 that two of the key features of the actual flow data are the high per-

sistence of the E and N states. Whereas the model with idiosyncratic productivity shocks

matched both of these flows very well, this example misses somewhat with regard to the

persistence in the E state, and by a huge margin with regard to persistence in the N state.15

Spell durations are now equal to 2.0, 1.1 and 1.0 months respectively for E, U , and N , versus

22.5, 2.0 and 14.3 in the data. The short duration of employment and non-participation

spells is striking. The model without idiosyncratic productivity shocks produces far too little

persistence at the individual level. Adding a persistent productivity shock adds a source of

persistence at the individual level and serves to produce a substantial quantitative improve-
  15
    Because the steady state employment rate is .632, the model must necessarily have a fair amount of
persistence in the employment state, in the sense that almost half of those employed this period must also be
employed next period.


                                                     34
ment in terms of the model’s ability to account for the salient features of the underlying flow

data.

       Having established that the presence of idiosyncratic shocks is important in matching the

flows observed in the data, we next examine how the values of the parameters characterizing

this shock process aﬀect the quantitative properties of the flows. Rather than presenting

flow tables for a wide range of specifications we have decided to simply report the extent of

persistence for each of the three states for diﬀerent combinations of ρ and σ ε .16 For ease of

interpretation we have again reported the annualized measures of these parameters. Table 12

displays the results when the persistence parameter ρ is varied. We note that for each value

of ρ the remaining parameters of the model are recalibrated so as to hit the same targets as

before. In particular, the two frictional parameters, σ and λw , are recalibrated in each case,

as is the disutility of work parameter α. This last parameter is particularly important, since

changes in the stochastic process for st holding all parameters constant will typically have a

large eﬀect on steady state employment.

  16
    There is a sense in which these statistics almost provide a complete picture of how well the model captures
the data. In particular, we know that there are only six indpendent values to start with, and one of these (the
E to U flow) is targeted in the calibration. And the U to N flow tends to be too low and relatively constant
across specifications.


                                                      35
   In terms of the persistence of the E and N states, we interpret the above results to imply

that as long as the shock process is moderately persistent, say with ρ at least .50, the model

does a reasonable job of capturing the persistence of these two states. A similar result holds

for the persistence of the U state, except that as ρ gets near to unity the persistence in this

state becomes quite large relative to the data.

   The last two rows report the mass of workers that flow into E from each of the two other

states in each period. They indicate that the flow of workers from N to E varies quite a lot

as the persistence varies, with particularly poor matches to the data for low values of ρ. As

ρ decreases the overall flow of workers into E increases, so the aspect of these final two rows

that is of greatest interest is the ratio of the two flows. Our reading of this table is that for

either very high or very low persistence the model has trouble matching the observed relative

importance of these two flows.

   Table 13 repeats this analysis by varying the value of σ ε .

   The table considers standard deviations that range from one-tenth to twice that used in

the benchmark case. The basic finding of this table is that the basic properties are quite

robust to changes in the standard deviation of the shocks. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the


                                               36
greater the standard deviation of the shocks, the greater is the persistence in the individual

states, though in the case of employment this eﬀect is somewhat small. We again remind the

reader that as we change σ ε we are recalibrating the other parameters (in particular α, λw

and σ) so as to match the same targets as before.


6    Conclusion

We have built a model that features search frictions and a nondegenerate labor supply decision

along the extensive margin. We argue that the steady state equilibrium of our model does

a reasonable job of matching labor market flows between the three labor force states of

employment, unemployment and out of the labor force as long as idiosyncratic shocks are

reasonably persistent. Persistent idiosyncratic shocks play a key role in allowing the model to

match the persistence of the employment and out of the labor force states found in individual

labor market histories. Available evidence suggests that the two prime sources of these

shocks—wage shocks and health status shocks—are both very persistent. It seems reasonable to

posit that family shocks associated with family size and caring for elderly family members are

also likely to be persistent. Whereas for some issues it may not be important to identify the

exact shocks that individuals face, for some issues this may be important. Understanding how

the model behaves in the presence of multiple shocks would also be of interest. Additionally,

it is of interest to consider extensions to our model that will address some of the discrepancies

between the flows in the data and those in the model. Examples might include allowing for

human capital accumulation and depreciation.

                                               37
   The fact that the model does a good job of matching worker flows as long as the process

is somewhat persistent leads us to believe that this very simple model serves as a reasonable

environment for addressing several issues. In Krusell et al (2009), we use this model to

evaluate the relative importance of frictions versus labor supply in the determination of

aggregate employment. This issue gets at a fundamental distinction between commonly used

versions of frictional and frictionless models, which each assume that only one of these factors

is important in determining aggregate employment.

   A second issue of interest is to carry out a more comprehensive analysis of tax and transfer

programs in order to address the debate between Prescott (2004) and Ljungqvist and Sargent

(2006, 2008) concerning the role of benefits. Specifically, Ljungqvist and Sargent argue that

once one takes into account the generosity of benefit systems in many European countries,

Prescott’s model implies implausibly large responses. But Ljungqvist and Sargent do not

distinguish between the unemployed and those out of the labor force, so implicitly assume

that all nonemployed individuals can receive unemployment benefits. In reality there is a

sharp distinction between the benefits that one has access to and prior labor market history.

Understanding the role of these provisions requires a model that can match the heterogeneity

in labor market histories that are found in the data. Our model is one such model.

   Third, it would be of interest to examine business cycle fluctuations in our model. Much of

the recent literature that emphasizes the role of frictions in understanding aggregate fluctua-

tions implicitly assumes that the labor supply channel is not operative. Standard frictionless



                                              38
models typically get relatively large responses to aggregate shocks because of the labor sup-

ply channel. We believe that our framework is the appropriate setting in which to assess the

relative importance of frictions and labor supply in accounting for aggregate fluctuations in

employment. Related, an important issue for models of aggregate labor market fluctuations

is to not only account for aggregate fluctuations in employment or unemployment, but also

for the patterns found in the data on the cyclical behavior of labor market flows.

   Appendix

   A.1 Data

   The Current Population Survey (CPS) reports the labor market status of the respondents

each month that allows the BLS to compute important labor market statistics like the unem-

ployment rate. In particular, in any given month a civilian can be in one of three labor force

states: employed (E), unemployed (U ), and not in the labor force (N ). The BLS definitions

for the three labor market states are as follows:


   • An individual is counted as employed if he or she did any work at all for pay or profit

     during the survey month. This includes part-time or temporary work as well as full-time

     year-round employment.


   • An individual is considered unemployed if he or she does not have a job, has actively

     looked for employment in the past 4 weeks and is currently available to work.


   • An individual is classified as not in the labor force if he or she is included in the labor

     force population universe (older than 16 years old, non-military, noninstitutionalized)

     but are neither employed nor unemployed.


   Households in the CPS are interviewed for several consecutive months. In a given month,

approximately 75 percent of the households were interviewed the previous month. This allows

the BLS to calculate month by month movements that dictate the changes in employment,

unemployment, and not in the labor force. The flows data calculated with the above defini-


                                              45
tions of the labor market states have recently been made publicly available by the BLS. (See

http : //www.bls.gov/cps/cpsf lows.htm)

   However, since our definition of unemployment in our model is not the same as that of

the BLS, we cannot use the publicly available labor flows data or any of the other estimates

calculated previously (e.g. Shimer (2007), Fujita and Ramey (2009)). We go back to the

CPS micro data and redefine the three labor market states consistent with our definition of

unemployment and calculate the flow rates. Our definition of E is the same as the BLS while

our definition of U is broader. The BLS asks people if they would like to work independently

of whether they engaged in active search in the previous four weeks. As a result there are

people who are not in the labor force but who actually report that they want a job. We

reclassify these people who are not in the labor force according to the BLS but report that

they want a job as unemployed. Consequently, the stock of unemployed increases and our

alternative unemployment rate becomes considerably higher than the oﬃcial unemployment

rate. For the period 1994-2007 the standard unemployment rate for the US averages 5.1%,

whereas our expanded notion of unemployment averages 8.3%.

   A.2 Calculation of the Flows

   Calculating the flows data has various problems that have been previously reported. (See

Frazis et al (2005), Fujita and Ramey (2009) and Shimer (2007)). The first problem is not

all the respondents stay in the sample for consecutive months; 75 percent are reinterviwed

according to the CPS sampling design. Moreover, many other respondents cannot be found



                                            46
in the consecutive month due to various reasons and are reported as missing. The failure

to match individuals in consecutive months is known as margin error and it causes biased

estimates of the flow rates as discussed by Abowd and Zellner (1985) and Fujita and Ramey

(2009).

       We apply the procedure that Fujita and Ramey (2009) used to calculate the flow rates

for the BLS definition of labor market states. To summarize


       • We create the raw flows data using the basic monthly CPS data from Unicon’s CPS

         Utilities starting (Jan. 1994- Dec. 2007).17


       • We retrieve the data by using part of Stata programs written by Robert Shimer.18 The

         Stata program matches individuals by household ID, age, sex and race.


       • We use the weights provided by the BLS and aggregate the data by the year, month

         and specific flow. We create the stock data by aggregating the monthly data by labor

         force status.


       • The flows data and the stock data are turned into flow ratios and stock ratios respec-

         tively, according to each monthly total.


       • To fill in for the missing observation we use the TRAMO (Time Series Regression with
  17
     BLS revised the monthly survey in the summer of 1995 and made it impossible to match household IDs
from June 1995 - August 1995. Thus, we have have 5 missing observations (3 observations unobservable due
to the revision, and 2 observation since we need at least 2 consecutive months worth of data to create a flows
series).

     TRAMO is a program developed by Gomez and Maravall. It fills in the missing data

     by interpolating the values and also detects additive and transitory outliers and smooths

     them out.


   • After the missing values are added, we run a nonlinear seemingly unrelated regression

     on the data series.


   • We then compute the annual averages of the margin adjusted data and finally the flow

     probabilities are calculated for each year.


   • We report the average flow rates for 1994-2007.
