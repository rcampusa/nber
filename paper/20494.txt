                                                 ABSTRACT

This paper explores the relationship between inflation and the existence of a publicly-traded, long-maturity,
nominal, domestic-currency bond market. Bond holders suffer from inflation and could be a potent
anti-inflationary force; I ask whether their presence is apparent empirically. I use a panel data approach,
examining the difference in inflation before and after the introduction of a bond market. My primary
focus is on countries with inflation targeting regimes, though I also examine countries with hard fixed
exchange rates and other monetary regimes. Inflation-targeting countries with a bond market experience
inflation approximately three to four percentage points lower than those without a bond market. This
effect is economically and statistically significant; it is also insensitive to a variety of estimation strategies,
including using political and fiscal instrumental variables. The existence of a bond market has little
effect on inflation in other monetary regimes, as do indexed or foreign-denominated bonds.

1. Introduction


          Debt is issued in many varieties: public and private, long- and short-maturity, nominal and

real, and so forth. Since most countries do not have a complete set of bond markets, new ones are

sometimes added. For instance, Poland introduced 10-year fixed rate government bonds in 1999;

Korea followed in 2000.1 In this paper, I ask the question: does the very existence of such bond

markets help keep inflation low and stable? One might imagine so, since bond vigilantes are a

potentially formidable political force who benefit from low stable inflation. My objective is to show

empirically for an important set of countries, those with inflation-targeting monetary regimes, the

presence of a long, nominal, local-currency bond market is indeed associated with inflation that is

approximately three-four percentage points lower.


          This finding seems intuitive. Financing government spending through seigniorage is usually

regressive. Money creation causes an inflation tax which is paid more by the poor, since they

disproportionately tend to hold money instead of assets that earn interest or are otherwise

protected from inflation. If a government begins to finance its deficit by issuing bonds to the rich

instead of money to the poor, it creates a powerful constituency for low inflation.2 The

consequences of inflation become more concentrated when they are borne by the (1%) rich rather

than the (99%) poor. The logic of collective action implies that the free-rider problem is reduced,

and anti-inflation measures are more likely to be pursued. Hence the public good of low inflation is

likely to be more prevalent when bonds are held, as they are owned by a relatively small powerful

interest group necessarily opposed to the redistributionary consequences of inflation. That is,

inflation is likely to be lower when the consequences of inflation tax are borne more by bond-

holders and less by money-holders. This effect can also operate without any growth in bonds

relative to money, if the nature of debt is transformed. Debt which is short-maturity, indexed,


                                                              1
and/or foreign-currency denominated does not provide the anti-inflationary bulwark/incentives of

long, nominal, local-currency bonds.


        The existence of a bond market could also have the opposite effect on inflation. Bond

markets may facilitate and thus increase the size of government debt. As long-maturity, nominal,

local-currency debt increases so do the immediate government benefits (i.e., bond-holder losses)

from unexpected inflation. Thus, one might expect countries with bond markets to have higher

inflation (at least temporarily); the linkage, if any, is theoretically ambiguous. Accordingly, I turn

now to an empirical investigation.




2. Empirical Strategy and Methodology


        My objective is to investigate whether the presence of a (long, nominal, local-currency) bond

market is correlated with inflation. There are obviously other determinants of inflation, especially in

the short run. As a consequence, my methodology is relatively low-frequency, relying on annual

data for a broad panel of countries. I begin with a conventional least-squares panel estimator:


                 πit = βBondit + γXit + {δi} + {εt} + ηit                                                    (1)


where πit is the inflation rate for country i at time t, Bondit is a binary variable (1 if country i has a

bond market at time t, 0 otherwise), {X} is a vector of controls linked to inflation via a set of nuisance

parameters γ, {δ} and {ε} are respectively country- and time-specific fixed effects, and η is a residual

to represent all other influences on inflation. I use five covariates (X) to control for other inflation

determinants unlikely to be affected by bond market participants: a) polity (a measure of

autocracy/democracy); b) income (the natural logarithm of real GDP per capita); c) size (log

population); d) openness (trade as a percentage of GDP); and e) demeaned real GDP growth.3 Since

I include comprehensive sets of both time- and country-specific fixed effects, this can be interpreted




                                                            2
as a difference-in-differences estimator.4 The coefficient of interest to me is β, the partial-

correlation between a bond market and inflation.


        Why and when do bond markets get created? It is natural to think that low and stable

inflation is a necessary prerequisite for the existence of a long, nominal, local-currency bond

market.5 Perhaps then the presence of a bond market cannot be treated as exogenous for inflation;

perhaps some common cause creates the conditions for both a fall in inflation and the creation of a

bond market?


        I try to handle this potential simultaneity problem in a few ways. First, I estimate (1) only for

inflation-targeting regimes (hereafter “IT”). These are regimes that have proven remarkably durable

and consistently deliver inflation that is low and stable compared with alternate regimes. Thus I

begin by restricting my attention to a set of countries that would already seem to have the necessary

conditions to establish a bond market. As a robustness check, I also consider other monetary

regimes such as hard fixed exchange rate regimes. Only IT regimes have made a policy commitment

to low inflation, thereby legitimizing anti-inflation forces such as the bond market. It is thus

reasonable to expect the effect (if any) of the bond market to be strongest for IT regimes. Hard fixed

exchange rate regimes may indirectly deliver low inflation or not; they are directly oriented only

towards the exchange rate.


        I also try two econometric strategies to deal with potential simultaneity. I use a variety of

different treatment estimators to estimate β. These may be useful to handle any selection issue,

since countries may choose in principle to create a bond market when the conditions are ripe,

because of an actual or expected fall in inflation. I also estimate (1) with instrumental variables,

relying on fiscal and political variables to construct instruments for bond market existence. I use the

size of government spending in the economy and the age of the country as my instrumental

variables, and show that my results are insensitive to reasonable alternatives. My IV results indicate




                                                    3
an economically and statistically significant effect of a bond market on inflation, just like those

estimated with least squares.




3. The Data Set


          I am interested in estimating β in equation (1), the effect of a bond market on inflation

during inflation targeting regimes, ceteris paribus. Besides data on inflation, controls, and the

monetary regime, I need information on whether or not a country has a bond market.


          I begin with the GFDatabase from Global Finance Data (hereafter “GFD”). GFDatabase is

advertised as providing data “spanning more than 200 global markets and extending coverage back

to 1265.”6 I employ GFD’s Fixed Income Database which is self-described as:


          “recorded electronically for current and historical markets covering 200 countries. GFD provides complete yield
          curve coverage with data on Interbank Rates, Swap Rates, Treasury-Bill Yields and Long-term Government Bond
          Yields. The Fixed Income Database enables you to follow changes in yields over different maturities going back
          several decades using yields at 3 months and 10 years, as well as maturities between and beyond these
                                                                                               7
          benchmarks. GFD provides data from both the public sector and the private sector.”




In practice, bonds data from GFD appear to be available for those traded with sufficient liquidity to

have prices quoted, typically over the counter, often after an initial auction. I rely initially on series

for government bonds, since the corporate analogues from GFD tend to follow government bonds in

time. I am interested in long, nominal, fixed-rate, local-currency bonds, since these are the most

affected by inflationary pressures. I begin with bonds which have a maturity of at least a decade.

Ten years is an international benchmark, a maturity well outside the horizon of current monetary

policy, and a horizon sufficiently long that bond prices are responsive to inflation. I also consider use

GFD to construct series on shorter maturity, indexed, and foreign-denominated bonds, as robustness

checks.




                                                            4
        I have checked GFD against other data sources, which typically seem less complete than

GFD. For instance GFD provides data for 819 bonds in its “Government Bond Yields” database from

some 105 countries; 70 of these countries have bonds with a maturity of at least a decade. By way

of contrast, Bloomberg and The Financial Times each provide data for twenty 10-year government

bond yields (all covered by GFD). In Table 17b of its Quarterly Review, the BIS provides data (dis-

aggregated by government, non-financial and financial corporations) for 28 countries with “long-

term” domestic bonds and notes; long-term is defined as a maturity of more than one year.

Investing.com provides a wide range of data; it covers 59 countries with 10-year (or greater)

government bonds. The most comprehensive alternative to GFD I have found is Dealogic, which

covers 73 countries (and territories, such as Jersey and Puerto Rico). I have checked the GFD data

for errors against all these sources (and others), and corrected some omissions.8


        Other data series are more straightforward. I extract series on inflation (both CPI and GDP)

from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. The WDI also supplies series for real (PPP-

adjusted) GDP per capita, population, and trade as a proportion of GDP.9 I use polity2, which ranges

from -10 (autocracy) to +10 (democracy), taken from the Polity IV project.10 Dates for the start of

inflation targeting regimes are taken from Rose (2013). For hard fix exchange rate regimes, I use the

Reinhart-Rogoff (2004) data set, updated through 2010 by the Ilzetzki, Reinhart and Rogoff.11


        In all, I have annual data for over 200 countries between 1970 and 2012 (with gaps).

However, most of my focus is on a subset of this data set, namely IT countries. These are tabulated

in Appendix Table A1, along with two dates: the start of inflation targeting, and the start of bond

markets. Four IT countries do not have bond markets during the sample (Albania, Ghana,

Guatemala, and Romania). The bond markets of a number of countries began long before IT

(including Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK).

Finally, a number of bond markets came into being after IT, including those for: Armenia, Brazil,




                                                   5
Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Iceland, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Peru, Romania, and

Turkey. This variation provides the identification required for my empirical approach.


        Table 1 provides some descriptive statistics on inflation across bond markets and monetary

regimes. Panel A shows that countries with bond markets experience lower and more stable

inflation than do countries without bond markets; both the mean and standard deviation of (either

measure of) inflation are lower by statistically significant amounts, as shown by the t/F tests to the

right of the table. Panel B examines only countries with bond markets, and shows that within this

class, inflation targeters experience inflation that is lower and more stable than hard fixers or other

countries. Panel C is an analogue for countries without bond markets; here average inflation is

similar for inflation targeters and hard fixers, though inflation is more stable with IT. Countries

without bond markets in the “sloppy centre” of monetary regimes which are neither inflation

targeters nor hard fixers, experience high and unstable inflation. The number of observations is also

recorded in Panels A-C; it is interesting to note that there are more IT countries with bond markets

than without, but countries using hard fixes or other monetary regimes usually do not have bond

markets. Finally, Panel D compares inflation moments within a given monetary regime, for countries

with and without bond markets. The top left t-test is significantly different from zero at all

conventional confidence levels, indicating that the average CPI inflation rate is higher for inflation

targeters without bond markets than for inflation targeters with bond markets. The F-test

immediately to the right is also large, indicating that inflation volatility is also higher for IT countries

without bond markets than IT countries with bond markets. Analogues for GDP inflation, hard fixers,

and the sloppy centre are tabulated in the remainder of the panel.


        Together, the panels of Table 1 paint a suggestive picture. IT countries with bond markets

seem to have lower and more stable inflation than those without bonds, while results for other

monetary regimes are less clear. This impression is bolstered by the evidence in Figure 1, which

provide graphical evidence for inflation targeters with and without bond markets. In the pair of


                                                      6
histograms at the left of the figure, I plot CPI inflation for IT countries with (below) and without

(above) bond markets. The histograms give the impression that inflation is typically lower for

inflation targeters with bond markets. The same view emerges from the analogous histograms for

GDP inflation in the middle column. The top-right chart graphs the quantiles of CPI inflation for

inflation targeters with bond markets (on the y-axis) against inflation quantiles for those without

bond markets (on the x-axis).12 A diagonal line is provided for reference; if inflation were similarly

distributed across inflation targeters with and without bond markets, the data would be plotted

along the diagonal. In fact, the data are below the diagonal; IT countries without bond markets have

systematically higher inflation than those with bonds. The quantile plot for GDP inflation in the

lower-right delivers the same message.


        Figure 2 provides a different take. This provides a pair of event studies (one for each

measure of inflation) that characterize inflation around the creation of bond markets, again

restricting attention to IT countries. I show average inflation starting three years before bond

market creation (at the extreme left) and continuing until three years afterward (at the extreme

right); a confidence interval is provided by the empirical (5%, 95%) quantiles. This exercise is

limited, since there are only 14 cases where inflation targeters introduced a bond market during my

sample. Still, the introduction of a long bond market seems associated with lower inflation.




4. Results


        My benchmark results for (1) are recorded in Panel A of Table 2. This presents estimates of

β from (1), along with robust standard errors (clustered by country). IT countries with a bond

market experience CPI inflation that is 2.9% lower than those without bond markets, holding a

variety of other features constant. The robust t-ratio is -2.9, significantly different from zero at the

1% significance level. The estimate for GDP inflation is over four percentage points, again



                                                    7
economically and statistically large. That is, the null hypothesis that the bond market is not

associated with lower inflation, is grossly inconsistent with the data. Rather, inflation targeting

countries have inflation that is three to four percentage points lower when a (long nominal local-

currency) bond market exists. The same is not true of different monetary regimes, as can be seen in

Panel B; while countries with bond markets seem to have higher inflation, the coefficients are

imprecisely estimated for both hard fixers and countries in the sloppy centre.


Sensitivity Analysis


        Most of Table 2 is sensitivity analysis intended to show that the default estimate in Panel A is

not a fluke that can be easily dismissed. Panel C shows that the key (β) coefficients are robust to

changes in the precise data sample. I successively drop: a) early/late observations; b) observations

for poor/rich countries (annual real GDP per capita less than $10k/greater than $40k); c)

observations for small/large countries (population <10 million/> 100 million); and d) outlier

observations (those with residuals greater than 2.5 standard deviations from zero). While standard

errors typically rise as observations are dropped from the sample, the point estimates of β remain

reasonably stable and significant in both economic and statistical senses.


        Panel D shows that the precise econometric technique does not seem to matter much. I

successively: a) replace robust with conventional standard errors; b) replace fixed with random

country effects; c) drop country effects; d) drop time effects; and e) drop the control covariates (X in

equation (1)). Again, none of the perturbations in Panel D undermine confidence in the default

estimate.13


        I check the robustness of the precise measure of the bond market in Panel E. First, I

substitute a five-year lag of the bond market in place of its contemporaneous variable. Next, I

substitute shorter maturity bonds (technically “notes”), those between five and nine years, instead




                                                   8
of requiring that bonds be trading for maturities of at least ten years. The effect of the bond market

on inflation remains statistically and economically significant through both of these checks.


        The final pair of checks, recorded at the bottom of Table 2, is expected to fail. My

hypothesis is that only bond-holders significantly affected by domestic inflation can be expected to

provide support for anti-inflationary policies. I test this by successively replacing my long, nominal,

domestic-currency bond market dummy variable with analogous dummies for bonds that are a)

indexed or adjusted for inflation; and b) denominated in foreign exchange rather than domestic

currency.14 In the former case, the point estimates shrink but remains negative, measured with

sufficient imprecision as to be insignificantly different from zero; in the latter case, the point

estimates are actually positive, though again insignificantly different from zero.


        All this bolsters confidence in the basic result: the presence of a long, nominal, local-

currency bond market within an IT regime is associated with inflation that is about three-four

percentage points lower.


Business Cycles and Output


        The evidence presented above indicates that inflation is strongly affected by the presence of

a bond market. What of other phenomena? Since the major focus here is on monetary policy, it is

natural to examine output over the business cycle. It would be worrying if bond-holders exert undue

influence and induce inappropriately contractionary monetary policy.


        Table 3 presents estimates that are analogous to those of (1), substituting a measure of the

business cycle in place of inflation as the dependent variable. I estimate:


                 BCit = βBondit + γX’it + {δi} + {εt} + ηit                                          (2)


where BCit is a measure of country i's business cycle deviation from trend at time t, and X’ is a set of

control covariates. To ensure the robustness of my results, I de-trend real GDP using four



                                                         9
techniques: a) Baxter-King filtering; b) Christiano-Fitzgerald filtering; c) Hodrick-Prescott filtering;

and d) de-meaned annual growth rates.15 I estimate (2) after dropping real GDP growth from the

covariate controls (X’). Equation (2) links a bond market presence to the average deviation of output

from trend; in order to see if there is a linkage between the bond market and the magnitude of

business cycle deviations, I re-run (2) after taking absolute values of the dependent variable.


        The bond market seems to dampen the volatility of business cycles, as shown by the

negative coefficients in the right-hand column of Table 3. Still, the estimates of β in Table 3 are all

small, and none are statistically significant at conventional levels. In this (limited) sense, the

existence of the bond market does not appear to affect either the average size of business cycle

deviations or their magnitude, at least for IT countries.


Treatment Effect Estimates


        In Table 4, I provide estimates for the effect of a bond market on inflation using a variety of

different treatment effect estimators, all confined to inflation-targeting countries. For instance, I

match bond market observations to those without bond markets using both the propensity score

and nearest-neighbour matching techniques in the top pair of rows.16 The estimated treatment

effects of the bond market for both CPI and GDP inflation is between 3.6 and 5.1 percentage points.

This is both economically and statically significant; it is also reassuringly close to the panel estimates

of Table 2. The next row tabulates a similar effect estimated using a regression-adjusted treatment

effect estimator, using the five control covariates as the regression model to predict potential

outcomes. I also provide inverse-probability treatment effect estimates, and then combine this

technique with regression adjustment in two ways. The bottom line for inflation targeters from a

dozen treatment effect estimates is similar; inflation is approximately three to four percentage

points lower for countries with bond markets.


Instrumental Variable Estimates



                                                    10
        The existence (or absence) of a bond market is a variable that may be measured with error.

It may also be simultaneously determined with inflation, even within the class of inflation-targeting

countries. For both reasons, I now pursue instrumental variables estimation. In particular, I use two

instrumental variables: the size of government spending relative to GDP, and the log of the length of

time since national independence. I also show that my results do not depend on the exact choice of

instrumental variables.


        The motivation for my choice of IVs is simple: more mature governments are likely to have

the institutional capacity necessary to create a bond market, and governments that spend more are

likely to have a greater need to create one. More sophisticated strategies to develop instrumental

variables undoubtedly exist. For instance, one could imagine focusing on wars, private-sector

financial development, and/or instability associated with previous inflations.17 I leave further

elaboration for future research.


        Table 5 presents evidence associated with instrumental variables estimation of (1). The top

row contains the default results, instrumenting bond market existence with government spending

(measured as a fraction of output) and the log of years of independence. These are not weak

instrumental variables; the left-hand column tabulates the p-value for the hypothesis that both

coefficients are zero in the first-stage regression of the bond market dummy variable on the two

instrumental variables (as well as the other regressors of (1)). The p-value is low, indicating that the

instrumental variables are significantly correlated with the bond market dummy variable.18


        To the right, IV estimates of β are tabulated, along with robust standard errors. The

coefficients for both measures of inflation are larger than those of least squares, indicating a drop in

inflation effect of about eight percentage points in the presence of a bond market. While both

coefficients are statistically large, so are the standard errors. Hausman tests are also presented for

the hypothesis of equality between LS and IV estimates; these indicate no significant difference.




                                                   11
Succinctly, IV estimates of the coefficient of interest remain economically and statistically significant

and negative; the existence of a bond market seems to lower inflation for IT countries.


        The remainder of Table 5 shows that this result does not depend sensitively on the exact

choice of instrumental variables. I consider six variants of my default pair of IVs. First, I cap the

effect of independence at 100 years. Second, I substitute military for total government spending,

since governments are particularly sensitive to security concerns. I pursue this line of reasoning

further, by replacing government spending with a measure of “state fragility.” State fragility is a

composite measure intended to be “closely associated with its state capacity to manage conflict;

make and implement public policy; and deliver essential services and its systemic resilience in

maintaining system coherence, cohesion, and quality of life; responding effectively to challenges and

crises, and sustaining progressive development.”19 The measure is a composite of eight sub-indices;

those for “security effectiveness” and “security legitimacy” are particularly attractive as instrumental

variables, since they are unlikely to be unrelated to inflation but are plausibly linked to the state’s

demand for fiscal resources.20 Accordingly, I also present a perturbation with security effectiveness

and legitimacy substituted for government spending. As an alternative, I use total central

government debt in place of government spending. Finally, I drop government spending altogether,

since this variable is only weakly correlated with bond market presence. Using the stock of

government debt in place of the flow of government spending lowers the number of observations

available and thus precision.21 Otherwise, none of the exercises changes the results substantively.22




5. Conclusion


        It is natural (if sometimes mistaken) to think that low and stable inflation is a necessary for a

bond market. In this short paper, I ask the converse question: does the existence of a long nominal

local bond market affect inflation?



                                                    12
        My work is unabashedly empirical and delivers a clear answer: the very existence of a

market for long maturity, nominal bonds denominated in local currency seems to lower inflation by

three to four percentage points (bonds that are either indexed to inflation or denominated in foreign

currency do not have a similar effect). This result is striking because it holds for countries with

inflation-targeting regimes, countries which already seem disposed to low and stable inflation.

Other monetary regimes, such as those dedicated to maintaining hard fixed exchange rates, do not

have the same reaction. And the effect is intuitive; countries with bond markets have a powerful

interest group opposed to inflation, one that often has considerable influence. Finally, and

reassuringly, no effect of the bond market is apparent on real output.


        This work could be improved in several ways. First, I have presented an intuitive empirical

result; interpretation could be sharpened within an explicit theoretical framework. Second, a more

structural approach to the issue of simultaneity might prove fruitful. Third, it might be possible to

improve on my measure of bond market presence. I use a simply dummy variable for the existence

of publicly-traded market for long nominal local-currency bonds; a more continuous measure would

be preferable.


        I conclude that bond markets constitute an effective bulwark in the defence of an inflation-

targeting regime.

     It is interesting to note that bonds have long been issued disproportionately to the rich. Pezzolo (2005, p147) writes:
               “Along with voluntary loans, some communes began to require forced loans from well to-do citizens. As far as we
               know, the first Italian government to do so was that of Venice, which in 1171, in order to prepare a fleet against
               the Byzantine emperor, decreed a loan from every citizen in relation to his patrimony, at an interest rate of 5
               percent until the money was paid back (donec pecunia imprestata restituatur).”

 Romer (1993) has provided a compelling link between openness and inflation; accordingly, I include the ratio of trade to
GDP.

 With a twist, since some countries are “treated” all the way through the sample, as they enter inflation targeting with a
bond market.

  Natural, but perhaps mistaken. Even restricting attention to the OECD, a number of countries have experienced high
inflation in the presence of a bond market; indeed, that is the norm. In the mid-1970s, Australia, Canada, and Denmark all
experienced bouts of inflation of 15% or more while maintaining long bond markets; such inflationary episodes were more
extended for Greece, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, and the UK.

 In particular, GFD seems to omit bonds of relevance from Armenia, Brazil, Chile, Israel, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Peru, Trinidad
and Tobago, Ukraine, and UAE.

     I fill in some observations missing from WDI with comparable series from the Penn World Table 7.1.

   Available at http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ilzetzki/data/ERA-Annual%20coarse%20class.xls ; I use the first group of the coarse
classification which includes: a) no separate legal tender; b) pre-announced peg or currency board arrangement; c) pre-
announced horizontal band that is narrower than or equal to +/- 2%; and d) de facto peg. There is one exception: while I
allow both Spain and Finland to be members of both hard fix and inflation target regimes during the run-up to EMU, I do
not allow the Czech Republic to be classified as a hard fix after it begins inflation targeting.

  Quantiles are points taken at regular intervals from the cumulative distribution function of a random variable. Dividing
ordered data into q essentially equal-sized data subsets is the motivation for q-quantiles; the quantiles are the data values
marking the boundaries between consecutive subsets (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile).

13
     Adding the growth rate of either M1 or M2 to the vector of controls makes no substantive differences in my results.

14
  One cannot perform the same exercise on stock markets, since all IT countries had stock markets throughout the
sample.

15
  I use standard parameter values for my filtering techniques: a smoothing parameter of 6.25 for Hodrick-Prescott (as
suggested by e.g., Ravn and Uhlig); and for Christiano-Fitzgerald and Baxter-King bandpass filtering, minimal/maximal
periodicities of two/eight years respectively, with a lead-lag length of three years (as suggested by e.g., Baxter and King).

16
  I match observations on the basis of the five control variables (X) from equation (1). Also, I use three matches; results
remain strong if the exact number of matches is varied.

17
   A number of government bond markets, especially older ones, were created to provide a way for the government to
finance fiscal deficits, especially those associated with war. The Bank of England was founded in order to issue and manage
debt for the government during a war with France
(http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/education/Documents/resources/postcards/history2.pdf), and the United States began
to issue Treasury bonds in 1917 shortly after entering WWI (http://www.treasury.gov/about/history/Pages/1900-

                                                                23
Present.aspx). The martial origins of Italian and Dutch debt are discussed by Pezzolo (2005) and de Vries and van der
Woude (1997) respectively. Alternatively, a long government bond market may be a necessary ingredient for a benchmark
yield curve. Finally, modern aversion to inflation may reflect historical experience (Germany is often cited); bond markets
may also be developed as a response to crises (East Asia after the crisis is a case in point). Such issues are worth
considering in future research.

18
  The pair of IVs seem excludable from (1); the p-value of the joint hypothesis that both years of independence and
government spending as a fraction of GDP can be excluded from the CPI (GDP) inflation equation is .12 (.23).
19
   More specifically (p7 of State Fragility Index and Matrix 2013): ‘the measure of Fragility … scores each country on both
Effectiveness and Legitimacy in four performance dimensions: Security, Political, Economic, and Social, at the end of the
year 2013. Each of the Matrix indicators is rated on a four-point fragility scale: 0 “no fragility,” 1 “low fragility,” 2 “medium
fragility,” and 3 “high fragility” with the exception of the Economic Effectiveness indicator, which is rated on a five-point
fragility scale (including 4 “extreme fragility”). The State Fragility Index, then, combines scores on the eight indicators and
ranges from 0 “no fragility” to 25 “extreme fragility.’ More details are available at
http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/SFImatrix2013c.pdf

   Security effectiveness is a measure of general security and vulnerability to political violence, based on two assumptions:
(1) the residual effects of low level and/or short wars diminish relatively quickly; and (2) the residual effects of serious or
protracted wars diminish gradually over a 25-year period. Security legitimacy is a measure of state repression, drawn from
separate annual indicators of U.S. State Department and Amnesty International reports. Further details are available at
http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscr/SFImatrix2013c.pdf.

   The same problem, of limited observations, characterizes other fiscal variables. For instance, using the government’s
budget surplus or deficit (relative to GDP) instead of government spending reduces the sample size by twenty percent,
while using the stock of central government debt (relative to GDP) reduces the sample size by over forty percent. Still, the
latter is probably the preferable instrumental variable from a theoretical viewpoint; Missale and Blanchard (1991) present
a model that ties the maturity of government debt to its size.
22
    Estimates for the equivalent of a reverse regression to (1) are presented in Appendix Table A2. Where (1) estimates the
inflation effect of the existence of a bond market for inflation targeters, the results in Table A2 show that IT has no effect
on inflation for countries with bond markets.
           One could also argue that the IT regime itself is endogenous with respect to the existence of the bond market. A
small amount of evidence consistent with this is tabulated in Appendix Table A3. The determination of monetary regimes
is notoriously difficult to model empirically; this multinomial logit model uses the default model of size, income, and polity
developed in Table 8 of Rose (2013).
