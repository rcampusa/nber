        Identifying and profiting from CEO vacation trips




I.     Introduction

       This paper documents a close connection between the timing of corporate news

disclosures and CEOs’ absences from headquarters. I identify CEO absences by merging

publicly available flight histories of corporate jets with real estate records of CEOs’ property

ownership near leisure destinations. I find that CEOs go to their vacation homes just after

companies report favorable news, and CEOs return to headquarters right before subsequent news

is released. More good news is released when CEOs are back at work, and CEOs appear not to

leave headquarters at all if a firm has adverse news to disclose. When CEOs are away from the

office, stock prices behave quietly with sharply lower volatility. Volatility increases immediately

when CEOs return to work. Mandatory Form 8-K disclosures of material company news are

more likely to be filed late if news occurs while CEOs are at their vacation homes.

       An example illustrating many of these patterns appears in Figure 1. On January 7, 2010,

aerospace manufacturer Boeing Co. disclosed a 28% increase in annual commercial airliner

deliveries and also issued an earnings forecast for the year ahead. Boeing stock rose 4%, capping

three days in which it outperformed the market by almost 10%. The company’s shares were

quiet for the next several weeks, not moving significantly again until January 27, when Boeing

                                                 1
announced strong quarterly earnings and its stock rose more than 7%. In between these

announcements, Boeing’s CEO appears to have been at his vacation home, an inference based

upon Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records of company aircraft trips to and from an

airport near his vacation residence in Hobe Sound, FL. During this period, the annualized

volatility of Boeing’s stock dropped to 0.16, an unusually low level for a major blue chip.

During the three days before and three days after his trip, the volatility was more than twice as

high at 0.40. I find patterns similar to Figure 1 for a sample of 217 trips to vacation homes

lasting five work days or longer, taken by CEOs of 65 major U.S. companies during the four year

period 2007-2010.

       The paper’s results seem consistent with an agency cost hypothesis, under which CEOs

might slow down their firms’ news disclosures for personal convenience on the days that they

requisition company aircraft for golf or ski trips. However, the observed associations between

news disclosures and vacation schedules may well be endogenous, if CEOs plan to be away from

the office when the company expects to have little news to announce. To understand more

clearly the direction of causation between disclosures and CEO absences, I conduct a variety of

tests, examining how company news announcements change when CEOs return to headquarters

at unexpected times. I also estimate a bivariate probit model of news days and vacation days, in

which weather at the CEO’s vacation site is used as an instrumental variable that should be

associated with trips to the vacation home but not be connected to company news developments.

Much of the analysis from these tests supports the agency interpretation, with news releases

appearing to occurr less frequently simply because the CEO is absent from the office. However,

it is difficult to test causation in the other direction, which would require an instrumental variable


                                                  2
associated with news at headquarters but uncorrelated with the CEO’s decision to take time off.

A persuasive instrumental variable with these characteristics is hard to find. In addition, overall

patterns of CEO vacations do not provide clear-cut support for the agency hypothesis. CEOs do

not seem to over-consume leisure, as they spend about 17 work days a year at their vacation

homes, in line with the schedules of typical mid-level managers.1 Many of their trips are short,

and some appear to be interrupted for returns to headquarters when required.

         A number of benign explanations also seem consistent with results in the paper. Some

CEO responsibilities, such as secret merger negotiations, may require meetings at remote

locations and put the CEO out of contact with headquarters or the news media. This “distance”

hypothesis implies that corporate disclosure may be affected by the CEO’s mere absence from

headquarters, even for business trips, due to logistical complications. In principle one could test

this conjecture by using business-related aircraft flights to identify the CEO’s days away from

headquarters and comparing news on those days with disclosures on vacation days. However,

CEOs’ business trips are hard to pinpoint, because we do not have passenger manifests for

individual flights. Due to the difficulty of identifying a CEO’s business flights, the paper does

not have a benchmark for differentiating how company news disclosures change when the CEO

leaves for vacation compared to routine trips away from headquarters for business.

         A further “effort” hypothesis would suggest that companies disclose less news when the

CEO is at his vacation home not because he is a great distance away, but merely because he is

working less and producing less news. The effort hypothesis seems plausible since technology



         1
           U.S. professional employees with 15 or more years service receive an average of 17 paid vacation days each
year, according to a government study. See http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ebs.t05.htm.

                                                           3
should allow most managers to communicate with headquarters from afar. This hypothesis is

difficult to test directly, since we cannot observe the CEO’s hour-to-hour activities at any

location. Evidence that CEOs work less while at their vacation homes is circumstantial, based to

their proximity to beaches, marinas, and ski resorts, as well as large perquisite disclosures for

many of them of corporate aircraft use for personal reasons.2 However, the “effort” hypothesis is

difficult to separate empirically from the “distance” hypothesis, and my inability to distinguish

between them represents a limitation of the paper’s research design.

         This study illuminates a facet of corporate disclosure policy rarely noticed by investors or

regulators. Since the 1930s U.S. authorities have established detailed regulations for the timing

of company disclosures by enacting rules such as Regulation FD and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act

(SOX). Since it became effective in 2003, SOX has required companies to report a wide range of

material events on Form 8-K within either two or four business days. Notwithstanding these

regulations, my results indicate systematic coordination between public news disclosures and the

personal schedules of company CEOs.

         The movements of company aircraft to and from CEOs’ vacation residences provide very

visible signals of pending news announcements and silences. With a trivial amount of research

and monitoring, investors could observe flights of corporate aircraft in real time between the

headquarters airport and CEOs’ vacation locales, either by watching live FAA data on the


         2
            Mandatory executive compensation disclosures indicate substantial leisure use of corporate aircraft use by
nearly all the CEOs in the sample. In the case of Boeing, the company disclosed an incremental cost of $303,962 for
personal use of company aircraft in 2010 by its CEO, W. James McNerney Jr. Estimates on the Jet Tracker database put
the incremental cost of a typical corporate aircraft flight in the neighborhood of $5,000 to $10,000 (depending on the
plane model and distance flown), implying that Boeing’s CEO took a fairly large number of personal trips on the
company’s executive jet in 2010. Conversations by the author with practitioners indicate that when preparing these
disclosures, companies tend to classify a CEO’s flight expenses as leisure-related only when necessary, for those trips on
when he does no identifiable work.

                                                            4
Internet or stationing scouts for “tailspotting” of the tail numbers of planes that land at leisure

airports favored by CEOs such as Nantucket, Ma. or Naples, Fl. This information could support

straightforward trading strategies, such as using derivatives to bet on declines in volatility when a

CEO arrives at his vacation airport and increases in volatility when he departs. A similar pattern

of volatility changes tied to the arrival of transport vessels is described by Koudijs (2013) in his

historical account of British company shares trading on the Amsterdam exchange during the 18th

century. By merging the schedules of mail boats carrying news from England with daily share

price changes in Amsterdam, Koudijs shows that volatility of stocks rose markedly when English

ships docked in Amsterdam. In this study, the mechanism by which information reaches the

market is somewhat different than in Koudijs’s; whereas the mail boats in 18th century Europe

transported market-relevant news from abroad directly to investors, a 21st century CEO’s

corporate jet seems to carry a gatekeeper who personally controls the release of news, and whose

absence from headquarters implies silence by the firm.

         The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents a literature

review connecting the results of this study to research in law, finance, and accounting. Section

III describes the data collection and presents descriptive statistics about the sample. Section IV

contains an analysis of stock returns and changes in volatility when a CEO is out of the office at

his vacation home, as well as an analysis of corporate news releases. Section V concludes the

paper.



II.      Literature review

         A large academic literature has investigated the strategic timing of news disclosure by


                                                  5
corporations. These papers generally focus upon firms’ attempts to influence analysts and

journalists or exploit gaps in investors’ attention. For instance, Patell and Wolfson (1982),

Damodaran (1989), and many other studies find that firms release adverse news on late Friday

afternoons, or in the evenings after the stock exchange has closed. Dye (2010) studies conditions

under which companies will cluster or “bunch” several disclosures together in order to diminish

the focus of investors upon any one announcement. Ahern and Sosyura (forthcoming) show that

when negotiating stock-for-stock acquisitions, a bidder firm will often flood the news media with

positive announcements, attempting to drive its share price higher and obtain a more favorable

exchange ratio with the target firm.

       Delaying or advancing news based upon the CEO’s personal work schedule represents an

additional aspect of disclosure policy that has not been previously noted by researchers.

Numerous studies in the Management field have analyzed top managers’ daily activities, though

it is unusual for these papers to document direct associations between CEO schedules and

companies’ financial performance. One exception is Bandiera, Guiso, Prat, and Sadun (2011),

who study one week of detailed work diaries for CEOs of 94 large Italian companies, tracking

such variables as the number of hours worked and the frequency of meetings with colleagues and

customers. The authors find a positive association between company productivity, measured as

sales per employee, and hours worked by CEOs, especially for hours spent inside the firm rather

than externally in meetings with outsiders such as investors or customers. Bennedsen, Pérez-

Gonzalez, and Wolfenzon (2012) study CEO illnesses and find a negative relation between CEO

hospitalizations and subsequent company profitability. In both of these papers the outcome

variables are reported at the annual level, in contrast to this study which looks more finely at


                                                  6
daily stock price behavior when a CEO is in or away from the office.

       Previous literature suggests that if a company were to alter its disclosure practices to

accommodate absences of top managers, investors may react negatively over time. When a

company delays or reduces its news disclosures, research indicates that a number of financial

problems arise for the firm. Most of these studies rely on indexes of firms’ disclosure quality

created by analysts or other financial market professionals. These indexes evaluate firms

according to the frequency, timeliness, and informativeness of their news announcements.

According to this research, better corporate disclosure is associated with a lower cost of debt

(Sengupta, 1998), greater liquidity for the firm’s stock (Welker, 1995), increased willingness of

institutional investors to hold a company’s shares (Healy, Hutton, and Palepu, 1999; Bushee and

Noe, 2000), and reduced litigation risk (Skinner, 1997). Leuz and Wysocki (2008) provide a

recent survey of these studies.

       This paper also extends a growing literature based upon CEOs’ corporate jet usage.

While early research such as Rajan and Wulf (2006) and Yermack (2006) focused upon

connections between jet usage and company performance, this paper does not directly analyze the

impact of jet flights. Instead, it employs data about CEOs’ air travel as an identification strategy

to identify their absences from headquarters. Two other recent working papers use The Wall

Street Journal’s Jet Tracker database, the same source employed in this study, to identify

executive trips to specific locations. Bushee, Gerakos and Lee (2013) study executive trips to

the “money center” cities of New York, Boston, Chicago, and San Francisco, where the

managers are likely to be meeting with bankers, analysts, or investors. Lee, Lowry and Shu

(2013) use aircraft travel records to compile data about the frequency of managers’ trips from


                                                 7
headquarters to company subsidiaries and other business locations.



III.     Data description

         Data for this study comes from the Jet Tracker online database made available for public

search by The Wall Street Journal since May 2011 (Maremont and McGinty, 2011). The

database, derived from FAA data, consists of “every private aircraft flight recorded in the FAA's

air-traffic management system for the four years from 2007 through 2010,” according to the

newspaper. The database lists the tail number used to identify each aircraft, which the newspaper

matches to individual companies using an FAA registry obtained with a Freedom of Information

Act request as discussed below.

         I search the Jet Tracker database for all companies included in the S&P500 index

between 2007 and 2010, using a list of companies and CEOs downloaded from ExecuComp.

Approximately three-quarters of the S&P500 appear in the database, with the frequency declining

in relation to company size. If a company operates its own aircraft, the database rank-orders its

2007-2010 flights by airport. Invariably the headquarters city of the company is the first airport

listed. For those companies whose aircraft fly often to airports serving leisure destinations such

as Martha’s Vineyard or Key Largo – which happens for perhaps half of all firms with planes – I

search on-line real estate records available on Lexis-Nexis to determine whether the company’s

CEO owns property near that airport.3 This requirement of vacation property ownership causes a


         3
           Searchable real estate databases include records of housing sales, property taxes, and mortgages and list the
owner and exact address of properties across the United States. These data have been used by several recent papers such
as Liu and Yermack (2012) and Cronqvist, Makhija, and Yonker (2012) to identify the main residences of corporate
managers. To search these databases accurately, one must sometimes consult biographical sources to obtain information
such as the CEO’s middle initial or spouse’s name. CEOs with common last names such as Smith or Johnson can be
problematic, and in several such cases I excluded companies from the sample when I could not link an individual CEO to

                                                           8
substantial reduction of the sample, as I am able to identify vacation homes owned by about one-

third of those CEOs whose firms frequently operate aircraft to and from leisure destinations

(many of the other CEOs may rent or stay at resort hotels, for instance, even if they visit the same

destinations regularly). If I locate a property, I query the database for exact details of each flight

to and from the vacation airport, on the assumption that those flights transport the CEO. I then

use this flight information to construct a record of the CEO’s trips to and from his vacation

home.

         Using the CEO’s real estate ownership represents an identification strategy that allows me

to infer, with high probability, that the CEO is actually a passenger on certain specific flights

operated by his company’s aircraft. Because it is far more difficult to know whether the CEO

was aboard an aircraft that flew to a generic commercial destination, the paper lacks a benchmark

to differentiate the effects of the CEO’s business travel from his vacation trips.

         Compiling flight records for individual trips requires some subjective judgment. Many

companies’ aircraft follow a pattern of flying from headquarters to a vacation destination, staying

only a few minutes (presumably to discharge passengers), and then immediately returning to the

headquarters airport or perhaps flying on to another city. This allows the plane to avoid local

hangar fees near the CEO’s vacation home and to undertake other corporate missions while the

CEO is inactive. Some days later, a company aircraft will travel again to the CEO’s vacation

airport, stop briefly to pick up passengers, and then return once again to headquarters, so that

CEO vacations often involve two separate round-trips by a company plane. Sometimes a CEO


specific real estate records with high confidence. On the advice of the staff of The Wall Street Journal, I excluded one
company (Cintas Corp.) in which both the CEO and his father, the Chairman and predecessor CEO, had access to the
company plane and each owned vacation property in the Florida Keys, making it impossible to infer which flights carried
the CEO and which carried the father.

                                                           9
appears to fly from his vacation airport to cities other than headquarters, often for an up-and-back

trip in one day. Many of these side trips are to obvious leisure destinations, such as Napa, Ca., or

Augusta., Ga., which many CEOs appear to visit for day trips of six hours or less, enough time

for a tour of vineyards or a round of golf. If the CEO travels from his vacation home to another

leisure destination, I count it as a continuation of the vacation trip, but if the trip appears to be to

an urban or commercial destination, I treat it as the end of the vacation. If the corporate aircraft

travels to the CEO’s vacation airport but no return flight ever appears in the database, I do not

include the trip in my sample; in these cases the CEO probably leaves by commercial air service

or surface transport at a time I cannot identify. To classify a departure day from headquarters as

either a work day or day away from the office, I use a cutoff of 4:00 p.m. takeoff, so if the CEO’s

plane leaves the headquarters city later than 4:00, I count the trip as having begun the next

working day. For return days, if the flight lands in the headquarters city or another non-leisure

destination at 12:00 noon or earlier, I count that as a work day.

        These methods will obviously yield only an incomplete record of a CEO’s vacation trips

with some measurement error, since I will record trips to locations where he owns homes but not

to other destinations where he may vacation without owning property. A few companies’ planes

travel regularly to Bermuda and Mexico resort towns and to Europe, but I do not have access to

foreign real estate records to verify whether CEOs own property in these locations. On occasion

CEOs may travel on commercial airlines or use time-sharing private jet services from an outside

company such as NetJets, and I will miss these trips as well. Even when a CEO travels to his

vacation home, he may spend time working on company business while there, so my measure of




                                                   10
vacation travel may be overinclusive.4 I also cannot verify that CEOs are passengers on every

flight made on company planes to the airports near their vacation homes; some of these trips may

transport a CEO’s family members or junior executives from the company, for instance.

         My sampling procedure yields vacation schedules for 66 CEOs from 65 companies. I

tabulate a binary vacation variable for each CEO each day, with the U.S. stock market calendar

used to distinguish working days from weekends and holidays. For CEOs who hold their jobs

continuously for the entire 2007-2010 period, the sample includes 1,008 days of data, an average

of 252 stock market days per year. For CEOs who were appointed or resigned during this period,

I tabulate daily vacation data only during their time in office, even though some seem to have

access to their firms’ planes while not serving in the CEO role. Table 1 presents basic overview

statistics about the sample. In all, the database contains 51,426 company-days, of which 3,504,

or 6.8%, are spent by CEOs at their vacation homes, an average of about 17 work days per year.

The data exhibit considerable variation across companies, with one CEO recording only three

work days at his vacation home during the four-year, 1,008-day sample period, and another

spending 197 days at his retreats during the same period.

         Table 1 presents additional descriptive detail about CEOs’ vacation trips. Generally these

days out of the office follow unsurprising patterns, with Fridays and Mondays represented more

than midweek days and a high concentration of absences from the office during July, August, and

the winter holiday season. The frequency of CEO absences was higher in 2010 than 2007-09,


         4
           An interesting recent case involves Houston company Nabors Industries Ltd. and its CEO Eugene Isenberg,
who owns homes in Palm Beach and Martha’s Vineyard, locations frequently visited by the company’s aircraft. The
CEO’s employment contract entitles him to establish offices at any of his personal residences and to perform his work
duties from those locations. In November 2011 the SEC opened an investigation because the company had disclosed zero
expense for the CEO’s personal use of company aircraft, apparently under a rationale that the CEOs’ trips to these
locations were always for business purposes. McGinty and Maremont (2011).

                                                         11
perhaps because improved conditions in the national economy permitted CEOs to spend more

time away from the office. In all, I identify a total of 1,150 distinct CEO vacation trips,

uninterrupted by days back at headquarters, with lengths varying between one and 28 continuous

work days. More than half of all CEO trips are just one or two days in length, but approximately

50% of all vacation days occur in trips at least one week (five working days) long, and I focus

much of the analysis below on this subsample.

         Table 2 presents a panel probit model of CEOs’ decisions about when to spend days at

their vacation homes. The binary dependent variable equals one if the CEO is at the vacation

home on a weekday that the stock market is open. Explanatory variables include personal

characteristics of each CEO, including age, percent ownership, and the log of total compensation

(the TDC1 quantity reported by ExecuComp); net-of-market stock performance over the prior six

months; variables about the weather at the vacation site and at headquarters; and indicator

variables for each calendar month.5 I also include indicator variables for work days immediately

preceding and immediately following public holidays. Each CEO is allocated a unique intercept

term and standard errors are robust to serial correlation and heteroskedasticity. About 4 percent

of the company-day observations drop out of regressions due to missing values for days that

weather stations are off-line and do not report any data.

         Estimates in Table 2 reveal a number of interesting patterns. CEO ownership and



         5
           Daily weather data is available from the Internet portal of National Climatic Data Center of the U.S. National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). I download the high temperature and depth of precipitation at the
airport weather station closest to the CEO’s vacation home for each day in the sample (most of these weather stations are
at the commuter airports used by their aircraft), and I obtain the same information for the headquarters airport of each
company. A small number of CEOs maintain pairs of leisure homes and visit them seasonally – for instance, Palm Beach
in the winter and Martha’s Vineyard in the summer. In these cases I use weather data for the winter location between
October 1 and March 31, and the summer destination from April 1 through September 30 of each year.

                                                           12
compensation both enter the model negatively with strong levels of significance, suggesting an

incentive effect of CEOs spending less time away from the office when they have more personal

wealth tied to performance. Older CEOs appear to take more vacation days than younger ones,

an effect that may be somewhat endogenous, since more senior CEOs would not have survived in

the job unless their firms were well managed. One variable that does not seem to matter is recent

company performance: the company’s net-of-market stock returns over the prior six months do

not have a significant coefficient estimate. This conclusion does not change for alternative

windows of past performance or if the variable is decomposed into separate company and market

returns. CEOs are significantly more likely to take vacation days in proximity to public holidays

when the stock market is closed.

       Weather conditions at both the CEO’s vacation home and at headquarters appear to be an

important factor in choosing vacation days. Estimates in the second and third columns show that

CEOs are less likely to spend a day at their vacation homes when the weather at the vacation site

is rainy or cold, with opposite effects attributable to the weather at headquarters. Squared terms

on the two temperature variables both have significant estimates with signs opposite linear terms,

indicating that temperature-driven vacation patterns taper off and then reverse when heat or cold

becomes extreme. The estimates on the linear and squared temperature terms in the second

column indicate that CEOs are most likely to visit their vacation homes when the high daily

temperature there is about 83N F. In the third column, I test whether these effects vary for

vacation homes near ski resorts in Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and Idaho. I interact the weather

variables with an indicator that equals 1 for vacation homes in these locations between the

months of October and March. All the weather patterns are reversed for ski locations: CEOs


                                                 13
with ski lodges are more likely to take vacation days when it is snowing and when the

temperature is colder (the estimates imply a local minimum of the likelihood function at 45N F but

no local maximum; the function simply increases in value as the weather gets colder). When the

ski variable equals zero, the estimates in the third column imply that the optimal temperature for

a vacation day at a warm-weather location is 75N F.



IV.    Analysis

       In the sections below I analyze the impact of CEO absences from the office upon the daily

performance of a company’s stock. Section A has three subsections that document empirical

relations between CEO absences and abnormal stock price behavior, changes in volatility, and

patterns of corporate news announcements, respectively. Section B presents a range of tests

useful for assessing the direction of causality between vacation trips and news announcements.

These results appear in three subsections that examine news releases following vacation trips that

are unexpectedly cut short, a bivariate probit model that jointly estimates the occurrence of news

announcements and vacation trips, and analysis of firms’ compliance with mandatory Form 8-K

disclosure deadlines that are triggered when news occurs during CEO vacation trips. Section C

discusses implications of the results for investors.



A.     Empirical Relations

       i.      Abnormal stock returns

       I investigate whether stock prices exhibit abnormal behavior around the days that the

CEO is out of the office. Table 3 presents an analysis of abnormal stock returns in a standard


                                                 14
four-factor Fama-French model, with indicator variables added to identify the days around CEO

vacation trips. Standard errors are clustered at the company level. In column two, the estimate

for an indicator for all CEO vacation days shows that stock returns are generally not different

than normal on days that the CEO is absent from headquarters.

        To increase the power of my statistical tests, I focus on long CEO vacations, which I

define as those lasting five or more consecutive work days. If a CEO flies back to headquarters

for one day and then returns to his vacation home, I count the one day as an “interruption” of a

trip, with the additional spell of days treated as a continuation of the first trip. In all I identify

217 distinct long vacations by the 66 CEOs in the sample, which include 1,806 total work days

away from the office, plus 36 interruption days, along with an uncounted number of weekend and

holiday days. I do not include trips lasting four work days plus a weekday that is a stock market

holiday, and I include interrupted trips only when there is a continuous stay of at least five days

on either or both sides of the interruption. In the third column of Table 3, the vacation indicator

is decomposed into pieces representing days of short and long trips, defined as those five or more

working days in length. Again, the estimates for these variables seem uninteresting.

        The most significant abnormal return estimates appear in columns four and five of Table

3, when the model includes indicators for the three-day periods immediately before and after the

CEO leaves for a long trip of five or more work days. As shown in the table, abnormal stock

returns are about 17 basis points higher than usual for each of the three days just before the CEO

leaves the office, and about 20 basis points higher than usual for each of the three days after he

returns. The latter window includes the CEO’s second, third, and fourth days back in the office,

during which the stock market would react to news disclosed at the close of the first three work


                                                   15
days following the trip. Given the three-day length of these periods, the estimates correspond to

appreciations in the company’s stock of about 0.51% and 0.59%, respectively, significant at the

5% and 1% levels, respectively. These patterns seem surprising, especially when the CEO

returns to headquarters, since investors should be able to anticipate the pattern of returns and

price them into stock prices in advance. This could be done by observing individual aircraft trips

or becoming aware of those companies whose CEOs follow a regular vacation schedule every

year (the short time series for this study – four years – precludes any robust identification of

CEOs who have predictable schedules).

       These estimates imply that companies release good news just before the CEO leaves for a

long trip, disclose very little while he is gone, and finally announce more good news on his

return. This interpretation is reinforced by the analyses of news releases and stock price volatility

that appear below. Bad news announcements do not seem to occur in proximity to CEOs’ longer

trips away from the office. Since many CEOs begin or end vacations in the first month of the

year, these data may have a plausible connection to the well-known “January effect” of stocks

performing unusually well in the first weeks of a new year.

       These findings are broadly consistent with recent papers by Tsiakas (2006, 2010), who

studies abnormal stock returns around market holidays, which occur nine times each year during

my sample period. Tsiakas finds positive expected returns both before and after mid-week

holidays. For market holidays on Mondays or Fridays that represent part of a three-day weekend,

abnormal returns are positive in advance of the long weekend, as found in my sample, but

negative on the first day back to work. Inspection of my data shows that close to half of the

lengthy CEO vacation trips are coordinated with holidays. Of the 217 individual trips in the


                                                 16
sample, 31 begin at the start of a three-day holiday weekend or immediately prior to a mid-week

holiday, and 35 trips end just after a holiday weekend or mid-week holiday. Many other trips

include stock market holidays in the middle, so that a total of 107 out of 217 vacations coincide

in some way with the holiday calendar.



       ii.     Volatility

       Table 4 presents data about stock volatility when CEOs are at work, and when they are

out of the office at their vacation homes. I calculate intra-day realized volatilities for the 65

companies in the sample, based on the standard deviation of stock returns calculated at five-

minute intervals using the method introduced by Andersen and Bollerslev (1997). At the top of

Table 4, the data indicate significant drops in stock volatility when the CEO is at his vacation

home: on these days, realized volatility is 0.307, compared to 0.330 on all other days. In other

words, volatility falls by about 10% when the CEO is out of the office, and the difference in the

mean volatilities for these subgroups is significant below the 1% level.

       The difference becomes even more dramatic when the CEO leaves for a long trip instead

of a short one. Realized volatility during long CEO vacations, 0.287, is about 13% below work-

day volatility. During short CEO trips of less than five days volatility also drops slightly below

normal, to 0.328, though this is not significantly less than the volatility on a work day. The

volatility drop for long trips is more substantial, to 0.270, when the period away includes a public

holiday.

       Changes in stock volatility around CEO vacations are economically large, similar to

results in other studies that have examined important corporate events. Patell and Wolfson


                                                  17
(1979, 1981) and a number of successor papers show significant increases in stock volatility on

dates of earnings announcements, followed by immediate decreases the next day. While these

studies concern changes in volatility around short news announcement windows, other papers

have found sustained volatility changes after important events. For example, Ohlson and

Penman (1985) find that volatility rises by approximately 30% following stock splits. Clayton,

Hartzell and Rosenberg (2005) find that volatility increases by approximately 23% in the year

following forced turnover of a CEO. That paper cites about 15 other studies than have found

significant volatility changes after corporate events such as tender offers and dividend

announcements.

        Further detail in Table 4 show volatilities during periods around the start and end of long

CEO trips. The data show that volatility gradually trends down in the three days before the CEO

leaves, dropping more on his first day of trip, before bottoming out during the middle days of the

trip. On the final day of a long trip, volatility is higher than before, and it rises further during the

CEO’s first three days back in the office.

        The strong volatility patterns associated with CEO absences from headquarters might be

endogenous, if CEOs cut short trips when the activity level at headquarters increases or are more

likely to leave when the office is quiet. In general, CEOs’ trips do not exhibit strong associations

with certain days of the week or holidays that might be affected by market-wide changes in

volatility. For instance, CEOs are most likely to be out of the office on Mondays and Fridays,

according to data in Table 1. However, these two days have the highest, rather than lowest,

market-wide volatility, an effect generally attributed to drops in liquidity that occur when traders

leave for three-day weekends, taking either Friday or Monday off. See Kiymaz and Berument


                                                   18
(2003). Tsiakas (2006) studies volatility around market holidays and finds an ambiguous pattern,

with lower market volatility prior to mid-week holidays, higher volatility after long weekend

holidays, and no significant effects in other cases.

       My calculation of realized volatility on vacation days for all companies pooled together

may be biased if CEOs from quieter companies with lower volatilities are away from the office

more often than their counterparts from higher volatility companies, since CEOs in the first

group would account for more observations in the sample. To examine this possibility, Table 5

shows the comparison between volatilities when the CEO is in the office and when he is away on

a long trip, with the comparison statistics calculated separately for each of 49 companies (for the

other companies in the sample, the CEO never is away for five or more consecutive days). As

shown in Table 5, volatility is lower for the large majority of the 49 companies when the CEO is

away on a long trip.

       Data in Table 5 seem to provide some support for the effort hypothesis discussed above..

More news may be announced by firms when the CEO is at headquarters simply because he is

directly involved in creating significant news events, by signing major contracts, meeting with

regulators, deciding upon new strategies and the like. If this is the case, we would expect those

firms whose CEOs take relatively little vacation time to respond most dramatically when the

CEO is away. This is generally consistent with a pattern in the table that shows the largest

volatility differentials occur for those firms whose CEOs take the fewest days off for long trips

during the 2007-10 sample period. In contrast, for companies whose CEOs spend large amounts

of time away, volatility seems to change little when they are absent, probably because they have

developed a management style relying heavily upon delegation to subordinates.


                                                 19
       iii.    News announcements

       The patterns of stock price volatility described above are consistent with companies

releasing news to the market just before the CEO leaves for a long trip, and CEO returning to the

office just before the next major announcement by the firm. I test this possibility directly using

daily news announcement data from the Thomson Reuters Significant Developments database,

which the vendor describes as “a unique news analysis and filtering service providing a concise

description of crucial, market-moving company news.” This source consolidates major news

affecting public companies from hundreds of worldwide sources and tabulates the date and time

that information first becomes public. The database covers topics such as dividend

announcements, mergers, earnings guidance, new product announcements, major contracts,

regulatory decisions, and the like. I tabulate a binary variable that takes the value of one if the

company makes a significant news announcement or an earnings announcement on each day in

the sample. For announcements that occur after the 4:00 p.m. close of the stock market or over a

weekend, I align them in the database with the next working day.

       Studying news announcements in relation to CEO absences offers an advantage compared

to investigating realized volatility, stock returns, or other market outcomes. When CEOs leave

for vacation, many stock traders or analysts may also be out of the office, and volatility could

change market-wide. Focusing only on a company’s news disclosures allows the reader to

evaluate directly the flow of raw material from a firm to its investors. If the news flow changes

when a CEO is away, the result would help clarify the importance of the agency, distance, and

effort hypotheses without any reference to how or when investors choose to act on the

information they receive.


                                                 20
       Data in the third column of Table 4 show a pattern of news releases similar to that

suggested by the analysis of realized volatilities discussed above and shown in the second

column. On days that CEOs are in the office, companies announce earnings or significant news

13.3% of the time, a frequency that drops by about one-third to 9.6% when CEOs are away from

the office. The effect is greater for longer trips, when the daily news announcement frequency

drops to 8.3%, compared to shorter trips, when it is 11.0%. Differences in all of these numbers

are statistically significant according to t-tests. The daily news announcement frequency tapers

downward from 11.1% on the day before a CEO leaves for a long trip, to 9.2% on the first day

away, then 8.2% on subsequent days in the middle of the trip, and finally 8.1% on the last day. It

then shoots up to 14.3% on a CEO’s first day back in the office. Longer trips that include public

holidays have daily news frequencies of 7.8%, below the frequency of 8.8% during longer trips

that do not include public holidays.

       Table 4's results showing declines in the frequency of company news announcements may

seem surprising in the context of modern technology, since mobile phones, fax machines, and

other innovations should permit top managers to stay in close contact with headquarters. To

examine this conjecture, I study two subsamples of trips during which CEOs may face greater

communication difficulties: ski vacations and trips to Hawaii. I assume that trips to Western ski

resorts such as Aspen and Sun Valley, occurring between October and March, are associated with

skiing. On these trips, CEOs may spend much of the workday on a mountain with limited

cellphone coverage and no easy access to fax or video conference equipment. For Hawaii trips,

the large difference in time zones compared to the continental United States may create

difficulties in reaching the CEO and releasing timely news releases to the market. Data in Table


                                                21
4 support the hypothesis that when the CEO has especially limited access to communications

technology, companies issue less news to investors. For ski trips, the daily frequency of material

news falls to 6.8%, much lower than the frequency of 9.6% for all vacation days, and for Hawaii

trips (which are associated with just two firms in the sample), news disclosures almost stop

completely, dropping to a daily frequency of 0.6%.

       While the data indicate fewer company news announcements when CEOs leave the

office, the existence of a direct causal relationship at first seems ambiguous. CEOs may

deliberately schedule vacations when they expect business to be quiet, as suggested by the data

above indicating that nearly half of CEOs’ long trips occur either adjacent to or overlapping a

public holiday.

       Attempting to understand the direction of causation between CEO vacations and news

represents an important aspect of this study. If CEO vacations affect company news

announcements, the results would imply an agency problem, with CEOs delaying news for

personal convenience, undermining price discovery in the market. Alternatively, if CEOs modify

vacation plans on account of news at headquarters, the results would suggest that CEOs make

compromises in their work schedules for the sake of investor transparency. Ideal experiments to

test these relations would involve suddenly forcing CEOs to take vacations and then observing

their firms’ disclosures, or randomly assigning material news to companies whose CEOs

happened to be out of the office. Neither of these strategies is possible to implement in real life.

Instead, I rely on two pieces of analysis to help identify the direction of causation, including (i) a

comparison of news released when the CEO flies back from vacation at an unusual time,

apparently for business reasons, with news released when the CEO flies back apparently due to


                                                  22
poor weather at the vacation site; and (ii) bivariate probit models that estimate jointly the

incidence of vacations and news releases, with the news and vacation variables modeled

endogenously as a function of instrumental variables.



B.     The direction of causation

       The empirical results presented above might have very different implications depending

upon the direction of causation between CEO absences and company news announcements. If

companies delayed news announcements to accommodate CEOs’ vacation schedules, the pattern

would support an agency interpretation, but if CEOs scheduled their vacations during quiet news

periods, the results would be consistent with a value-maximizing practice of CEOs absenting

themselves from work at optimal times. To help identify the direction of causation, three types

of analysis appear below. Subsection (i) examines news releases that occur when CEO vacation

trips are cut short for business reasons and for weather reasons; the analysis compares the

consequences of random variations in weather patterns with the consequences of random

variations in business requirements. Subsection (ii) presents results from a bivariate probit

model that estimates jointly the probability of vacation days and significant news days, with

exogenous instrumental variables used to identify causation in each direction. Subsection (iii)

examines firms’ compliance with mandatory Form 8-K disclosure deadlines when news occurs

during CEO vacation trips. If compliance is impacted during CEO absences, the results would be

consistent with poor planning and an adverse tradeoff between CEO effort and disclosure.



       i.      Vacation trips cut short by business and by weather


                                                 23
       I create two subsamples of vacations that appear to end unexpectedly, one group

apparently for business reasons, and the other apparently for weather reasons. If the company’s

release of news to the market depends upon the presence of the CEO at headquarters, we should

observe similar frequencies of disclosure at the end of both subsamples of trips, although the

news announced by the first group of firms should be materially more important than the

disclosures by the second group.. The two subsamples attempt to emulate the ideal experiments

of exogenously terminating trips (which should resemble vacations halted for bad weather) and

exogenously delivering material information to a company (in the case of mid-week trip

interruptions), although this emulation almost surely involves some degree of measurement error

since some of the news disruptions and inclement weather events are likely foreseeable.

       I identify business-related interruptions based upon the timing of flights back to

headquarters. Minute-by-minute flight data indicate that CEOs rarely fly from their vacation

homes back to headquarters on weekday mornings, except Mondays. Of the 1,150 individual

vacation trips in the sample, only 42, or 3.7%, involve a return flight that arrives at the

headquarters airport between 8:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. Tuesday through Friday (excluding two

cases where the flight occurs on a holiday). I assume that these trips are likely to occur because

of pressing business at headquarters that requires the executive to stop his vacation at an

inconvenient time. The comparison sample involves rain-shortened vacations. This subsample

includes 38 cases in which the CEO returns to headquarters on a Monday through Thursday, and

the next day is a workday with at least 10 mm. of precipitation at the vacation site. I assume that

these trips are more likely to occur due to an adverse weather forecast than because of news at

headquarters. Two events fall into both subsamples, so I delete them.


                                                  24
       In each subsample, news announcements increase despite the evident differences in

motivations for the CEO’s trips back to headquarters. When the CEO flies back apparently for

business reasons, the company announces significant news that day 15.0% of the time, and on the

following day, 12.5% per the time. When the CEO flies back apparently for weather reasons, the

significant news disclosure frequencies are slightly higher, 15.7% on the day following the return

day and 13.1% the next day. These news frequencies are modestly above those shown in Table 4

for CEOs’ first two days back from long vacations, 14.3% and 11.0%, respectively, and are also

well above the 9.6% news frequency for CEO vacation days, though the differences are not

statistically significant due to the small sample sizes of 40 and 38 trips, respectively. These data

support an interpretation that news releases are tied to the CEO’s presence at the office, rather

than the converse. Although companies seem to announce more news simply because the CEO

is back at work, disclosures connected to the business-related trips appear to be more material in

the eyes of the market. The abnormal stock return over the first three days back is a significant

+0.45% for these 40 observations (t-statistic 1.70), similar to the sample average reported above

after the conclusions of CEOs’ longer vacations. Intra-day volatility exhibits a day-over-day

increase of 2.5 percentage points on the return day, increasing a further 1.4 percentage points the

next day. The two-day increase in volatility has a significant t-statistic of 2.18. In the weather-

related subsample, by contrast, the three-day abnormal stock return is a negative and insignificant

-0.53% (t-statistic -1.32) and intra-day volatility rises by only 0.8 percentage points and then 0.2

percentage for the first two days, with the two-day change not significant (t-statistic = 0.65).

       A comparison of the actual news announced by companies in these two subsamples

highlights differences in their importance, although the data must be interpreted with caution due


                                                 25
to the small sample sizes. Among the set of CEOs with business-related vacation interruptions,

eight announcements seem to have been especially noteworthy. Four of these disclosed

significant merger and acquisition activity by their firms, including two cases of tactical moves in

hostile takeover attempts, a successful completion of a tender offer, and government antitrust

approval received for a very large acquisition (Comcast’s merger with NBC-Universal). Another

material announcement involved a company reducing its quarterly earnings guidance to analysts,

and a further story announced a settlement with government authorities in a consumer safety

investigation. Two quarterly earnings announcements also occurred. The remaining stories

involved minor contract awards or joint venture announcements. In contrast, CEOs’ vacations

with weather-related disruptions were followed by news announcements of lower materiality,

with only three of them appearing to have notable importance. One company disclosed the

cancellation of an $800 million government defense contract, one quarterly earnings release

occurred, and in another case a company increased its earnings guidance. The remaining stories

involved mostly minor contract awards, joint venture announcements, acquisitions of small

private companies, two reiterations of earnings guidance, and a jury verdict against one firm for

$47 million that could not have been known at the time of the flight back to headquarters.



       ii.     Bivariate probit analysis

       To investigate whether CEO absences from the office have a causal effect upon

companies’ news releases or vice versa, one must estimate joint models of CEO vacation trips

and company news releases that treat either the vacation or news variable as endogenous.

Because the two dependent variables of interest, company news releases and CEO vacation days,


                                                26
are binary (0, 1) variables, I cannot rely on standard simultaneous equations techniques such as

two-stage least squares, and I instead use the bivariate probit model. Greene (1998) introduces

the recursive bivariate probit as the most efficient estimator for a system of equations with binary

dependent variables, in which one of the binary outcome variables also enters the equation of the

counterpart variable as an explanatory on the right-hand side.6 It is not possible to model the

endogeneity in both directions in the same system by placing each outcome variable on the right-

hand side of the counterpart equation, because such a model lacks statistical coherence and

cannot be estimated.

         Table 6, panel A, presents the bivariate probit estimates for the two-equation model of

CEO vacation trips and company news releases, with the vacation variable modeled as

endogenous using the six vacation site weather variables as instruments. As shown in Table 2,

the weather (temperature and rainfall) at a CEO’s vacation home has a strongly significant

impact on a CEO’s daily vacation decisions, and it seems implausible that the weather at a

distant leisure location should have any connection to news developments at company

headquarters.7 Maximum likelihood estimation of the two-equation model proved difficult given

the size of the dataset, and to achieve convergence I had to exclude the indicator variables for


         6
            Greene shows that the bivariate probit approach has a simple, appealing and counterintuitive property, because
it does not require the use of a fitted value of one variable in the model for the other as would be done in two-stage least
squares. In the bivariate probit, the investigator can simply put either dependent variable on the right-hand side of the
other equation, and the likelihood function for the joint model is structured in a way that accounts for the variable’s
underlying endogeneity. See Greene (1998, pp. 294-295). Recent applications in the finance literature include Naveen’s
(2006) bivariate probit model of CEO turnover in the presence of a endogenously designated “heir apparent” presumptive
successor, and Jiang, Li and Wang’s (2012) analysis of bankruptcy outcomes in the presence of endogenously determined
activism by hedge funds.

         7
             When the six vacation weather variables are included in a univariate probit model of company news releases,
the two precipitation variables have estimates near zero with an insignificant likelihood ratio χ(2) test statistic of 1.12 for
their joint significance. Some of the vacation site temperature variables do exhibit significant associations with news
announcements made back at headquarters, but I can rely on the precipitation variables to identify the model.

                                                              27
individual CEOs.

       The model for news announcements includes, in addition to the endogenous CEO

vacation variable, weather variables for the headquarters city, indicator variables for days of the

week, indicators for individual months, and indicators for days immediately before or

immediately after public holidays. I also include the company’s difference in realized volatility

compared to the prior day, with this difference lagged one day. This variable is used below in the

estimation in Panel B before as an instrumental variable for significant news announcements.

The news variable follows the definition in Table 4 and equals one for those days on which the

company makes a quarterly earnings announcement or a significant news announcement,

according to the Thomson Reuters Significant Developments database.

       Estimates in Table 6, panel A, show that, even after accounting for the endogeneity of

CEO vacation days, trips out of the office by the CEO appear to have a significantly negative

relation with companies’ daily decisions about whether to release news to investors. The

estimated correlation of the residuals of the two equations, shown by the ρ coefficient at the

bottom of the table, is strongly positive and significant at 0.5035, highlighting the need for the

endogeneity correction. Other estimates in Table 6 closely follow intuition: news releases are

more likely on Monday through Thursday as compared to Friday, while vacation days follow

exactly the opposite pattern. News is less likely to be released and CEOs are more likely to be

out of the office on work days that are adjacent to public holidays. Companies tend to announce

news the day after a significant increase in realized volatility.

       I reverse this analysis in panel B of Table 6, modeling the news variable as endogenous in

order to investigate whether CEOs are more likely to be away from the office when significant


                                                  28
news announcements are not expected. The one-day lagged difference in realized volatility

serves as the instrumental variable for significant news announcements. While this variable

exhibits the statistical properties required of an instrument, because of the nonlinear nature of the

bivariate probit model no test exists for whether it meets the exclusion restriction.8 To justifying

using the lagged change in realized volatility as an instrument requires a persuasive argument

that the variable should be associated with expected news releases, which seems clear, but not

with CEOs’ decisions to leave for vacation, which is more uncertain. For the variable to be

credibly unassociated with CEO absences, one would conjecture that top managers take little

account of the intraday volatility of their share prices. In other words, if a company’s shares

closed unchanged in price from the prior day, the CEO would be indifferent to whether the stock

behaved quietly or exhibited large swings during trading hours.

         The recursive bivariate probit estimates in panel B do not support the hypothesis that

CEO vacation trips occur endogenously based upon expectations of future news disclosures. The

indicator variable for significant news days has an insignificant estimate in the vacation equation,

even though the instrumental variable of the first difference in realized volatility has a strongly

significant estimate. Unlike the estimates in panel A, the model in panel B exhibits very low

estimated correlation of the residuals, 0.0180, implying that the endogeneity correction may not

be important. However, if the rationale for the instrumental variable presented above seems

unpersuasive, the inconclusive results in panel B could be interpreted as the byproduct of a weak

instrument.

         8
           As shown in the table, this variable has a significantly positive association with subsequent news releases.
Further investigation shows that it has close to zero correlation with the CEO vacation variable, and if it is included as a
regressor in the probit model of CEO vacation days, it has an estimate near zero with an insignificant p-value of 0.78. I
am grateful to Nancy Su and Dan Galai for discussions that led to my choice of this instrument.

                                                             29
       As a robustness test of the interpretations from Table 6, I disaggregate the news

announcements in the database according to whether the company controlled the timing of the

disclosure, or whether the news was announced by an outside agent such as a competitor,

regulator, or court of law. In the latter case, the company should have had little or no ability to

anticipate the timing of the news, so that CEO absences should not be expected to exhibit

significant associations with the news variable.

       I partition the news observations by reading the headlines and synopses of the significant

announcements used in the sample. The Thomson Reuters news database provides 7,722

individual items for my 65 companies during the sample period (this number does not include

quarterly earnings announcements, which are obtained from a separate database, and it is not

adjusted for the fact that companies sometimes make multiple announcements on the same day).

I classify 16% of the news announcements as having been generated by external sources. The

leading categories include government contract awards (522 items), regulatory decisions by

government agencies (432 items), court rulings and jury verdicts (142 items) and lawsuits filed or

threatened by competitors or plaintiffs’ attorneys (133 items). Other externally created news

items, much less numerous, include analyst rating changes, activism by major shareholders, and

developments related to hostile takeover attempts.

       Table 7 presents recursive bivariate probit estimates of the incidence of CEO vacation

days and significant news announcements, with the news separated according to internal and

external origin. For brevity, I tabulate estimates only for the key news and vacation dependent

variables in each equation, but all regressions include the full range of explanatory variables used

in Table 6. In the left column, the news variable equals one only for days in which significant


                                                   30
news is generated internally by the firm itself, and I drop from the estimation all days with

externally generated news (including a minor number of overlap days during which news occurs

both internally and externally). In the right column, the news variable is defined in the opposite

way, as it is set equal to one only for days with externally generated news, and observations are

dropped for those days on which news is generated internally by the firm and also for overlap

days. Estimates for the internal news model on the left of Table 7 are similar to those for the

sample overall in Table 6; the vacation indicator variable has a negative and significant estimate

in the news equation, while the news variable has only an insignificant variable in the vacation

equation. In contrast, for the external news model on the right of Table 7, neither variable has a

statistically significant estimate. This pattern of estimates is consistent with an interpretation that

the timing of company news announcements are influenced by CEO absences, but only for news

that is generated by the company itself, and not for news that is generated by external actors such

as governments, courts, or competitors.



       iii.    Compliance with mandatory disclosure deadlines

       This section investigates companies’ compliance with Form 8-K filing requirements, to

see whether news occurring during CEO absences is released to investors with greater delay than

news which occurs when the CEO is in the office. In contrast to most countries that have a

“continuous disclosure” regulatory system, the United States permits companies some leeway in

releasing material news to the market. The SEC requires companies to file Form 8-K within four

business days of a “triggering event,” and the official instructions for this form enumerate 36

distinct categories of news for which this requirement applies (a few of these categories require


                                                  31
filing within two business days).

       I use information from the S&P Filing Dates database, which provides both the event date

and filing date for Form 8-K disclosures. The database lists 2,784 filings by the 65 companies

during my sample period. When an Form 8-K filing refers to multiple corporate events, I treat

the event day as the most recent one covered by the document. If a Form 8-K is filed with the

SEC after the stock market closes at 4:00 p.m., I count it as having been filed on the next

business day. Of the set of 2,784 observations, 163 relate to company developments that occur

on the 3,504 days when CEOs are at their vacation homes, a frequency of 4.7%; the

corresponding frequency of material events on all other days is 5.5%. The drop in frequency of

significant corporate events on the CEO’s vacation days, about 15%, is much less than the 28%

drop in actual news disclosure frequencies implied by data at the top of the right column in

Table 4 (0.096 vs. 0.133). Most of the disclosures on Form 8-K filings occur for three reasons:

publication of financial statements, releases of quarterly earnings or other financial news, and the

departure of officers or members of the board of directors. These three categories comprise 65%

of the disclosures that are triggered by events while CEOs are at their vacation homes, and 66%

of the disclosures that are triggered on all other days. Among CEOs at their vacation homes and

in the office, the data exhibit slight differences among the three categories: quarterly earnings

announcements or other material financial news comprise 12% of the vacation sample and 17%

of the remaining sample, while departures of officers and directors comprise 15% of the vacation

sample and 11% of the remaining sample (p-values for these differences 0.01 and 0.04,

respectively).

       Some basic data about the timeliness of Form 8-K filings indicates that CEO travel


                                                 32
schedules may impact companies’ disclosures. If material events occur when a CEO is at his

vacation home, Form 8-K is filed 44.2% of the time on the same day, but the frequency of same-

day filing is higher at 50.4% if events occur when the CEO is not at his vacation home.

Similarly, the fraction of Form 8-K filings that miss the four-day deadline is 6.1% if the events

occur while the CEO is at the vacation home, vs. 2.6% at other times. Both of these differences

in means have borderline statistical significance with p-values of 0.12 and 0.07, respectively.9

         Table 8 presents regression estimates that control for company and month fixed effects,

as well as various calendar-related variables such as whether news occurs just prior to a holiday

weekend. A Poisson maximum likelihood model shows that CEO vacation trips do not appear to

impact the timeliness of Form 8-K filings in a basic model, but if the vacation variable is

disaggregated based upon the length of a trip, significant patterns do emerge. If the CEO is on a

longer vacation lasting five days or more, the Form 8-K is filed significantly later (these models

omit the cases in which Form 8-K is filed after the four-day regulatory deadline). In contrast,

Form 8-K filings occur somewhat quicker than usual if the CEO is on a shorter vacation of 1 or 2

days length. A probit model estimates that the probability of a company missing the four-day

filing deadline is significantly greater if events occur when the CEO is on vacation.

Disaggregation of the vacation variable by trip length indicates a positive effect at for all

estimates, though the effect is somewhat smaller and not statistically significant if the news

occurs when the CEO is on a longer trip of at least five work days. Collectively these estimates


         9
            The fraction of late filings is especially high when financial results are released to investors when CEOs are at
their vacation homes: in 4 out of these 36 cases, or 11%, a company announces earnings news to the market but then files
the required Form 8-K one week (five business days) or more later. Given that the triggering events for these filings
occur due to public announcements already made, the late Forms 8-K in this category probably have little impact on
investors. The frequency with which other items occurring during CEO vacations lead to late Form 8-K filings are
generally quite close to the overall rate of 6% exhibited for triggering events during the subsample of vacation days.

                                                             33
are consistent with a conclusion that CEO vacations tend to lengthen the time taken by

companies to release material news to the public.



C.      Implications for investors

        The analysis above suggests two broad implications for a company’s shareholders. First,

firms’ disclosures of news appear to depend significantly upon CEOs’ personal travel schedules.

When CEOs are away on vacation trips, less news is disclosed and certain regulatory filings are

delayed. It is possible that these patterns apply to work-related as well as leisure-related

absences, but the paper lacks an identification strategy for differentiating these types of trips. As

noted in the literature review section above, companies may expose their investors to adverse

financial consequences when the quality of disclosure deteriorates. Firms may face higher costs

of capital, less liquidity for their shares, heightened ligitation risk, and ultimately, lower

valuation of their securities.

        In addition, the analysis suggest the presence of systematic profit opportunities related to

CEOs’ easily observable travel schedules, since stock prices appear to follow predictable patterns

when CEOs leave for vacation and later return. The data collection for this paper suggests that

traders could obtain information about CEO trips in real time simply monitoring Internet air

traffic websites. By taking a long position in a company’s stock for several days after a CEO

returns from a trip, an investor could outgain the market indexes by 0.20% per day, an annualized

“alpha” of about 64% per year. Along with the large daily abnormal returns, investors could

speculate on the systematic changes in volatility that appear to occur when a CEO is away on a

lengthy trip. To profit from this pattern, a trader would want to sell short derivative securities


                                                  34
with a high price sensitivity to volatility, or vega, when the CEO’s aircraft flies form

headquarters to the CEO’s vacation home, and then do the opposite when the CEO flies back.

With an appropriate portfolio, these strategies could be implemented on a delta-neutral basis,

with no sensitivity to the underlying stock price. The tools for these strategies, such as

“straddles” and “strangles” involving put and call options, are widely taught to MBA finance

students and are easily implemented by traders on the exchanges. See Chaput and Ederington

(2005).

          Given the ease of observing a CEOs’ travel, the existence of these patterns of abnormal

returns and volatility seems surprising. The results imply that shareholders do not make the

small investments needed to acquire detail about managers’ travels or do not recognize the value

of the information. One obstacle could undermine investors’ ability to track CEO aircraft

movements: companies have a right to prevent their aircraft tail numbers from appearing on

public Internet sites. Congress passed legislation creating the Block Aircraft Registration

Request (BARR) program in 2000 allowing companies to opt out of live tracking sites for

security reasons, in order to frustrate potential terrorists or kidnappers. Currently the scope of the

BARR program is under reconsideration by the FAA, Congress, and the Obama administration.10

However, even if tail numbers were blocked from public Internet sites, they can be matched with

company operators either in the FAA’s online registry or by making Freedom of Information Act


          10
             Between 2000 and 2009, the FAA allowed any private aircraft operator to opt out of public tracking
databases for an expanded list of reasons including privacy and competitive secrecy, but this policy was reversed in 2009
after the agency was sued by a variety of media outlets seeking complete lists of tail numbers under the Freedom of
Information Act. The FAA elected to begin disclosing the identities of operators of aircraft with blocked tail numbers
(though not their flight records) in response to such requests in 2009, and a 2010 decision by a federal court rejected a
challenge by a business group to the FAA’s policy. See Grabell (2010). In August 2011 the FAA greatly reduced its
blocking of tail numbers but then reinstated the practice in December 2011, though not retroactively for aircraft that had
already been unblocked. See Federal Register vol. 76, no. 242, p. 78328 (December 16, 2011).

                                                           35
requests to the agency. Due to their large size, aircraft can also be observed physically taking off

and landing at airports by scouts stationed as “tailspotters,” a role played memorably by actor

Charlie Sheen in the 1987 feature film Wall Street.



V.     Conclusions

       This paper studies patterns of corporate news disclosures associated with CEOs’ personal

travel schedules. By merging records of corporate aircraft flights with information about the

location of CEOs’ vacation residences, I identify days when CEOs are likely to have been away

from their offices. I find regularities in stock price behavior consistent CEOs going away right

after important news disclosures, and then returning just before subsequent announcements. The

CEO’s first days back in the office often feature abnormally positive news. When the CEO takes

a long vacation trip lasting five work days or more, company stock volatility declines by

approximately 13% for the period he is away. Volatility increases to normal levels in a pattern

that begins one day before the CEO returns. Observing the movements of corporate aircraft to

and from the CEO’s vacation airport could therefore give investors valuable signals about

impending disclosures by companies. CEO absences also appear to affect regulatory compliance,

as mandatory Form 8-K disclosures of material company news are more likely to occur late if

news occurs while CEOs away at their vacation homes.

       The results suggest that corporations release news on a schedule determined not only by

when information may be important for investors, but also by the constraints of the CEO’s

personal schedule. However, a variety of tests above support additional hypotheses, suggesting

that delays in news announcements also occur simply due to the difficulty of involving a CEO in


                                                 36
decisions when he is a great distance from headquarters, and also because the CEO directly

produces much of a firm’s material news, and such events will inevitably occur less often if the

CEO takes time off for vacation.

Figure 1
Boeing Co. daily stock returns, January 2010
The figure shows daily returns for the stock of Boeing Co. minus returns for the CRSP value-
weighted market index for an interval of days during January 2010. On January 7 the company
announced that its commercial airliner deliveries had increased 28% for the prior year and also
issued an earnings forecast for the year ahead. On January 27 the company announced better-
than-expected earnings results for the 4th quarter of 2009. Little news of significance was
announced between those two dates, a period when the company’s CEO appears to have been
away from headquarters at his vacation home. Flight records for Boeing’s Executive Flight
Operations unit show that its Bombardier CL-600 corporate jet flew from its headquarters airport
near Chicago to Washington, DC on the night of January 7, then from Washington to Palm
Beach, FL, at mid-day January 8, returning to headquarters later than afternoon. On January 24,
the same aircraft flew from Chicago to Palm Beach and then back to the headquarters airport.
Boeing’s Chairman and CEO, W. James McNerney Jr., owns a vacation home in Hobe Sound,
FL, 34 miles from the Palm Beach airport, according to real estate records. Flight records are
obtained from The Wall Street Journal Jet Tracker database.

Table 1
Sample of CEOs’ trips to their vacation homes
The table presents descriptive statistics about 66 CEOs’ travel to their vacation homes. The
timing of trips is based upon flight records of corporate aircraft obtained from The Wall Street
Journal Jet Tracker database for the years 2007-2010. To appear in the sample, an executive
must be listed as CEO of an S&P500 firm by ExecuComp during this period, and he must own a
vacation property near a destination visited regularly by his company’s aircraft. Property
ownership is determined from real estate records available on Lexis-Nexis. Data for vacation
lengths are based upon weekdays when the U.S. stock market is open for trading and do not
include weekends or holidays. A travel day counts as part of a vacation trip if the aircraft takes
off from headquarters earlier than 4:00 p.m., or if the return flight lands at the headquarters
airport at 12:00 noon or later.

Table 2
Factors associated with CEO vacation days
The table presents probit regression models with the dependent variable equal to one if the CEO spends a
day at his vacation home. The sample includes data for 66 CEOs of S&P500 companies between 2007
and 2010, with observations included for all weekdays in which the CEO holds his position and the stock
market is open. The vacation day indicator equals one for days on which the CEO is out of the office at
his vacation home, as determined from a database of corporate aircraft flight records maintained by the
Federal Aviation Administration. Data about CEO characteristics is obtained from the ExecuComp
database. Total compensation is the TDC1 quantity reported by ExecuComp. Weather data at the
location of the CEO’s vacation home is obtained from the National Climatic Data Center website. The
Ski House indicator variable equals 1 during the October-March period for CEOs who own vacation
homes in Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho. Standard errors robust to serial correlation and
heteroskedasticity appear in parentheses below each coefficient estimate.

Table 3
Abnormal stock returns
The table presents Fama-French four-factor models of company stock returns estimated by
ordinary least squares. The dependent variable equals the daily stock returns for a sample of 65
companies between 2007 and 2010. The four factors are the return on the market portfolio minus
the risk-free rate (MktRF), the difference in returns for portfolios of growth vs. value stocks
(HML), the difference in returns for portfolios of small vs. large stocks (SMB), and the difference
in returns for portfolios of rising minus falling stocks (UMD). All returns are compounded
continuously. The vacation day indicator equals one for days on which the CEO is out of the
office at his vacation home, as determined from a database of corporate aircraft flight records
maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration. Long vacations are those of five work days
or longer. The indicator for days prior to long vacation equals 1 for each of the three days
preceding a long vacation. The indicator for days following long vacation equals 1 for the
second, third, and fourth days after a long vacation ends. Standard errors clustered by company
appear in parentheses below each coefficient estimate.

Table 4
Stock volatility and frequency of news announcements for subsamples of trading days
The table shows realized stock volatility and frequencies of significant news announcements for
subsamples of trading days for 65 large companies between 2007 and 2010. CEO vacation
schedules are inferred from corporate aircraft flight records maintained by the Federal Aviation
Administration. Volatilities are calculated as the standard deviations of continuously
compounded daily stock returns, annualized by multiplying by the square root of 252, the number
of trading days in a typical year. Dates of news announcements and earnings releases are
obtained from the Thomson Reuters Significant Developments database. A long vacation is one
lasting five or more work days. A ski trip is one occurring between October and March at a
Western ski resort destination. All of the estimated long vacation day volatilities are different
from the volatility on the CEOs’ days in the office at very low significance levels according to F-
tests. Similarly, all of the vacation day news frequencies are significantly different from the
office day news frequency at very low levels according to t-tests.

Table 5
Stock volatilities for individual companies
The table shows average intra-day stock volatilities for 48 companies on days that the CEOs are on long vacation tripss and days that the CEOs
are in the office. A long vacation is defined as a trip to the CEO’s vacation home for at least five consecutive working days. Office days are all
days excluding both long and short trips to the vacation home. Trips are inferred from flight records of corporate aircraft maintained by the
Federal Aviation Administration. The sample period includes all trading days between 2007 and 2010 for which the individual manager served in
the CEO position. Eighteen additional firms are in the sample, but their CEOs do not take any long vacation trips during the sample period. The
right column shows the ratio for each company between the average volatilities on office days and long vacation days. Intra-day volatilities are
calculated using stock price data based on five-minute trading intervals.

Table 6
Bivariate probit estimates of CEO vacation days and significant company news days
The table presents bivariate probit regression estimates in which the probabilities of CEO vacation days and significant company news
announcements are modeled jointly. Panel A shows estimates for a bivariate model in which the vacation day indicator appears as an
explanatory variable in the news equation, and Panel B shows estimates for a bivariate September 19, 2013 model in which the
significant news day indicator appears as an explanatory variable in the vacation equation. The models are identified by using weather
variables from the vacation site as instruments for CEO vacation days, and by using the daily change in the company’s realized stock
volatility as an instrument for significant news announcements. The sample includes data for 66 CEOs of S&P500 companies
between 2007-10, with observations included for all weekdays in which the CEO holds his position and the stock market is open. The
vacation day indicator equals one for days on which the CEO is out of the office at his vacation home, as determined from a database
of corporate aircraft flight records maintained by the Federal Aviation Administration. The significant news indicator equals one for
days on which the company makes a quarterly earnings announcement or releases significant news, according to the Thomson Reuters
Significant Developments database. CEO ownership and compensation data is obtained from the ExecuComp database. Weather data
is obtained from the National Climatic Data Center website. Realized volatility is calculated using intra-day returns at five-minute
intervals. Standard errors robust to serial correlation and heteroskedasticity appear in parentheses below each coefficient estimate.

Table 7
Bivariate probit estimates for subsamples of internal and external news days

The table presents bivariate probit regression estimates in which the probabilities of CEO
vacation days and significant company news announcements are modeled jointly. The sample
includes data for 66 CEOs of S&P500 companies between 2007-10, with observations included
for all weekdays in which the CEO holds his position and the stock market is open. The vacation
day indicator equals one for days on which the CEO is out of the office at his vacation home, as
determined from a database of corporate aircraft flight records maintained by the Federal
Aviation Administration. The significant news indicator equals one for days on which the
company makes a quarterly earnings announcement or releases significant news, according to the
Thomson Reuters Significant Developments database. In the left column, the news variable is
restricted to announcements that originate within the company, and observations are dropped
when news is generated by external sources such as governments, courts of law, plaintiffs’
lawyers, ratings agencies, or shareholder activists. In the right column, the news variable equals
one when news is generated by these external sources, and observations are dropped for days on
which the company announces news generated internally. The models include the full range of
independent variables and also the same instrumental variables used in Table 6.

                                                         News = 1 for          News = 1 for

Table 8
Timing of Form 8-K filings

The table presents regression estimates for models of how quickly companies file required Form
8-K disclosures of material news developments with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
In most cases companies must file Form 8-K within four business days of a triggering event, and
columns 1 and 3 present estimates from Poisson maximum likelihood models of the days elapsed
between the event and the filing. Columns 2 and 4 present estimates from probit models in
which the dependent variable equals 1 if a company misses the four-day filing deadline. The
model includes 2,784 observations for Form 8-K filings by 65 companies between 2007-2010.
The Poisson models exclude the 78 cases in which firms did not comply with the four-day filing
deadline. Filings made after 4:00 p.m. are counted as having occurred on the next business day.
Data are obtained from the S&P Filing Dates database. Standard errors robust to serial
correlation and heteroskedasticity appear in parentheses below each coefficient estimate.
