We update Rose and Spiegel (2009a, b) and search for simple quantitative models of macroeconomic
and financial indicators of the “Great Recession” of 2008-09. We use a cross-country approach and
examine a number of potential causes that have been found to be successful indicators of crisis intensity
by other scholars. We check a number of different indicators of crisis intensity, and a variety of different
country samples. While countries with higher income seemed to suffer worse crises, we find few clear
reliable indicators in the pre-crisis data of the incidence of the Great Recession. Countries with current
account surpluses seemed better insulated from slowdowns.

Introduction


        In the Spring of 2009, we collected a cross‐country data set that we used for a number of

purposes in Rose and Spiegel (2010a, b, hereafter “RS”). We were primarily interested in seeing which

of the many possible causes of the “Great Recession” of 2008‐09 could be linked empirically to the

actual crisis. A large number of causes had been suggested as potential fundamental reasons for the

global crisis which broke out in 2008. Our approach was purely cross‐sectional; any plausible theory of

the crisis should at least be able to explain its incidence across countries (we think of understanding the

timing of the crisis as a substantially more difficult exercise). We considered the cross‐country exercise

to be intrinsically interesting, since there was no consensus at the time on the cause(s) for the crisis.

Our reasoning was that if, for example, excessive house‐price appreciation was “the fundamental”

cause of the crisis (feel free to substitute financial leverage, credit growth, current account imbalance,

or whatever), it should explain the incidence and severity of the crisis in a number of different countries,

not just one. Determining the fundamental causes of the crisis would also be valuable in building a

quantitative “early warning system” (EWS) of the sort that the G‐20 had advocated. In the large, our

analysis failed; we were essentially unable to find an empirical model of the crisis that could link any

plausible set of potential causes of the crisis to its manifestations. We found that richer countries had

systematically worse experiences, as did countries which experienced a sharper rise in the stock market

in the years before the crisis. There was also some weak evidence that countries with closer trade

linkages to the United States experienced less severe crises.


        In this short paper, we update our analysis and check to see if our conclusions our robust to the

arrival of more recent information. We use two types of new information: updated data and, more

importantly, the emerging literature of relevance.


The Data Set


                                                      1
        The analysis we report below is conducted on the same broad cross‐section of countries as RS.

In particular, we examine all countries/territories with real GDP per capita of at least $10,000 in 2003, as

well as those with real GDP per capita of at least $4,000 and a population of at least one million. Our

sample of countries is tabulated in Appendix Table A1.1


        We begin by re‐estimating the key results of our original work with updated data.


Updating the MIMIC Model


        In RS we used a non‐structural MIMIC (Multiple Indicator Multiple Cause) model of the crisis.

This model uses different manifestations of the severity of the crisis across countries, each of which is

viewed as an imperfect proxy for crisis intensity. Real GDP growth in 2008 was an obvious indicator of

the crisis, and we used the forecasts (technically, backcasts) for 2008 real GDP growth that were

available in early March 2009 from the Economist Intelligence Unit. Since financial variables are

intrinsically forward‐looking and the crisis was financial in nature, we also used three different

manifestations from different financial markets. In particular, we used 2008 changes in: a) the national

stock market (from national sources), and b) the multilateral (SDR) exchange rate (from the IMF’s

International Financial Statistics), as well as c) the difference in country credit ratings between March

2008 and March 2009 as measured by Institutional Investor. The latter are ratings created by

Institutional Investor that rank over 170 countries on a scale between 0 and 100 where 100 represents

the least likelihood of default (in March 2010, Norway, Luxembourg and Switzerland had scores over 90,

while Haiti scored less than 20).2 These four variables collectively seem to deliver a reasonable view of

the countries most affected by the 2008 crisis. For instance, Iceland always appears as the country most

dramatically affected by the crisis, along with countries like Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Ireland and the UK.


        In RS, we also considered a host of potential causes of the crisis, all dated 2006 and earlier. Our

reasoning was that this would be a data frequency of interest to policy‐makers, since higher‐frequency

                                                     2
early warning systems may not provide enough time for policy to respond appropriately. Using 2006

data to measure potential causes also allows one to escape much of the endogeneity bias that might

result from using later data, since policy authorities responded forcefully to the crisis. In RS, we

considered both national causes of the crisis and a larger number of international linkages between

countries and the countries that could plausibly be considered as the epi‐centers of the crisis. For

example, in trying to determine why Iceland experienced a 90% drop in both its stock market and

exchange rate in 2008 (as well as a substantial drop in its country credit rating and a domestic

recession), we considered both national features of Iceland’s economy (e.g., its credit/GDP rating) and

international linkages between Iceland and say the United States, a plausible epi‐center of the crisis

(e.g., the share of 2006 Icelandic external assets held in America and the share of Icelandic exports going

to the US). However we found only two reasonably robust positive results. We found that richer

countries experienced more dramatic crises, as did countries with a larger run‐up in the stock market

(measured relative to output) before the crisis. We also found weaker evidence that countries with

closer trade linkages to the United States also experienced somewhat milder crises. In the analysis that

follows, we consider all three of these potential causes of the crisis.


        We have since updated our 2008 stock market and exchange rate observations in a

straightforward way, from national sources and IFS respectively. Since 2010 country credit ratings have

not yet been released (as of late May 2010) for Institutional Investor, we instead use comparable

country risk ratings from Euromoney, a comparable trade magazine.3 For real GDP growth, we use the

estimates for 2008 and 2009 growth taken from the most recent national “Country Reports” produced

by the Economist Intelligence Unit as of April 29, 2010. We thus have both more data (since we have

2009 as well as 2008 growth rates) and better data (since the quality of the 2008 data has been

improved by the hindsight another year affords). Of course these changes to the data set, however

welcome, may not be that important. Our 2008‐09 series are extremely highly correlated with our 2008

                                                      3
series, as is shown in Figure 1. This contains four scatter‐plots, one for each of the different

consequences of the crisis (growth, as well as the changes in the stock market, exchange rate, and

country bond rating). The correlations between the 2008 and 2008‐09 series are all high, ranging from

.69 (for stock market growth) to .82 (for GDP growth).


        We link the manifestations of the Great Recession to causes using a Multiple Indicator Multiple

Cause (MIMIC) model. The MIMIC model was introduced to econometrics by Goldberger (1972). The

model consists of two sets of equations:


                 yi,j = βjζi + νi                                                                         (1)


                 ζi = γkxi,k + ζi                                                                         (2)


where: yi,j is an observation on crisis indicator j for country i, xi,k is an observation for potential crisis

cause k for country i; ξi is a latent variable representing the severity of the crisis for country i; β and γ are

vectors of coefficients, and ν and ζ are mutually uncorrelated well‐behaved disturbances with zero

means and constant variances.4 Equation (1) links J consequences and manifestations of the crisis

(denoted by y) to the unobservable measure of crisis severity. In practice, we model this measurement

equation using our ( J  4 ) indications of the crisis (the 2008‐09 national changes in: a) real GDP, b) the

stock market, c) country risk, and d) the exchange rate). The second equation models the determination

of the crisis as a function of K causes (x’s, dated 2006 or earlier).


        By substituting (2) into (1), one derives a model which is no longer a function of the latent

variable ξ. This MIMIC model is a system of J equations with right‐hand‐sides restricted to be

proportional to each another. These proportionality restrictions constrain the structure to be a “one‐

factor” model of the latent variable; with the addition of normalization, they achieve identification of

the parameters in (1) and (2). One of the features of the MIMIC model is that it explicitly incorporates


                                                        4
measurement error about a key variable – the incidence and severity of the crisis – in a non‐trivial and

plausible way. We estimate our MIMIC models in STATA with GLLAMM; Rabe‐Hesketh et al (2004)

provide further details. The iterative estimation technique begins with adaptive quadrature which is

followed by Newton‐Raphson. We normalize and achieve identification by imposing a factor loading of

unity on the stock market change.


        In RS, we examined more than one hundred possible national determinants of the crisis (x’s)

suggested by the literature. We found that only two variables worked consistently well; the natural

logarithm of 2006 real GDP per capita, and the percentage change in the stock market between 2003

and 2006. We also found weaker evidence that 2006 bilateral trade between a country and the United

States (the likely epi‐center of the 2008 crisis), measured as a proportion of the country’s total 2006

trade, can be linked to crisis intensity. In particular, richer countries and countries which had

experienced a larger stock market run‐up seemed to suffer more serious crises. The same is true of

countries less dependent on trade with the United States, though the evidence is weaker for the last

finding. We use these three variables as our default “causes” of the 2008‐09 crisis.


        In the column at the extreme left of Table 1, we estimate our MIMIC model again, but now using

2008‐09 data on crisis manifestations and our three causes. Our updated results are quite similar to

those of RS in both economic and statistical terms. The effects of both real GDP per capita and the stock

market run‐up are negative and statistically significant; more of either is associated with a worse crisis.

More American trade seemed to reduce crisis intensity, though the effect is only significantly different

from zero at (a whisker) greater than the .1 level.


New Results from the Literature


        While our original results seem to stand up to the scrutiny provided by extra data, we do not

pursue them further here. A literature has since sprung up which diverges from our methodology in

                                                      5
four respects: a) the measure of crisis intensity (the dependent variable); b) the potential causes of the

crisis (the covariates); c) the estimation procedure used to link potential causes and consequences of

the crisis; and d) the sample of countries under consideration. In order to see whether our results are

incompatible with those of others, we now follow more closely in the steps of the literature.


Measures of Crisis Intensity


        One of the attractions of the MIMIC model to us is the fact that it models the crisis as being

imperfectly reflected through a number of measures. However, the norm in the subsequent literature

has been to model the crisis using a single measure, typically some function of GDP growth. For

instance, Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) model real GDP growth over 2008‐09; Blanchard et al (2010)

use growth between 2008Q4 and 2009Q1 from which they subtract average growth over 1995‐2007;

and Berkmen et al (2009) use the revision to the forecast of 2009 growth made between the Springs of

2008 and 2009 (Giannone et al (2010) and Claessens et al (2010) use other functions of GDP). It should

be noted that such measures of crisis intensity are almost always real; modeling measures of financial

distress is rare (though see Claessens et al, 2010).


        Rather than restrict ourselves to a single cross‐country measure of the crisis, we cast our net

widely, and examine seven measures, all of which are continuous.5 Our default measure of crisis

intensity is real GDP growth for 2008‐09, taken from the EIU Country Reports. RS were criticized for not

taking account of underlying growth trends, so we also consider both: a) the change in growth between

2005‐07 and 2008‐09; and b) the change in growth between 1990‐07 and 2008‐09, following the logic of

e.g., Blanchard et al (2010) and Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010). We also follow Berkmen et al (2010) in

considering growth revisions; we consider the difference between the April 2008 World Economic

Outlook forecast for 2009 real GDP growth and the forecast for 2009 real GDP growth made in the April

2009 WEO. A fifth measure of the extent of the crisis is the 2009 output gap as estimated in the


                                                       6
November 2009 OECD Economic Outlook, though this measure is only available for OECD members.

Next we consider consumption growth for 2008‐09 following Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010);

consumption is more directly relevant for welfare than output growth. Our last measure of cross‐

country crisis intensity is a combination of the four variables we used in RS. In particular, we examine

the first principal factor extracted from 2008‐09 changes in the SDR exchange rate, the national stock

market, real GDP, and Euromoney country risk ratings.6


        All seven crisis measures that we consider are positively correlated with each other, but the

measures are by no means identical. Figure 2 provides a comprehensive set of scatter‐plots of each of

our seven cross‐country measures of crisis intensity graphed against the others; the bivariate correlation

coefficients are recorded in Table 2.7


Causes of the Crisis


        After choosing a measure of crisis intensity (e.g., 2008‐09 GDP growth), researchers have

attempted to link their chosen dependent variable to potential causes of the crisis. These crisis

determinants are often measured using data that precedes the crisis, as would be required in a

functional EWS. For instance, in RS, we attempted to link over 100 potential crisis causes dated 2006

and earlier to crisis manifestations from 2008. A large number of different causes have been

investigated, usually with limited success. A consensus seems to be developing that it is extremely

difficult to understand the intensity of the crisis across countries using simple quantitative models.

However, there are some successes.


        Claessens et al (2010) find that only a few conditions preceded the crisis can be linked to the

measures of performance during the crisis. In particular, they find that only house‐price appreciation,

bank credit growth, and the size of the current account can be sensibly and robustly linked to crisis

incidence. Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) and Berkmen et al (2009) also consider a large number of

                                                     7
crisis causes and effects; both corroborate the finding that cumulative credit growth and fixed exchange

rates affect crisis severity. Adrian and Shin (2008) provide a relevant discussion of credit growth.

Berkmen et al (2009) also find that countries with greater financial leverage experienced worse crises,

while Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) find the current account is relevant for understanding crisis

intensity; we had some success with both variables in RS. Giannone et al (2010) provide robust

evidence that countries with more liberal credit market regulations suffered more serious crises. Both

Blanchard et al (2010) and Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) find that countries whose trading partners

declined further during the crisis fared worse themselves. Blanchard et al (2010) demonstrate that the

fraction of GDP held in short‐term external debt is closely negatively linked to growth for developing

countries. Frankel and Saravelos (2010) have some success with various measures of international

reserves; Obstfeld et al (2009) find that reserves are of help in understanding depreciation during the

period. A large number of other potential causes have been investigated but cannot be reliably linked to

the crisis, including: the size of credit and debt in the economy; features of the domestic banking sector;

fiscal policy; and foreign integration via both trade and capital flows. Many researchers (including

Claessens et al (2010), Giannone et al (2010), Frankel and Saravelos (2010), and Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti

(2010)) corroborate RS in finding that countries with higher levels of real GDP per capita experienced

more severe crises.


Investigating Potential Crisis Causes One by One


        We now investigate the relevance of all the variables suggested by the literature as potential

cross‐country causes of the great recession. We begin by including them as covariates of crisis intensity,

one by one (this should help alleviate multicollineaity problems). In RS we used a non‐linear MIMIC

procedure, but we follow the literature in using least squares since it prevailed as the estimation

strategy of choice. Thus we use OLS to estimate equations of the form:



                                                     8
                 yi = φxi + εi                                                                        (3)


where φ is a reduced‐form coefficient linking a pre‐crisis cause of the crisis (x) to a crisis manifestatation

(y) and ε is a well‐behaved disturbance.


        We estimate our equations for a variety of different samples. We do this to check for sample

sensitivity, to be able to compare our results easily with the literature, and to ensure that negative

results do not stem from mixing together heterogeneous groups of countries. We examine six different

samples of countries. Our full sample consists in up to 107 countries/territories that are either rich (real

GDP per capita of at least $10,000 in 2003) or reasonably well‐off and large (real GDP per capita of at

least $4,000 and a population of at least one million). We also restrict this sample to consider five more

narrow alternatives: a) 51 countries that the World Bank judges to be “high income”; b) 74 countries

that are not considered by the IMF to be “advanced economies”; c) 89 countries that are not major oil

exporters; d) 91 countries that are not small financial centers; and e) 51 countries that are either high or

upper‐middle income countries and are neither oil exporters nor small financial centers. The full sample

of countries (along with relevant characteristics) is tabulated in Appendix Table A1.8


        The nine panels of Table 3 each investigate one of the nine causes of the crisis that researchers

have been able to link successfully to the intensity of the crisis. For instance, Table 3a examines

whether countries with fixed exchange rate regimes seem to experience more intense crises. Successive

panels of Table 3 report the effects of: the 2006 current account/GDP ratio; 2005‐07 growth in trading

partners; the 2006 degree of credit market regulation; the 2006 ratio of short‐term external debt to

GDP; the 2000‐06 change in real housing prices; the 2000‐06 growth in bank credit measured as a

fraction of GDP; the 2006 level of bank credit, again measured as a fraction of GDP; and international

reserves, also as a fraction of GDP.9




                                                      9
        There are seven rows in each panel of Table 3, one for each of the seven different measures of

crisis intensity (2008‐09 real GDP growth, the 2009 output gap, etc.). There are also six different

columns, one for each of the different sample of countries (all, high‐income countries, etc.). Thus there

are (6x7=) 42 coefficient estimates tabulated, along with robust standard errors. Each of these

coefficients is taken from a separate cross‐country OLS regression; these regressions also included an

unreported intercept and control for the natural logarithm of 2006 real GDP per capita. Coefficients

that are significantly different from zero at the .05 (.01) significance level are marked with one (two)

asterisk(s).


        The results of Table 3 show that it is not trivial to link some plausible causes of the crisis to its

intensity across countries, at least in a robust fashion. For instance, we have little success linking crises

to fixed exchange rate regimes; the same is true of the effect of pre‐crisis trading partner growth, and

the ratio of credit to GDP. International reserves also do not seem to have consistent strong effects.10

But we do have some successes. Countries with pre‐crisis current account surpluses seemed to weather

the Great Recession better, as did countries which had experienced lower growth in bank credit

beforehand. Like Giannone et al (2010), we find that countries with more liberal credit market regulation

experienced significantly worse crises.11 The effects of the current account, credit growth, and credit

market regulation are all somewhat sensitive to the exact country sample and measure of crisis

intensity. Countries which have experienced more of a runup in the real housing price and those with

more short‐term external debt also seem to suffer worse crises, though the number of observations we

have for both measures is limited (short‐term external debt data is only available for 52 developing

countries, and we use the 45 observations on real housing prices available from Claessens et al (2010)).12


        To summarize, we find that some of the variables explored in the literature are correlated with

crisis intensity across countries in our sample. The current account, credit market regulation, and credit



                                                      10
growth are widely available variables which are associated with crisis in the Table 3 results; the fraction

of GDP held in short‐term external debt and the runup in real housing prices also seem to work, but are

only available for a small number of countries.13


Combining Potential Crisis Causes Together Simultaneously


        The results in Table 3 can be criticized, since they only control for the level of real GDP. Further,

the potential causes are investigated one by one, not simultaneously. We now handle both those

problems.


        In Table 4, we include all of the potential causes of the crisis that we found to be successful in

Table 3 and have large number of observations. In particular, we include simultaneously: a) the 2006

current account, expressed as a percentage of GDP; b) the 2006 credit market regulation, and c) bank

credit growth between 2000 and 2006 (as a percentage of GDP). We also include as controls the three

variables that we found to be successful in RS, namely: a) the log of 2006 real GDP per capita; b) the

growth in a country’s stock market/GDP ratio between 2003 and 2006; and c) the proportion of a

country’s trade going to the United States in 2006. Simple bivariate scatter‐plots of growth against each

of six regressors are provided in Figure 3. There are seven rows in Table 4, one for each of the seven

different measures of crisis intensity (our dependent variable).


        The results of Table 4 are sobering for those who believe in the viability of such cross‐country

early warning systems. None of the measures of crisis intensity is explained precisely; the equations do

not fit the data well. The right‐hand side variables have only been included after a fairly arduous

process of winnowing, and yet a number seem to be insignificant when included simultaneously. For

instance, neither the pre‐crisis stock market run, nor trade linkages with the United States have

significant effects on crisis intensity in any of the seven reported regressions. Other variables are almost

as weak; the effect of bank credit growth is significant at the 5% level in one of the seven regressions,

                                                     11
while the current account and income effects are different from zero at conventional levels in only two.

The only variable that seems to have a robust effect is that of the degree of credit market regulation,

which is significantly different from zero for six of the seven regressands. The crisis measure that can be

most closely linked with the data is simple 2008‐09 GDP growth; it is intuitively and strongly affected by

three pre‐crisis variables (2006 real per capita income, the current account and credit market

regulations). Accordingly, we pursue this measure of crisis intensity in the analysis which follows.14


        In Table 5a, we examine whether the links between 2008‐09 growth and the six key regressors

are robust to changes in the sample of countries. The default sample of all countries with available data

is reported in the top row; this simply reproduces the top row of Table 4. The rows below present

results for the five other samples of interest to us. Unfortunately even reasonable changes to the

precise sample of countries have a large effect on the coefficient estimates. For instance, the significant

effect of the current account vanishes almost entirely when the sample is changed, as is the effect of

real income. Indeed, the only effect which is significantly different from zero in a majority of the

samples is the negative effect of credit market regulation. Not all the news is negative; the goodness of

fit varies little across samples, as do the signs (though not magnitudes) of most of the coefficients.


        Table 5b adds the two extra regressors of interest to the equation, using the full sample of

available observations. Only the negative effect of short‐term external debt survives, and its presence

reduces the sample size considerably (since it is only available for developing countries), simultaneously

knocking out the effects of the current account and real income.


        The results in Table 6a show that even focusing the regressions more narrowly on these results

still leaves an equation which is sensitive to the exact sample of countries. Only the external short‐term

debt ratio enters in a consistently robust fashion. On the other hand, weighting the regressions by a

country’s population has little effect, as shown in Table 6b.


                                                     12
        Is the absence of strong results the result of some non‐linearity in the data which has not been

modeled in our linear equations? While the graphical evidence in Figure 3 makes us skeptical about

such a claim, we now pursue a semi‐parametric approach to tease out any non‐linearities of relevance.


        We focus on the four regressors that seemed most highly correlated with (in Tables 5 and 6)

and relevant for understanding real 2008‐09 growth: the current account/GDP ratio, credit market

regulations, log real GDP per capita, and short term external debt/GDP ratio, all measured in 2006. We

search for non‐linearities variable by variable using a general non‐parametric technique. However, we

also take account of the potential linear effects of the (three) other key regressors. We follow a tedious

but straightforward procedure. First, we choose a regressor of interest; say the current account/GDP

ratio. Next, we account for the effects of the other regressors (credit market regulations, …) by

regressing 2008‐09 growth on these other regressors, and retrieving the residual. Similarly, we regress

the current account ratio on the other factors and take the residual. Finally, we regress the growth

residual on the current account residual – both now purged of the effects of other regressors – using the

non‐parametric “locally weighted regression” technique which can capture arbitrary non‐linearities. We

plot fitted LWR relationships in Figure 4. There are four graphs, one for each key regressor.15

Unfortunately, no obvious threshold effects or useful non‐linearities are apparent in Figure 4.


Extending the Sample Period


        Suppose that one ignores the sensitivity of the results in Tables 4‐6 and focuses only the positive

results. The message one might be tempted to draw is that countries with current account surpluses,

and more tightly regulated financial systems suffered less extreme crises in 2008‐09, after controlling for

the level of real GDP per capita. Do these empirical findings characterize other global downturns?


        The panels of Table 7 are analogues to Table 6, for different worldwide downturns. After having

grown for years at around 3.7%, the world economy turned down sharply; in 1991, global output growth

                                                    13
fell to 1.5%. The downturn was particularly pronounced among the advanced economies, and persisted

through 1992 (and indeed 1993). Accordingly, where Table 6 uses data for a cross‐section of countries

during the “Great Recession” of 2008‐09, Table 7a examines the global slowdown of 1991‐92. Another,

more shallow, global slowdown occurred in 2001‐02 when the growth of the world economy slowed to

2.3% after previously growing at 3.7% (again, this event disproportionately hit richer economies).

Accordingly, Table 7b is an analogue for the slowdown of 2001‐02. Both panels of Table 7 use the three

variables that most successfully captured growth in Tables 5 and 6, namely the current account/GDP

ratio, the degree of credit market regulation, and the level of real GDP per capita (we interpret the latter

as a control). In all cases, these variables are measured for the year before the worldwide slowdown

occurred, and the estimation is done for the six different samples of countries examined in Table 5a.


        The estimates of Table 7 show that even the best estimates gleaned from Tables 5 and 6 may

not be particularly stable over time (even focusing on global recessions that are only clearly seen ex

post). Countries with large current account deficits seemed to suffer more in the Great Recession, but

not in the 2001‐02 slowdown when the effect is usually negative (but insignificant). Even more

strikingly, consider the single most robust result of the 2008‐09 analysis, namely the negative and

significant effect of the credit market regulation variable. For the two previous global recessions, the

effect is often positive and significantly so in a number of the samples; it is never significantly negative.

Such sample sensitivity reinforces our skepticism concerning the value of such exercises. Table A2 in the

appendix provides some corroborating sensitivity analysis; it reveals that neither credit growth nor

short‐term external debt play consistently important and negative roles in predicting growth.


Conclusion


        In our earlier research on early warning systems (Rose and Spiegel, 2010a, 2010b), we found

that it was difficult to reliably link macroeconomic or financial indicators from 2006 or earlier to a


                                                      14
variety of financial and real manifestations of the 2008 crisis. In this short paper, we show that this

negative finding seems robust, in particular to a number of apparent successes in the recent literature.

In particular, we examine the sensitivity of our findings to: a) new data available through the Spring of

2010; b) (seven) different measures of cross‐country crisis intensity; c) (eight) different potential causes

of the crisis that have worked for other researchers; d) (six) different country samples; and e) a different

estimation strategy. Despite a broad search, we have been unable to find consistent strong linkages

between pre‐existing variables that are plausible causes of the Great Recession and the actual intensity

of the recession. Our models just do not seem to fit the data well even “in sample” and the effects of

our wide range of potential causes cannot be estimated with reasonable precision. Perhaps this is

because crisis causes varied across countries. Perhaps “this time was different.” Either explanation

reinforces our skepticism about the feasibility of developing a forward‐looking early warning system.


        It is natural for economists to generalize from experiences of a few particularly salient countries

to make generalizations, though it is often inappropriate. Our poor regression results are simply telling

us that the pre‐conditions for the crisis in the United States (or Iceland, or Latvia, …) often do not

describe other countries particularly well. Credit growth was high before 2008 in Australia, Canada, and

South Africa, yet these countries seemed to have weathered the crisis well. Real housing prices actually

fell in Japan, Germany and Portugal, yet these countries were hard hit. Since it is difficult to understand

the cross‐country incidence of the great recession even in retrospect, we are dubious about the

potential for comparable “early warning” forecasting model going forward.

1
  We note in passing that the number of observations we have is small. This is not because we are taking a small
sample from a large population, but because the population itself is small.
2
  Institutional Investor states that their ratings “… are based on information provided by senior economists and
sovereign‐risk analysts at leading global banks and money management and securities firm”; further details are
available at: http://www.iimagazinerankings.com/rankingsRankCCMaGlobal09/methodology.asp.

   “To obtain the overall country risk score, Euromoney assigns a weighting to seven categories. These are political
risk (30% weighting), economic performance (30%), debt indicators (7.5%), debt in default or rescheduled (5%),
credit ratings (7.5%), access to bank finance/capital markets (10%), discount on forfaiting (10%).” Further details
are available at http://www.euromoney.com/Print.aspx?ArticleID=2404432. Switching from Institutional Investor
to Euromoney is done strictly for convenience; the correlation coefficient between the two sets of ratings is above
.95 in previous samples; we chose Institutional Investor only for RS only because it offers a slightly large sample,
and we showed in RS that our results were insensitive to the choice of Euromoney instead of Institutional Investor.
4
     Our normalization implies that the latent variable estimate should be interpreted as decreasing in crisis severity.
5
  One could imagine transforming any or all of our continuous variables intro discrete binary variables, as is
traditional for the banking and currency crisis literatures.
6
  Only the first of the four (unrotated) principal factors has an eigenvalue greater than one; the other three factors
are negative. The scoring weights and factor loadings are all intuitively signed, being positive on the changes in
growth, the stock market and country risk, and negative for the increase in the price of the SDR.
7
  These measures are also correlated with the crisis measure we used in RS, but not perfectly. For instance, we
found that the country with the most intense 2008 crisis was Iceland, but its 5.6% decline in real GDP over 2008‐09
made it only the fourteenth‐worst hit country using that metric (the Baltics shrank much more). Similarly,
Argentina was ranked by RS to be one of the top five crisis countries in 2008 primarily on financial criteria, but over
2008‐09 Argentina beat most other countries if one considers only growth.

  The World Bank defines high‐income countries as those with 2008 GNI per capita of at least $11,906, while
upper‐middle income countries are those income of at least $3,856; http://data.worldbank.org/about/country‐
classifications. The IMF’s groups are at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/groups.htm.
We follow Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) in defining oil exporters as the OPEC members in the sample along with
Bahrain, Brunei, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Kazakhstan, Oman, Russia, Trinidad & Tobago, and Turkmenistan. We
also follow Lane and Milesi‐Ferretti (2010) in their definition of small financial centers, but also add four countries
that are not in their sample (Bahamas, Barbados, Bermuda, and Netherlands Antilles).
9
  We have done considerable sensitivity analysis (available online) to ensure that our results are robust with
respect to slightly different measures of the regressor.
10
  We have also investigated four other ratios of reserves, comparing them to external debt, short‐term debt,
imports, and M2; we never find strong results.
11
  We have also examined the index of labor market regulation from the Economic Freedom of the World database
without success; it is rarely correlated with our measures of crisis incidence.
12
   It should be noted that the results of Table 3 contain considerable pre‐test bias, since we only pursued potential
crisis causes that had worked successfully for other scholars.

13
   After the first draft of this paper was written, Frankel and Saravelos (2010) found that various measures of
reserves seem to work in helping predict the cross‐country incidence of the 2008‐09 crisis using a variety of
manifestations of crisis severity. We have examined a number of different measures of reserves using our
techniques without much success.
14
  Sensitivity analysis available online presents comparable (often weaker) OLS results for the other crisis
measures. The four columns at the right of Table 1 record estimates when these regressors are added to the
MIMIC model.
15
  We use a bandwidth of .5, though changing this has little effect on our results. Also, we use the full sample of
observations and do not control for the short‐term external debt/GDP ratio in each of the graphs, except for the
lower‐right one (where we examine short‐term external debt itself).
