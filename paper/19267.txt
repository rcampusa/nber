The Natural Rate Hypothesis: An idea past its sell-by date

JEL No. E0,E24,E52

                                              ABSTRACT

Central banks throughout the world predict inflation with new-Keynesian models where, after a shock,
the unemployment rate returns to its so called "natural rate". That assumption is called the Natural
Rate Hypothesis (NRH). This paper reviews a body of work, published over the last decade, which
is critical of the NRH. I argue that the NRH does not hold in the data and I provide an alternative paradigm
that explains why it does not hold. I replace the NRH with the assumption that the animal spirits of
investors are a fundamental of the economy and I show how to operationalize that idea by constructing
an empirical model that outperforms the new-Keynesian Phillips curve. I model animal spirits with
a new fundamental that I call the belief function.
