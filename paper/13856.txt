                                             ABSTRACT

The efficiency of common law rules is central to achieving efficient resource allocation in a market
economy. While many theories suggest reasons why judge-made law should tend toward efficient
rules, the question whether the common law actually does converge in commercial areas has remained
empirically untested. We create a dataset of 465 state-court appellate decisions involving the application
of the Economic Loss Rule in construction disputes and track the evolution of law in this area from
1970 to 2005. We find that over this period the law did not converge to any stable resting point and
evolved differently in different states. We find that legal evolution is influenced by plaintiffs' claims,
the relative economic power of the parties, and nonbinding federal precedent.

I. Introduction.

       We investigate the evolution of a particular common law rule pertaining to the

construction industry, as developed by state appellate courts in the United States over the

last 35 or so years. Although the topic might at first glance appear esoteric, the evolution

and efficiency of legal rules are central to understanding any market economy. The

simplest way to see this is by going back to the Coase Theorem (Coase 1960). The

Theorem holds that, as long as initial property rights are well defined and private parties

whose behavior affects each other can freely negotiate and contract over their conduct,

they will agree to act efficiently. Such efficient behavior maximizes total surplus, which

parties can agree to divide via contract among themselves.

       But what if the parties cannot negotiate and contract (perhaps because of high

transaction costs), or have failed to do so? In those cases, efficient resource allocation

requires that underlying legal rules, such as the rules of liability, provide parties with

incentives to act efficiently. Such rules would steer parties to outcomes that mimic those

that the market would produce if transaction costs were low. In a common law system,

which prevails in most English-speaking nations, including the United States, legal rules

in a number of important fields, including torts, are created mainly by appellate judges as

a byproduct of deciding cases. Such rules are modified, and sometimes even reversed, in

subsequent decisions, so they evolve over time. If the rules are predictable and efficient,

but not otherwise, parties will act in an efficient manner even without contracting. For

this reason, the efficiency of common law rules is necessary for attaining efficient

resource allocation in a market economy.




                                                                                              2
         Scholars in law and economics have sought to understand why common law rules

might be efficient. Posner (1973) recognized the importance of this question, and argued

that appellate judges have personal incentives to maximize efficiency. Rubin (1977) and

Priest (1977) showed that because inefficient legal rules lead to inefficient economic

outcomes, they are more likely to be challenged in court. Such litigation is likely to drive

them out in favor of efficient rules, even when judges do not pursue efficiency. 1

         These arguments for efficiency do not come to grips with the legal realist and

critical legal studies criticism that judges have policy preferences other than social

welfare or disagree about what serves social welfare. Indeed, a considerable empirical

literature concludes that judges pursue political objectives (see, e.g., George and Epstein

(1992), Brenner and Spaeth (1995), Songer and Lindquist (1996), Hansford and Spriggs

(2006), and Landes and Posner (2007)). When judges follow personal policy preferences,

the case for the efficiency of common law is harder to make. Nevertheless, one can still

argue, in the spirit of Cardozo (1921), that the law evolves toward better rules through

sequential decisions of judges with diverse preferences (see also: Holmes (1897), Frank

(1930), Llewellyn (1951), Stone (1985), and Posner (2005)). 2

         Yet much of the discussion of the efficiency of legal rules remains theoretical,

with no empirical studies of how the law evolves in commercial fields that matter for the

efficiency of resource allocation. That is the gap we try to fill. The doctrine we have

chosen for our study is an important common law tort doctrine known as the “economic

 Gennaioli and Shleifer (2007) show, for example, that because appellate courts tend to distinguish prior
cases from current ones on the basis of information generated by the latter, rather than overruling the prior
cases and thus losing the knowledge generated by them, sequential decision making leads to the refinement
of the law over time, and thereby improves its efficiency on average even when full efficiency is not
attained.


                                                                                                            3
loss rule” (ELR). We study the application of the ELR to construction disputes. We ask

whether the courts have adhered to the ELR (with some standard exceptions that might be

necessary to make the rule efficient) in the construction industry, and, if not, how the

pattern of adherence and non-adherence has evolved.

         Stated at its broadest, the ELR holds that one cannot sue in tort for “economic

loss” unless that loss is accompanied by personal injury or property damage. (“Economic

loss” thus just means a loss that is not a personal injury or property damage.) So if the

builder of your house installs windows negligently with the result that they do not keep

out the rain, you cannot sue the builder in tort for the cost of re-installing the windows

carefully, because your loss is purely economic. 3 In contrast, if the water that seeps into

the house because of the badly installed windows damages your furniture (i.e., causes

damage to other property), then you can sue the builder in tort.

         The antecedents of ELR are very old, but the doctrine was first clearly articulated

in the 1960s and applied to disputes in the construction industry in the 1970s. 4 Most

construction activity is governed by contract, so the vast majority of construction disputes

are contract disputes. There are two principal types of case in which tort claims and

therefore the ELR become relevant in construction. In the first, a plaintiff property owner

sues in tort for economic loss when contracts or warranties have expired or are

unavailable, or when he simply wants to make additional claims. In the second scenario,

a builder sues other builders, architects, engineers, inspectors, or manufacturers for

damages resulting from the defendant’s alleged negligence. We investigate how state

  See Barrett (1989) for a discussion of early ELR cases in the construction industry. An important early
statement of the rule was Holmes’s opinion for the Supreme Court in Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v.
Flint, 275 U.S. 303, 308–310 (1927), an admiralty case.


                                                                                                            4
appellate courts, whose decisions constitute the precedents that shape common law, have

dealt with such cases.

         We have decided to examine the application of the ELR in the construction

industry for four reasons. First, construction disputes arise out of commercial relations,

and legal evolution in commercial law is our principal interest. Second, the industry is

mature. Any changes we observe in the ELR between its first clear articulation and the

present day cannot be attributed to changes in the underlying economic activity, but only

to changes internal to the legal system 5 . Third, there do not appear to be differences

across states in construction that might dictate different legal regimes. (This is important

because the common law of torts is for the most part a state prerogative. One state is not

required to decide construction cases the same way as any other state is—for that matter,

no state is required to make ELR a part of its law.) Thus both time-series and cross-

sectional analysis of ELR should be unaffected by variance in construction methods and

practices. Fourth, the doctrine is sufficiently recent to enable us to trace its evolution

under modern conditions, but old enough, and construction disputes common enough, to

have generated enough appellate cases 6 to allow an empirical analysis of its evolution.

Our sample contains 465 appellate decisions over 35 years: enough to reach some

tentative conclusions on how the law evolves but not so many as to make the project

unmanageable.

         To understand how the application of the ELR has evolved in construction

disputes, we examine three principal issues. First, we consider both the bright-line ELR

5
  In section V, we discuss some evidence that differences in state growth rates or state construction activity
cannot account for the differences in the application of the ELR that we document.
6
  Cases at the trial level are rarely decided in judicial opinions that explain the factual and legal issues fully.
And the opinions of trial judges have only very limited impact on the evolution of legal doctrine, because
trial-court opinions are not considered precedents, i.e., authorities, binding courts in subsequent decisions.


                                                                                                                 5
and the ELR with generally recognized exceptions as candidates for the efficient rule, and

ask whether the law achieves or moves toward either of them. Second, we ask more

generally whether the law converges over time to any resting point. If it does not, in an

environment that is basically stationary, it becomes harder to argue that the law tends

toward efficiency – whatever one’s view of efficiency is. The absence of a resting point is

not conclusive evidence of inefficiency. Although the environment may be stable,

disputes may still involve different facts, creating a process of continuous judicial

learning that generates a continuous adjustment of the rules. If the law is efficient and the

facts do not change, however, some tendency toward stability can be expected as a legal

doctrine matures. Third, we look at the evolution of the law in different jurisdictions.

Under the assumption that legal rules in the field of construction should not efficiently

vary across jurisdictions, large differences in the patterns of legal evolution across

jurisdictions would argue against an inference of efficient judicial rulemaking.

       To summarize the results, over our sample period the law did not converge to the

bright-line ELR, to the bright-line ELR with generally recognized exceptions (such as

fraud), or to any other resting point. While there is some tendency to convergence in the

first 25 years of the sample, in the last decade courts increasingly have limited the ELR in

construction by creating idiosyncratic exceptions to it – exceptions adopted in only a few

jurisdictions and rejected in others. Moreover, while adherence to the ELR in some form

grows in some states over time, in others it diminishes. These results are inconsistent with

simple theories of efficient judicial lawmaking.

       It might seem that judicial disagreement about the proper scope of the ELR makes

the doctrine unrepresentative as an object of study of legal efficiency by marking it as




                                                                                            6
controversial. In cases governed by less controversial doctrines, courts would find it

easier to agree on what would be efficient outcomes, and so there would be faster and

more complete convergence. But no one doubts that efficiency has some domain in law;

the interesting question is whether courts can converge to stable rules in the numerous

areas of law where there is room for disagreement about efficiency or equity. The ELR is

one such area.

        In the next section we spell out in more detail the ELR, its application to

construction, and the exceptions to the rule. Section III describes the data. In Section IV,

we present basic trends in state appellate courts regarding recovery for economic losses

in tort, as well as trends in the exceptions to these recoveries. We also discuss the

predictability of the law. Section V looks behind the trends to ask whether they reflect

changes in plaintiffs’ claims, the presence of explicit contracts, the economic power of

the parties, or leadership by the U.S. Supreme Court. We also check how much variation

there is across states. Section VI concludes.



II. The Economic Loss Rule in Construction Disputes.

        Although the term “Economic Loss Rule” is recent, the idea of barring recovery

in tort for a pure economic loss is not. 7 The immediate antecedent of the application of

the ELR in construction cases was its application in products liability cases. In the 1960s,


7
  An early U.S. case is Anthony v Slaid., 52 Mass. 290 (1846). The most famous case announcing the
fundamental principle is Ultramares Corp. v Touche, 255 N.Y. 170 (1931), in which Cardozo held that an
accountant owes no duty to third parties, such as lenders, to refrain from negligently causing economic
injury (from reliance on accountant’s reports). See also the Robins case, note 3 above, decided four years
before Ultramares. Feldthusen (2000) provides a detailed historical analysis of tort recovery for economic
losses in various common law countries. The arguments for limiting recovery in tort for economic loss are
analyzed in Bishop (1982), Rabin (1985), Goldberg (1994), and Posner (2006). The economic loss rule
exists in approximately its American form in England, but has much less purchase in Continental European
law. See Bussani and Palmer (2003).


                                                                                                        7
when the California Supreme Court was making groundbreaking decisions on the liability

of manufacturers for defective products, the question of liability in cases in which the

loss was purely economic, with no accompanying personal injury or property damage

(other than to the defective product itself), was bound to arise, and did. In Seely v White

Motor Co., 8 the court ruled on this issue. The plaintiff had purchased a truck with

defective brakes. The truck overturned, but the plaintiff was not hurt (nor did the accident

damage any other property). He sued in contract as well as in tort to recover repair costs

and lost profits. The court held that strict liability was not available and the plaintiff was

limited to warranty remedies. 9 In later rulings, the ELR was extended to negligence (as

distinct from strict liability) claims in product cases.

         The theoretical case for the efficiency of the ELR in situations similar to Seely,

including construction disputes, 10 rests on the possibility of anticipating problems

through contracts. Applied in situations of low transaction costs, the ELR encourages

parties to solve their potential problems through contracts. As Posner (1973) pointed out,

courts prefer parties to govern their relationships through privately negotiated contracts

rather than through tort suits whenever transaction costs are low enough, because the

parties know their business better than the judges can. He reiterated this logic as a judge

in upholding a bright-line ELR in Miller v United States Steel Corp.: “tort law is a

superfluous and inapt tool for resolving purely commercial disputes. We have a body of




8
  63 Cal. 2d 9 (1965).
9
  Seely actually recovered for both the repairs of the truck and lost profits under his warranty, but the case
is famous because the court established the legal rule with respect to recovery for economic loss in tort. We
discuss the role of contracts in the application of the ELR in Section V.
10
   In cases such as Ultramares, a crucial efficiency justification for the ELR is that it protects parties
engaged in normal business conduct from unpredictable tort claims from strangers if an accident occurs. In
construction disputes, the plaintiffs and the defendants are not strangers, so this argument does not apply.


                                                                                                            8
law designed for such disputes. It is called contract law.” 11 Thus the buyer of a house

who worries that it is poorly built should demand a warranty rather than repress his

concern and seek a remedy in tort should his fears materialize.

           This logic behind the ELR implies denial of monetary recovery to some persons

harmed by wrongful acts, and this troubles some courts. An example is the 1965 New

Jersey case of Santor v. A & M Karagheusian, Inc., 12 in which a consumer recovered tort

damages from a carpet manufacturer when he discovered that the carpet had a defect. The

dealer from whom he had bought the carpet had gone out of business before the

consumer realized that the defect could not be fixed, so the dealer’s warranty was of no

value to him; and there was no manufacturer’s warranty. We do not know whether the

New Jersey court was moved by an alternative view of efficiency or by sympathy for the

plaintiff, but it rejected the ELR.

           Even those convinced by the basic efficiency logic of the ELR recognize the need

for some exceptions. One generally recognized exception is fraud (the deliberate

infliction of an economic loss). Another is economic loss that accompanies a personal

injury or physical damage, as in a case in which a defectively installed window lets in

rain that damages furniture. These situations are difficult to anticipate and make

provision for by contract. In our empirical analysis, we keep track of such generally

recognized exceptions, bearing in mind that they may be efficient. The bright-line ELR is

one candidate for an efficient legal rule; the ELR with generally recognized exceptions is

another. And of course, some courts might not be persuaded by the economic logic of the

ELR, or might find the outcomes it yields repugnant, and in the latter case might create

     44 N.J. 52 (1965).


                                                                                           9
“idiosyncratic” exceptions. Idiosyncratic exceptions are applied inconsistently across

jurisdictions and sometimes overruled within the same jurisdiction.

        The application of the ELR to construction offers an interesting setting for

analyzing the behavior of appellate courts. We have a rule that is well-known and can be

justified using good efficiency arguments, but may leave some courts dissatisfied. We

have an environment unlikely to be changing over time and from state to state. We can

ask: what do courts do with this rule over time and space? Do their decisions converge

to, or at least move toward, an efficient resting point, which might be the bright-line ELR

or the ELR with generally recognized exceptions? Do their decisions converge over time

at all? Is the evolution of decisions in this area similar across states? Answers to these

questions would bear on the central questions regarding the efficiency of common law. In

the next few sections, we attempt to obtain these answers.



III. Data.

Overview of the Database

        We gathered data on 465 state-court appellate decisions in tort cases involving the

ELR (see Appendix for details). We have read all these cases and extracted our variables

from the judicial decisions. We coded the state in which the decision was rendered, the

date of the decision, and the level of the court (whether the state’s highest court or a

lower appellate court). We did not include information about individual judges. We

recorded the type of plaintiff and defendant. We divide parties into one of five general

categories: (1) property owner; (2) builder (such as general contractors and

subcontractors); (3) architect, engineer, or inspector; (4) manufacturer; and (5) other (real




                                                                                             10
estate agent, insurance company, or bank). We noted whether the plaintiff and the

defendant were parties to a contract and whether any contractual claims were made by the

plaintiff (breach of contract, breach of express warranty, or breach of implied warranty),

as well as the outcomes of such claims on trial and on appeal. Our primary interest,

however, is in the resolution of tort claims.

       Our data collection was motivated in part by the ambiguity of what should be

considered “efficient” in this context. One possible view is that efficiency calls for

applying the ELR with no exceptions at all (call this the strict view). Another is that

efficiency requires applying the ELR with the exceptions that are generally recognized by

most courts (call this the middle view). A third view holds that courts have vastly more

information about cases than the researchers do, and so the application of the ELR and its

exceptions is highly nuanced and contingent on specific facts of the case (call this the

broad view). Our data allow us to test both the strict and the middle view, but the broad

view is untestable by the methods that we use.

       We use data about the specifics of tort claims, and whether they are allowed, to

create tortwin, which denotes the plaintiff’s winning at the appellate level. It is a dummy

variable that takes a value of “0” if the plaintiff’s claim in tort is barred by the ELR and

“1” if it is not. We use tortwin to test the strict view of the ELR, under which tortwin

should be “0” on average. A value of “1” for tortwin does not necessarily mean that the

plaintiff actually recovered damages. The appellate court may decide that recovery is not

barred by the ELR but remand the case to a lower court for considering other defenses,

assessing damages, or resolving other issues material to a final resolution of the dispute.




                                                                                            11
Coding the Reasons for Not Applying the ELR

        We also document the reasons courts give when they do not apply the ELR. There

are relatively few such reasons, summarized in Table 3.1. In coding the data, we recorded

the primary exception to the ELR applied by the court. Other exceptions that the court

mentioned along the way (dicta rather than the holding of the case) we ignore.

Table 3.1: Distinction between generally recognized exceptions and exceptions that are idiosyncratic.



        We distinguish between two categories of reasons given by a court for its

decision: (1) generally recognized exceptions to ELR; and (2) idiosyncratic exceptions.

Under the middle view of efficiency, tortwin should be “0” other than when courts apply

generally recognized exceptions. There are three kinds of generally recognized

exceptions:

        Independent Torts: Pure economic loss can occur as a result of either intentional

or unintentional wrongdoing. Intentional wrongdoing is a standard exception to the ELR.


                                                                                                        12
For example, when the defendant fraudulently induces the plaintiff to sign a contract, the

ELR does not bar him from suing the defendant in tort for fraud.

       Other Property: Plaintiffs are permitted to recover tort damages for personal

injury or property damage. In products liability cases, this includes damage caused by a

defective product to other property belonging to the plaintiff, as well as to property

belonging to a third party. Damage to the defective product itself is treated as economic

loss, but if other property of the plaintiff is damaged, the ELR does not preclude

recovery. State courts vary in their application of this exception. For simplicity, we

classify all applications of the other property exception as generally recognized.

       Generally recognized Independent Duty: Courts have recognized exceptions in

which defendants owe a duty to the plaintiff that is independent of any contract. Many of

these exceptions are idiosyncratic, but two are generally recognized. First, as noted in

section 552 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, architects have an independent duty to

a general contractor. This seems an efficient way of avoiding making architects contract

separately with builders when both have already contracted with the owner. Second,

several states have enacted statutory duties in this area. For example, Florida has imposed

a number of statutory duties upon builders, architects, and inspectors. Section 553.84 of

Florida Statutes (1995) provides a cause of action for economic loss when a builder has

injured a property owner as a result of violating the building code or doing construction

without required permits. This duty operates independently of any other available ground

for a remedy.

       The coding of exceptions as “generally recognized” does not necessarily mean

that all cases from all jurisdictions have accepted the exception. For example, we have




                                                                                           13
coded fraudulent inducement as a “generally recognized exception” even though in two

cases in our dataset fraudulent inducement was held not to constitute an exception. One

was overruled a year later; the other was based on a statutory interpretation. 13

        Courts have carved out a number of additional exceptions, which we refer to as

idiosyncratic (see Table 3.1). These are exceptions that are peculiar to a few states or not

uniformly recognized even within the same state. The label “idiosyncratic” does not refer

to innovations made by courts in situations that have not previously arisen (as in

Gennaioli-Shleifer 2007). Rather, idiosyncratic exceptions are exceptions rejected by

other courts either explicitly or implicitly. For each case that we classify as having been

decided on the basis of an idiosyncratic exception, there is a factually very similar case

decided in favor of applying the ELR.

        Most of the idiosyncratic exceptions are independent duties created by courts. A

few courts subject builders or architects to a tort duty to property owners or

subcontractors. For example, Colorado and Georgia hold that builders owe property

owners a tort duty independent of the ELR, but most courts do not. Sometimes an

idiosyncratic exception is inconsistent with other cases in the same state. In an early

Illinois case, an architect was held to owe an independent duty to purchasers of

residential property, but most cases from Illinois apply the ELR in such cases. 14


13
   In Woodson v. Martin, 663 So. 2d 1327 (Fla. 1995), the Florida court held that any misrepresentations of
the defects in the house caused only economic losses. This was overruled in Wassall v. W H Payne 682 So.
2d 678 (Fla. 1996) and has been disapproved in a number of other Florida cases. In Flagg Energy
Development Corp. v General Motors Corp., 244 Conn. 126, 151–55 (1998), the Connecticut court
dismissed the claim for fraudulent misrepresentation, but while mentioning the ELR the court actually
based its decision on an interpretation of the Uniform Commercial Code. While the case has been
distinguished in Connecticut, it has not been overruled or disapproved.
14
   Ferentchak v Frankfort, 121 Ill. App. 3d 599 (1984), was the early architect case. The similar cases from
Illinois that upheld the ELR are Illinois Housing Development Authority v. M-Z Construction Corp., 110
Ill. App. 3d 129 (1982); 2314 Lincoln Park West Condominium Association v. Mann, Gil, Ebel & Frazier,
Ltd., 136 Ill. 2d 302 (1990); and Martusciello v. JDS Homes, Inc, 361 Ill. App. 3d 568 (2005).


                                                                                                        14
                            Some courts recognize an exception in cases in which the plaintiff has no

contractual remedy, or confine the ELR to commercial, but not to residential, property

owners. These “other reasons,” which seem motivated by sympathy for wronged

plaintiffs seemingly barred by the ELR, are rejected by other courts and we code them as

idiosyncratic exceptions.



Brief Summary of the Data

                            Cases are not distributed uniformly across the years 1970-2005 covered by the

dataset. In some years we have no observations, while the maximum number of cases in

one year is 28 (in 1998 and 2005). Figure 3.1 plots the number of cases each year, and

reveals a clear upward trend in appeals cases in which ELR is mentioned.

                            The growth in the number of ELR cases is affected by our search strategy in

constructing the dataset. Many construction cases from the 1970s and 1980s do not refer

to the ELR explicitly and hence are not included. The result is to bias the plaintiffs’


                                                                                                            15
success rate downward in the early years of our sample. A plaintiff is more likely to have

recovered economic damages in a case in which the ELR is not mentioned than in one in

which it was.

        In the majority of our cases, a plaintiff property owner is suing a builder,

architect, engineer, inspector, or manufacturer. In 331 cases (71.18%), the plaintiff is a

property owner. Builders are the only other significant plaintiff category (involved in

25.81% of the cases). The most frequent defendants are builders (involved in 34.84% of

all cases), followed by manufacturers (27.10%), architects, engineers, and inspectors

(20.86%), and property owners (14.62%). Table 3.2 summarizes these data.

        Table 3.3 summarizes the outcomes in our 465 cases. Plaintiffs won 170 cases

(36.56%). The most frequent exceptions to the ELR found in our sample are other

property (25.88% of all cases that plaintiffs win); idiosyncratic independent duties

(22.94%); and independent torts (21.76%). Courts invoke generally recognized




                                                                                             16
exceptions to the ELR in 113 of the 170 tortwin cases (66.47%) and idiosyncratic

exceptions in the remaining 57 cases (33.53%).

        The data on means begin to tell the story of how the ELR has been applied in the

construction industry. More than 63% of the cases apply the ELR and deny plaintiffs

recovery in tort. In nearly 25% of the cases the decision is for the plaintiff based on a

generally recognized exception to the ELR. Only about 12% of the cases apply

idiosyncratic exceptions. On average, then, the ELR plus its generally recognized

exceptions is widely, but not universally, accepted by state appellate courts. The question

arises whether, over time, this acceptance has grown, suggesting convergence. If it has,

what kinds of decision have withered away? If acceptance has not grown, what kinds of

exception are responsible? We address these questions in the following sections.

                                                                               Observations

Table 3.3: Outcomes of cases and frequency of exceptions




IV.     Aggregate Outcomes.

        Figure 4.1 presents the fraction of cases each year in which plaintiffs won

(tortwin). It reveals a U-shaped pattern: tortwin declines steadily over the first 20 years of

the data but rises in the last decade. The frequency with which claims are rejected based

on the ELR rises in the 1970s and 1980s but falls after the mid-1990s.


                                                                                            17
                     There are various ways to establish the U shape more formally. One strategy is to

use Locally Weighted Least Squares (Lowess) to fit the curve (Figure 4.2). We fit the

Lowess curve over the 465 binary observations of tortwin. The trend curve is an amalgam

of 465 linear regressions around each local point using a localized subset of the data. This

smoothes the data and generates a trend curve.15

                     The Lowess curve suggests that outcomes in our sample indeed follow a U-

shaped curve over time, with the bottom tortwin rate of about 30% reached in the early

1990s. Thus, there has never been convergence on what we call the “strict” view of

ELR—the view that it always bars the recovery of economic loss in tort.

                     One can obtain the same U shape with more restrictive models. A simple

quadratic model fitting case outcomes over time and time2 yields strongly significant

15
  The smoothing parameter (referred to as bandwidth) is the proportion of all observations that each
regression uses. The smaller the bandwidth, the coarser the trend line appears, since individual regressions
are more localized. The default bandwidth for Lowess curves in STATA is 0.8 (meaning that each of the 465
regressions uses 372 observations), which we use throughout. The picture is similar with a bandwidth of
0.25, where each regression uses 116 observations.


                                                                                                         18
results. The coefficient on time is -3.7966 with a t-statistic of -2.70. The coefficient on

time2 is 0.0009 with a t-statistic of 2.70. Both are significant at the 1% level. The

quadratic best fit suggests that the turning point came in 1993.

                We can also estimate linear regressions dividing the sample at various points in

the late-1980s or early-1990s. These specifications yield a negative and statistically

significant trend in tortwin in the earlier sub-sample and a positive and statistically

significant trend in the later one (see Figure 4.3). This pattern, too, is inconsistent with

either the average acceptance of, or even convergence to, the strict view of ELR.

                     Figure 4.4 decomposes tortwin as a percentage of total cases into generally

recognized and idiosyncratic exceptions. Both trend down in the 1970s and 1980s, except

that the number of cases decided on the basis of generally recognized exceptions bottom

out earlier, in the mid-1980s, at about 20% of all cases, and then begin rising gently (and

not statistically significantly) in the mid 1990s to about 30% of all cases, with a decline at

the end of the sample period back to 20%. Idiosyncratic exceptions fall until the mid-

1990s, to about 10% of all cases – a remarkable testament to apparent convergence to the

ELR with generally recognized exceptions – except that they then rise back to around

20% toward the end of the sample period. Both the downward trend before the mid-1990s

and subsequent upward trend in idiosyncratic exceptions are significant (Figure 4.5).

last decade of the sample. We do not see convergence to ELR with generally recognized

exceptions, and thus reject the middle version of the ELR’s efficiency as well. Had this

paper been written a decade ago, we would have concluded that the legal rule has

converged to nearly universal acceptance of the ELR with generally recognized

exceptions. The substantial and statistically significant growth in cases decided plaintiffs’

favor by application of the idiosyncratic exceptions in the last decade of the sample

precludes such a conclusion today.

                To study these trends in more detail, we next break up the outcome data to

determine which exceptions the courts use to allow the plaintiff to avoid the ELR. Figure

4.7 shows the trend of the courts’ use of each of the exceptions over time. The decline in

plaintiff victories throughout the 1970s and 1980s comes mainly from a decrease in the

number of cases in which plaintiffs are allowed to claim independent tort duties to them.

Both cases involving generally recognized independent duties and cases involving

idiosyncratic independent duties fall significantly over this period. 16 There is also a

significant decline in cases involving independent torts until the mid-1990s. 17

                   The increase in plaintiff victories from the mid-1990s onwards is harder to break

down. While all the exceptions trend upwards, particularly the other property,

independent torts, and idiosyncratic independent duty exceptions, none of them

individually increases significantly.

                   Another way to look at the patterns is by focusing on dissents in judicial opinions;

55 of our 465 cases include at least one dissenting opinion. Overall there is no difference

between the frequency of dissents in cases in which the ELR is upheld and in the cases in

which an exception is made. But in cases in which the court relies on an exception that is

idiosyncratic, the incidence of dissent is, as one would expect, significantly higher, as


16
   For the sub-sample 1970 to 1992, generally recognized independent duties fall significantly: t = -2.69
(significant at 1% level). For the sub-sample 1970 to 1998, idiosyncratic independent duties fall
significantly: t = -2.12 (significant at 5% level).

   Over the sub-sample 1970 to 1995, independent torts fall significantly: t = -2.27 (significant at 5% level).


                                                                                                            23
“idiosyncratic” implies that the law is unsettled. Of the 113 cases in which generally

recognized exceptions were applied, only 10 (8.84%) included a dissent, while in the 57

cases in which idiosyncratic exceptions were applied, 11 cases (19.29%) included a

dissent. This difference is significant at the 5% level (t = -1.97).

                    A look at the frequency of dissents over time yields additional insights. As Figure

4.8 shows, there is a significant downward trend in dissents in cases in which the ELR is

used to defeat recovery. 18 In other words, when the majority enforces the ELR as a bar to

recovery, the presence of opposing voices is diminishing. Dissents in the cases in which

exceptions are applied exhibit no statistically significant trends. Thus suggests that courts

are continuing to struggle with the exceptions to the ELR.

Predictability

                                                                                                      24
       Parties to a construction-related transaction who are deciding whether to write a

contract and if so what to put in it are interested in what a court would do should they

have a dispute. Courts might be predictable but still use inefficient rules, which would

induce the parties to contract more carefully or take some other measure to minimize the

likelihood of getting involved in litigation—all at a cost. If courts are unpredictable,

transacting parties will bear an extra cost in the form of uncertainty about the outcome of

any dispute that might arise—an uncertainty that a contract (or a more complete contract)

would reduce provided the judicial interpretation of contracts is more predictable than the

judicial application of the ELR.

       Determining whether judicial behavior is predictable in this situation is difficult

for us for a number of reasons. First, we do not have all the details of the transactions

involved in the cases, and the contracting parties and even the courts know more about

those details than the authors of a statistical study can know. Second, predictability

depends on when the transaction took place and in what jurisdiction. Third, from the

point of view of predictability, we have a highly unrepresentative sample, as it is limited

to disputes that went all the way to state appellate courts, indicating that the parties’

views of the facts and the law were so different that they could not settle the case.

       Still, we can ask, as a start, how predictable the courts are if parties have our full

data sample in their heads and believe that courts apply the ELR subject only to generally

recognized exceptions. Parties with this knowledge and belief would be correct nearly

88% of the time. The predictability of the rule does not change significantly even if the

parties have additional information, such as the state whose courts would resolve the




                                                                                             25
dispute and the type of plaintiff and defendant that they are. 19 Predictability was much

lower at the beginning of the sample, with many fewer cases to base predictions on. That

is inevitable at the outset of any common law doctrinal development. More disturbing is

that idiosyncratic exceptions were on the rise toward the end of our sample period.

         In short, judicial behavior with regard to the application of the ELR in the

construction industry is fairly predictable but far from certain. Parties expecting courts to

apply the ELR with generally recognized exceptions in the event of a dispute to which

the ELR might be applicable are in for a surprise about 12% of the time. We cannot say

based on our data how much extra risk-bearing and contracting costs this level of

unpredictability entails.



Summary

         The story that emerges from the trends we analyze does not confirm any simple

theory of the evolution of common law. The law does not start at an efficient point, but it

is also very far from being random. The majority of the appellate courts in our sample

accept the ELR, and when they do not, they often rely on generally recognized

exceptions. Judicial behavior is fairly predictable, but far from certain.

         The evolution of the law over time reveals some fascinating patterns. The initial

twenty years after the Seely decision, the case that set the law on its modern path, are best

described as years of growing acceptance of the ELR, with declining application of either


19
  We run a probit regression of the rule being used on case facts, such as state, plaintiff type, defendant
type. We predict when a court will use an idiosyncratic exception using this factor-based approach and note
that the additional facts do not generate any additional predictive value. This factor-based approach and its
extensions have been used by political scientists (e.g., Segal 1984, Richards and Kritzer 2002) to
investigate the predictability of (mostly U.S. Supreme Court) case outcomes rather than the predictability
of the application of a particular legal rule. See also Cameron and Kornhauser (2005) for a discussion of
theoretical issues with this literature.


                                                                                                          26
generally recognized or idiosyncratic exceptions. In the final decade of the sample,

however, courts moved away from strict application of the ELR as a result of more

frequently invoking some of the generally recognized exceptions, such as the independent

tort and other property exceptions, and – more surprisingly – some of the idiosyncratic

exceptions as well. The data reveal no convergence to any rule, let alone an efficient rule

under either of our candidate definitions of efficiency.

       As we noted in the introduction, we cannot reject the view that judicial decisions

are efficient if we adopt a sufficiently broad definition of efficiency, one that allows for

the possibility that the law and the facts are more complicated that one can learn from

reading a judicial opinion. Perhaps if all were known, the cases would be understood to

produce efficient outcomes in a larger percentage of cases. But although there are

dissents in only about one-eighth of the cases, these dissents are much more frequent

when idiosyncratic exceptions are applied, which casts some doubt on the hypothesis that

those decisions would be seen as efficient if only enough details were known about them.

       So what is behind the time patterns we observe: both the convergence toward the

ELR in the first 20 years of the sample and the movement away from it afterwards? In the

next section we address this question from different perspectives.



V. Behind the Patterns.

       We try to deepen our understanding of the patterns uncovered in section IV by

examining five aspects of the evolution of the ELR in the construction industry. First, we

examine the claims that plaintiffs make in our sample and ask whether changes in those

claims can explain the patterns of court decisions. In a decentralized world of legal




                                                                                           27
evolution, plaintiffs would try new strategies when they found barriers to recovery with

old ones. Perhaps the movement away from the ELR in later years reflects such

adaptation, as plaintiffs discover or invent claims to which courts are more receptive.

           Second, we examine whether the application of the ELR is influenced by the

existence of an explicit contract between the parties. Because the presence of such a

contract indicates that the parties considered the various risks of their relationship, courts

may be more likely to apply the ELR to tort claims when litigants have a contract.

           Third, we investigate the relative economic power of the plaintiff and defendant.

Judges’ sympathy for weaker parties may help explain deviations from the ELR in cases

in which plaintiffs have less economic power than the defendants.

           Fourth, we examine court leadership. In 1986 the U.S. Supreme Court issued a

decision in an admiralty case, East River, 20 which broadly endorsed the ELR. Although

East River is far away from construction and is not binding on state courts applying state

law, we can ask whether the decision influenced the state courts in construction cases.

           Fifth, we examine state variation in decisions. We ask whether the lack of

convergence to the ELR is explained by the fact that in many states there are very few

appellate cases involving ELR in construction. Perhaps it is those states that account for

lack of convergence in the aggregate. By looking at the states with the highest caseloads,

we can ask whether those states exhibit a greater tendency to convergence.



Claims

           Figure 5.1 shows that the proportion of cases in which the plaintiff claims

negligence has been falling (statistically significantly) since the mid-1980s. While claims

of strict liability have also trended downward since the start of our sample, the trend is

significant only over certain periods. As the ELR becomes increasingly accepted,

plaintiffs are using types of claim less likely to be barred by it. The increase in claims of

fraud is mildly significant since the early 1980s, while the increase in claims of negligent

misrepresentation over the same period is strongly significant. 21 The increase in claims

for “other torts” is significant over the course of our entire sample. 22 We get very similar

results if we look at the claims relative to tortwin cases rather than relative to all cases.

                                         The change in the nature of plaintiff claims can explain some of the rise in

tortwins. Put simply, plaintiffs claim fraud and courts are receptive. However, the

changes in claims do not help explain the rise in idiosyncratic exceptions.

ELR and the Contractual Relationship between Parties



21
   Over 1983-2005, the trend for fraud is positive and significant at the 10% level (t = 1.92). In the same
period, the trend for negligent misrepresentation claims is positive and significant at the 1% level (t = 2.93).
22
   From 1970 to 2005, the trend for “other torts” is positive and significant at the 10% level (t = 1.78).


                                                                                                                        29
        We consider whether judicial application of the ELR depends on whether the

parties have an express written contract – thus excluding oral contracts, implied

warranties, and contractual rights as a third-party beneficiary of someone else’s contracts.

If the courts want to promote efficiency, they may be more willing to apply the ELR

when the parties have gone to the trouble of defining their relationship in a contract. Seely

itself may be an example of such logic.

        In Table 5.1 the percentage of tortwin is greater when plaintiffs do not have an

express written contract, although the difference is not quite significant (t = 1.53). And

courts are significantly more likely to rely on idiosyncratic exceptions when the parties

do not have a contract (t = 1.95). Courts in effect “make” a contract for the plaintiff when

there is no actual contract between the parties, rather than being willing to penalize the

plaintiff for having failed to negotiate a contract that would have protected him from the

loss that he is suing to recover.

                                                      Cases         Tortwin%           Idiosyncratic%

Table 5.1: Breakdown of tortwin and incidence of idiosyncratic exceptions depending on whether parties
had an express written contract.



        If courts are moving toward efficiency, the tortwin percentage in cases in which

parties have an express written contract should fall over time. The data in Figure 5.2 do

not support this hypothesis. Both tortwin and the use of idiosyncratic exceptions rise

significantly after 1997. (The initial downward trend is not significant.) Courts are

becoming more willing to allow exceptions to the ELR when the parties have a contract,

and more willing to allow idiosyncratic exceptions.

parties have an express contract.



                    We can further investigate whether success in tort and contract are substitutes or

complements in the 291 cases in which plaintiffs claim both tort and breach of contract.

Table 5.3 reveals positive correlation (0.2316) between tortwin and winning in contract (t

= 4.11). And there is no statistical difference in the use of idiosyncratic exceptions when

plaintiffs win and when plaintiffs lose their contract claims (t = 0.99).

                                                       Cases                Tortwin %               Idiosyncratic %

Table 5.3: Breakdown of tortwin and incidence of idiosyncratic exceptions depending on whether plaintiffs
won their contract claim.



                    The focus on the contractual relationship casts further doubt on the hypothesis

that the law is converging toward an efficient rule. Although the hypothesis that judges

favor defendants who were in a contractual relationship with the plaintiff is weakly

supported, the fact that outcomes in tort and in contract are positively correlated suggests

that courts are allowing exceptions to the ELR even when claims in contract are valid.


                                                                                                                  31
The trends in tortwin and in the application idiosyncratic exceptions also suggest that

courts increasingly are allowing plaintiffs to recover in tort even when they have an

express written contract with the defendant.



Relative Economic Power of the Parties

        We now examine the hypothesis that the relative economic power of plaintiff and

defendant affects the courts’ application of the ELR. Table 5.4 divides parties into two

groups that provide us with a rough proxy for economic power.

Weak parties                                          Strong parties
  • Individual property owners and tenants                • Commercial property owners
  • Associations of residents                             • Public property owners
  • Subcontractors and small builders                     • General contractors

        There is no statistically significant difference between the groups in tortwin

percentages. Courts are more likely to apply an idiosyncratic exception when facing a

weak plaintiff and strong defendant (17.53% of cases) compared to when both parties are


                                                                                                     32
strong (7.39% of cases). This difference is highly significant (t = -2.97). However, the

application of idiosyncratic exceptions is also higher when courts face a strong plaintiff

and weak defendant (17.14%) than when both parties are strong (t = -1.89). No other

differences are significant. This evidence offers mild support for the idea that sympathy

moves courts to use idiosyncratic exceptions to help weak plaintiffs.



The Potential Effect of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Decision in East River

       In East River (1986) the Court endorsed bright-line ELR. A plaintiff shipbuilder

had a contract with the defendant to design, manufacture, and install turbines for four

supertankers. The ships malfunctioned and were damaged, and the plaintiff sought to

recover the costs of repair, plus income lost while the ships were out of service. The

plaintiff initially made claims in both contract and tort; but the contract claims turned out

to be barred by the statute of limitations. The negligence claims were rejected by the

Supreme Court, which held that customer dissatisfaction with product quality is not a

cognizable claim in admiralty tort law. Following the reasoning in Seely, the Court held

that such claims can be brought only as claims for breach of warranty.

       Although the East River decision was not binding on state courts, we examine

whether it had a significant influence on those courts in the construction realm. Influence

is difficult to ascertain here, since, as we showed in Section IV, tortwin had been trending

down for at least a decade before East River and bottomed out in the early 1990s. We

find no effect of East River on the speed of convergence.

       Another way to assess influence is by number of citations. Since East River

denies recovery, we expect that state court decisions that cite East River are likely to




                                                                                             33
deny liability. Indeed, 52 of the 68 cases (76.47%) in our sample that cite East River deny

the plaintiff recovery, while only 196 of the 314 cases since East River that do not cite

the case deny recovery (62.42%). This difference is significant (t-test statistic = 2.21).

Still, one needs to be cautious: cases that cite East River may do so as cover, trading on

the prestige of the Supreme Court, whereas cases that do not cite East River can justify

not citing it on the ground that an admiralty case is irrelevant to construction disputes. If

this explanation is correct, the citation evidence yields some support for the “legal realist”

hypothesis that state courts do what they want and use citations to provide rhetorical

support for their conclusions.

         While East River may have had some influence in consolidating support for the

ELR, the proportion of cases citing East River has fallen since the early 1990s. This trend

is significant (t = -2.24 for years 1990-2005). We cannot conclude from our data that the

U.S. Supreme Court has had a major influence on the state courts’ treatment of ELR, at

least in the construction industry.



Variation across States

         There is tremendous variation in tortwin across states. Kentucky has 100%

tortwin; Wyoming, Kansas, Virginia, and Maine have 0% tortwin. We ask whether

tortwin can be explained by geographical or economic differences; the answer appears to

be no. 23 We ask whether the differences in tortwin can be explained by the methods in

which judges are selected and retained that different states employ, and again the answer


23
  Testing for differences in tortwin across regions does not provide any notable patterns. Testing for
differences based on levels of economic growth in each state from 1970 to 2005 generates insignificant
results; and testing for differences based on growth in the construction industry in each state from 1970 to
2005 also yields insignificant results.


                                                                                                           34
is no. 24 Nor can differences in tortwin be explained by differences among judges in

political ideology. 25

         Some states have fewer cases than others, and perhaps states with the highest

caseloads, which have had the most experience with the ELR, have more respect for the

doctrine. To examine this hypothesis, we focus on the five states with the highest

caseloads in our sample. In these states, tortwin percentage varies greatly (see Table 5.6).

New York is very strict on plaintiffs, with a mere 15.91% tortwin, while California is far

more lenient, with a 52.94% tortwin. High caseload does not explain greater adherence to

the ELR: tortwin is not significantly affected by the number of cases decided in a state (t

= -1.22).

Table 5.6: Tortwin and use of exceptions in five states with highest caseloads



         Not only do the averages differ greatly across the five busiest states; so do the

trends (Figure 5.3). The percentage of tortwin in California is high on average but

significantly decreasing over time (t = -2.62). In contrast, tortwin in New York and



24
   States differ in the method by which judges ascend to the bench and in the way they are retained. We
investigate whether this has any effect on the application of the ELR and its exceptions. We use the
categories employed in Choi, Gulati, and E. Posner (2007) to divide states into four types of judicial
selection method (appointed, merit-selected, partisan election or nonpartisan elections). The methods by
which judges are retained are highly correlated with selection method. The differences in tortwin across
states of different judicial selection methods are not significant.
25
   Using a simple measure of party-adjusted surrogate judicial ideology (“PAJID”) from Brace, Langer, and
Hall (2000), we test whether the ideology of the Supreme Court judges in a given state can help explain the
variation in tortwin across states. In the cases in which the court upheld the ELR to preclude recovery, the
average PAJID score was 47.20. In tortwin cases, the average PAJID score was 47.46. The difference is not
significant (t = 0.1817).


                                                                                                         35

Figure 5.3: Tortwin over time in the five states with the highest caseloads



                Unlike the overall tortwin pattern, the proportion of cases that apply exceptions

that are idiosyncratic is influenced by caseload. This inverse relation is significant (t = -

2.85) and is illustrated in Figure 5.4. The implication is that idiosyncratic exceptions are

more likely to be introduced when courts have less of their own experience in this area.

This hypothesis is supported by a comparison of the first 10 decisions heard in each state

with the subsequent decisions in those states (if the state hears at least 10 cases). 15.81%

of the “early” cases in these states applied exceptions that are idiosyncratic, compared to

just 8.02% of the “later” cases. This difference is significant (t = -2.56).

               The punch line of this analysis is that low state caseloads might offer an

explanation for why we have not seen stronger convergence to the ELR, and more

specifically why we have seen an increase in the use of idiosyncratic exceptions in the

past decade. Although the ELR is quite widely accepted, the law does not come to a rest,

and states continue experimentation, often in ways inconsistent with the ELR and its

generally recognized exceptions. Experience slows this experimentation down, as one

would expect, but not completely.

               The increase in the application of idiosyncratic exceptions is not limited to states

with low caseloads. In fact, 76% of idiosyncratic exception cases since 1997 have come

from states with 10 or more cases. Wisconsin (the state with the sixth highest caseload)

has seen a sharp rise in cases decided by the application of idiosyncratic exceptions. Four

of the five largest states have all used an idiosyncratic exception in the last six years of




                                                                                                          37
our sample. Thus, even in busy states we see an increasing tendency of courts to get

around the ELR.



VI. Conclusion.

       Our investigation of the application of the Economic Loss Rule to construction

disputes yields some surprising results. Over the 35 years covered by our study, the

doctrine has evolved in a way that cannot be easily described as convergence to

efficiency. While over the first quarter century the law moved significantly toward

adopting the ELR with generally recognized exceptions, over the last decade it has

moved away from this equilibrium. Had we written this paper 10 years ago, we would

have found the law converging to ELR with generally recognized exceptions, but the law

moved away from that rule afterwards, with no changes in the economic environment to

explain the movement. Moreover, the law evolved very differently in different states,

which is inconsistent with efficiency in the absence of an economic explanation for the

differences among states in the nature of construction disputes.

       The lack of full convergence does not mean that judicial behavior is random or

that the law is entirely unpredictable. On average in our sample, courts in construction

disputes applied the ELR with generally recognized exceptions about 88% of the time,

which would give the parties engaged in a transaction in which a potential ELR issue

lurked reasonable though not complete certainty. The more unsettling findings are that

the law has become less predictable in the last decade, that many states are increasingly

using idiosyncratic exceptions to limit the ELR, and that the amount of appellate




                                                                                           38
litigation involving ELR in construction disputes is growing. These are not signs of the

law settling down.

       Some additional evidence sheds light on how legal evolution works. Plaintiffs’

claims respond to what courts are receptive to, such as claims of fraud. But that is not the

whole story. The key reason for non-convergence is that courts distinguish cases and

create idiosyncratic exceptions to the prevailing legal doctrine that other courts reject. In

the last decade covered by our study, courts increasingly used such exceptions even when

the parties had express contracts.

       Idiosyncratic exceptions differ across states, with many states going in their own

direction with regard to what exceptions they recognize or create. State courts at first

responded to a nonbinding 1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling embracing the bright-line

ELR in an admiralty case, but this influence declined over time. There is evidence that

state courts with heavier caseloads in this area of litigation are more likely to converge to

the adoption of the ELR with generally recognized exceptions, but even in those states

there is residual uncertainty.

       We conclude that appellate courts exercise a moderate amount of discretion in

deciding cases, leaving the law reasonably predictable but far from certain, even after

three decades of evolution. The deviations from efficiency are not huge, but they do not

disappear over time. There may be evolutionary benefits of such legal flexibility, but the

hypothesis that, in traditional commercial areas, common law is predictable and efficient,

or at least is moving there, is not supported by the evidence in this very particular sphere.

Appendix: Construction of the Database

       All data are obtained from the LexisNexis “Construction” library. To find the

cases, we searched the library for state appeals court cases decided prior to December 31,

2005, that satisfy the following criteria: (1) the phrase “economic loss” is found in either

the Overview or the Core Terms; and (2) any of the following terms—“contract!”,

“agree!”, or “warrant!”—are found in the Overview or the Core Terms. The Overview is a

summary of the case of approximately 150 to 200 words. The Core Terms is a list of 30

to 50 key terms that appear in the decision. This search strategy captures all state appeals

cases from the construction industry where the ELR defense is raised by defense lawyers.

No issue of different coverage periods for different states arises in our sample period.

       This search yielded 1171 cases. Of these, 209 were not appellate cases and so

were dropped, and another 4 were not from state courts. Another 496 cases were

excluded as irrelevant because the LexisNexis Construction library turns out to include

cases that do not pertain to construction. In 50 cases, more than one dispute is addressed

on appeal. For example, a plaintiff may bring claims against the general contractor and

subcontractors in one case. When the plaintiff brings different claims against the two

defendants and both claims are being heard on appeal, we divide the case into two

distinct observations. When the plaintiff brings claims against multiple defendants but the

appeal addresses only one of them, it is left as one observation. We have 46 cases that

give rise to 2 observations and 4 cases that give rise to 3 observations; the other 412 cases

involve single claims decided on appeal. Of the 516 individual disputes thus coded, 37 do

not involve tort claims and another 14 involve tort claims that were not appealed. After

removing these 51 disputes, we have the sample of 465 observations.
