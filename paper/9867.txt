Flexible Exchange Rates as Shock Absorbers

JEL No. F30, F32

                                           ABSTRACT

In this paper we analyze empirically the effect of terms of trade shocks on economic performance

under alternative exchange rate regimes. We are particularly interested in investigating whether

terms of trade disturbances have a smaller effect on growth in countries with a flexible exchange rate

regime, than in countries with a more rigid exchange rate arrangement. We also analyze whether

negative and positive terms of trade shocks have asymmetric effects on growth, and whether the

magnitude of these asymmetries depends on the exchange rate regime. We find evidence suggesting

that terms of trade shocks get amplified in countries that have more rigid exchange rate regimes. We

also find evidence of an asymmetric response to terms of trade shocks: the output response is larger

for negative than for positive shocks. Finally, we find evidence supporting the view that, after

controlling for other factors, countries with more flexible exchange rate regimes grow faster than

countries with fixed exchange rates.

I. Introduction
         During the last few years economists’ views on exchange rate regimes have
evolved significantly. Fixed-but-adjustable regimes have lost adepts, while hard-pegs
and floating rates have gained in popularity. The discussion on the relative merits of
these two contrasting exchange rate systems has come to be known as the “two corners”
debate (Fischer 2001). Supporters of hard-pegs have argued that this type of regime
provides credibility and results in lower inflation, a more stable economic environment
and faster economic growth.1 Supporters of flexibility, on the other hand, have argued
that under floating exchange rates the economy has a greater ability to adjust to external
shocks.2 According to this view, which at least goes back to Meade (1951), countries
with a flexible exchange rate system will be able to buffer real shocks stemming from
abroad. This, in turn, will allow countries with floating rates to avoid costly and
protracted adjustment processes.3
         In most models of open economies, real external shocks – including terms of trade
and real interest rate shocks – will result in changes in the equilibrium real exchange rate
(Obstfeld and Rogoff, 1995). If the nominal exchange rate is fixed, the adjustment in the
equilibrium real exchange rate will have to take place through changes in domestic
nominal prices and domestic wages. As Meade (1951, p. 201-02) argued early on, this
adjustment will be difficult in countries with a fixed exchange rate and inflexible money
wages. According to Meade (1951), in the presence of these rigidities the economy is
likely to benefit from what he called a “variable exchange rate” regime, or from what
we know today as a floating exchange rate system. He was careful to note, however, that
flexible exchange rates are not a panacea, and that there are indeed circumstances when
they may not help to accommodate external disturbances. This would be the case, for


1
  Hard-peg regimes include currency boards, currency unions and dollarization. The growth effect is
suppose to take place through two channels: (a) dollarization will mean lower interest rates, higher
investment and, thus, faster growth. Dornbusch, for instance, (2001, p.240) has emphasized this channel,
arguing that dollarization-induced lower interest rates are “conducive to investment and risk-taking, which
translates into growth, and … a virtuous circle.” And (b), by eliminating exchange rate volatility, hard-pegs
will encourage international trade and this, in turn, will result in faster growth. Rose (2000), and Rose and
Van Wincoop (2001), among others, have emphasized this trade channel within the context of currency
unions. On analytical aspects of dollarization see Calvo (1999) and Eichengreen and Haussman (1999).
2
   In this paper we will use the terms “floating” and “flexible” exchange rate interchangeably.
3
   Friedman (1953) was an early proponent of this view. The idea that hard pegs magnify external shocks
acquired greater prominence in the aftermath of the Argentine currency and debt crisis of 2001-2002.

instance, if due to indexation or other mechanisms real wages are inflexible.4 This key
point has also been recognized by modern scholars that have analyzed the merits of
alternative exchange rate regimes (Dornbusch, 2001; Kenen, 2002).
         Recently, a number of authors have argued that flexible exchange rate systems
will not be effective in countries where the private and public sectors have large foreign
currency-denominated liabilities (Eichengreen and Hausmann 1999). In this case, it has
been argued, it is even possible that a flexible exchange rate regime will amplify the
negative effects of terms of trade shocks. The reason for this is that in the presence of
“balance sheet” effects, the currency depreciation generated by the external shock will
generate (large) increases in the value of the debt expressed in domestic currency. This,
in turn, may trigger bankruptcies, lead the public sector to insolvency, and result in a
reduction in the rate of growth (Calvo 2000).
         As the preceding discussion suggests, determining whether flexible exchange rate
regimes are indeed able to insulate the economy from external shocks, and contribute to
improving economic performance, is ultimately an empirical issue; it can only be
elucidated by analyzing the historical evidence.5 Surprisingly, there has been very little
empirical work on the relationship between exchange rate regimes and the way in which
terms of trade shocks affect growth and other measures of economic performance. In
fact, papers that have investigated empirically the way in which terms of trade
disturbances affect economic growth and growth volatility, have tended to ignore the role
of the exchange rate regime in the transmission process. A literature search using
EconLit indicates that 165 papers with the words “exchange rate regimes” and “growth”
in the title or abstract were published between 1969 and 2002. During the same period,
98 papers with the words “terms of trade” and “growth” were published. However, only
3 articles that had all three terms were published during this 33-year span.6
         The purpose of this paper is to bridge this gap in the literature, and to analyze
empirically the effect of terms of trade shocks on economic performance under

4
  In fact, Meade (1951, p. 203) explicitly said that “for the variable-exchange-rate mechanism to work
effectively there must be sufficient divorce in movements in the cost of living and movements in money
wage rates.”
5
   Calvo (2000), for instance, has argued that if there are “dollarized liabilities” a flexible exchange rate
regime may

alternative exchange rate regimes. We are particularly interested in investigating
whether, as supporters of exchange rate flexibility have claimed, terms of trade
disturbances have a smaller effect on growth in countries with a flexible exchange rate
regime, than in countries with a more rigid exchange rate arrangement. We also analyze
whether negative and positive terms of trade shocks have asymmetric effects on growth,
and whether the magnitude of these asymmetries depends on the exchange rate regime.
In order to investigate these issues we use a new data set that provides an improved
classification of the exchange rate regime in each country at any particular moment in
time. The advantage of this data set – which was constructed by Levy Yeyati and
Sturzenegger (2002) – is that it does not rely on official country statements for classifying
countries as having a pegged, intermediate or floating regime.7 Instead, this new data set
uses actual data on the behavior of nominal exchange rates and international reserves to
classify countries under different regimes.
         Our findings may be summarized as follows: First, we find evidence suggesting
that terms of trade shocks get amplified in countries that have more rigid exchange rate
regimes. Another way of saying this is that we find evidence indicating that, with other
things given, countries with flexible exchange rates are able to accommodate better real
external shocks. Second, we find evidence of an asymmetric response to terms of trade
shocks. More precisely, the output response is larger for negative than for positive
shocks, a fact consistent with the presence of asymmetries in price responses (with
downward nominal inflexibility leading to larger quantity adjustments). Interestingly,
while the output response in both directions is, again, larger the more rigid the exchange
rate, this asymmetry is not present under flexible regimes.8 In addition, we find evidence
supporting the view that, after controlling for other factors, countries with more flexible
exchange rate regimes grow faster than countries with fixed exchange rates, confirming
previous findings in Levy Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2003).

6
   Broda (2001) is a recent contribution that analyzes whether the exchange rate regime makes a difference
in the way in which terms of trade shocks impact economic performance.
7
   It is well known that in many countries the authorities systematically state that they have a particular
regime, when in reality they have a different one. See Edwards (1993) for a discussion on this issue.
8
  This would be in principle consistent with the presence of fear of floating, as reflected in a partial
response of nominal exchange rates to positive shocks that result in larger real contractions. This
hypothesis or, more generally, the hypothesis that exchange rates elasticity tends to be smaller in the event
of negative shocks, is a fruitful topic for future research.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section II we present our
empirical framework, we discuss our data, and we present our basic results. In Section
III we examine the robustness of the results to the use of the IMF de jure classification,
and we extend the analysis to explore potential asymmetries in the output response to
terms of trade shocks. Finally, in Section IV we present some concluding remarks.


II.    Terms of Trade Shocks, Exchange Rate Regimes and Growth: An Empirical
       Analysis
       Economists’ concerns with the effects of terms of trade changes on economic
growth go back, at least, to the writings of Prebisch (1950) and Singer (1950). These
influential authors made two claims: first, they argued that developing countries’ terms of
trade had exhibited a secular deterioration through time. And second, they argued that
this decline in relative exports’ prices contributed to the developing countries’ lack of
industrialization, and resulted in low rates of growth and further impoverishment. As a
result of Prebisch and Singer’s empirical propositions, a number of authors developed
theoretical models on the connection between terms of trade and economic growth. The
majority of these models considered rather simple links, and argued that by negatively
affecting real income, negative terms of trade shocks depressed aggregate demand and,
thus, resulted in lower growth (Bloomfield 1984, Singer and Lutz 1994). More recent
studies, however, have focused on a variety of transmission channels, including the effect
of terms of trade on relative prices. Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), for example, have
pointed out that whether growth in fact accelerates as a result of terms of trade
improvements depends on the effects of relative price changes on productivity
improvements.
       Some authors have emphasized the effects of terms of trade shocks on capital
accumulation and factor intensities. Basu and McLeod (1992), for example, constructed a
stochastic model of growth where imported intermediate inputs are complementary to
capital. In this setting, deterioration in the terms of trade makes imported inputs more
expensive and has the potential of reducing capital’s productivity. In addition, in this
model, uncertainty regarding the terms of trade has a negative effect on investment and,
                                              5


ultimately, on growth. Mendoza (1997) developed a stochastic model of growth in which
terms-of-trade uncertainty affects savings and growth. In this model terms of trade
improvements have a positive effect on savings, capital accumulation and, thus, on the
average rate of growth. The model also predicts that higher terms-of-trade variability
could result in either faster or slower growth, depending on the degree of risk aversion.
       In a comprehensive study Hadass and Williamson (2001) have reviewed most of
the empirical literature on terms of trade and economic performance produced during the
last five decades, including the works by Easterly et al (1993), Collier and Gunning
(1999), Warner (1992), Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995) and Barro (1997). They
convincingly argue that, while there has been massive amount of work trying to explain
the actual behavior of terms of trade, relatively few studies have focused on the effects of
terms of trade shocks on growth. And none of the studies reviewed by them makes a
distinction between countries with different exchange rate regimes. In a recent
contribution, Broda (2001) provides one of the few empirical analyses on how terms of
trade shocks affect real economic performance under alternative exchange rate regimes.
He uses a VARs analysis to compute the way in which terms of trade shocks affect
growth. He finds that the (negative) effect of a 10% deterioration in the terms of trade
has a greater negative effect on growth under fixed than under flexible exchange rate
regimes.


II.1 The Empirical Model
       Our main interest is to investigate whether, as supporters of floating exchange
rates have claimed, countries with floating exchange rate regimes are (partially) insulated
from the effects of terms of trade shocks on growth. More specifically, we are interested
in finding out if terms of trade disturbances affect differently countries with different
exchange rate regimes. The point of departure of our empirical analysis is a two-equation
formulation for the dynamics of real GDP per capita growth of country j in period t.
Equation (1) is the long run GDP growth equation, while equation (2) captures the
growth dynamics process.
                                                     6


        (1)     g* j = α + x j β + r j θ + ω j.


        (2)     ∆ g t j = λ [ g* j – g t-1 j ] + ϕ v t j + γ u t j + ξ t j .


The following notation has been used: g* j is the long run rate of real per capita GDP
growth in country j. x j is a vector of structural, institutional and policy variables that
determine long run growth; r j is a vector of regional dummies. α, β and θ are
parameters, and ω j is an error term assumed to be heteroskedastic. In equation (2), g t j is
the rate of growth of per capita GDP in country j in period t. The terms v t j and u t j are
shocks, assumed to have zero mean, finite variance and to be uncorrelated among
themselves. More specifically, v t j is assumed to be an external terms of trade shock,
while u t j captures other shocks, including political shocks. ξ t j is an error term, which is
assumed to be heteroskedastic – see equation (3) below for details. λ, ϕ, and γ are
parameters that determine the particular characteristics of the growth process.
        From the perspective of the exchange rate regime discussion, an important
question is whether the exchange rate system has a direct effect on the long-term rate of
growth. We deal with this issue by investigating whether in equation (1) the intercept α is
different for countries with different exchange rate regimes.9 Equation (2) -- which has
the form of an equilibrium correction model (ECM) --, states that the actual rate of
growth in period t will deviate from the long run rate of growth due to the existence of
three types of shocks: v t j, u t j and ξ t j. Over time, however, the actual rate of growth will
tend to converge towards it long run value, with the rate of convergence given by λ.
Parameter ϕ, in equation (2), is expected to be positive, indicating that an improvement in
the terms of trade will result in a (temporary) acceleration in the rate of growth, and that
negative terms of trade shock are expected to have a negative effect on g t j.
        Our main interest is to determine whether parameter ϕ in equation (3) depends on
the exchange rate regime of the country in question. If, as their supporters have argued,
floating exchange rates allow countries to absorb foreign shocks better, we would expect
ϕ to be smaller in countries with floating rates than in those countries with some version
                                                       7


of a pegged rates exchange rate regime. We are also interested in determining whether
positive and negative terms of trade shocks have asymmetric effects on growth – that we
do in section III. Our task, then, is to estimate the system given by equations (1) and (2),
and to analyze if the coefficients α and ϕ are different across exchange rate regimes. The
estimation of this system is not trivial, and is subject to the complexities of estimating
panels with lagged dependent variables and heteroskedastic errors.
           We estimate the system (1) - (2) using a two-step procedure. In the first step we
estimate the long run growth equation (2) using a cross-country data set. These data are
averages for 1974-2000, and the estimation makes a correction for heteroskedasticity.
These first stage estimates are then used to generate long run predicted rates of growth to
replace g*j in the equilibrium correction model (2). In the second step, we estimate
equation (2) using a feasible generalized least squares procedure (FGLS) suggested by
Beck and Katz (1995) for unbalanced panels. In the estimation of equation (2) the error ξ t
j is   assumed to be heteroskedastic, with a different variance for each of the k panels.

           The FGLS estimator has the same properties as the GLS estimator, and is
asymptotically efficient. Notice that an alternative estimation strategy would be to re-
parameterize equation (1) and (2), and to apply the Generalized-Method-of-Moments
(GMM) for dynamic panel data models suggested by Arellano and Bond (1991). When
we did this, the results obtained were similar to those obtained using our two-steps-FLS
methodology.10

  On debates on the effect of alternative exchange rate regimes on performance see, for example, Gosh et al
(1995), Levy Yeyati and Sturzenegger (2002), Frankel (1999) and Kenen (2002).
10
   A potential limitation of the GMM strategy, however, is it does not lend itself to a straight forward
interpretation of the equilibrium correction term. The results we obtained when using this method are
available on request.
                                              8


       We use two alternative methods to investigate whether the terms of trade
coefficient ϕ in equation (2) is different for different exchange rate regimes: The first one
consists of including a variable that interacts the terms of trade shock with three
alternative indicators for exchange rate regimes. Our second method consists of splitting
the sample according to the exchange rate regime, and comparing the estimated
coefficients for the terms of trade variable. If flexible regimes buffer the country better
form external disturbances, we would expect the coefficient for the terms of trade
variable to be significantly lower in countries with flexible exchange rate regimes than in
countries with rigid regimes.


II.2 Data and Equation Specification
       Our sample covers annual observations for 183 countries over the period 1974-
2000. With the exception of the civil unrest, exchange rate regimes, and secondary school
enrollment variables, the data were obtained from the IMF and the World Bank
databases. Since data availability varies across countries and periods, all tests were run
on consistent subsamples of observations corresponding to 96 and 100 countries. A list of
countries, as well as the definitions and sources for the variables used, are reported in
Appendix A.
       As pointed out above, our main interest is to analyze the transmission of terms of
trade shocks under alternative exchange rate regimes. There is generalized agreement,
however, that the IMF’s “official” exchange rate regime classification tends to be
misleading. For this reason, we use a methodology proposed by Levy Yeyati and
Sturzenegger (2002) to construct four indexes of exchange rate regimes. These indexes
are constructed as time series, and are based on actual, as opposed to legal, exchange rate
behavior– see Appendix B for details. The three indexes are defined as follows:
       • A binary index that takes the value of one if in that particular year the country
           has a pegged exchange rate regime, and zero otherwise. We call this index
           pegged.
       • A dummy variable that takes the value of one if in that particular year the
           country in question has a hard (as opposed to a conventional) peg – that is, if
                                              9


           it has a currency board, belongs to a currency union or it is dollarized. The
           index takes a value of zero otherwise. This variable is called hard.
       • A dummy variable that takes the value of one if the exchange rate regime is an
           intermediate regime – crawling pegs, managed floats, and the like (see Levy
           Yeyati and Sturzenegger 2002, for details). We call this index intermediate.
           (Notice that from these definitions we are able to construct an index that takes
           the value of one if the regime is neither pegged nor intermediate. This index
           is called flexible.)
       • And a three-way classification that combines some of the indexes described
           above, and distinguishes between pegged, intermediate and flexible exchange
           rate regimes. This index is called regime and takes a value of zero if in that
           particular year the country in question has a flexible rate. It takes a value of
           one if the country has an intermediate regime, and a value of two if the
           country has a pegged exchange rate in that particular year.


These indexes where constructed for each year in the sample (1974-2000). Table 1
presents a summary of the distribution of countries in our sample across the different
exchange rate regimes that we have defined.


                          [TABLE 1 APPROXIMATELY HERE]


       In estimating equation (1) for long run per capita growth, we follow the by now
standard literature on growth, as summarized by Barro and Sala-I-Martin (1995), and use
average data for 1974-2000. In terms of the equation specification, we follow Barro and
Sala-I-Martin (1995), Sachs and Warner (1995) and Dollar (1992) among others, and
assume that the rate of growth of GDP (g*j ) depends on a number of structural, policy
and social variables. More specifically, we include the following covariates: the log of
initial GDP per capita (gdpin); the investment ratio (invgdp); the coverage of secondary
education (sec, a proxy for human capital); an index of the degree of openness of the
economy (openness); the ratio of government consumption relative to GDP (gov); and
regional dummies for Latin American, Sub Saharan African and Transition economies
                                                       10


(latam, safrica, and trans). In some specifications we also included the rate of growth of
population. Finally, and in order to investigate whether the exchange rate regime affects
long run growth, in some of the cross-section regressions we also incorporated two
alternative indexes for the exchange rate regime. The first one, which we call
pegged_cross, is a cross section version of the time series index pegged, defined above.
It takes the value of one if the country in question has been classified as a fixed exchange
rate regime for at least 50% of the time, and zero otherwise. The second index – called
regime_cross – is a cross section version of the index regime described above, and is
constructed as an average of that index. A lower value of this regime_cross index, then,
represents a more flexible exchange rate regime. A full description of the data, including
the data sources, is provided in Appendix A.
         In the estimation of dynamics of growth equation (2), v t j is the terms of trade
shock (∆tt), and is defined as the percentage change of the relative price of exports to
imports. Thus, a positive (negative) number represents an improvement (deterioration) in
the terms of trade. In addition to the terms of trade shocks, we also included the terms of
trade shock interacted with our different exchange rate regime indexes. An index of civil
unrest was included as a proxy for other shocks (this can be interpreted as being an
element in vector u t j in equation (1)). In all equations we included time fixed effects,
which capture systemic shocks to all countries, such as changes in global liquidity and
shocks to world interest rates. We also included regional dummies, and in some of the
equations we included lagged values of the terms of trade shocks. In Table 2 we present
summary statistics for all variables used in our empirical analysis (See Appendix A for
data sources).11

II.3 Main Results
         The results from the first step estimation for the long run growth equation are
reported in Table 3, where the t-statistics have been estimated using robust standard


11
  As usual, data availability differs across countries and variables. For consistency, the statistics reported in
the table are based on the actual sample used in the empirical tests below.

errors computed using the Huber-White methodology. As may be seen, the results are
quite satisfactory; all the coefficients have the expected sign and most of them are
statistically significant. These results confirm previous findings with respect to the roles
played by initial GDP, education, openness, and government consumption in explaining
differentials in long run GDP per capita growth across countries. In terms of the main
question raised in this paper, a particularly interesting finding in Table 3 is that the
estimated coefficients for our two exchange rate regime indicators are significantly
negative. This suggests that in the long run, and after controlling for traditional
covariates, countries with (de facto) more rigid exchange rate regimes have tended to
grow at a slower rate than countries with more flexible exchange rate systems. Moreover
the absolute values of the point estimates are quite large, suggesting that, with other
things given, countries with a fixed exchange rate regime have had a lower rate of growth
of GDP per capita ranging between 0.66 and 0.85 percentage point per year, than
countries with a flexible regime. These findings contrast with studies such as Gosh et al
(1995) and IMF (1997) that have used the official IMF classification of regimes.
According to these studies, while fixed exchange rate countries tend to have a lower rate
of inflation than flexible rate ones, there is no statistical difference in terms of GDP per
capita growth across both groups of countries. Our results, on the other hand, are
consistent with recent findings by Levy Yeyati and Stuzenegger (2003).

          We use the fitted values from the estimates for long run GDP per capita growth
reported in equation (i) in Table 2 to construct a proxy for g*j in the second step
estimation of equation (2). When alternative specifications for the long run growth
equation were used, the results were very similar to those reported in the paper.12
          Table 4.a contains the results from the estimation, using the FGLS procedure
described above, of several versions of equation (2) on the dynamics of growth. All
equations were estimated for the 1974 – 2000 period, and included yearly fixed effects;
this allows us to capture the effects of shocks that are systemic to all countries in a

particular year, such as changes in international interest rates. As may be seen the results
are quite satisfactory. The estimated coefficient of [ g* j – g t-1 j ] is, as expected, positive,
significant, and smaller than one. The point estimates are on the high side -- between
0.75 and 0.79. For instance, according to equation (i) in Table 4.a, after 4 years
approximately 90% of a unitary shock to real GDP growth will be eliminated. Also, as
expected, the estimated coefficients of the terms of trade shock are always positive and
statistically significant, indicating that an improvement (deterioration) in the terms of
trade results in an acceleration (de-acceleration) in the rate of growth of real per capita
GDP. The results in Table 4.a also show that the coefficients of our political shocks
variable – civil unrest – are negative in every specification. However, they are not
significant at conventional levels.
        Our main interest in this paper is the estimated coefficient of the interactive terms
between our exchange rate regime indexes and the terms of trade shock. As may be seen
from Table 4.a, the estimated coefficients of these interactive terms are always positive,
and in most regressions they are significant at conventional levels. This indicates that the
effects of terms of trade shocks on growth are larger under fixed exchange rate regimes
that under floating regimes. Consider, as an example, the case of equation (i) in Table
4.a: the terms of trade coefficient has a point estimate of 0.043; the estimated interactive
term, on the other hand, has a point estimate of 0.037. These results suggest, then, that in
pegged exchange rates countries a 10% deterioration in the international terms of trade
has been associated, on average, with a (contemporaneous) decline in GDP per capita
growth of 0.80 of one percentage point. In flexible exchange rates countries, on the other
hand, the same 10% decline in the international terms of trade has been associated on
average with a (contemporaneous) reduction in GDP per capita growth of 0.43 of one
percentage point. That is, according to this equation under flexible exchange rates the
effects of terms of trade shocks on growth are approximately one half than under pegged
regimes.

         Table 4.b contains separate FGLS regression results for four groups of countries,
each corresponding to a different exchange rate regime. The first group is comprised of
countries that according to our indicator have a flexible exchange rate; the second sub-
sample contains countries with an intermediate regime. The third sub-sample contains
countries with a pegged exchange rate regime. And finally, the fourth sub-sample
corresponds to countries that according to our classification have had a hard peg regime.
As may be seen, the results indicate that the estimated coefficient of the terms of trade
variables is always positive and significant. What is particularly interesting from the
point of view of this paper’s topic is that point estimates of these coefficients are different
across the four sub-samples, and that they increase with the rigidity of the exchange rate
regime. Indeed, the sum of the contemporaneous and lagged terms of trade coefficients is
highest for the hard-peg regimes (0.168); the second highest value corresponds to the
pegged regimes (0.129). The sum of these coefficients is 0.071 for the intermediate
systems, and it is the lowest (0.057) for the group of countries that has had a flexible
exchange rate system. Moreover, as the χ2 tests reported in Table 4.c indicate, the
coefficients for pegs are significantly larger (from a statistical point of view) than those
for each of the more flexible regimes.13
         In order to investigate further how of terms of trade shocks affect growth under
alternative regimes, we divided our sample into industrial and emerging countries. This
allows us to analyze whether the results reported above are driven by the level of
development, rather than by their exchange rate regime. The results obtained – which are
reported in Table 5 –, show that flexible exchange rate regimes have helped buffer terms
of trade shocks for both industrial and emerging nations.


                              [TABLE 5 APPROXIMATELY HERE]


         The results reported in Tables 4 and 5, then, provide support the hypothesis that
countries with flexible regimes have been able to accommodate terms of trade shocks

13
  The χ2 statistics in this table were computed interacting each of the regressors with the corresponding
regime dummy. Thus, for example, to compute the statistics for the pegged – flexible comparison we
restricted the sample to include pegs and flexible regimes, interacted all controls with the pegged and

better than countries with rigid exchange rates. In the next section we expand our
analysis by investigating whether terms of trade shocks affect growth asymmetrically.
More precisely, we examine whether the impact of negative shocks is stronger than that
of positive shocks, as one should expect if nominal prices are rigid downward.


III.    Asymmetric Effects and Robustness Analysis
        In this section we deal with two extensions: First, we investigate whether positive
and negative terms of trade shocks affect growth in an asymmetric way, and whether
these asymmetric effects are different under alternative exchange rate regimes. And
second, we analyze the robustness of our results to alternative classifications of exchange
rate regimes, and to the use of alternative samples.


III.1 Asymmetric Effects of Terms of Trade Shocks under Alternative Regimes
        According to a number of authors the most important advantage of flexibility is
that it allows the economy to buffer negative terms of trade shocks through smooth
changes (depreciations) in the real exchange rate. This contrasts with the case of pegged
exchange rates, where real exchange rate depreciation requires a decline in nominal
prices. If nominal prices are rigid downward, however, a negative terms of trade shock
will result in unemployment, a decline in output and I the rate of growth – see Dornbusch
(2001) and Kenen (2002) for details.In that sense, then, iIt is possible to argue that from a
policy point of view what really matters is the way in which alternative exchange rate
regimes accommodate negative terms of trade shocks.
        In order to investigate this issue, we estimated a number of regressions that
distinguished between positive and negative terms of trade shocks. As before we used a
FGLS procedure for heteroskedastic panels. In this case, our system becomes:


        (3)      g* j = α + x j β + r j θ + ω j.


        (4)      ∆ g t j = λ [ g* j – g t-1 j ] + ϕ vp t j + ψ vn t j + γ u t j + ξ t j .


flexible dummies, and tested the null ∆tt* pegged+∆tt_1*neg*pegged – (∆tt*flexible + ∆tt_1*flexible) = 0.
The last column (pegged vs. hard) compares conventional and hard pegs regimes.
                                                     15


Where vp t j refers to positive terms of trade shocks, vn t j refers to negative shocks; ϕ and
ψ are coefficients to be estimated. If the effects of negative terms of trade disturbances
on growth are indeed larger than those of positive shocks, we would expect ψ to be
significantly larger than ϕ. In the estimation of equations (3) and (4) we made a
distinction between four exchange rate regimes: hard-pegged; pegged; intermediate and
flexible. If, as its supporters have argued, flexible regimes are able to accommodate better
negative real shocks from abroad, the estimated ψs – that is, the coefficients of the
negative terms of trade shocks -- would be larger in countries with more rigid exchange
rate regimes than in countries with more flexible ones. As before, in the estimation of the
equation on growth dynamics (equation (4)) we included time specific effects.
         The results from the estimation of the second stage equation (4) are presented in
Table 6 for two alternative samples: one that includes all countries and a sub-sample of
emerging countries only. As may be seen, the results obtained indicate that there are
indeed asymmetric effects of terms of trade shocks in six out of the seven regressions. In
every equation, with the exception of (i), the sum of the coefficients for the negative
shocks is higher than the sum of the coefficients for the positive shocks. Moreover, the
differences in the terms of trade coefficients are statistically significant for the hard pegs,
pegs, and intermediate regimes – see table 7 for formal tests.


                             [TABLE 6 APPROXIMATELY HERE]
                             [TABLE 7 APPROXIMATELY HERE]


         Consider, for example, the comparison between pegged and flexible regimes for
the whole sample. According to the FGLS estimates in Table 6, the sum of the
coefficients of the negative terms of trade shocks is 0.158 for the pegged regime
countries, but only 0.053 for those countries with a flexible exchange rate. From a
statistical point of view, the sum of the (negative) terms of trade coefficients is
significantly higher for the pegged regime countries – the χ2 has a p-value of 0.017
(Table 7).14 In fact, similar tests indicate that the sum of the negative terms of trade

14
  The χ2 statistics in this table were computed interacting each of the regressors with the corresponding
regime dummy. Thus, to compute the statistics for negative shocks for the pegged – flex comparison we
                                                    16


coefficients for countries with flexible (fixed) exchange rate arrangements are
significantly lower (higher) than the sum of the coefficients for countries with non-
flexible (non-pegged) rates. Thus, these results indicate that the reported asymmetric
response to shocks in countries with more rigid exchange rate regimes is mainly driven
by the larger effects of negative terms of trade shocks. This, combined with the fact that
the sensitivity to both positive and negative shocks is higher the less flexible the regime,
suggests that the lack of exchange rate flexibility increases the real impact of terms of
trade shocks due to the lack of (downward) price flexibility.
         To summarize, these results provide further support for the hypothesis that
flexible exchange rates have played a role as shock absorbers, helping countries
accommodate real terms of trade shocks. This ability to accommodate these shocks
appears to have been particularly important in the presence of negative external shocks.


III.2 Alternative Classification of Exchange Rate Regimes
         In this subsection we investigate whether the results reported above depend on the
classification of exchange rate regimes that we have used. In order to do this we re-
estimated our model using the standard and official exchange rate classification provided
by the IMF. The results obtained in this case, not reported here due to space
considerations, are somewhat weaker.15 Although the coefficients have the expected
signs, and in most cases have similar point estimates to those reported in Tables 4-6, they
are estimated with a lower degree of precision.
         To explore further this issue we conducted the following simple exercise: we
revised the IMF-based classification, and tried to detect obvious misclassifications of
regimes. We then re-estimated our equations using a restricted sample that include only
uncontroversial de jure IMF-defined regimes. This entails the (relatively minor) loss of
89 observations.16 The estimates, which are available from the authors on request, have a
higher degree of precision than those obtained when the unadjusted IMF classification is
used. As before, these results indicate that terms of trade shocks – and in particular

included pegs and flexible regimes, interacted all the controls with the pegged and flexible dummies, and
tested the null ∆tt*neg*pegged+∆tt*neg_1*pegged – (∆tt*neg*flexible + ∆tt*neg_1*flexible) = 0.
15
    These results are available on request.
                                                      17


negative terms of trade shocks – have a larger effect on growth under rigid exchange rate
regimes than under more flexible regimes.


IV. Concluding Remarks
         In this paper we examined two aspects of the economic implications of exchange
rate regimes that, despite being recurrently used to argue in favor of exchange rate
flexibility, have been the subject of little, if any, empirical work: (i) the role played by
flexible exchange rates as absorbers of real shocks, and (ii) the link between this role and
the presence of downward price rigidities. More precisely, we tested whether the
sensitivity of real growth to terms of trade shocks declines as the degree of flexibility of
the regime increases. In addition, we investigated whether this sensitivity is higher in the
event of negative shocks, as it would be the case in the presence of asymmetric price
rigidities.
         Using a de facto classification of exchange rate regimes, we found that flexible
exchange rate arrangements indeed help reduce the real impact of terms of trade shocks
on GDP growth, both in emerging and industrial economies.17 Moreover, we found real
output growth to be more sensitive to negative than to positive shocks. In fact, most of
the differential shock responses across regimes can be traced to the stronger real impact
of negative shocks under a peg, be it of the conventional or the hard kind. The effects
unveiled in this paper are, on the other hand, not only statistically significant but
economically important: while a 10 percent deterioration of the terms of trade translates
into a real contraction of around 0.4% for the average country, this effect nearly doubles
under a peg. Thus, the choice of exchange rate regime indeed has important implications
in terms of output volatility. Moreover, the fact that the asymmetry of output responses
to real shocks increases with the rigidity of the regime suggests that pegs are associated
with deeper and longer contractions.




16
   While a similar correction can be done for floats and intermediates, it is certainly in the fix group where
misclassifications are less debatable, as changes in the exchange rate are readily observable.
17
   Similar, albeit slightly weaker, results are obtained if a de jure regime classification is used.

                Appendix B. De Facto Exchange Rate Regime Classification 18


         The de facto classification of exchange rate regimes used in this paper employ
cluster analysis techniques to group countries according to the behavior of three variables
related to exchange rate policy: (i) Exchange rate volatility (σe), measured as the average
of the absolute monthly percentage changes in the nominal exchange rate relative to the
relevant anchor currency (or basket of currencies, whenever the currency weights are
disclosed) over the year; (ii) Volatility of exchange rate changes (σ∆e), measured as the
standard deviation of the monthly percentage changes in the exchange rate; and (iii)
Volatility of reserves (σr), measured as the average of the absolute monthly change in
dollar denominated international reserves relative to the dollar value of the monetary base
in the previous month.
         These variables are computed on an annual basis, so that each country-year
observation represents a point in the (σe, σ∆e, σr) space. In this space, floats are
associated with little intervention in the exchange rate market (low volatility of reserves)
together with high volatility of exchange rates. Observations with little or no exchange
rate volatility and substantial reserves volatility correspond to the group of fixes. Finally,
intermediate regimes are associated with moderate to high volatility across all variables,
reflecting exchange rate movements in spite of active intervention. Observations are
grouped by proximity using cluster analysis according to the characteristics previously
identified.19
