                    Costly   Adjustment and Limited Borrowing:

        A Welfare Analysis of Policies to Achieve External Balance



                                     ABSTRACT


     This paper develops an analytical framework for the analysis of adjustment to
 adverse shocks in the presence of limited access to the international credit market.
We consider an economy producing traded and non-traded goods and experiencing a
permanent, unanticipated drop in the availability of external resources. A direct
effect of the shock is that previous consumption and production patterns are not
feasible any more, and the economy consequently must undergo an adjustment that
will allow it to regain its external balance. We introduce several frictions in the
form of time-dependent reallocation costs and nominal labor contracts. We assess the
welfare consequences of restricted access to the capital market by comparing the
welfare loss induced by the drop in income between the cases of credit rationing and
perfect access to international credit. Our analysis demonstrates that restricted
borrowing has three effects -- the intertemporal cost; the contemporaneous
reallocation cost and the dead—weight loss in the labor market. Restricted access to
international capital markets requires a greater real depreciation, implying 9reater
reallocation of resources and consequently greater loss of output in the short run.
Access to the capital market will require smaller contemporaneous reallocation,
allowing partial postponement of the adjustment to the future, when It will be
associated with lower costs. In general, these costs can have first order effect. With
nominal wage contracts we will observe potential losses in the labor market due to
nominal rigidities. These effects can be (at least partially) overcome by optimal
devaluation. Our analysis demonstrates that the effect of limited access to
international credit is to Increase the welfare loss due to nominal contracts,
consequently necessitating a larger devaluation. We conclude that capital flows and
credit assistance can have substantial benefits in reducing the welfare cost of
adjustment to adverse real shocks.

       1. INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY




       Most developing countries nave experienced significant (adverse) external shocks

 durin9      the 1980s. Decline in international transfers, increases in external interest
 payments anddeterioration of terms of trade have required painful policy decisions
 in   order to reach external balance.

      The issue of whether less costly adjustment paths can be identified has arisen.
 i.e. , can we identify a more optimal sequencing of policies to achieve external
baLance. Should the country quickly apply switching              policies such as a devaluation?

Should the policy maker also quickly initiate contractional policies to reflect the

drop    in   real income? Or should one postpone or slow the pace           of   adjustment?
      The purpose of this paper Is         to   provide a simple analytical framework that can

guide the discussion of this topic. We consider an economy producing traded and
non-traded goods and experiencing a permanent, unanticipated drop                 In the availability
of external resources. A direct effect of the shock is that previous consumption and

production patterns         are not feasible any more, and the economy            consequently must
undergo an adjustment that will allow it to regain its external balance. We introduce
several frictions in the form of time-dependent reallocation costs and                 nominal labor

contracts.       Thus elasticities of demand and supply become time dependent, their

magnitudes riing as time passes; While inputs are mobile in the long—run, mobility

is more costly In the short—run. Consequently,           a key feature    determining the costs of

moving       inputs is   the planning time that has been available before the move.

      The   paper evaluates the welfare implications of several alternative sequences of
adjustment under various degrees of access to international credit markets. This
allows us        to identify factors determining the welfare gain attributed to the

possibility      of financing current account deficits during the transition to the new

equilibrium.
                                   -2-
      we apply our framework to assess the welfare consequences of restricted access
to the Capital market, by comparing the welfare loss Induced         by the   drop in income
between the    cases of credit rationing and perfect access to international credit. Our

analysis     demonstrates that restricted borrowing has three effects -- jjj
 intertemDoral   cost; the contemDoraneous   reallocation cost and   the dead-weight loss In

the labor market.
      The intertemporal cost reflects the    change in   welfare induced by the change in
the   real interest rate. This effect operates via I.w.Q. channels. The first corresponds to

the    direct welfare effect of the change in the interest rate induced by the new
borrowing. The second effect corresponds to the intertemporal reallocation effects of
the change in time path of the output of non traded goods.1

      The contemporaneous reallocation cost accounts for the           resources needed to
re-allocate inputs. Restricted access to international capital markets              requires
a greater real depreciation, implying greater reallocation of resources and
consequently greater loss of output in the short run. Access to the capital market
will require smaller contemporaneous reallocation, allowing partial postponement of
the adjustment to the future, when it will be associated with lower costs. In general.
these costs can have first order effects.
      With nominal wage contracts we will observe potential losses in the labor market
due to nominal rigidities. These effects can be (at least partially) overcome by
optimal    devaluation. Our   analysis demonstrates that the effect of limited access to
international credit is       to increase the   welfare loss due to nominal contracts,
consequently necessitating a larger devaluation. We conclude that capital flows and
credit assistance can have substantial benefits in reducing the welfare cost of

adjustment    to adverse real shocks.

   Section 2 introduces the model by describing the supply of output and the
equilibrium in the goods, labor and the capital market. Section 3 evaluates the
adjustment to an unanticipated adverse real shock for the case of flexible labor
market. Section 1 analyzes the various components of the welfare criterion applied in
our discussion, and uses it to evaluate the -welfare implications of limited access to
international credit. Section 5 studies the adjustment in the presence of             labor

contracts and Section 6 provides concluding remarks. Appendix A derives the loss

function underting our discussion, and Appendix B describes an extension of our

analysis   beyond a two periods modeL

   2. THE MODEL

   in    this section we outline the building blocks of the model. These building blocks

contain a specification of the supply of output and the equilibrium in the goods, labor

and the capital market.

   Before turning to the formal analysis It Is instructive to review the economics of


adjustment to an unanticipated adverse income shock. The consequence
                                                                     of the shock is

that   the economy must undergo a structural adjustment that will raise the size of the
traded sector. The presence of time dependent re-allocation costs Is reflected In the
assumption that Labor is fully mobile only In the long run. In the short run, however,
mobility of Labor is costly and there are effective             limits to the attainable

reallocation.   The key feature determining the cost of moving labor is the planning
time that has been available before the move. Figure One plots a sketch of the
mar9inal costs in such an economy. In the long-run, complete mobility of Inputs
allows expansion of output at a constant mar9inat cost. In the short—run, mobility is

costly   and limited. The planned output for time t is denoted by _1X. The short-run


marginal cost schedule is given by schedule SS, intersecting the long-run schedule at

the planned emplojment level. Access to the international credit market may play an

important    role in determining the cost of adjustment. The consequence of the drop in
income is that we should produce more traded goods to replace the drop In external
income. Access to the international capital market allows us to replace some of the

drop in income in       the transition with international borrowing, paying for the

borrowing in the long-run. The absence of such access will imply                a greater

adjustment of production    in   the short-run relative to the adjustment needed with full

access. Thus, access to the capital market will allow intertemporal substitution of

costly    short-run adjustment with cheaper       long—run adjustment. This argument    Is

exemplified in Figure One. Points A and B describe the adjustment            in the traded


good   sector in the absence of access to the international credit market In the short

and the long-run, respectively. Points Am and Bm describe the adjustment in            the


traded good sector with complete access to the international credit market
in the short— and the long-run.           respectively. Note that access to the credit

market       saves (relative to the case of no access) the shaded area between points A

and Am. A similar argument applies for the non—traded sector, only now the


adjustment is in the opposite direction, The area between points D and Dm


corresponds       to the saving in     adjustment costs in the non-traded sector that Is

enabled      by the access to international borrowing. The purpose of our subsequent
discussion      is to model an economg characterized by time dependent       reallocation cost
and to evaluate the welfare consequences of limited access to the International

credit market.




      2.1 OUTPUT

      The formulation of the production function is guided by the notion of the presence

of                      labor reallocation costs. For simplicity of exposition we consider

here the extreme version of such           a framework - the case of a Ricardian model where

the    cost of moving labor today is zero if the reallocation has been anticipated
yesterday, but is a concave function if          the reallocation   is unanticipated. A simple
way to capture this notion Is by postulating a time dependent production function,
where in the lonQ run output is given by




      (Ia)    XcL ; Cø.
where L corresponds to employment of labor, and c represents the rewards to
entrepreneurial     skills,   The case of c = 0 corresponds   to a Ricardlan technology. As In

any Ricardian model, the model abstract from the process of investment in productive

capital and quantities are demand determined. Output In the short-run Is given by




      (ib) X C        + Lt —     (Lt   Et_i[LtJ)2     / (2 Eti[Lt])




where         is the output at   time t;   Lt is the labor emploged in activity     at time t;
                                        -6-
Et_i[LtJ is the expected level of employment in activity X; where expectations are

taken at the previous period (t-1); and r is a measure related to the magnitude of the

contemporaneous costs of moving labor. Henceforth we denote EtIELt] by _1L

Throughout our discussion we will choose functional forms for the supply and demand
that will yield simple expressions for the percentage changes around the initial

equilibrium .     For example, this concern motivates the choice of the normalization of

the adjustment costs in equation         (Ib). The formulation of (Ib) corresponds to the case

where it takes one period to reach the long run, where the planed employment equals

the    realized one. This formulation can be extended           to the case where adjustment is

more gradual, as will be shown in             Appendix B. To gain further insight we turn to
Figure   Two, which plots the production function for the case where c                   0. Curve Os

corresponds to the long-run production function, where actual employment corresponds

to    the planned. Suppose that the expected production is at point B. Curve ABC is a
plot of the short-run production process that is dictated by equation (ib). While this
curve    is tan9ent to     the long run production at the planned point (B), the distance
between the two curves rises            quadratically with       lit -   _jLtl. The   effective range

of the   supply   is   between A and C, reflecting the non-negativity constraint on output

and the fact that production will occur only where the marginal product of labor is
positive. The short-run employment range is dictated by the magnitude of the cost of
reallocation (r). As i -. oo, the short-run production curve converges to point B;
whereas if i - 0,        the short—run production curve converges to the Long             run   (curve

OS).   A rise in , can be shown to be associated with a raise in the concavity of the
production schedule AC.2 The production                function specified in (Ib) defines a
short-run demand for labor by the equality between real wages and marginal

productivitg, and a corresponding output:

 Short-run employment and output deviate from the planned output at a rate that
 depends negatively on deviations of real wages from their long run equilibrium level
 (where W/P            1) and on the measure of reallocation costs. Henceforth we will assume
 for simplicity of exposition that C 0.
         We consider a two-sectorial economy, where N and I               denote   the non-traded and
 the   traded     sectors, respectively. To allow simpler aggregation we assume that both

 sectors apply the same technology and are facing the same adjustment cost as

 specified in equation (la,lb). Allowing for differential technologies will complicate

 notation due to a much more             complicated   aggregation process without affecting the
 logic of our      discussion,    Figure Three plots the transformation curve dictated by the

above technology. Curve N1T1 Is the long-run curve. Suppose that planned                   production


 occurs at point B. The short-run production possibility frontier is given by
                                                                                             N9BT
which is        concave in   portion ABC. Higher reallocation costs (      dii > 0)   have the effect

of   shifting the short-run curve             inwards, to NS.BTS. ;    reducing the length of the
concave     portion of the transformation curve and raising Its curvature. At the limit,
as   ii-' oo.       production    frontier approaches        ABC.3



       2.2 THE GOODS MARKET

       For notational simplicity we assume henceforth a two-periods economy (t                      1.

2). We denote by              the price of 900d y at time t (y = N, T). Similarly, we denote by

C the consumption of goon               V   at time t. Let      stand for the consumption share of
sector V (y = N,       I). We denote the aggregate price index by P.       defined as a geometric

weighted average:                               ,N + T' In
       Alternatively,        if Q denotes the real exchange rate (defined by the ratio of the

price of non-traded to traded goods, Q t,N't,T ) we get that

        Consumers net income reflects the value of output, adjusted for the presence of

 international transfers (denoted by Z) '• Let r denote the inierest rate facing the
 country    (defined in   terms of the traded good), and S the corresponding discount factor
 (8     i/U+r)). To simplify exposition we abstract from foreign inflation, assuming

 constant foreign prices of traded     goods, normalized to   one. The first-period wealth of

 consumers in terms of the CPI price index (denoted by Q) is given by:


               Q            +
      (3)                          Xl,N +      + & I X2.. + 2,N X2N + Z21)/ (Q1)N




An alternative interpretation of            is as the income from traded output, like natural

resources. To simplify future notation we assume that                   Z. Our analysis will

evaluate the sequencing of adjustment to a change in Z, which can have the dual
interpretat ion of a change in foreign transfers or in the external terms of trade.
      The demand for non-traded goods and traded goods is defined as a generalization
of a Cobb—Douglas framework. As Is evident from (3), fIrst period wealth In terms of

the traded good is given by Q (Q1)ocu. We assume that consumers wish to spend in the

first period a portion exp( ii — h p) of their wealth, where h and h are constant
parameters and p is the consumption real interest rate, expressed as


      (4) p = r - E1 ( °g(


The term h denotes the semi-elasticity of demand with respect to the real interest

rate. The decomposition of the first-period spending (i.e. Q Q1OCN exp( IV - h p))

between traded and non—traded goods Is determined by relative prices:
                                       -g -
                   =                        Q (Q10N) exp( ii- h p)

where C1,, denotes the consumption of good Y (V = NJ) afld               Is the price elasticity

of demand for non-traded goods. Similarly, the consumption In the second period is
given by



           C2N     oN(Q2) °N               Q (Q1°N) ((1 - exp( h- h p)}/8I;

           C2T [1 - °N2T J                   Q   (Q1°N) [(1 - exp( i- h p))/6I


In defining (6) we take care f or the requirement of intertemporal solvency, which
Implies    that real second-period aggregate consumption (in terms of traded goods)

equals Q(Q1°N) RI       - exp(   1i   -h   p))/8]. Note that an economy where the underlying


periodic utility is Cobb-Douglas corresponds to a special case where             =      h = 0.

   While the   demand for traded goods may diverge from the corresponding supply at

any given period, equilibrium in the non—traded market requires that

   2.3 THE LABOR MARKET

   For the purpose of our        analysis    we will distinguish between two types of labor

markets, In the first case, we will consider the case of a flexible economy          where   the

labor market     always clears. This will define the benchmark economy for our
subsequent discussion, where we will allow for the presence of nominal contracts In

the labor market. This      In turn   leads to the possibility of labor market non—clearing.

The supply of labor is given by:
                                        - 10-


      (8)       Its       A (Wt/t)€         where W stands for the moneu wage.



      In the case of a flexible equilibrium the nominal wage is set so as to clear the

 labor      market, With nominal contracts, W is pre-set at the end of each period at the

 level      that is   expected to clear the labor market next period.




      2.4    THE CAPITAL MARKET

      we formulate the case where countrg risk considerations implg the presence of an
upward—sloping         supplg of credit (B). given   b

      (9)     B/C@t(r-r0) ;


where CØT stands for the initial (pre-sriock) consumption of traded goods and B is

the   current account deficit, given bg C11 -                 - Z1.   The term r measures the


degree of integration of financial markets, where r0 is the interest rate in the

absence       of new borrowing. To       simplifg future notation we define the degree of

financial      integration in terms of the responsiveness of the supply of     credit (relative

to   consumption of traded goods) to changes In the interest rate facing the country,
and we suppress existing         debt service in Z.   External credit rationing corresponds to
      0, whereas full integration to r -. oo. We denote by            the spread r — r0 . Using

this notation we get

      3. ADJUSTMENT TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS: FLEXIBLE LABOR MARKETS



      We start    this section by characterizing the Initial long—run equilibrium

associated      with revenue Z, reflecting export proceeds for natural resources or
alternatively international transfers. For simplicity of exposition, we assume that
the initial equilibrium is characterized by a balanced current account where net

savings    are zero (equivalently, that 1/(1+6) exp(i- hp)). This in turn implies that

the initial equilibrium is characterized by:




      Q (16)(AZ) ;             PNPTWl
      C1N C2N OCNQ/(L+6) ON(A + 2) ;              C1..       C2T                      T(A + 2)


where    A is the long-run supply of labor (obtained from (8)). To simplify notation we
will   assume   also that the initial equilibrium is symmetric across periods, as will be
the   case if &    0. This enables us to simplify aggregation by considering an initial

equilibrium where each period has equal weights.

      We next examine the adjustment pattern   to an unanticipated permanent drop            in 2

for the case of a flexible labor market.




      3.1 THE LONG-RUN EQUILIBRIUM

      The initial long—run equilibrium has a simple representation at Figure Four. The

presence of transfers 2 implies a wedge between aggregate output and consumption

opportunities. Let curve N1T1 be the long—run production frontier, Consumption


opportunities are given by the          curve N1T1 ,   which       is a horizontal displacement


of N1T1 by 2. Equilibrium consumption is at a point
                                                        C1     ,   where   the indifference curve


is tangent to N1T1. It corresponds to production at point X1. Suppose that at period

one   there is an unanticipated permanent drop in Z , and for          simplicity   of exposition
suppose that 2 drops to zero. The new long-run equilibrium will occur at a point like

      3.2 THE SHORT RUN EQUILIBRIUM

      The short-run equilibrium Is characterized by limited labor mobility, as reflected

in the short-run production frontier P15T5     .   In 9eneral, we should distinguish between

two possible equilibria. If the shock to Z or if the reallocation cost (ii) are
relatively small, we will observe an internal equilibrium where production Is at a

point like       . Otherwise, we will observe a corner solution where production Is at

a point on   the vertical portion    of the short-run transformation curve. Henceforth we
assume an internal solution. The location of the production and the consumption

points will be shown to be determined by the access to international borrowing.


      Figure Five describes the dependency of the short-run adjustment on the access to

international credit. In the absence of access to the international capital market,


production and consumption     will occur at point         .Access to international      credit

enables equilibrium where production and consumption are at points X and C'

respectively.   The horizontal distance between the two points equals the borrowing.
The dotted curve plots the consumption points obtained for different interest rates. A

lower interest rate (due to a higher financial integration. i.e. a higher r) is

associated   with a consumption point that is farther from the 'credit autarky' point,
)( The higher borrowing associated with the higher access to the international

capital market has the consequence of reducing the needed production of traded
output, allowing thereby a higher production of non-traded and a lower real
depreciation. We turn now for a formal derivation of these results.
      Let us denote by lower case letters the percentage change in a variable relative

to its pre-shock,   initial value;   thus, for a variable Y, y =   log   (Y/Y0)
                                                                                  (Y -

    Thus, the change in aggregate emplotiment is given bg

    The demand for labor will drop at a rate proportional to the rise in the consumer real
-
    wage, where the proportionalitg factor drops with a rise In the cost of labor
    reallocation.    In   deriving this result we are applying (2a') and the assumption of equal
    reallocation     costs across sectors. This last assumption facilitates the aggregation

    process, allowing the       representation of aggregate demand for labor as a function of
    real   consumption wage independent of relative prices. The supplg of labor (8) will

    change according to

    Applying a first-order approximation to equation (Ib) and using the labor market

    equilibrium condition (12) yields the short-run changes in output:

 To complete    the characterization of the short-run equilibrium we should solve for the

 resultant real exchange rate (q) and the new interest rate spread (F        ). To   simplify

 notation we will assume also that the initial equilibrium is symmetric across

 periods,    as will be the case if       1. NotIce that equilibrium In the non-traded goods
 market (7) implies that

The right-hand side corresponds to the change in the demand for non-traded goods, as

 is implied by (4. 5). The term            is the resultant change in the (consumer) real

 interest    rate. Because in period   two the real exchange rate Is one, we Infer from (5)

that         = F + OCN q1. By applying the definition of Q (equation 3) we get that
equilibrium in the non-traded goods implies that

yields the equilibrium changes in the interest rate facing the country and the real

interest    rate is

     Several observations are In order. Consider the case where there is a permanent
drop in transfers, (z < 0). This drop Is associated with a net drop in the demand for
non-traded goods. Because in the short run we have limited substitutability in the
production side, equilibrium requires a drop             in   the relative price of   non-traded goods

(see (20)). The needed relative price adjustment is larger the lower the sectorlal

substitutability in production (d'rl >            0) and consumption within and between periods
(d   <0 and dh <       0   ).   Note that the substitutability in production goes up over time.

Consequently, the resultant drop in output in the short—run exceeds the long—run and

consumption smoothing calls for present borrowing of 'rF' (see (19)). The Induced

change in the consumption real interest rate is the sum of E                + ocq. Consequently, the
                                            - 16-

 direction of the consumption real Interest rate adjustment is determined bj the

 balance between two opposing forces (see 21). The first effect corresponds to the

 direct effect of a rise In the interest rate (measured in traded goods, r) induced
                                                                                                          by
 the    new borrowing. The second effect corresponds to the intertemporal reallocation
 effects of the change in relative prices. Because the drop in the price of non-traded
 goods is transitory, it works to reduce the (consumption) real interest rate. The net
 change in          the real interest rate is determined by            the sum of these two effects, as can
 be seen from (21). With perfect access to international credit (v = oo),                         only   the
 second effect is observed, whereas in the presence of credit rationing the first effect
 dominates:




                                                +   O(N(.5 + h) + °T - .5s °Q"i1 < e

           It is noteworthy that openness works to dampen the needed changes in the
 interest      rates ( and F).

       We can gain insight into the role of the capital account by contrasting two

limiting cases --           full   financial integration (t -' oo) and external credit rationing

(r      0). Equation (20) implies that




                     q11

Inspection       of (20) reveals that access to international credit mitigates the needed

changes of relative prices and the consequent output adjustment. Formally, it implies

that

   A comparison of the credit autarky equilibrium with the borrowing equilibrium

reveals that access to credit enhances welfare due to two factors. First, it allows a

smoother   intertemporal consumption path (in terms of Figure Five C is further from

x5).   Second, It allows smaller costly reallocation of resources In the short-run,

saving on costly adjustment costs (in terms of Figure FIve       Is   closer to X1). We

turn now to the analytical derivation of the welfare cost associated with costly
adjustment to shocks in the presence of limited access to the International credit
market.

       4. ON THE WELFARE EFFECTS OF LIMITED ACCESS TO INTERNATIONAL CREDIT



        We turn now to an assessment of the welfare effects of limited access to

 international credit. To do so we apply a modified Harberger's triangles
                                                                              analysis for
 the   assessment of the welfare Loss due to restricted access to international credit.

 We apply the analysis for the case where the policy maker intends to service the

 debt fully. This allows us to treat        the welfare Loss due to limited access to

 international credit as equivalent to the loss due toa borrowing tax levied by the

 creditors on the borrowing nation.7 Using the initial        long-run equilibrium as the

 benchmark and assuming negligible cross effects Appendix A shows that the                In

 welfare   (WI) induced by the drop in   transfers   in terms of consumption of   period one
 can be approximated by



       (23) Wi    Ii:zI (1 + 8) + A1()2 + 51@,N (oc1q1)2/1 +              (q1)/
The first term is the direct income effect associated with the loss of income, being
equal to the net present value of the drop in transfers. The second term measures the

drop in welfare due to the change in the real interest rate, where           .5hCOT. The
                                                                        A1
last two terms reflect the welfare loss due to the'reallocat iofl costs as reflected by
the second term In the production function (see (ib)). In terms of Figure One these
losses measure the areas between the short- and the long-run marginal cost
schedules, and their size is determined by the short—run reallocation of production.
These two terms can be added up to yield a total loss associated with reallocation
cost of


   (24)    .5 L9 ococ(q1)2/1


   By applying equations (20. 21) to the welfare loss we get that greater
substitutability in consumption between traded and non-traded goods and smaLler
reallocation costs reduce the resultant welfare loss due to the drop in transfers.
                                    - 19-

Furthermore, It can be shown that whenever          < .5, a rise in the share of non-traded

goods is associated with greater welfare loss, and that:

    (25) 8wL/8<e 8w1/a>e; awL/aoN>e(forN<.5)

We can now apply our framework to assess the welfare consequences of credit
rationing, by comparing the welfare loss induced by the drop in transfers between the
case of no and perfect access to international credit. As equations (22) and (23)
reveal, restricting borrowing has IYjQ independent effects -- the InterternDoral cost
and the contemDoraneous reallocation cost.
    The    intertemporal   cost reflects the drop in welfare induced by the change in the

real interest rate, as reflected in the second term of (23). This effect operates via

iw channels. The      first channel operates via the rise of the interest rate facing the

country. The second        channel operates via relative prices. The consumption real
interest   rate is determined by the    expected future real appreciation. The effect of
credit    rationing is to cause greater current real depreciation Inducing thereby a

higher expected future appreciation and consequently a lower real Interest rate (see

(4). (15). (22)).   These two effects operate in opposite directions, and the net change
in the real interest rate is determined by the balance between these two forces. The
resultant welfare cost is quadratic In the net change in the real interest      rate.

    The contemporaneous reallocation cost is reflected in        the last two terms of (23).
accounting for the         resources needed to re-allocate labor. Restricted access to

international credit results         in greater    real depreciation, implying greater
reallocation   of resources and consequently    greater ioss of output.   Note that to allow

a tractable analysis we have assumed a quadratic reallocation term In equation (ib).

As a result, the magnitude of the last two terms in the       welfare loss is of secondary

order.   I.e., the reallocation costs are negligible around the initial equilibrium, being
equal to tne size of a 'Harberger' triangle. In general, however, these costs can nave
first-order effects.    This will be the   case, for example, if the reallocation costs are
                                               8
proportional   to the size of the reallocation. in such a case   the reallocation costs   are
of a first order magnitude, and they are significant even for small deviations from
                                   - 20-

the initial   equilibrium. The relative order of the welfare costs is playin9 a key role

in   determining the importance of the costs of limited capital mobility. For example,
a second order cost is much smaller than the shock inducin9 it, whereas a first order
cost has the same magnitude as the shock (more formally, the cost/shock ratio
approaches zero if     the   shock is approaching zero for a second order cost, and a
positive number for a first order cost).
     We close this sect ion by considering an example that illustrates the consequences

of restricted access to international credit. The 'details of this comparison are

summarized     in Figure SIx.9 Solid lines In Figure SIx correspond to the percentage
change induced by the drop in Z with credit rationing, whereas broken lines
correspond to the percentage change     with perfect access to international credit. The

drop in external income necessitates a rise in the production of traded goods and a

corresponding decline in the production of non-traded goods,     which   is accomplished

with   a real depreciation. Credit rationing has the consequence of magnifying the
needed depreciation of the real exchange rate adjustment (q). These changes also
imply that credit rationing induces greater change in the composition of output, and
consequently much greater welfare loss due to reallocation costs.

    5. ADJUSTMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF NOMINAL CONTRACTS



    Our previous      discussion assumed away the presence of nominal rigidities In the

short run. Consequently, the discussion was conducted in a real model, and there was

no active role for nominal exchange-rate policies. The purpose of this section is to

extend the analysis to the case where due to transaction cost considerations we

observe in the short run nominal contracts in the labor market. Consider the case

where there are one-period contracts that pre-set the wage at its expected market

clearing level. Actual employment is assumed to be demand determined, implying that

actual output is given now by

where e denotes the unanticipated devaluation at period one. We can solve for the

short-run equilibrium by applying the same methodology as in section 3 and using

(13')   and (II') as the relevant output equations, which yields The following conditions

for q1 and

The presence of nominal wage contracts Is reflected in the observation that the

short-run    equilibrium is determined by the unanticipated devaluation rate. The

measure     of the welfare loss induced by the drop in income should be adjusted to
account for the possibility of a non-clearing labor market. The new loss

A comparison between the loss with a flexible labor market (23) and the present loss
reveals that the only difference Is the addition of the last term In (23'), reflecting
the dead-weight loss in the labor market. This loss is quadratic in the discrepancy

between the actual and the equilibrium real wage. As was shown in section 3.2, the

equilibrium real wages stag Intact (see equations 10, ii). Consequently, the loss in

the labor market is proportional to the square of the change in real wages, given by

the change in the price level, e +


     To exemplify the potential role of a nominal devaluation,             consider first the case
of   perfect access to international credit, where r-'          implies that

Applying (10) allows us to conclude that in the absence of an active nominal
exchange rate policy we will observe a percentage drop in employment given by

                                  xN)}.
                                          The drop in employment rises with the share of

non-traded     goods and with the degree of short-run             labor mobility. Note       that

unanticipated       nominal      devaluation        (d e > 0) implies in the short run real

depreciation ( q1 <      0). This is the result of the fact that a devaluation reduces the
                                        - 23-

 real   wage, raising thereby the supply of non-traded goods, requiring real depreciation.

 We can apply (26) to derive the values of the devaluation rates that will eliminate

 the losses in various markets. These rates are summarized by:




       (27)    el
                            =

                     10                 +   O((.5 + h) +    -




Equation (27) stands for the devaluation rate that will preserve the real exchange

rate intact following the drop in income, This is also the needed depreciation that

will nullify the losses due to the unanticipated reallocation of labor (the third term

in (23')). Note that this can be accomplished only by an jieciatlon. The logic of

this    result follows from the observation that In the absence of an active nominal
exchange rate policy (e         0) we observe real depreciation (see (26) for e = 0). thus
we need a nominal appreciation If we wish to avoid the initial real depreciation.
    EquatIon (28) stands for the needed nominal depreciation that wILL prevent
dead-weight losses in the labor market by keeping a stable price level, thereby
nullifying the last term in (23').               Note that this can be accomplished by a
devaluation. The needed devaluation rises with the cost of labor reallocation (11) and
with the share of non-traded goods, and drops with a rise in the substitutability in
consumption    between traded     and non-traded goods.

   Our analysis      so far assumes perfect access to international credit. We turn now

to the, other polar case --     the   presence of external credit rationing (t   0).   In such a

case we get   that

A comparison of (26) and (29) reveals that the absence of access to international
credit magnifies the real depreciation Induced by the drop In income and the
consequent drop in emplo9ment. In the absence of an active exchange rate policy we
will   observe a drop          in employment given by °N SZ/{ T + 0(T). We turn now to the

derivation of the devaluation rates that will nullify                       the losses in    the various

markets. Applying (18') and (18') allows us to conclude that

AS in the case of perfect access to International credit, we need a nominal

appreciation      to prevent real depreciation following the drop In income, and a nominal
depreciation      to prevent dead-weight losses In             the   labor market. If the policy   target
is   to prevent the induced rise in the (consumption) real interest rate, we need a large
devaluation. The logic behind this result Is that a devaluation raises the Supply of
traded goods in the short run, thereby mitigating the Induced current account deficit
and reducing the upward pressure on the interest rate. Direct application of (16',18)
allows us also to infer that limited access to international credit raises the
devaluation needed to prevent dead-weight losses in the labor                     market.

     We can assess now the optimal devaluation, which Is                   derived by minimizIng (23').

Notice that each of        the three rates defined in          (30) corresponds to a devaluation that
wIll nullify the        corresponding welfare triangle in (23'). In general,                the optimal
devaluation rate is a weighted average of the three rates defined in (30), where the
weights      are determined by the relative importance of each                  sub-market. For example,
if the dominant loss comes from the labor market, than the devaluation rate will
approach     the rate   that preserves stable real wages. etc.

   We close this section bj considering an example that Illustrates the consequences

of restricted access to international credit. The details of this comparison are

summarized In Figure Seven, which Is drawn for the case of no devaluatlon. Solid

lines in Figure Seven correspond to the percentage change Induced by the drop In

exteranl income (Z) with credit rationing, whereas broken lines correspond to the

percentage change with perfect access to international credit. The drop in external

Income necessitates a raise In the production of traded goods and a corresponding

decline in the     production of non-traded goods, which is accomplished with a                 real

depreciation.    Credit rationing has the consequence of magnifying the needed
depreciation of the real exchange rate adjustment (q). These changes also imply that
credit rationing induces greater change in             the   composition of output, and consequently
a greater welfare loss due to reallocation costs.1' The last entry In Figure Seven
reports   the nominal depreciation needed to stabilize                  employment. Credit rationing
also has the consequence of raising the magnitude of the devaluation needed to clear
the labor market, and consequently the potential cost of nominal wage contracts.

     6. CONCLUDING REMARKS

     This   paper has demonstrated that time-dependent reallocation costs may play an

 important role In explaining the welfare costs of credit rationing in the presence of

 adverse    real shocks. While there ls no wag to escape the need for structural
 adjustment to real shocks, the desired speed of adjustment is determined by the
 nature of the reallocation costs. Whenever the reallocation costs are
                                                                               negatively
 related to the planning time that has been available before the movements of factors,

 there is an important role for credit assistance in   reducing the resources lost In   the

 reallocation process. In   the absence of credit assistance we will observe much

 larger changes In relative prices and a greater drop In welfare due to a greater

reallocation of resources in the short-run, when such an adjustment is more costly. It

 Is noteworthy that this effect occurs in addition to the more standard losses induced

by restricted access to international credit. Unlike typical deadweight tosses that

frequently are of a second order of magnitude, the loss due to time-dependent

reallocation costs can be of a first-order magnitude. This will be the case, for

example, if the reallocation costs are proportional to the size of the reallocation. In

such a case the reallocation costs are of a first order magnitude. and          they are

significant even for small deviations from the initial equilibrium.

    The   present paper has used the simplest framework for the derivation of the
various results. This was obtained by simplifying several assumptions that can be
relaxed without affecting the logic of the analysis. We considered a Ricardian

economy, modified by the presence of short-run reallocation costs. Thus, we did not

allow for productive capital or for the role of   Investment. Allowance for investment
will further increase the measure of the welfare loss       induced by   credit rationing
(formally it will increase the size of A1 in equation 23). without affecttn9 the key

results, As Appendix B demonstrates, our analysis can be extended for a general n
periods horizon, generating gradual adjustment and a meaningful distinction between
the short, intermediate, and long runs.
   White our model did not consider uncertainty explicitly, it can be extended to a
                                 - 27-

stochastic     framework. Such an extension may imply that the presence of
time-dependent reallocation costs will increase the welfare costs of volatile
relative prices and real interest rates. This may have important policy implication:
if   developed countries differ from developing countries in having lower adjustment

costs,   then there are benefits in   reallocating risk from developing to developed

countries    that are independent of the attitude towards risk in the various countries.
Another    implication may be related to the desirability of stable real Interest rates.

In our framework the resources spent on reallocation costs are determined (among

other    factors) by the volatility of real income. A scheme that would stabilize the
real interest rate applicable to the existing indebtedness of developing countries
would tend to reduce the magnitude of resources lost due to reallocation costs by

reducing the volatility of real income. A superior scheme might optimally tie the

interest rate on past indebtedness to       the terms of trade, further reducing the
volatility of   real income.

     Another relevant observation is that there are economic     and political limits to
the capacity and willingness to follow policies of swift adjustment. Frequently, one
is   left with the notion that there is a trade—off between the planned speed of

adjustment and the probability of accomplishing it. Consequently. credit assistance

during the adjustment can have the beneficial effect of rising the probability of

successful accomplishment1 2

                       APPENDIX A: THE LOSS FUNCTION

      The purpose of this Appendix is to review the derivation of the loss function that

underlies our discussion. We do it            by considering an economy where the policy maker
 intends to service the debt fully. This allows us to treat the welfare loss due to

limited capital mobility as equivalent to the loss due to a rise in the real interest

rate facing the country. We account for the presence of a nominal contract by

allowing a wedge between the supply price of labor (i.e.                  w5 as measured along the

supply of labor) and the demand price of labor, which is the observable wage w. In

deriving the loss function we make use of techniques applied previously in Svensson

and Razin (1983), Aizenman and Frenkel                    (1985) and Edwards and von Wijnbergen
(1986).

where m and v are periodic subutilities, and we assume m to be linear homogeneous

functions, Following the steps described in Svensson and Razin (1983, pp 104-185)

we define a periodic price index Pt which measures the minimum cost of attaining


one unit utility mt at period t,           and using these price indexes we derive a modified

expenditure function I          ( P1,   DP2, L1, L2, u ).
                                                              This function measures the minimum

money income needed to attain utility level u if               the     supply of labor in period t IS Lt,


the cost of living' in period t IS P and                  the nominal discount factor is D. As an

expenditure         function Ehas several useful characteristics: it is homogeneous of degree

one in (        ,
                    DP2). and it satisfies the following conditions (where E1 is the partial

derivative of Ewith respect to argument i)

where               Is the supply price of labor in period t.

        It Is useful     to conduct our analysis in real terms. This is                   done by deflating   all

nominal       quantities by P1. noting that the homogeneity of the expenditure function

implies that I ( P1.         DP2, L1, L2, u )
                                                   =   I ( 1. p' , L1, L2, u ) where p' is the real
discount      factor, p'      D   2,           In terms   of our   discussion        in the paper, p' equals

l/(1   + p). The Intertemporal real budget constraint is given by


   (A5) 1= m1 + p m2 Q


where Q is real wealth (in terms of the first—period CPI index), given by

 where    ut
                   is the real income In period t, obtained by deflating nominal Income at

time t                  The terms mt      t in equations (A5-6) are real consumption and real

 income in period t. Applying equations (A4-8) we obtain that the welfare change

 induced by shocks is given by

Equation       (A7) decomposes the welfare change into three effects. The first is the
income effect of the change in real wealth at the given discount factor (as reported
in the first two terms). The second is the income effect resulting from the higher
discount rate,          being   equal to the current account times the     change in the discount

factor (as reported in the third term). The third is the change in welfare due to

changes in leisure (the last two terms).            in terms of the framework applied in the
paper we obtain that around the initial equilibrium

effect of the drop in permanent income due to Z < 0, and the change induced by the

marginal    product of labor). Note that around the initial equilibrium we get that

The third, fourth, and fifth terms measure the change In welfare due to chan9es in
employment. The third term measures the distortive effects of nominal contracts,
given by the distortion wedge between the market real wage and the supply price of
labor, times the change in       employment.   The last two terms measure the changes in
profits resulting from costly reallocation of labor.
   We start by considering the case of a flexible labor market. We obtain an
approximation for the welfare loss around the flexible equilibrium by integrating the

last expression in (AT) along a path changing p from p0 to its new level, changing

employment from _1L1 to L1 and recalling that in the absence of nominal contracts

the third term in (A7') is zero. In applying this procedure we assume the absence of
cross effects, yielding that

 Applying to (A12) the information regarding 1N and Ii yields the loss function in the


text (23). In the presence of nominal contracts we should add to the integration the

The last term in (AIz) measures the loss in the labor market resulting from the

clearing real wage (zero) and the actual real wage (-             p).   The complete derivation of
this term can be found in Aizenman and Frenkel (1985). Equation (A12') is the loss

                      APPENDIX B: A THREE PERIODS ANALYSIS


    The purpose of this Appendix is to describe the operation of our analysis In a

 three—periods case. This is done in order to demonstrate that the framework evaluated

 in the paper is not restricted to two periods analysis. In fact, one             can extend It to a

general n-periods model following a process similar to the one applied in this

Appendix.

    Consider a three periods world, where we start with an initial                            long-run

equilibrium, denoted by zero. An unanticipated shock occurs at period one. We

 identify period one with the short—run, period two with the intermediate—run, and

period three with the new long-run equilibrium. A production process that fits such

an economy is given by:


    (Bi)           C + Lt —    (Lt
                                     —

               -
                   (Lt - Et_2UtJ)2 112 / (2 Et.2[LtJ) ;                   where 0 <     112
                                                                                              <



    The economics of the production function are the same as described in the text

for (ib), where the reallocation costs are higher the shorter the planning horizon. In

the long run these costs are zero, where in terms of equation (BI) the long run is

reached after two periods. These costs are higher in the short—run than in the

intermediate—run, as is reflected in the assumption that 0 <
                                                                        112
                                                                              <     A   competitive

equilibrium   Implies   that starting from a long—run equilibrium in period zero the

changes in employment in periods one and two can be approximated by:

where the lowercase letters denote (as in the paper) the percentage change in a

variable relative to Its pre-shock, initial value. Note that a given change In the real

wage will result in a smaller labor reallocation in the short—run than in the
                                            - 34-

intermediate—run.

   The first—period wealth of consumers in terms of the CPI price index (denoted by
Q) is   given by:




   (B3)       Q {x + 1,N X1T                  +     + Si 1X2,T + 2,N 2,T + Z2]

   where St         1/(1 + rt).


   We preserve the logic of our previous discussion regarding the formulation of the

demand for goods, modifying the demand equations to a three—periods analysis. The

modified demands for goods are now given by:

   Following   the steps described in the text we can solve now for the adjustment

following an unanticipated, permanent drop in transfers in period one. The qualitative

nature of the solution is similar to the one reported in the paper. The key difference

is that adjustment now is more gradual,                      and adjustment in the        intermediate-run

exceeds the short—run adjustment. For example, the change in output in a flexible

wage economy can be shown to be given by:




           X1N       1q1/(1+            112)
                                                         X1,T -          (11i      112

   The change in the real exchange rate can be shown to be given by

 betters anticipated (i.e., that    >      we can show that:

     Consequently, there Is an intertemporal trade—off between price and quantities
adjustment. The shorter the run, the greater the change In relative prices and the
smaller the adjustment of quantities. Applying a similar procedure to the analysis in
the paper, one can complete the description of the adjustment In this more general
case. The main results reported in the text are applicable for the general case, where

the speed of adjustment over time is now determined by the time profile of
(I   1, 2,..).

points B and C Is 1/ (_iLt Ti). Consequently. points A and C converge towards point B

presence of investment will be reflected in an extra term in the welfare loss of
limited access to international credit.
   3. Note that 1/Ti is a useful measure of the convexity of the production frontier,
being equal to the short—run elasticity of substitution along the production frontier

(i.e. d log N' XT)/ d log N'              1/11, where XN XT and N' T are the output
and the price of non-traded and the traded goods).

   4. The income of the consumer is given by Z +          + WtLt where     corresponds

to net profits ( fl PtNXtN +               - WtLt). Thus, net income equals the value of

international transfers plus the the domestic output (i.e. Z + t,Nt,N + PtTXtT

where St is the spot exchange rate at time t (being also equal to the domestic price

of traded goods). Equation (4) is obtained by taking a logarithmic approximation of

maker intends to default on the external debt under certain conditions. A necessary
condition for such an extension Is a knowledge of the decision rule guiding the policy

z   —1.

    10. We are assuming the same values as in Figure Six ( see footnote 6).
    11. It can be shown that (assuming the values specified In footnote 6) with credit
rationing we need an appreciation of 200% to stabilize the real exchange rate, but
with perfect access to international credit an appreciation of 36%. A depreciation of
51% will stabilize the consumption real interest rate in the absence of access to
International credit, whereas an appreciation of 36% wIll accomplish it with perfect
access to International credit. A devaluation of 10.5% will stabilize emploijment in
the presence of credit rationing, whereas a devaluation of 5.8% will accomplish It
with perfect access to international credit.

   12. This issue can be addressed successfully in a framework that will analyze
explicitly the   role of political and country risk. Unconditional   credit   assistance may

also   have the adverse effect of postponing the needed adjustment, which may lead
economic agents to attempt to 'roll over' Indebtedness in an attempt to postpone
further adjustment. This observation suggests the need for various conditionality
clauses to enhance adjustment.
