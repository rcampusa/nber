This paper presents a theoretical study of the effects of globalization on risk sharing and welfare. We
model globalization as a gradual and exogenous increase in the fraction of goods that are tradable.
In the absence of frictions, globalization opens new goods markets and raises welfare. We assume,
however, that countries cannot commit to pay their debts. Unlike the previous literature, and
motivated by changes in the institutional setup of emerging-market borrowing, we also assume that
countries cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors when paying their debts.
Although globalization still opens new goods markets, we find that it can also open or close some
asset markets. The net effect on risk sharing and welfare of this process of creation and destruction
of markets might be either positive or negative depending on a variety of factors that the theory
highlights.

       This paper presents a theoretical study of the e¤ects of globalization on risk sharing and welfare.
We model globalization as a gradual and exogenous increase in the fraction of goods that are
tradable. In the absence of frictions, globalization opens new goods markets and raises welfare. We
assume, however, that countries cannot commit to pay their debts. Unlike the previous literature,
and motivated by changes in the institutional setup of emerging-market borrowing, we also assume
that countries cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors when paying their debts.
Although globalization still opens new goods markets, we …nd that it can also open or close some
asset markets. The net e¤ect on risk sharing and welfare of this process of creation and destruction
of markets might be either positive or negative depending on a variety of factors that the theory
highlights.1;2
       We study a world with two regions. The basic setup also has two periods, youth and old age,
although sometimes we re-interpret it as a many-period model with an overlapping-generations
structure. During youth, all individuals have identical preferences and own an ex-ante identical
project that delivers output during old age. The return to this project is random and leads to
ex-post di¤erences in production bundles during old age. This provides a role for markets to help
individuals pool or share production risks. Goods markets open during old age and allow individuals
to trade commodities or goods, while asset markets open during youth and allow individuals to trade
promises or assets. Naturally, asset markets can only open if governments enforce during old age
the trades agreed upon during youth. We assume that governments choose enforcement policy so
as to maximize the utility of the average or representative individual of their region. As usual, this
leads governments to prefer di¤erent enforcement policies over time. During youth, governments
would like to commit to enforce all payments during old age and allow domestic residents to reap
all the gains from trade. But during old age, governments prefer not to enforce payments to foreign
residents because they lower domestic consumption and welfare. This time-inconsistency problem
is also known as sovereign risk in international economics.
       There are two polar cases that deliver well-known results in this setup. The …rst one is the per-
fect commitment model. If governments can credibly commit during youth to enforce all payments
   1
     Whether globalization improves or worsens risk sharing is an old question in international economics. Newbery
and Stiglitz (1984) provided a famous example in which asset markets are missing and globalization can reduce risk
sharing and welfare. However, Dixit (1987, 1989a, and 1989b) showed that this cannot happen if the absence of asset
markets, instead of simply assumed, is endogenously derived by introducing private information. Here we endogenize
the absence of asset markets by introducing sovereign risk. We …nd that the result of Newbery and Stiglitz that
globalization can reduce risk sharing and welfare still holds. Moreover, our result is even stronger since we also
show that globalization can destroy asset markets. See also Levchenko (2005) and Rappoport (2005) for alternative
approaches to this question.
   2
     On the empirical side, there is substantial evidence that consumption volatility in emerging markets has increased
(relative to output volatility) during the last decades, and that much of this increase can be attributed to globalization.
(See Kose, Prasad, and Terrones (2003a and 2003b) and Prasad, Rogo¤, Wei, and Kose (2003)). There is no hard
evidence that we know of about consumption volatility at the individual level.

during old age, they will always choose to do so. In this case, asset markets are always open and
there is perfect domestic sharing of all goods and perfect international sharing of tradable goods.
Globalization is welfare-improving because it increases the fraction of goods that can be shared
internationally. The other polar case is the perfect discrimination model without commitment. If
governments choose during old age which payments to enforce, they will choose a discriminatory
policy that enforces payments between domestic residents but does not enforce payments from
domestic residents to foreign ones.3 In this case, asset markets are also open but geographically
segmented. As a result, there is perfect domestic sharing of all goods but only imperfect interna-
tional sharing of tradable goods. Globalization is welfare-improving again because it increases the
fraction of goods that are shared internationally, even if imperfectly.4
       We think that these polar cases leave behind the most interesting e¤ects of globalization, namely,
those on the workings of asset markets. To show this, we study here a third polar case in which
governments have neither commitment nor the ability to discriminate between domestic and for-
eign creditors when enforcing payments. In this situation, asset markets are never geographically
segmented if open, but some asset markets might be closed. This is the result of governments facing
a trade-o¤ when deciding whether to enforce payments that is absent in the other two polar cases.
On the one hand, enforcement increases payments from domestic to foreign residents that lower
domestic consumption and welfare. On the other hand, enforcement increases payments between
domestic residents that contribute to domestic sharing of goods and therefore raise welfare. This
trade-o¤ determines the states of nature in which governments choose to enforce payments during
old age and, therefore, the set of assets that can be traded during youth. In states of nature in
which asset markets are open, there is perfect domestic sharing of all goods and perfect interna-
tional sharing of tradable goods. In states of nature in which asset markets are closed, there is not
only imperfect international sharing of tradable goods but also imperfect domestic sharing of all
goods.
       This enforcement trade-o¤ provides a theory of asset market incompleteness based on sovereign
risk that we exploit to study the e¤ects of globalization. The most novel aspect of our analysis is
that we show how globalization a¤ects the degree of asset market incompleteness. In particular,
globalization can either lead to the opening or closure of asset markets depending on its e¤ect
on the relative importance of domestic and international payments. Naturally, the opening of
markets improves domestic sharing of all goods and international sharing of tradable goods, while
   3
     Why would governments want to enforce payments between domestic residents? In equilibrium, payments are
made by individuals that have a low marginal utility of consumption to individuals that have a high marginal utility
of consumption and therefore raise the average utility of the region.
   4
     International sharing of tradable goods is imperfect since it only takes place in goods markets. During old age,
regions sell those tradable goods that are relatively abundant in their bundle and buy those that are relatively scarce.


                                                           2
the closure of markets does the opposite. Our theory also incorporates other, more standard, e¤ects
of globalization on risk sharing that also take place in models where the degree of asset market
incompleteness is exogenous. In those states of nature in which asset markets are open, globalization
leads to perfect international sharing of newly traded goods without a¤ecting domestic sharing of
goods. In those states of nature in which asset markets are closed, globalization still improves
international sharing of tradable goods but, unlike in the other polar cases, globalization might
now also improve or worsen domestic sharing of goods.
    This paper is directly related to an extensive literature on sovereign risk that developed in re-
sponse to the debt crises of the early 1980’s in emerging markets. Without exception, this literature
adopted the polar case of perfect discrimination.5 This choice was justi…ed because this polar case
provides a reasonably realistic description of the institutional setup of emerging markets in the late
1970’s and 1980’s. This was a period in which governments borrowed almost exclusively from for-
eign banks using syndicated loans, while the private sector was largely shut out from international
…nancial markets. This institutional setup clearly facilitates ex-post discrimination, as governments
can choose not to pay foreign banks without interfering with domestic asset trade.
    But the institutional setup of emerging-market borrowing has changed dramatically in the
1990’s and 2000’s. Governments now borrow from abroad by selling bonds which are traded in
increasingly deep secondary markets, while capital account liberalization now permits the private
sector to access international …nancial markets directly or through an increasing variety of …nancial
intermediaries. These changes have made it much more di¢ cult for governments to discriminate
ex-post.6;7 As a result, while the existing literature on sovereign risk is more relevant to understand
   5
     See Eaton and Gersovitz (1981), Grossman and van Huyck (1988), Bulow and Rogo¤ (1989a and 1989b), Fer-
nández and Rosenthal (1990), Atkeson (1991), Cole, Dow and English (1995), Cole and Kehoe (1997), Kletzer and
Wright (2000), Kehoe and Perri (2002a), Wright (2002), and Amador (2003). See Eaton and Fernández (1995) for
an excellent survey. All these papers assume there is perfect domestic risk sharing (i.e. each region contains a rep-
resentative consumer) and ask when governments enforce international payments. Since the answer is ‘never’in the
two-period setup, these papers focus on reputational equilibria of the many-period version of the model.
   6
     In an environment characterized by opaque …nancial intermediaries and deep secondary markets, governments’
ability to discriminate between domestic and foreign holders of domestic debt is seriously limited. Governments
typically do not know the nationality of the clients of banks, mutual funds and other …nancial intermediaries that
hold domestic debt. And even if they knew, they might still not be able to control how these intermediaries distribute
the losses from not enforcing payments among its domestic and foreign clients. Moreover, even in those cases in which
asset trade is not intermediated, foreign creditors could still get repaid indirectly by selling their assets to domestic
residents in secondary markets.
   7
     In fact, governments might not even know how much domestic debt is held by each …nancial intermediary. For
the case of public debt, the most recent issue of the IMF’s Global Financial Stability Report (April 2006, pp. 95-
96) literally says: “It is di¢ cult to obtain complete data on the composition of investors in sovereign bonds. Unlike
bilateral, multilateral, or bank loans, neither issuers nor other data gatherers publish comprehensive decompositions of
commercial investors in emerging market sovereign debt. Some sovereigns have needed and compiled this information
sporadically, for example, in the context of voluntary debt swaps or distressed debt restructurings, but the full
composition of commercial investors in emerging markets debt is rarely known.” The report goes on explaining the
di¢ culties of obtaining this information and therefore justifying that “...only a handful of countries could provide
detailed information on investor composition.” Although the report focuses on public debt, it seems reasonable to
assume that governments have even less information on the …nancial intermediaries that hold private debt.

emerging-market borrowing during the 1970’s and 1980’s, we believe that the results presented in
this paper are more relevant to understand emerging-market borrowing in the 1990’s and 2000’s.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section one presents the basic setup. Section two
introduces sovereign risk. Section three studies the e¤ects of globalization. Section four examines
the role of externalities. Section …ve concludes. There are also three appendices that explain some
technical aspects of the solution method, and extend the theory to the case in which governments
can set borrowing limits and issue public debt.


1        A benchmark model of risk sharing

We consider a world in which all individuals are ex-ante identical since they all have the same
preferences over di¤erent goods and they all have access to an ex-ante identical project. The return
to this project is random and this generates ex-post di¤erences in the quantity and types of goods
produced by the di¤erent individuals. This creates a role for markets that can help individuals
pool or share risks. In this section, we examine a situation in which these markets work well.


1.1       Preferences and technology

The world economy contains two regions: Home and Foreign, indexed by j 2 fH; F g. Both regions
have identical population size, normalized to 1. Let I W be the set of inhabitants of this world,
indexed by i, and let I H and I F be the sets of Home and Foreign residents, respectively. Naturally,
I H [ I F = I W and I H \ I F = ?. Let j(i) denote the region where individual i resides. The world
and its inhabitants last two periods, which we refer to as youth and old age. There is no uncertainty
about youth, but there is uncertainty regarding old age. Let S be the set of all possible states of
nature during old age. This set includes all the relevant aspects of the world economy that are not
known during youth. We assume that, once realized, all individuals observe the state of nature.
We denote by        s   the probability at youth of state s 2 S occurring during old age.8
        There is a continuum of goods, indexed by z 2 [0; 1]. A fraction           of these goods can be
transported between regions at negligible cost. We refer to these goods as “tradable.” The rest of
the goods cannot be transported across regions and we refer to them as “nontradable.”The goods
are indexed so that tradable goods correspond to low indices, i.e. z 2 [0; ], and nontradable goods
correspond to high indices, i.e. z 2 ( ; 1]. When considering two alternative speci…cations, we shall
say that the world is more globalized the higher           is.
    8
    With some abuse of language, we shall refer to s as the probability of state s even though for continuous
state-spaces we are really referring to the probability density function.

   Utility is derived only from old age consumption, and individuals are expected-utility maxi-
mizers. Let cis (z) be the quantity of good z consumed by individual i in state s. The objective
function of individual i during old age is assumed to take the popular logarithmic form, i.e.

                                  Z   1
                          uis =           ln cis (z) dz for all s 2 S and i 2 I W ,                             (1)
                                  0

while his/her objective function during youth is given by

                                             Z
                                      Ui =             s   uis for all i 2 I W .                                (2)
                                                 s2S


A standard feature of dynamic decision problems is that the objective function of agents (individuals
or governments) varies over time, as the state of nature is revealed. This gives rise to a standard
time-inconsistency problem that plays a central role in this paper.
   During youth, individuals build a project located in their own region. Projects deliver a bundle
of goods during old age. We refer to this bundle as the production of the project of individual i or,
for short, as the production of individual i. Let yis (z) be the production of good z by individual
                                                Z
                                         j
i in state s. To simplify notation, let ys (z)         yis (z) for j 2 fH; F g be the regional average
                                                             i2I j
                                                                1
productions of good z in state s, while          ysW (z)             ysH (z) + ysF (z) be the corresponding world
                                                                2
average.
   There is full symmetry between and within regions. First, if there exists a state s with                 s   =
and given sets of productions in Home fyis ( )gi2I H = Y and in Foreign fyis ( )gi2I F = Y , then there
exists a corresponding state s0 with        s0   =     and sets of productions in Home fyis0 ( )gi2I H = Y and
in Foreign fyis0 ( )gi2I F = Y . Second, for every pair of individuals i and i0 residing in the same
region, if there exists a state s with       s   =     and given sets of productions in Home and Foreign in
which yis ( ) = y( ), then there also exists a corresponding state s0 with              s0   =   and the same sets
of productions in Home and Foreign in which yi0 s0 ( ) = y( ). These assumptions imply that ex-ante
productions are the same in both regions and for all individuals within a region. Of course, this
need not be the case ex-post and this is why there are gains from trade.
   In this world, markets allow individuals to transfer consumption across goods and across states
of nature. Some trades might involve the exchange of goods during old age, while some others
might involve the exchange of promises during youth to deliver goods during old age. We refer to
the former as “goods”trade and the latter as “asset”trade. We start by considering the benchmark
case of complete markets. As usual, by “complete” it is meant that the existing set of markets
allows all pairs of individuals to carry out all mutually desired trades. There are many possible



                                                            5
ways of organizing markets that ensure that all valuable trades are carried out. For convenience,
we consider a sequential formulation of markets: during youth there are asset (or forward) markets
where individuals can trade promises to deliver one unit of the numeraire good in state s in any
of the two regions; and during old age there are goods (or spot) markets where individuals can
exchange the di¤erent goods. Intuitively, asset markets are used to distribute income across states
of nature, while goods markets are used to distribute consumption across goods.9
       As usual, it is useful to construct the competitive equilibrium recursively, going backwards in
time. During old age, individuals take their income as given and choose how to distribute their
consumption across goods so as to maximize utility. During youth, individuals choose how to
distribute their income across states of nature so as to maximize their expected utility. We study
each of these choices in turn.


1.2      Goods markets

During old age, the state of nature is known and only goods markets are open. Let pjs (z) be the
price of one unit of good z in state s in region j. Let yis be the value of the production of individual
                       Z 1
                            j(i)
i in state s, i.e. yis     ps (z) yis (z) dz; and let xis be the value of the assets held by individual
                        0                      Z
i in state s. To simplify notation, let ysj         yis for j 2 fH; F g be the regional average values
                                                     i2I j
                                     1
of production in state s, while ysW       ysH + ysF is the corresponding world average. Also, let
      Z                              2
xjs        xis for j 2 fH; F g be the regional average values of assets in state s. We need not
          i2I j
de…ne the world average value of assets since assets are nothing but promises and the average value
of these promises must be zero. With this notation, we can write the budget constraint of old
individuals as follows:

                       Z    1
                                pj(i)
                                 s (z) cis (z) dz   yis + xis for all s 2 S and i 2 I W .                        (3)
                        0


The budget constraint states that the value of consumption cannot exceed income, which in turn
consists of the value of production plus the value of assets held.
   9
     This sequential formulation of markets is sometimes referred to as a Radner equilibrium. The classic Arrow-
Debreu equilibrium assumes instead that there is a set of forward markets during youth where individuals can trade
promises to deliver one unit of any good in state s in any of the two regions. The Arrow-Debreu equilibrium
minimizes the use of spot markets, while the sequential or Radner equilibrium minimizes the use of forward markets.
If all markets work well, both equilibria deliver the same allocations. This equivalence breaks down however once we
introduce sovereign risk in the next section. This type of risk negatively a¤ects the functioning of forward markets,
without a¤ecting the functioning of spot markets. This provides incentives to minimize the use of forward markets
and justi…es our choice of equilibrium.




                                                             6
      For goods markets to clear, we must impose these conditions:

                Z
            1
                         cis (z) = ysW (z) and pH        F
                                                s (z) = ps (z)               pW
                                                                              s (z) for all z 2 [0; ] and s 2 S,       (4)
            2    i2I W

                          Z
                                   cis (z) = ysj (z) for all z 2 ( ; 1], s 2 S, and j 2 fH; F g .                      (5)
                           i2I j

Equations (4) and (5) state that supplies of the di¤erent goods must equal their demands. For those
goods that are tradable, international arbitrage ensures that the prices of a given good delivered
at Home and Foreign are equalized. This international arbitrage does not operate for nontradable
goods.
      A competitive equilibrium during old age consists of a set of goods prices and quantities such
that individuals maximize their utility –Equation (1)–subject to their budget constraint –Equation
(3)–and goods markets clear –Equations (4) and (5). Note that the state variables of the old-age
problem are individual productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings fxis gi2I W .
    We show that the equilibrium exists and is unique by construction. It follows from individual

Equation (6) shows how Home and Foreign residents distribute their consumption across the dif-
ferent goods. In particular, individuals share goods in proportions that are directly related to their
incomes. For tradable goods, world production is shared according to world relative incomes. For
nontradable goods, regional production is shared according to regional relative incomes. We can
…nd individual incomes as a share of world income as follows:10

A region’s income increases with its relative production of tradables and with its assets.11
       Equations (6), (7) and (8) provide a full description of the consumption allocation as a function
of the state variables of this problem, i.e. individual productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings
fxis gi2I W . Individual productions are determined by nature, but asset holdings are determined by
trade during youth and we turn to this now.


1.3      Asset markets

During youth, only asset markets are open. Let qs be the price of an asset that promises to deliver
one unit of the numeraire in state s, and let xis be the number of such assets held by individual i.
Therefore, the budget sets of the young are characterized by:

                                         Z
                                                 qs xis    0 for all i 2 I W ,                                    (9)
                                          s2S


                                    xis          yis for all s 2 S and i 2 I W .                                 (10)

Equation (9) is the budget constraint and says that purchases of assets must be …nanced by corre-
sponding sales of other assets, while Equation (10) is a solvency constraint that says that individuals
can only issue promises that are backed by their own production. Naturally, during youth asset
markets must clear:
                                             Z
                                                     xis = 0 for all s 2 S.                                      (11)
                                             i2I W

Equation (11) states that there is a zero net supply of all assets or promises.
       A competitive equilibrium during youth consists of a set of asset prices and quantities such
that individuals maximize expected utility –Equation (2)– subject to their budget and solvency
constraints –Equations (9) and (10)– and asset markets clear –Equation (11). When maximizing
their utility, individuals take as given how their individual consumption during old age depends on
their individual asset holdings.
       We show again that this equilibrium exists and is unique by construction. Note that log prefer-
                                                                                                                 1 s
ences imply that a young individual i will choose asset holdings fxis gs2S such that yis +xis =              i
                                                                                                       qs
where      i   is the Lagrange multiplier associated with individual i’s budget constraint. Since all in-
  11
    Note that assets increase income more than one-to-one if < 1. The reason is that assets shift purchasing power
from foreign to domestic residents. This raises the demand for domestic nontradable goods relative to foreign ones.
And this increases the value of domestic production relative to foreign. This additional e¤ect of asset holdings on
incomes is known as the “transfer problem.”

dividuals are ex-ante identical (preferences and technology) and have access to the same set of
markets, they all have the same multiplier          for all i 2 I W . Integrating this expression over
                                                                 i

i 2 IW     and using the market clearing conditions in Equation (11) we …nd         1 = qs y W . As a
                                                                                             s
                                                                                                                      s
result, we have:
                                            xis = ysW     yis for all s 2 S and i 2 I W .                                    (12)

Equation (12) provides the equilibrium asset holdings, i.e. fxis gi2I W . During old age income is
always equally distributed within and between regions.
      We have now a full description of the complete-markets equilibrium. For a given set of individual
productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings fxis gi2I W , Equations (6), (7) and (8) describe the
consumption allocation that come out of goods markets during old age. For a given set of individual
productions fyis ( )gi2I W , Equation (12) describes the asset holdings that come out from asset
markets during youth. We describe the welfare properties of this equilibrium next.


1.4      Domestic and international risk sharing with complete markets

Markets allow individuals to share production risks both within and between regions. We can
provide a sharper description of how this happens by decomposing production, yis (z), as follows:

                                                 j(i)
                        yis (z) =     is (z)     s (z)   ysW (z) for all z 2 [0; 1] , s 2 S, and i 2 I W ,                   (13)

                                                          j(i)
                            yis (z)        ys (z)
                                               j(i)
where      is (z)j(i)
                                      and      s (z)
                                             W (z)
                                                    for z 2 [0; 1], s 2 S, and i 2 I W are the individual
                ys (z)                     y s
and regional components of production respectively. By construction, these components have a
                     Z
                                           1     H (z) + F (z) = 1 for all z 2 [0; 1] and s 2 S. We will
constant mean, i.e.         is (z) = 1 and       s         s
                      i2I j                2
                                                        j(i)
refer to a (mean-preserving) spread in is (z) and s (z) as an increase in individual and regional
risk for good z respectively.
      With these de…nitions at hand, we can use Equations (6) and (12) to …nd equilibrium consump-
tion allocations:
                                  8
                                  < y W (z)        if z 2 [0; ]
                                     s
                        cis (z) =                                                      for all s 2 S, and i 2 I W ,          (14)
                                  :   j(i)   W
                                      s (z) ys (z) if z 2( ; 1]


and plugging these consumption allocations in Equation (2), we obtain ‘ex-ante’utility:12

                    Z   1     Z                                  Z   1       Z
           U=                         s   ln ysW (z)     dz +                      s   ln   j(i)
                                                                                            s (z)     dz for any i 2 I W .   (15)
                    0          s2S                                           s2S
 12
      All individuals enjoy the same ex-ante utility because of our symmetry assumptions.


                                                                         9
Equations (14) and (15) provide a full description of consumption and welfare. There is perfect
domestic sharing of all goods, but only perfect international sharing of tradable ones. Naturally,
this is because it is not technologically possible to share nontradable goods across regions. Markets
work well, but they cannot overcome technological constraints. In fact, it is straightforward to
show that the complete-markets consumption allocations are ‘ex-ante’Pareto e¢ cient and strictly
Pareto dominate all other symmetric consumption allocations.13
       Not surprisingly, welfare increases with world production of all goods ysW (z). Moreover, Jensen’s
inequality shows that a mean-preserving spread in world production lowers welfare. Higher volatility
in world production cannot be diversi…ed away and must lead one-to-one to higher volatility in
individual consumption. Since individuals are risk averse, they su¤er from this.
       A feature of the complete-markets equilibrium is that welfare is not a¤ected by an increase in
individual risk.14 Since there is perfect domestic sharing of all goods, the ‘ex-post’ distribution
of production among individuals of the same region has no e¤ects on individual consumption or
welfare.
       Welfare is not a¤ected by an increase in regional risk on tradable goods either, but welfare is
a¤ected by an increase in regional risk on nontradable goods.15 Since there is perfect international
sharing of tradable goods, the ‘ex-post’distribution of tradable production between regions has no
e¤ects on consumption or welfare. Since transport costs preclude international sharing of nontrad-
able goods, higher volatility of the regional component of their production must lead one-to-one to
higher volatility in the consumption of these goods and this lowers ex-ante utility.
       This discussion provides a short but comprehensive description of the complete-markets equi-
librium. Goods and asset markets combine to allow individuals to share production risks. Given
technological constraints to trade, this is an ideal world. But this is too rosy a picture of asset
markets. There is a fundamental di¤erence in the nature of goods and asset markets that the
complete-markets model ignores. In goods markets individuals trade commodities for commodi-
ties, while in asset markets individuals trade promises for promises. Unlike commodities, promises
are only valuable if individuals can commit to ful…ll them later. We have assumed this implicitly
in the previous analysis. In the next section we relax this assumption.
  13
      Since we shall focus exclusively on symmetric consumption allocations throughout the paper, we refer to those in
Equations (14) as “the”Pareto e¢ cient consumption allocations, even though we recognize that there exist asymmetric
allocations that are also Pareto e¢ cient.
   14
      To see this, simply note that the individual component of production is absent in Equations (14) and (15).
   15
      To see the former, simply note that the regional component of tradable production is absent in Equations (14) and
(15). To see the latter, use Jensen’s inequality to show that a mean-preserving spread in the nontradable component
of regional production lowers ex-ante utility.




                                                          10
2         Sovereign risk

The feasibility of the complete-markets consumption allocation rests on society’s ability to solve a
standard time-inconsistency problem. Even though individuals would like to commit ex-ante to pay
their debts, ex-post they have incentives not to do so and enjoy a higher level of consumption. Either
old individuals are not maximizing their utility or their true utility cannot be fully represented by
Equation (1). The standard way to think about the complete-markets model is as describing a world
in which there is also a government that imposes an unbearable utility cost to those individuals
that fail to pay their debts. In this situation, Equation (1) can be understood as representing utility
only conditional on paying debts. The (very low) level of utility that results from not paying debts
can be disregarded since it is never chosen in equilibrium.
         Although recognizing the role that governments play in sustaining asset markets is a small step
towards greater realism, it begs the question of why governments would always want to enforce
payments. To the extent that governments care more about domestic residents than about foreign
ones, they are subject to the same type of time-inconsistency problem that individuals are. Even
though governments would like to commit ex-ante to enforce payments by domestic residents, ex-
post they may have incentives to deviate to allow domestic residents to enjoy a higher level of
consumption. This time-inconsistency problem of governments is usually referred to as sovereign
risk, and the goal of this section is to analyze how it a¤ects risk sharing and welfare.


2.1        The model with sovereign risk

We consider again the world economy described in section 1.1, but now we explicitly model gov-
ernments and their role as enforcers of private contracts. There are two governments, a Home
government which can enforce payments by residents of Home, and a Foreign government which
can enforce payments by residents of Foreign. Ex-post, an individual only pays if his/her gov-
ernment forces him/her to pay. Governments only care about the utility of the residents of their
                                                                                           Z
region. In particular, they maximize the average utility of domestic residents, i.e. vsj =        uis for
                                   Z                                                        i2I j

all s 2 S during old age and V j =       s Ui during youth for j 2 fH; F g.
                                         i2I j
         If governments could credibly commit to enforce all payments before the state of nature is
revealed, they would always choose to do so and all asset markets would be open. This is the
extreme or polar case of perfect commitment.16 If governments have some choice over enforcement
after the state of nature is revealed, they are tempted not to enforce payments to foreigners when
    16
    With perfect commitment, the equilibrium would be identical to the complete-markets model and would therefore
be fully described by Equations (6), (7), (8) and (12).



                                                       11
these are high enough. We ensure this temptation is always present by moving to the other extreme
and assuming governments cannot commit to enforce at all:

Assumption 1. LACK OF COMMITMENT: Governments simultaneously choose enforcement
during old age after the state of nature has been revealed and before markets open.

       The e¤ects of this lack of commitment depend crucially on the degree to which governments
can discriminate among debtors when enforcing payments. Assume, for instance, that governments
choose ex-post which particular payments to enforce so that they can fully discriminate between
debtors when enforcing payments. This is the polar case of perfect discrimination without com-
mitment. In the context of our model, this would imply that governments would never enforce
any payment from a domestic resident to a foreign one. Asset markets would be geographically
segmented and there would be no trade in assets between residents of di¤erent regions.17
       If discrimination is less than perfect, lack of enforcement a¤ects both domestic and international
transactions and this creates new and interesting interactions between domestic and international
risk sharing. We take a …rst step towards analyzing these interactions by going to the other polar
case and assume that governments cannot discriminate among debtors. In particular, we assume:

Assumption 2. NON-DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT: Governments choose whether to
enforce all payments or none.

       This assumption is crucial for the results of this paper. Once again, we construct next the
competitive equilibrium recursively going backwards in time.


2.2      Goods markets and enforcement

During old age, the state of nature is revealed, then governments enforce payments, and then goods
markets open. De…ne xj;is as the assets held by individual i that pay in state s issued by residents
of region j. Since governments now decide whether to enforce payments by their own residents
independently, it is not su¢ cient to know the overall asset holdings of an individual, but also the
residence of the issuer.
       Unlike section 1.2, the budget constraints of old individuals must now re‡ect the fact that assets
are worthless if there is no enforcement. That is, we must replace Equation (3) by the following
  17
    With perfect discrimination without commitment, there would still be international trade in goods since such
trade is arms’ length and, thus, not a¤ected by sovereign risk. In addition, domestic asset trade would still take
place since, in equilibrium, this trade would result in payments from residents with low marginal utility to residents
with high marginal utility. Enforcing these payments would raise the average utility of the region. Therefore, the

   Governments simultaneously choose whether to enforce payments or not so as to maximize
the average utility of domestic residents. When considering their enforcement choice, governments
take the actions of the other government as given. That is, enforcement decisions are the Nash
equilibrium of a game between governments. Their best responses therefore satisfy:
                    8
                    < 1 if vsj (enforce) > vsj (not enforce)

                            s               s



Note that when vsj (enforce) = vsj (not enforce), the government is indi¤erent between enforcing or
not and both ejs = 1 and ejs = 0 are best responses. We de…ne E j         S as the set of states in which
government j decides to enforce payments for j 2 fH; F g.
   A competitive equilibrium during old age consists of a set of goods prices and quantities such
that individuals maximize their utility –Equation (1)–subject to their budget constraint –Equation
(16)–, governments enforce so as to maximize average utility of their region –Equation (17)– and
goods markets clear –Equations (4) and (5). Once again, the state variables of this problem are
individual productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings fxj;is gj2fH;F g;i2I W .
   To compute this equilibrium, replace


                            xis = eH
                                   s xH;is + eFs xF;is for all s 2 S and i 2 I W                    (18)


in Equations (6), (7) and (8) to …nd the equilibrium consumption allocations as functions of en-
forcement decisions. Then, substitute these consumption allocations into the best responses of
governments to …nd the equilibrium enforcement decisions as a function of the state variables of
this problem, i.e. individual productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings fxj;is gj2fH;F g;i2I W . Once
again, asset holdings are determined during youth as we show next.


2.3    Asset markets

During youth, individuals trade in asset markets. The individual maximization problems are as
in section 1.3, except that now agents can only sell securities which pay in states in which their




                                                     13
government enforces payments. Then, the budget sets in Equations (9) and (10) are replaced by

                              Z
                                         qsH xH;is + qsF xF;is                 0 for all i 2 I W ,                 (19)

where y^is is now pledgeable income, de…ned as

                                      y^is =                                  for all i 2 I W .                    (21)
                                             : 0 if s 2 = E j(i)

Equation (19) is the budget constraint. Equations (20) and (21) de…ne the solvency constraint.
They say that individuals cannot pledge income in states in which their government does not enforce
payments.18 They also say that individuals cannot issue assets that are enforced by the government
of the other region. The market clearing conditions for asset markets are now given by

                                  Z
                                            xj;is = 0 for all s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g                                (22)
                                    i2I W


Equation (22) simply states that there is a zero net supply of each country’s assets.
       A competitive equilibrium during youth consists of a set of asset prices and quantities such
that individuals maximize expected utility –Equation (2)– subject to their budget and solvency
constraints –Equations (19), (20) and (21)– and asset markets clear –Equation (22). Naturally,
when maximizing their utility, individuals take as given how their individual consumption during
old age depends on their individual asset holdings.
       We restrict the analysis to symmetric equilibria.19 De…ne a coarse partition of states of nature
based on sets of productions in Home and Foreign as opposed to individual productions. Abusing
notation, we refer to the set of states fs 2 S : fyis ( )gi2I H = Y and fyis ( )gi2I F = Y g as a single
“state” characterized by regional sets of productions Y ; Y . Given our assumption of symmetry
within regions, each such “state” is composed of a large number of equiprobable states, one for
each way in which these regional sets of productions can be distributed among residents within
  18
     For example, a Home resident might want to sell assets that pay in a state, say s, in which his/her production is
high in order to purchase assets that pay in states in which his/her production is low. However, if state s the Home
government does not enforce payments, s 2   = E H , this resident will not pay his/her debts when state s materializes.
Knowing this ex-ante, other agents would not be willing to purchase any assets that pay in state s from this Home
resident. Therefore, Home production in state s is not pledgeable. Similarly, no agent would be willing to purchase
assets from Foreign residents that pay in states in which the Foreign government does not enforce payments.
  19
     Without loss of generality (see Appendix
                                         Z    A), we alsoZ impose the restriction that there be no two-way international
trade in the same asset. That is, either             xF;is or           xH;is is zero for all s 2 S.
                                             i2I H              i2I F




                                                                   14
each region. Given our assumption of symmetry between regions, each state s characterized by
sets of productions Y ; Y    has a corresponding symmetric state s0 with the same probability and
characterized by sets of productions Y ; Y . We say that an equilibrium is symmetric if enforcement
sets can be de…ned over this coarser partition of states and Y ; Y       E H if and only if Y ; Y     EF .
Throughout we focus on symmetric equilibria. This restriction is not without loss of generality,
since the model also has asymmetric equilibria. But it delivers a high payo¤ in terms of tractability
since it implies that residents in both regions have the same budget constraint multipliers         during
youth and we can therefore analyze pairs of symmetric states independently.
   Typically, there are many symmetric equilibria. To see this, consider a pair of symmetric states.
If individuals expect enforcement in both regions, it is possible (but not necessary) that asset trade
be such that both regions enforce and validate individuals’ expectations. If individuals expect
non-enforcement in both regions, then there is no asset trade and the individuals’expectations are
always a consistent belief even if it cannot be veri…ed in equilibrium. Obviously, expectations play
an important role in this world. But we do not emphasize this feature in what follows. Instead,
we focus exclusively on the best symmetric equilibrium and we refer to it as “the” sovereign risk
equilibrium. This equilibrium arises when individuals have the most optimistic expectations about
enforcement and the maximum number of asset markets are open.
   Appendix A provides a detailed description of how we construct this equilibrium. Basically, we
do this by checking, for each pair of states, if there exists an equilibrium in which both governments
enforce payments. If it exists, we choose it. Otherwise, we check whether there is an equilibrium
in which at least one region enforces. If it exists, we choose it. Otherwise, we conclude that there
is no enforcement. We …nd that the equilibrium constructed in this way sometimes contains states
in which there is enforcement in one region but not in the other and, as a result, E H 6= E F . To
streamline the exposition, in the main text we focus only on the case in which, in all states, there
is enforcement either in both regions or in neither and E H = E F           E. This case generates the
following simple and intuitive closed-form solutions for equilibrium asset holdings:
                                   8
                                   < yW      yis if s 2 E
                                      s
                             xis =                            for all i 2 I W                         (23)
                                   : 0            if s 2
                                                       =E

That is, income is equally divided among all individuals in those states in which asset markets are
open. Naturally, there is no asset trade in those states in which asset markets are closed.
   We have now a complete description of the sovereign risk equilibrium. For a given set of
individual productions fyis ( )gi2I W and asset holdings fxj;is gj2fH;F g;i2I W , Equations (6), (7), (8),

(17), and (18) describe the consumption allocation that come out of goods markets during old
age and Equation (17) determines the enforcement set. For a given set of individual productions
fyis ( )gi2I W , Equation (23) describes the asset holdings that come out from asset markets during
youth. We describe the welfare properties of this equilibrium next.


2.4     Domestic and international risk sharing with sovereign risk

Sovereign risk destroys some asset markets, and this reduces domestic and international risk sharing.
The equilibrium consumption allocations are now given by:

Finally, it follows from Equation (17) that the enforcement set is given by:

                                                                                 i2I R




                                                                                       16
where R is the rich region in the corresponding state.
         Equations (24), (25), (27) and (28) provide a full description of consumption and welfare. Now
there is imperfect domestic sharing of all goods and imperfect international sharing of tradable
goods. This is because individuals are forced to choose consumption baskets worth no more than
their production bundle in those states in which the corresponding asset market is closed. The
sovereign-risk consumption allocations are therefore ‘ex-ante’ Pareto ine¢ cient. This is shown in
Equation (27) which di¤ers from (15) by the third and fourth integrals. Jensen’s inequality shows
that these two integrals are negative. The third integral re‡ects the welfare loss from not being
able to perfectly share tradable goods between regions, while the fourth integral re‡ects the welfare
loss from not being able to perfectly share all goods within regions.
         The complete-markets equilibrium can now be re-interpreted as the special case of the sovereign-
risk equilibrium in which the enforcement set contains all states of nature, i.e. E = S, and markets
are complete. In general, however, the enforcement set is smaller than the set of all states, i.e.
E         S, and markets are incomplete. The number of asset markets that are closed and therefore
the ine¢ ciency created by sovereign risk depends on individual and regional income risk. A mean
preserving spread in        is   in the rich region increases the loss in average utility that results from a
breakdown in domestic payments, increasing government incentives to enforce and therefore the
                                                                     j
size of the enforcement set. A mean preserving spread in             s   raises the gains in average utility that
result from not paying debts to foreigners, reducing incentives to enforce and therefore the size of
the enforcement set.20
         The sovereign-risk equilibrium shares some features with the complete-markets equilibrium.
For instance, in both equilibria welfare increases with world production of any good but decreases
with a mean-preserving spread in world production of any good. Also, in both equilibria welfare
decreases with an increase in regional risk on nontradable goods. Moreover, the intuitions behind
these results are exactly the same in both equilibria since neither world production nor the regional
component of the production of nontradables a¤ect the size of the enforcement set.
         But the sovereign risk equilibrium di¤ers from the complete-markets equilibrium in that welfare
depends on both individual risk and regional risk on tradable goods. This dependence can be quite
complex but can always be analyzed as the sum of two di¤erent e¤ects. For a given enforcement set,
higher volatility in individual and regional tradable production cannot be diversi…ed away in those
states in which asset markets are closed and must lead one-to-one to higher volatility in individual
    20
    One must be careful when studying the e¤ects of individual and regional risk for a given good. It is possible
that a mean-preserving spread in is (z) bene…ts disproportionally poor individuals and reduces the enforcement set.
Similarly, it is also possible that a mean-preserving spread in js (z) bene…ts disproportionally the poor region and
increases the enforcement set.



                                                        17
consumption in those states. This …rst e¤ect of increases in individual and regional risk always
lowers welfare. But higher volatility in individual and tradable production also a¤ect the size of
the enforcement set. An increase in individual risk tends to increase the enforcement set and this
increases welfare. Therefore, the …rst and second e¤ects tend to work against each other in the
case of individual risk. An increase in regional risk for tradables tends to reduce the enforcement
set and this lowers welfare. Therefore, the …rst and second e¤ects tend to reinforce each other in
the case of regional risk on tradable goods.
    The sovereign-risk equilibrium provides a rich description of international trade in assets. Lack
of commitment or trust destroys asset markets and constitutes an impediment to trade. Individuals
cannot sell enough assets to …nance the purchase of other assets that would protect them from
the risks they face. Therefore, this is less than an ideal world given technological constraints to
trade. Sovereign risk generates interesting interactions between domestic and international risk
sharing. The more domestic risk sharing is needed, the more asset markets are open and the more
international risk sharing is possible. After all, it is the fear to destroy domestic risk sharing that
induces governments to enforce international payments and thus sustain asset markets. Similarly,
the more international risk sharing is needed, the more asset markets are closed and the less
domestic risk sharing is possible. After all, it is the temptation to default on foreigners that induces
governments not to enforce payments and thus destroy asset markets. We use these interactions
next to provide a novel account of the e¤ects of globalization.


3     The e¤ects of globalization

Since globalization is a dynamic process, we now re-interpret the model as describing the life of
a typical generation in a world with overlapping generations. The world has many generations,
t = 0; 1; :::; T (   +1). Generation t members are born at time t, with a project that pays at
t + 1. They maximize expected utility from consumption at t + 1. At time t they trade in assets
to diversify their production risk. Generation t members cannot trade assets with members of
di¤erent generations: at time t + 1, they are old and the best they can do is to consume all of their
income; at time t, the only other living generation is generation t     1, but since this generation is
old they are not willing to trade assets either. As a result, individuals diversify their production
risk as much as they can by trading assets with other members of the same generation. The process
of globalization consists of an increase over time of . In particular, we assume      0   = 0,   t+1   t,




                                                  18
and lim      t   = 1.21
       t!T
       We measure the gains from globalization in terms of consumption. More formally, de…ne G( )
U( )       U (0). A generation born in autarky would be indi¤erent between experiencing growth in
world production (of all goods in all states) by a factor exp fG( )g and experiencing an increase in
the fraction of traded goods from 0 to . It follows from Equation (27) that:

                 Z         Z                         Z         Z                  !          Z
                                                                         j(i)
                                        j(i)                             s (z)
G( ) =                 s       ln       s (z)   dz         s        ln     j(i)
                                                                                      dz +             s   ln       is   for any i 2 I W .
                 s2E       0                         s2E
                                                      =        0           s                  s2E
                                                                                               =
                                                                                                                                     (29)
Equation (29), together with Equation (28), provides a full description of the gains from globaliza-
tion. In autarky, sovereign risk is not a problem and all asset markets are open. There is perfect
domestic sharing of all goods, but technological constraints to trade prevent international sharing.
As a result i’s consumption of good z ‡uctuates across states following regional production. Glob-
alization removes technological constraints to trade but also creates sovereign risk that leads to the
closing of asset markets. In those states in which asset markets are open, i.e. s 2 E, globalization
allows perfect international sharing of tradable goods without a¤ecting domestic sharing. This gain
is captured by the …rst term in Equation (29). In those states in which asset markets are closed,
i.e. s 2
       = E, globalization allows imperfect international sharing of tradable goods, but it reduces
domestic sharing of all goods. The second and third terms in Equation (29) capture this gain and
loss from globalization. In this section, we study how all of these forces combine to determine the
dynamic e¤ects of globalization on risk sharing and welfare.22


3.1      Globalization without terms-of-trade e¤ects

Globalization cannot a¤ect individual or regional production bundles since we have assumed that
fyis ( )gi2I W is taken as exogenous to the analysis. Therefore, the relative values of individual and
                              yis     ysj
regional production, i.e. j(i) and W , can only be a¤ected by globalization through changes in
                             ys       ys
  21
     We focus on equilibria of this many-period model in which the present actions of governments and/or individuals
are independent of their past actions. In this case, the consumption and welfare of each generation is identical to
that of the two-period model of section 2, and is fully described by Equations (24), (25), (27) and (28). It is well
known that the many-period model might also have additional equilibria in which governments and/or individuals
condition their current actions to their past actions.
  22
     With perfect commitment, all asset markets would be open and all the gains  Z    fromZglobalization would come
                                                                                                                     j(i)

                                                                                             s2S           0
             W
any i 2 I . With perfect discrimination without commitment, asset markets would be geographically segmented
and the gains from globalization would
                                  !    come from being able to imperfectly share a larger fraction of goods, i.e.
         Z       Z         j(i)
                           s (z)
G( ) =         s     ln      j(i)
                                    dz 0 for any i 2 I W . Both of these polar cases therefore yield a smooth and
             s2S       0            s
conventional picture of globalization gradually increasing welfare. The reason is that globalization opens new goods
markets without a¤ecting asset markets.


                                                                   19
goods prices. When this is the case, we say that globalization has terms-of-trade e¤ects.
   It is useful to start the analysis with the case in which globalization has no terms-of-trade e¤ects,
i.e. the case in which changes in             do not a¤ect pjs (z) for any z 2[0; 1], s 2 S, and j 2 fH; F g. This
case is a useful benchmark because the relative incomes of individuals and regions are not a¤ected
by globalization. That is, in this case globalization only a¤ects risk sharing and welfare because
it permits more (or less) trade, and not because it changes the amount of trade that is required
for risk sharing. We ensure that globalization has no terms-of-trade e¤ects by assuming that both
regions produce the same bundle of goods and, as a result, there are no gains from international
goods trade:
                            j             j
                            s (z)   =     s       for all z2 [0; 1] , s 2 S, and j 2 fH; F g .                                            (30)

                            @ is           @ js
This condition implies that       = 0 and       = 0, that is, individual and regional incomes are not
                             @             @
a¤ected by globalization even in those states in which asset markets are closed. (Of course, incomes
are never a¤ected by globalization in those states in which asset markets are open, as shown in
Equation (26)). Moreover, we can then write the gains from globalization as follows:

                                   Z                                     Z
                                                             j(i)
                     G( ) =                   s        ln    s       +            s       ln   is   for any i 2 I W .                     (31)
                                    s2E                                   s2E
                                                                           =


For a given enforcement set, G( ) is non-decreasing in . In those states in which asset markets
are open, i.e. s 2 E, globalization permits international sharing in a growing fraction of goods. In
those states in which asset markets are closed, i.e. s 2
                                                       = E, globalization does not a¤ect domestic
and international sharing of goods.
   But the enforcement set is itself a non-increasing function of . To see this, consider a pair of
symmetric states fs; s0 g. The top panel of Figure 1 shows the bene…t and cost of enforcement in
these states (see Equation (28)). While the bene…t of enforcement does not depend on , the cost of
                                                                          Z
enforcement is proportional to . If individual risk is not too high, i.e.     ln is < ln R
                                                                                         s ; there
                                                                                                              i2I R
exists a threshold   s (=   s0   ) such that, if                 s   both asset markets exists, but if                      >   s   both asset
markets are missing. This threshold is obtained by equating the cost and bene…t of enforcement,
                                                       Z
                                                                 ln      is
                                                        i2I R
                                              s   =              R
                                                                              for all s 2 S.                                              (32)
                                                            ln   s


This threshold is increasing in individual risk, but decreasing in regional risk. This is a direct
implication of the already familiar trade-o¤ behind enforcement decisions. If                                         s   > 1, globalization
never closes the market for assets that pay in state s. If                            s   < 1, globalization closes this market on



                                                                     20
the …rst date in which             t   >    s   and it never reopens again.
      Our symmetry assumptions allow us to study the contribution to overall welfare of each pair
of symmetric states separately. The bottom panel shows how the contribution of a pair of states
s and s0 changes as globalization proceeds. Assume                        s   < 1 and let ts be the generation such that

 ts      s   <    ts +1 .   All generations born at date t            ts open the asset markets for this pair of states.
Therefore globalization allows international sharing on a growing number of goods and increases
the contribution of this pair of states to welfare. But this also requires growing payments between
regions in these states. When generation ts arrives, these payments would have grown too large and
the temptation to default would have been irresistible. Since individuals anticipate this, the asset
markets for this pair of states close. This eliminates all international sharing of tradable goods and
worsens domestic sharing of goods. As a result, the contribution to welfare of this pair of states
drops discretely to a level that is below that of autarky. All the generations born at dates t > ts
share this low level of welfare in this pair of states.
      It is now straightforward to use the theory to provide an account of the e¤ects of global-
ization. This is shown in Figure 2. Assume there are many pairs of symmetric states S =
f(s1 ; s01 ) ; (s2 ; s02 ) ; :::; (sP ; s0P )g. Let   p   be de…ned as above for the pair of states sp ; s0p . In a
given date t, asset markets exist for the pair of states sp ; s0p if and only if                         t   p.   Without loss
of generality, we order pairs of symmetric states according to                       p;   i.e.   1   2             P.

      The possible e¤ects of globalization on welfare are illustrated in the three panels of Figure 2.23
Assume that there exists some sp ; s0p such that                      p   < 1 and, for these pairs, let tp be the period
such that        tp     p   <   tp +1 .    All generations born in date t        t1 bene…t from globalization because all
asset markets are open and globalization enlarges the set of goods that are shared internationally.
At t = t1 , the asset markets corresponding to the pair of symmetric states (s1 ; s01 ) close leading
to a reduction in both domestic and international sharing in these states. This leads to a discrete
loss of welfare that persists forever since these asset markets never re-open. All generations born in
dates t1 < t < t2 bene…t from further globalization as, once again, it enlarges the set of goods that
can be shared internationally. Note however that this e¤ect is smaller than in earlier generations
because the newly tradable goods cannot be shared in the pair of states (s1 ; s01 ). At t = t2 , the
asset markets corresponding to the pair of symmetric states (s2 ; s02 ) close and this leads to another
discrete and persistent loss of welfare. After this, subsequent generations bene…t from further
globalization until the following pair of asset markets close. And this process continues until the
world is fully globalized.

     The jagged line shows the case of a …nite number of states (as explained in the text) while the smooth line shows
the limiting case in which the number of states approaches in…nity.



                                                                 21
   This special case illustrates the interplay between two e¤ects of globalization on welfare. On
the one hand, globalization removes technological constraints to trade and improves international
risk sharing in those states in which asset markets remain open. On the other hand, globalization
creates sovereign risk and destroys domestic and international risk sharing in those states in which
asset markets close. The top panel of Figure 2 shows the case in which the balance of these e¤ects is
always positive and welfare increases monotonically with globalization. The middle panel shows the
opposite case in which the balance of these e¤ects is negative and welfare falls monotonically with
globalization. Finally, the lower panel shows a case in which the balance of these e¤ects changes
sign many times and the e¤ects of globalization on welfare are not monotonic.


3.2   Terms-of-trade e¤ects

If condition (30) fails globalization creates changes in the terms of trade that a¤ect the relative

    For a given enforcement set, G( ) no longer needs to be non-decreasing in , as shown by
Equation (29). Increases in    still permit international sharing of a larger fraction of goods in all
states and this raises welfare. But now, in addition, globalization a¤ects domestic sharing of goods
in those states in which the corresponding asset market is closed, i.e. s 2
                                                                          = E. For instance, a change
in the terms of trade that increases individual risk worsens domestic sharing of goods and lowers
welfare.
   Terms-of-trade e¤ects also have implications for the shape of the enforcement set, as shown
by Equation (28). Without terms-of-trade e¤ects we found that, for any pair of symmetric states
fs; s0 g, enforcement only takes place at low values of . This was because the cost of enforcement
grows proportionally with globalization, while the bene…t of enforcement is not a¤ected by global-
ization. But this need not be the case if globalization creates terms-of-trade e¤ects. For instance,
it is possible that terms-of-trade e¤ects reduce regional risk su¢ ciently fast that the cost of en-
forcement falls with globalization. Or it could also be possible that terms-of-trade e¤ects increase
individual risk and the bene…t from enforcement grows with globalization. Enforcement in a pair
of symmetric states fs; s0 g might now change many times with globalization.

3.2.1         Regional terms-of-trade e¤ects

An interesting special case is that in which all individuals within a region produce the same bundle
of goods and, as a result, there are no gains from domestic goods trade:


                                       is (z)   =   is    for all z2 [0; 1] , s 2 S, and i 2 I W .                                            (33)

                                             @ is
When this condition applies, we have that           = 0. That is, globalization changes the relative
                                              @
incomes of regions but it does not change the relative incomes of individuals within the same region.
         For a given enforcement set, G( ) is non-decreasing in                   like the previous section. In those states
in which asset markets are open, i.e. s 2 E, globalization allows perfect international sharing of a
larger fraction of goods. In those states in which asset markets are closed, i.e. s 2
                                                                                    = E, globalization
does not a¤ect domestic sharing but allows imperfect international sharing of a larger fraction of
goods. But unlike the previous section now the enforcement set can take a variety of di¤erent
                                          @ is
shapes. Since condition (33) ensures that      = 0, we still have that the bene…t of enforcement is
                                           @
independent of . But now the cost of enforcement need not be proportional to . If globalization
increases regional risk, the cost of enforcement will increase more than proportionally with . If
globalization reduces regional risk, the cost of enforcement will increase less than proportionally
with          and might even fall. Whether globalization increases or reduces regional risk depends
on whether the marginal tradable good contains more regional production risk than the average
tradable one.24
         To develop further intuition, consider a pair of states in which one region’s production bundle is
abundant in low-index goods, while the other region’s production bundle is abundant in high-index
goods. In particular, assume that                        R (z)    R (L)    > 1 for all z 2[0; 0:5], and              R (z)            R (H)     =
2          R (L)     for all z 2 (0:5; 1]. The top panel of Figure 3 shows that the cost of enforcement
grows proportionally with                  until     = 0:5, but then starts declining and reaches zero when                                   = 1.
Naturally, the bene…t of enforcement is independent of since condition (33) applies. If individual
                            Z
risk is not too high, i.e.       ln is < 0:5 ln R (L); enforcement takes place at low and high
                                           i2I R
levels of globalization, but not at intermediate levels. The threshold values at which enforcement
changes are labelled             s   and   s    .
         The contribution of this pair of states to welfare at di¤erent stages of globalization is shown in
the bottom panel of Figure 3. Let ts and ts be the generations such that                                        ts       s       <    ts +1    and

generations born at date t      ts open the asset markets for this pair of states. Therefore globalization
allows international sharing on a growing number of goods and increases the contribution of this
pair of states to welfare. But this also requires growing payments between regions in these states.
When generation ts arrives, these payments would have grown too large and the temptation to
default would have been irresistible. Since individuals anticipate this, the asset markets for this
pair of states close. This eliminates all international sharing of tradable goods and reduces domestic
sharing of all goods. The contribution of this pair of states to welfare drops discretely to a level
that is below that of autarky. All the generations born in t 2 ts ; t0:5
                                                                     s   share this very low level
of welfare. Generations born in t 2 [t0:5
                                      s ; ts ) bene…t from globalization. Although asset markets

remain closed, goods markets now allow imperfect international sharing of tradable goods. Note
also that changes in the terms-of-trade raise the relative income of the poor region and reduce
the payments that would be required to achieve perfect international sharing of tradable goods.
When generation ts arrives, these payments are low enough and enforcement is possible again.
Asset markets re-open and both domestic and international sharing is reestablished. This leads to
a discrete increase in welfare. For t      ts , asset markets are always open and globalization enlarges
the fraction of goods that can be shared internationally.25


3.2.2      Individual terms-of-trade e¤ects

If we relax condition (33), globalization creates changes in goods prices that not only a¤ect the
relative incomes of regions but also the relative incomes of individuals within a region. Rather than
performing a long and tedious discussion of this general case, we shall illustrate the new forces at
work using a simple modi…cation of the previous example. Instead of assuming that all individuals
within a region produce the same bundle of goods, assume now that half of the residents produce
only low-index goods while the other half produces only high-index goods. Namely,
          8
          < 2 for z 2 [0; 0:5] and 0 for z 2 (0:5; 1] with prob. 0.5
  i (z) =                                                                     for all i 2 I j and j 2 fH; F g :
          : 0 for z 2 [0; 0:5] and 2 for z 2 (0:5; 1] with prob. 0.5


Note that, in this example, full domestic sharing of all goods is achieved in autarky without asset
trade, since the value of the production bundle of all the residents of a region is the same. That is,
the value of asset markets in autarky is zero.
       The top panel of Figure 4 shows the bene…t and cost of enforcement both as functions of .
  25
    Note that asset markets are not used when globalization has been completed since the value of production in
each region is the same in all states. The model of Cole and Obstfeld (1991) can be re-interpreted as the limiting
case of this example in which R (L) ! 2 and ! 1.




                                                       24
The cost of enforcement is as in the previous case, since it only depends on regional risk. But
the bene…t of enforcement now depends on                since changes in       a¤ect individual risk. This bene…t
starts at zero when         = 0 since asset markets are not used in autarky. Globalization does not create
any international goods trade in this example when                      0:5 and, as a result, the relative prices
of high- and low-index goods are not a¤ected in this range. Without terms-of-trade e¤ects, the
bene…t of enforcement continues being zero throughout this range. When                      > 0:5, regions start to
trade goods and terms-of-trade e¤ects start to kick in. In particular, international trade in goods
raises the prices of low-index goods relative to high-index ones. This reduces domestic risk sharing
and increases the bene…t of enforcement (this also reduces the cost of enforcement, as explained
in the previous subsection). As            increases, terms-of-trade e¤ects grow stronger and the bene…t of
enforcement increases. There is therefore a threshold level               s   such that there is enforcement only
for          s.

       The bottom panel shows how the contribution to welfare of this pair of states changes with
globalization. Generations born in t            t0:5
                                                 s are not a¤ected by globalization. There is no enforcement

but goods prices are such that there is perfect domestic sharing of all goods. As discussed above,
there is no international sharing of tradable goods. Globalization has two opposing e¤ects on
the welfare of generations born in t 2 [ts0:5 ; ts ). On the one hand, globalization improves sharing
of tradable goods between regions. On the other hand, globalization worsens domestic sharing
of nontradable goods.26 In this range, the negative e¤ect of globalization on domestic sharing
raises the bene…t of enforcement. Also, the cost of enforcement declines as the same terms-of-
trade e¤ects that increase individual risk also reduce regional risk. When generation ts arrives,
the bene…t of enforcement has increased enough and the cost of enforcement has decreased enough
that enforcement becomes possible again and asset markets open. At this point there is a discrete
increase in welfare. All generations born after ts open asset markets and bene…t from globalization
as it enlarges the fraction of goods that can be shared internationally.
       These examples show that terms-of-trade e¤ects alter sometimes quite dramatically the rela-
tionship between globalization and asset market incompleteness. Without terms-of-trade e¤ects,
asset markets are open only in the early stages of globalization. But Figures 3 and 4 show situa-
tions in which asset markets are open only at intermediate and only at later stages of globalization,
respectively. The theory therefore captures a rich set of interactions between globalization and the
workings of asset markets.
  26
       This negative e¤ect of globalization on domestic sharing of goods was …rst noted by Newbery and Stiglitz (1984).




                                                           25
4     Externalities

The cornerstone of the theory developed above is the trade-o¤ that governments face when decid-
ing their enforcement policy. On the one hand, enforcement increases payments from domestic to
foreign residents that lower domestic consumption and welfare. On the other hand, enforcement
increases payments between domestic residents that improve domestic sharing of goods and there-
fore raise welfare. This trade-o¤ determines the states of nature in which governments choose to
enforce payments during old age and, therefore, the set of assets that can be traded during youth.
    In our setup, the closure of markets constitutes a failure and this is the direct result of two
externalities. The …rst one is that governments do not take into consideration how their enforcement
decisions a¤ect foreigners. This externality leads governments not to enforce payments even though
in old age the domestic gains from not enforcing are always below the foreign costs. It might seem
therefore that the closure of markets could be avoided if governments could pay each other ex-post
to enforce. Section 4.1 shows that this is not the case however.
    The second externality is that individuals do not take into consideration how their choice of asset
holdings a¤ects the enforcement decision of their government. This externality leads individuals
to borrow so much from abroad during youth that governments prefer not to enforce in old age.
One might think that imposing borrowing limits would solve this problem and avoid the closure
of markets. Section 4.2 shows that this is only partially true and that, in any case, allowing
the government to set optimal borrowing limits has surprisingly little e¤ect on the picture of
globalization developed in the last couple of sections.


4.1    Renegotiating the debt

We have assumed throughout that governments decide enforcement policies non-cooperatively and
do not take into account how their decisions a¤ect foreigners. This policy externality leads markets
to close whenever the costs of making foreign payments are higher than the bene…t of keeping
domestic payments. At …rst sight, this might seem an easy problem to solve. After all, the gains
that the rich region obtains from not enforcing are always smaller than the losses that the poor
region su¤ers. Allowing regions to renegotiate their debts ex-post should therefore ensure that
there is always enforcement. Unfortunately, this argument is wrong and we explain next why.
    Consider a pair of symmetric states for which we concluded there is no enforcement in the best
symmetric equilibrium. We reached this conclusion by contradiction. Assume individuals expect
enforcement, then asset trade would be as in the complete-markets model and the government
of the rich region would have an incentive not to enforce. Therefore, individuals cannot expect


                                                  26
enforcement by the rich region. Assume then that the rich region does not enforce but the poor
region does. But then there would be payments from the rich residents of the poor region to the poor
residents of the rich region and the poor region would have an incentive not to enforce. Therefore,
individuals cannot expect enforcement by the poor region either. This leads us to the conclusion
that the only possible outcome is that individuals do not expect enforcement. In this case, there is
no asset trade and expecting governments not to enforce is a consistent “o¤-equilibrium” belief.
   This argument does not formally consider the possibility that regions cooperate during old age
and the question now is whether this omission matters or not. To be concrete, assume the poor
region can make a transfer to the rich region in exchange of enforcement. To raise revenue for this
transfer, the poor region levies lump-sum taxes on its residents. Ex-post, the poor region would
be willing to o¤er a transfer to the rich region that is as large as the payments that its residents
are due. But the transfer need not be as large for it to work. Since not enforcing destroys valuable
domestic payments, the value of enforcing for the rich region is less than the foreign payments it
saves by not enforcing. This observation could lead us to conclude that enforcement should be the
only outcome of any e¢ cient (and also some ine¢ cient) ex-post bargaining between regions.
   But this conclusion would be unwarranted, since it assumes that free or unobstructed asset trade
during youth can lead to imperfect sharing ex-post. To see this, consider again a pair of states for
which we decided there is no enforcement in the best symmetric equilibrium. Assume now that
individuals were to expect that there is enforcement in old age and that this enforcement requires
a transfer. But then asset trade would not be as in the complete-markets model. Anticipating the
transfer, domestic residents would now feel richer and sell more assets to foreign residents which
now feel poorer. In particular, asset trade would be such that fully o¤sets the transfer and achieves
perfect domestic sharing of all goods and perfect international sharing of tradable goods after the
transfer has been paid. But we know already that in this case the rich region has an incentive not
to enforce and therefore individuals cannot expect that the transfer be enough to induce the rich
region to enforce.
   This argument shows that the expectation of a debt renegotiation cannot sustain the opening
of asset markets, and leads us to conclude that allowing ex-post cooperation between regions does
not a¤ect the equilibrium of the model.

4.2       Dealing with overborrowing

We have assumed throughout that individuals are atomistic and do not take into consideration
how their choice of asset holdings a¤ects the enforcement decision of their government.27 This
overborrowing externality leads markets to close because otherwise regions would borrow so much
that there would be no enforcement. In principle, the solution to this problem consists of imposing
limits to foreign borrowing. But this solution is not available if government policy cannot discrim-
inate between asset holders, as we have assumed throughout the paper. The same reasons (opaque
…nancial intermediaries and deep secondary markets) that impede governments to discriminate
between asset holders when enforcing payments also impede them to discriminate between asset
holders when imposing borrowing limits. We therefore assume that governments can only impose
borrowing limits that are non-discriminatory.
       Assume governments limit private borrowing using asset-speci…c issuance rights. Governments
choose the number of issuance rights for each asset, denoted xjs for s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g, which
they distribute equally among their domestic residents. During youth agents trade in both issuance
rights and assets, under the constraint that their issuance is limited by the issuance rights they
hold. Therefore, the budget sets during youth in Equations (19) and (20) are replaced by

                    Z
                            qsH xH;is + qsF xF;is +     j(i)
                                                        s          xis   xj(i)
                                                                          s           0 for all i 2 I W ,        (34)

                     xj(i);is    min f^
                                      yis ; xis g and x        j(i);is   0 for all s 2 S and i 2 I W ,           (35)

where xis denotes the state-s issuance rights held by individual i after the market for issuance rights
           j
closes,    s   denotes the price of state-s issuance rights in country j, and we used the fact that before
                                                                           j(i)
the market for issuance rights opens individual i holds xs                        state-s issuance rights. In addition
to the market clearing conditions for assets in Equation (22) we now also have market clearing
conditions for issuance rights, which are given by

                                  Z
                                           xis = xjs for all s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g .                             (36)
                                   i2I j


       A competitive equilibrium with borrowing limits during youth consists of a set of asset prices and
quantities such that individuals maximize expected utility –Equation (2)–subject to their budget
and solvency constraints –Equations (34), (35) and (21)–and asset markets clear –Equations (22)
and Equation (36). Naturally, when maximizing their utility, individuals take as given how their

   This externality is well known in the literature on sovereign risk. For recent discussions of the problem, see
Caballero and Krishnamurthy (2001), Tirole (2003), Kehoe and Perri (2002b), and Wright (2006).

individual consumption during old age depends on their individual asset holdings.
   In Appendix B we analyze the equilibrium with optimal borrowing limits and show that it
contains three types of states. In those states in which there is enforcement even in the absence of
borrowing limits, it is optimal not to impose binding limits and the price of issuance rights is zero
in both regions. In the remaining states, it is possible (but not necessary) that borrowing limits
in the rich region allow enforcement and trade. In those states in which this happens, we have
that the price of issuance rights is positive in the rich region and asset markets are open. Paying
issuance rights introduces a wedge between the ex-post incomes of borrowers and lenders and, even
though asset markets are open, both domestic and international sharing of goods is imperfect. In
those states in which there is no borrowing limit that would lead to enforcement and trade, the
price of issuance rights is zero in both regions and asset markets remain closed.
   The e¤ects of globalization with optimal borrowing limits are illustrated in Figure 5. The left
two panels refer to the case of no terms-of-trade e¤ects illustrated in Figure 1. The top panel
shows the optimal issuance rights price in the rich region as a function of                  (this price is always
zero in the poor region), which we denote           s(    ). For       s,   borrowing limits are not needed for
enforcement to take place so       s(   ) = 0. In addition, for         su¢ ciently higher than        s   borrowing
limits are not useful either since the issuance rights price would need to be so high for enforcement
to take place that no resident of the rich region would sell assets anyway. The optimal issuance
rights prices are positive only for values of            that are a bit above     s.   The e¤ects of globalization
on welfare for this pair of symmetric states is shown in the bottom panel. These e¤ects are quite
similar to those in the absence of borrowing limits. The di¤erence is that when generation ts + 1
arrives, instead of asset trade disappearing the rich region imposes borrowing limits that lead to
a positive issuance rights price    s ( ts +1 ).   Although asset markets remain open, there is imperfect
domestic and international sharing of goods. Each new generation requires higher issuance rights
prices to keep enforcement. Conditional on issuance rights prices and enforcement, globalization
improves international sharing of newly tradable goods. However, domestic sharing of goods and
international sharing of inframarginal tradable goods worsen as a result of higher issuance rights
prices. The net e¤ects of globalization on welfare are ambiguous. At some point, enforcement is
impossible even with borrowing limits, so the price of issuance rights fall to zero and globalization
eliminates all domestic and international sharing of goods. Borrowing limits delay the date in which
enforcement breaks down.
   The middle two panels refer to the case illustrated in Figure 3 in which there are only regional
terms-of-trade e¤ects. The top panel shows that the optimal issuance rights price is positive only
for values of   that are a bit above     s,   and also for values of        that are a bit below   s   . The bottom

panel shows that the e¤ects of globalization on welfare for this pair of symmetric states are not
qualitatively a¤ected by borrowing limits. Borrowing limits delay the time at which enforcement
breaks down and bring forward the time at which enforcement reappears. The right two panels refer
to the case illustrated in Figure 4 in which there are regional and individual terms-of-trade e¤ects.
The top panel shows that the optimal issuance rights price is positive only for values of                      that are
a bit below       s.   Once again, the bottom panel shows that the e¤ects of globalization on welfare for
this pair of symmetric states are not qualitatively a¤ected by borrowing limits. Borrowing limits
simply bring forward the time at which enforcement appears.
         This discussion shows that borrowing limits, though welfare-improving, have little e¤ect on the
picture of globalization we presented in section 3.28


5         Final Remarks

This paper has developed a novel theory of endogenous asset market incompleteness based on
sovereign risk. The key departure from previous theory is our assumption that governments cannot
discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors when choosing enforcement. Previous theory
had instead assumed that governments can perfectly discriminate between domestic and foreign
creditors. The results presented in this paper show that this choice of assumption shapes the
analysis in a fundamental way:

           If a country can perfectly discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors, sovereign
           risk keeps all asset markets open but geographically segmented. Domestic asset trade is not
           a¤ected by sovereign risk and can only be limited by other …nancial market imperfections.
           International asset trade is not feasible unless the country can o¤er some collateral.29 In-
           creases in collateral should improve international risk sharing, without a¤ecting domestic risk
           sharing. Reductions in trade costs improve the functioning of goods markets without a¤ecting
           the functioning of asset markets, and always raise welfare.30
    28
     In Appendix C, we allow governments to shut down private asset markets and directly control the amount of
borrowing by issuing public debt. We show that the outcome with optimal public debt is better than the outcome
without ex-ante government intervention and worse than the outcome with optimal borrowing limits. We also show
that public debt has little e¤ect on the picture of globalization.
  29
     We use here a broad concept of collateral. This concept includes the narrow view of collateral, i.e. the value of
the real assets that foreign creditors can directly seize in the event of default. It also includes the e¤ects of default
penalties, i.e. the value of the payments that foreign creditors can elicit through the threat of applying penalties of
various sorts. Conceptually, narrow collateral and penalties play the same role in the theory and therefore makes
sense to treat them jointly.
  30
     The trade theorist will immediately recognize that this statement needs a few words of quali…cation. In the
model of this paper, globalization with perfect discrimination would raise the ex-ante welfare of all regions because
they are ex-ante identical and a reduction in trade costs has no ex-ante terms-of-trade e¤ects. With asymmetric
regions, it is possible to construct examples in which there are ex-ante terms-of-trade e¤ects that lead some regions



                                                           30
      If a country cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign creditors, sovereign risk closes
      some asset markets but keeps those that are open global. Even in the absence of other …nancial
      market imperfections, domestic asset trade is limited. Even in the absence of collateral, some
      international asset trade is possible. Increases in collateral should improve both international
      and domestic risk sharing. Reductions in trade costs improve the functioning of goods markets
      but might either improve or worsen the functioning of asset markets, and the e¤ects on welfare
      can go either way.

    Therefore, our assumption of no discrimination: (i) provides a new explanation for why countries
can borrow abroad; (ii) shows that there are crucial interactions between domestic and international
asset trade; and (iii) accounts for much richer e¤ects of globalization on risk sharing. In addition,
the assumption of no discrimination seems to us more realistic than the previous one of perfect
discrimination. Although reality surely lies somewhere between these two polar cases, we argued in
the introduction that the institutional setup of emerging-market borrowing during the 1990’s and
2000’s is one in which governments …nd it di¢ cult to discriminate between domestic and foreign
creditors. In any case, it seems also evident that the main theoretical results of this paper would
still apply even if governments have some ability to discriminate between creditors and only vanish
in the polar case of perfect discrimination.
    There are, at least, two important directions in which the theory presented here can be extended.
First, the theory abstracts form other types of …nancial frictions, for instance, those resulting from
asymmetric information and transaction costs. These frictions are likely to a¤ect the governments’
incentives to enforce payments, since they may have di¤erent e¤ects on the size of domestic and
international payments. It would be interesting to analyze the interactions between sovereign risk
and these other types of …nancial frictions. Second, the theory ignores the role of reputation in
sustaining cooperative behavior. Although the role of reputation has been thoroughly analyzed in
previous literature for the case of perfect discrimination, it seems likely that new results would arise
if we allowed for reputational equilibria in our setting. For example, if a country cannot discriminate
between domestic and foreign creditors, an increase in the incentive to keep a good reputation is
likely to improve both international and domestic risk sharing. Furthermore, globalization is likely
to a¤ect enforcement, market incompleteness, and welfare not only as a result of its e¤ects on the
within-period trade o¤ analyzed in this paper, but also through intertemporal interactions absent
when there is perfect discrimination.
to gain and some to lose as a result of globalization. But even in this case, the world as a whole would still gain
from globalization and, as a result, there would always exist a set of (international) ex-ante transfers that ensure
that globalization leads to a Pareto-improvement. See Ventura (2005) for a comprehensive analysis of the e¤ects of
globalization (as modelled here) on trade, growth and welfare.

7    Appendix A: Construction of the sovereign risk equilibrium

In this appendix, we construct the sovereign risk equilibrium used in the text. With complete
markets, there are equilibria that share the same prices and quantities, but di¤er in the distribution
of assets among individuals. This multiplicity is clearly irrelevant since it does not matter whose
assets an individual holds. With sovereign risk, the distribution of assets may be relevant since it
can a¤ect the governments’incentives to enforce payments ex-post. To simplify the exposition, we
impose the condition that there be no state in which Home residents receive payments from Foreign
                                                                   Z              Z
and Foreign residents receive payments from Home. That is, either        xF;is or     xH;is is zero
                                                                       i2I H         i2I F
for all s 2 S. This restriction is without loss of generality since it can be easily shown that if a
given allocation can be supported as an equilibrium in which this condition is not satis…ed, then


                                                 33
this allocation can also be supported as an equilibrium in which this condition is satis…ed.
      It follows from the symmetry assumption that we can analyze pairs of symmetric states indepen-
dently. For each pair of symmetric states s and s0 there are three possible symmetric enforcement
levels: (i) both regions enforce: s 2 E H \ E F and s0 2 E H \ E F ; (ii) one region enforces: either
s 2 EF       E H and s0 2 E H          E F , or s 2 E H    E F and s0 2 E F           E H ; and (iii) no region enforces:
 = E H [ E F and s0 2
s2                  = E H [ E F . We construct the best symmetric equilibrium and this is the one
in which enforcement levels are as high as possible. To …nd this equilibrium, we take each pair of
symmetric states s and s0 and follow three steps:

STEP 1: We check whether in equilibrium both regions can enforce payments simultaneously.31
Assume this is the case. Then, asset holdings are as in the complete-markets model and consump-
tions are given by Equation (14). Using these consumption allocations and the fact that utility is
logarithmic, we …nd that the enforcement condition is given by:

                                                    !       0                     1
                   Z                                                 j
                                   Nj + x
                                  yis        j;is                ysj;N + xj j;s
                             ln    j;N j    j
                                                          ln @              j
                                                                                  A for all j 2 fH; F g ,
                     i2I j        ys     + x j;s                    ysW;N

            j
where y N stands for the value of income in case of unexpected non-enforcement by the government
of region j. The left hand side measures the loss in average utility that results from a breakdown
in domestic risk sharing in region j, while the right hand side measures the gains in average utility
that result from not paying debts to foreigners. The left hand side is nonnegative for both regions,
while the right hand side is zero for the poor (or creditor) region and positive for the rich (or debtor)
region. Therefore, the poor region has no incentive to deviate. Has the rich region an incentive
to deviate? Let R be the rich region. Since nobody in this region holds assets issued by residents
of the poor region, i.e. xP;is = 0 for all i 2 I R , individual and regional incomes of the rich region
if it deviates are obtained by setting xis = 0 in Equations (7) and (8). If, given these values of
productions, the Equation above holds we conclude that the government of the rich region enforces
payments. In this case, s 2 E H \ E F and xis = ysW                      yis for all i 2 I W . Otherwise, we move to
the next step.

STEP 2: We check whether the poor region enforces payments, even though the rich region does
not. Assume this is the case. Since the rich region does not enforce payments, there are some
residents of this region that would like to sell assets but cannot do so. Typically, there are also
some “poor” residents of the rich region that purchase assets from “rich” residents of the poor
 31
      Since states s and s0 are symmetric, we just perform these steps on state s.

region. Therefore, the rich region becomes the creditor while the poor region becomes the debtor.
Let R and P be the rich and poor regions. Then, we have that asset holdings are given by
                                     8
                                     < max y P + xP                  yis ; 0      if i 2 I R
                                              s    s
                               xis =
                                     : y P + xP y                                 if i 2 I P
                                        s     s   is


and the market clearing condition in Equation (11). These asset holdings imply that there is full
risk sharing among those individuals for which the solvency constraint is not binding. This includes
all residents of the poor region and the “poor”residents of the rich region. The “rich”residents of
the rich region are forced to consume all of their production. Substituting these asset holdings into
Equations (6), (7) and (8), we obtain incomes and consumption allocations. Moreover, this allows
us to write the enforcement condition for the poor region as:

                     Z                          !   "                     P
                                                                              !                      !#
                                     N
                                    yis
                                          P
                                                                  ysP;N                ysP + xPP;s
                               ln           P           ln                P       ln                      .
                       i2I P        ysP;N                         ysW;N                    ysW

Once again, the left hand side measures the loss in average utility that results from a breakdown
in domestic risk sharing in the poor region, while the right hand side measures the gains in average
utility that result from not paying debts to residents of the rich region. Both the left and right hand
sides are nonnegative. Since residents of the rich region cannot sell assets, individual and regional
incomes of the poor region if it deviates are obtained by setting xis = 0 in Equations (7) and (8).
If, given these values of productions, the condition above holds, we conclude that s 2 E P                    E R and
asset holdings are determined as described above. Otherwise, we move to the next step.

STEP 3: If we arrive to this step, it means that none of the regions enforce payments and we
                = E H [ E F and xis = 0 for all i 2 I W and j 2 fH; F g. We then obtain incomes
conclude that s 2
and consumption allocations by substituting these asset holdings into Equations (6), (7) and (8).

   This procedure delivers the best equilibrium. This follows from two observations. First, the
enforcement level in a given pair of states does not a¤ect enforcement or welfare in any other pair
of states. This is because we focus on symmetric equilibria and in all of them the relative wealth
of individuals is the same. Second, the welfare in any pair of states increases with the enforcement
level. This is because there are gains from trade and the larger the number of markets the more of
these gains individuals reap.
   We can generate other symmetric equilibria by switching the order in which we perform the
three steps above. For instance, moving step one to the end and then alternating between starting
the procedure in steps two and three generates equilibria in which there is at least one missing

                                                             35
market. Or moving step two to the end and then alternating between starting the procedure in
steps one and three generates equilibria in which there are either two open markets or none.32


8         Appendix B: Borrowing limits

In this appendix, we analyze the equilibrium with optimal borrowing limits. Instead of …nding the
optimal issuance rights directly, we …rst …nd the optimal issuance rights prices f s gs2S . Given these
prices and resulting asset issuance, the optimal issuance rights are given by

                                     Z
                           xjs   =           max f0; xis g for all s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g .
                                     i2I j


         As before, we can analyze pairs of symmetric states independently. To simplify the analysis of
the e¤ects of globalization and make it comparable to those in Section 3, we assume that either
there is enforcement in both regions or there is not enforcement in either region. We only consider
cases in which the issuance rights prices in the poor region are                    P   = 0. This condition will be
                                                                                    s

satis…ed at the optimum because it is the government of the rich region which might have ex-post
incentives not to enforce payments. So let us denote the issuance rights prices in the rich region by

These conditions imply that, when there is enforcement, the richest residents of the rich region
make payments to the poorest residents of the rich region and to the residents of the poor region.
Borrowing limits introduce a wedge between the ex-post incomes of individuals in these two groups.
         Whether or not there is enforcement in state s depends on asset holdings, which in turn depend
on borrowing limits. Let xis ( s ) be the amount of assets individual i purchases when issuance rights
                                                                          Z
prices are s , if all individuals expect enforcement. Then xPs ( s )           xis ( s ) is a decreasing
                                                                                            i2I P
function of       s . This is because, as       s   increases, both the set of richest residents in the rich region
    32
    Following this procedure until we have tried all possible orderings allows us to construct all symmetric equilibria
except for those in which the rich region enforces but the poor region does not. If we added an additional step in
which we checked whether the rich region enforces payments while the poor region does not, the procedure would
generate the entire set of symmetric equilibria.



                                                               36
who want to sell assets and the amount of assets that each such resident wants to sell decreases.
It also follows that xPs ( s ) is continuous in                       s   and that there exists a high enough                 s   such that
xPs ( s ) = 0. Let us de…ne                s       min     s   : xPs ( s ) = 0 , which we call the prohibitive issuance rights
price for state s. Let            E    be the set of issuance rights prices such that enforcement takes place,
                                  s

namely

             E
             s       s   : vsR (enforce)           vsR (not enforce) when xis = xis ( s ) for i 2 I W             for all s 2 S.


     Let the optimal issuance rights price be denoted                                                      E
                                                                                   s.   Then [ s ; 1)      s   and, since the optimal
issuance rights prices are those that maximize asset trade,                                 s     s.    The optimal issuance rights
price will be such that there is enforcement in all states except in those in which the issuance
rights prices need to be so large for enforcement that no issuance takes place (i.e.                                 E    = [ s ; 1) and
                                                                                                                     s

xis ( s )        0 for all i 2 I R ). The optimal issuance rights prices are then given by
                             8
                             < min         E           if min xis (min         E   ) : i 2 IR < 0
                                           s                                   s
                         s                                                                               for all s 2 S.

                                                                               s


     Clearly,       s    = 0 for those states in which there was enforcement in the equilibrium without
borrowing limits, and              s   2 [0; s ] for the other states. If mini2I R fxis (0)g < xPs (0), then when

 s   =   s   there are no payments to residents of the poor region while there are payments from the
richest residents of the rich region to the poorest residents of the rich region. As a result, the
government of the rich region strictly prefers to enforce payments. By continuity,                                        s   <    s.   As a
result, if mini2I R fxis (0)g < xPs (0) ex-ante utility is strictly higher with optimal borrowing limits
than without them. In addition, there is some international sharing of goods since xPs ( s ) > 0.
If mini2I R fxis (0)g            xPs (0), then when               s   =   s    there are neither payments to residents of the
poor region nor payments to the poorest resident of the rich region. Whether or not there exists
an issuance rights price               s       <   s   such that there is enforcement depends on the distribution of
individual shocks in the rich region and the fraction of goods that are tradable . In all cases, even
with optimal borrowing limits sovereign risk still leads to imperfect domestic and international
sharing of goods.


9        Appendix C: Public debt

In this appendix, we allow governments to address the problem of private overborrowing by replacing
private borrowing with public debt. Assume that at the beginning of youth governments issue


                                                                          37
contingent public debt. Governments choose the number of public bonds contingent on each state
of nature, denoted bj;s for s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g, which they distribute equally among their domestic
residents. Assume for now that governments prohibit agents from trading private assets. During
old age, instead of an enforcement choice, governments choose whether to repay their debt or not.
If a government chooses to repay, it imposes non-distortionary lump-sum taxes on its domestic
residents tj;s = bj;s . If a government chooses not to repay, taxes tj;s = 0. The governments’budget
constraints during old age are then given by


                                    tj;s = ej;s bj;s for all s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g ,                                     (39)


where ejs is an indicator variable that takes value one if government j repays its debt and zero
otherwise. We assume that governments cannot discriminate among domestic residents when im-
posing taxes and cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign residents when repaying its
debt. During youth, agents trade in a market for government debt, selling bonds that pay in states
in which their production is high and buying bonds that pay in states in which it is low.
      The budget sets during youth in Equations (19), (20), and (21) are replaced by

                          Z                                         Z
                                  qsH     bH;is +   qsF   bF;is =         qsj(i) bj(i);s for all i 2 I W ,               (40)
                           s2S                                      s2S


where bj;is denotes the number of public bonds that pay in state s issued by government j held by
individual i after the market for public debt closes, qsj denotes the price of public bonds that pay in
state s issued by government j, and we used the fact that before the market for public debt opens
individual i holds bj(i);s bonds that pay in state s. The market clearing conditions in Equation (22)
are replaced by
                                   Z
                                                bj;is = bj;s for all s 2 S and j 2 fH; F g .                             (41)
                                        i2I W

      Finally, the budget constraints of old individuals re‡ect both payments from holding public
debt and taxes. We thus replace Equation (16) with

 Z    1
          psj(i) (z) cis (z) dz    yis + ej(i)
                                          s          bj(i);is   bj;s + es j(i) b    j(i);is   for all s 2 S and i 2 I W , (42)
  0


where we used the fact that governments can default on their debts and also the governments’
budget constraint in Equation (39) to …nd taxes.
      Note that a higher level of public debt leads in principle to more risk sharing (conditional on
repayment) since it allows individuals to make higher payments in more states. At one extreme, if



                                                                  38
bj;s = 0 residents of region j cannot make any payment in state s. At the other extreme, if bj;s is
very high residents of j can make very high payments. Public debt issuance thus plays a similar
role as issuance rights in the previous section.
   As before, we can analyze pairs of symmetric states independently. To simplify the analysis of
the e¤ects of globalization and make it comparable to those in Section 3, we will assume that either
both governments repay or neither does. With some abuse of notation, we will denote the set of
states in which both governments repay as E. We will only consider cases in which the government
of the poor region issues enough public debt so that their residents are unconstrained in the amount
of payments they make during old age. This condition will be satis…ed at the optimum because
it is the government of the poor region which might have ex-post incentives not to repay its debt.
Equilibrium in the market for government debt that pays in state s is characterized by

                   = E for all i 2 I W . This shows that the richer residents of the rich region make
and cis = yis if s 2
payments (through taxes) to the poorer residents of the rich region and to the residents of the poor
region.
   In principle, we could do a full analysis of the case of optimal public debt policy. However,
it is easy to see that in terms of sharing of goods and welfare it falls in between the cases of no
ex-ante policies and optimal borrowing limits. With respect to the case of no ex-ante policies,
it is easy to see that for states in which there would be enforcement with private debt the same
outcome can be obtained by setting bj;s high enough (in particular, as high as the largest payment
a domestic resident would have made in that state). In addition, in states in which there would not
be enforcement, it is sometimes possible to get some asset trade with public debt. With respect to



                                                                 39
the case of optimal borrowing limits, in states in which enforcement is gained with both optimal
public debt and optimal borrowing limits the outcome with optimal public debt is no better and
in general worse than the outcome with optimal borrowing limits. This is because with optimal
borrowing limits payments are made by the richest residents of the rich region (and, among these,
the higher the value of production the higher the payment). This is re‡ected in the fact that
consumption levels are equalized among the richest residents of the rich region. With optimal
public debt, however, residents are constrained in the payments the can make by the size of taxes.
This constraint binds for the richest residents and that is why consumption levels are not equalized
among them. In addition, since the resulting domestic sharing of goods is worse with public debt,
government have fewer incentives to tax and pay the debt held by domestic residents and, thus,
there are some states in which enforcement is gained with optimal borrowing limits but not with
optimal public debt.
   Finally, is it possible to obtain a better outcome by allowing private markets to operate in
parallel with public debt markets? The answer is no. First, in states in which borrowing needs to
be constrained for enforcement to take place agents cannot expect enforcement of private contracts
and repayment of government debt. If they did, the outcome would be as in the complete markets
case and, thus, ex-post governments would prefer not to enforce private payments and/or not
to repay government debt. Second, in these states agents cannot expect enforcement of private
contracts and no repayment of public debt for the same reason. So even if governments allowed
private markets, they would be irrelevant in states in which borrowing needs to be constrained. In
other states, optimal public debt can be partly or even totally replaced by private assets without
a¤ecting the fact that the outcome is as in the complete markets case.

These panels illustrate the effects of globalization on welfare with many pairs of symmetric states. The top panel uses
uniformly distributed pairs of states (14 for the jagged line and 20,000 for the smooth line) with a large mass of states
            *                                              *
satisfying ô p>1. The middle panel is obtained by setting ô p<1 for a large number of states. The bottom panel is constructed
with the same number of states as before but distributed according to a sinusoidal probability density function.
