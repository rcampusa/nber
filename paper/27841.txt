                                         ABSTRACT

We outline a macro-pandemic model where individuals can select into working from home or in
the market. Market work increases the risk of infection. Occupations differ in the ease of
substitution between market and home work, and in the risk of infection. We examine the evo-
lution of a pandemic in the model as well as its macroeconomic and distributional consequences.
The model is calibrated to British Columbian data to examine the implications of shutting down
different industries by linking industries to occupations. We find that endogenous choice to self-
isolate is key: it reduces the peak infection rate by 2 percentage points but reduces the trough
consumption level by 4 percentage points, even without policy mandated lockdowns. The model
also produces widening consumption inequality, a fact that has characterized COVID-19.

                                                 Abstract

         We outline a macro-pandemic model where individuals can select into working from home
      or in the market. Market work increases the risk of infection. Occupations differ in the ease of
      substitution between market and home work, and in the risk of infection. We examine the evo-
      lution of a pandemic in the model as well as its macroeconomic and distributional consequences.
      The model is calibrated to British Columbian data to examine the implications of shutting down
      different industries by linking industries to occupations. We find that endogenous choice to self-
      isolate is key: it reduces the peak infection rate by 2 percentage points but reduces the trough
      consumption level by 4 percentage points, even without policy mandated lockdowns. The model
      also produces widening consumption inequality, a fact that has characterized COVID-19.



1    Introduction

    As the coronavirus and the disease it spawns, COVID-19, has spread across the globe, it has

unleashed fearsome challenges for epidemiologists, public health professionals, economists and pub-

lic policy officials to both understand and devise methods to arrest its spread and attenuate its

effects. The particular challenge in managing the crisis is the tradeoff between the public health

and economic costs of the disease.

    In this paper we formalize a macroeconomic model and blend it with the standard SIR model for

pandemics. Relative to standard macroeconomic models, our structure has two main innovations.

First, we conceptualize aggregate output as being the outcome of the labour effort of different


                                                      1
occupations. We believe this focus is important since a significant source of contagion of infections

is the interaction of people while working. However, labour is supplied through many different

occupations with different degrees of required social proximity and interaction. Hence, the economic

costs of pandemics are likely to vary significantly with different occupation mixes in society.

   A second innovation of the model is that it allows individuals to choose whether to work from

the market or work from home. The ease with which individuals can substitute into working

from home varies across occupations. Our model and empirical implementation incorporates this

variation. Allowing individuals to choose the location of their work allows them to self-insure

against infection risk. This appears to be a key decision facing private agents and policymakers

alike as they decide on the methods of dealing with the crisis.

   Our model is calibrated to British Columbian occupation and labour force data from the Cana-

dian Census 2016. We show that the endogeneity of market participation is quantitatively important

with the peak infection rate lower by 2 percentage points. Risk aversion is the key driver for this

result. Moreover, the effect of lockdowns and their relaxation is also significantly impacted by the

endogeneity of market participation. Lockdowns that are relaxed while infections are still growing

result in slower recoveries as individuals endogenously choose to stay away from market work, even

without coercion.

   We conduct a number of robustness checks on our results. We uncover three important insights

from these exercises. First, our baseline model assumes a common infection risk from market work

for all occupations. Relaxing this assumption and allowing for occupation specific infection risk

from market work does not change the baseline results by much. Second, the degree of risk aversion

is very important. With risk-neutrality, the difference between endogenous and exogenous choices

of work location almost disappears. Third, the productivity of individuals contingent on becoming

infected is important. The lower the productivity of the infected, the lower is the peak of the overall

infection rate.

   The structure that we formalize also has distributional implications. Since individual skills are

occupation specific and occupations have different degrees of substitutability between market and

home work, a pandemic induces heterogeneity in infection rates and consumption across occupa-

tions. Occupations which are easy to perform from home without significant loss of income allow

individuals to insulate themselves from infection risk without sacrificing consumption. Contrarily,

                                                  2
occupations that are harder to perform from home see higher infections and lower consumption.

   The model matches the data fact that the higher the income group the greater the initial drop in

consumption and the slower the consumption recovery. The model also predicts that the trough of

consumption of the lowest income groups comes much later than for relatively richer groups. Hence,

we may not have seen the worst yet in terms of the distributional consequences of COVID-19.

   We believe our results point to the importance of public health initiatives that prioritize building

societal confidence in the safety of market work. One such measure is widespread and frequent

testing of the general population. Absent such measures, economic recovery from COVID-19 may

be prolonged, possibly until the commercial development of an effective vaccine.

   Since the beginning of the global Covid-19 pandemic, there has been an explosion of research

studies analyzing the links between macroeconomic and epidemiological models. The work has

been so prolific that already there are a already number of reviews of the recent literature (Brodeur

et al. (2020), Hur and Jenuwine (2020)) We do not attempt here to provide a complete summary

of new papers in this area. Our paper is closest on the economic side to Eichenbaum et al. (2020),

and takes its calibration of disease dynamics from Atkeson (2020). Recent work in Chetty et al.

(2020) documents the evolution of inequality along various margins in the aftermath of COVID-19.

We use the consumption inequality facts presented in their work as a benchmark to compare the

distributional dynamics of our model.

   Other papers closely related to ours are Dingel and Neiman (2020), who construct a measure of

ease of home work by occupation from ONET data. We use a measure similar to theirs to benchmark

our simulations. Theoretical models that have some relation to ours, besides Eichenbaum et al.

(2020), mentioned above, are Krueger et al. (2020), Jones et al. (2020), and Bodenstein et al.

(2020). Acemoglu et al. (2020), Alvarez et al. (2020), and Jones et al. (2020) conduct optimal

policy experiments in richly parameterized SIR models. The message of our paper, that endogenous

adjustment by individuals accounts for a substantial part of the response to pandemic risk, beyond

official lockdowns, is also stressed in an empirical study by Goolsbee and Syverson (2020).

   The next section presents the model while Section 3 describes the dynamics of a pandemic

and some theoretical results. Section 4 describes the calibration of the model and the quantitative

results. Section 5 explores the robustness of the quantitative results with respect to key parameters

while Section 6 compares the distributional predictions of the model with those in the data. The

                                                  3
last section concludes.



2    Model

    We study a closed economy with a continuum of occupations with measure one. The economy

consumes a final good that is produced by multiple sectors. Sectoral goods are produced by

combining various occupations. Within each occupation i, there is a population Lt (i) of individuals
                                              R1
at date t. Hence, the total population is Lt = 0 Lt (i)di.

    Infinitely lived individuals in the economy have one unit of labour time that they supply inelas-

tically to work every period. Individuals have occupation specific skills. These skills can be used

to supply work effort from home or the market. A representative individual within occupation i

receives wage wh (i) from working at home and wage wm (i) from working in the market. Labour

markets are competitive so that wages reflect the marginal products of labour from home and mar-

ket work in each occupation. Note that for some occupations, the value of work from home may

be extremely small or close to zero. Our model allows for arbitrarily small values of wh for some

occupations.

    We assume that occupations are arranged in order of the wage from working in the market
                                        wm (j)       wm (i)
relative to working from home. Thus     wh (j)
                                                 >   wh (i)
                                                                for j > i. An individual within each occupation

will work in the marketplace if the value of market work V m (i) exceeds the value of home work

V h (i). So if occupation i decides to work in the marketplace, then occupation j > i will also work

in the marketplace. We denote θ as the share of occupations working in the market rather than

home. Thus, defining ī as the marginal occupation that is indifferent between home and market

work, θ = 1 − ī.

    Individuals maximize the present discounted value of lifetime utility. Thus, an individual j in

occupation i maximizes
                                                         ∞
                                                                 ln cjt (i)
                                                         X
                                            j
                                         V (i, t) =
                                                            t

Individuals are hand-to-mouth consumers so that every period they consume their current period

earnings completely: cjt (i) = wt (i)

    The epidemiological structure of the model is very similar to recent papers noted above. At

every date, within each occupation, there are potentially three types of agents in the economy:

                                                        4
Susceptible (S), Infected (I), or Recovered (R) with the total population being Lt = St + It + Rt .

The measure of agents in each of these groups changes over time as a function of the cumulated

decisions made by individuals regarding home versus market work, as well as through infections

occurring through consumption activities as well as random infections, as described more fully

below. In the following we shall use the notation Kt (i) to denote the measure of people of type

K = S, I, R in occupation i at date t.

   For an individual, working in the market entails the risk of becoming infected by a virus. This

risk is a function of the interaction between infected people and susceptible individuals working in

the market. Once infected, individuals either continue to remain infected or recover with probability

πR or die with probability πD .


2.1   Production

   The production structure of the economy consists of a final good that is produced by combining

a set of J-intermediate goods corresponding to different sectors. The final good is the numeraire

for the model. The final goods technology is

                                                          1

                                                                                 P
where ρ ≤ 1 controls the elasticity of substitution between sectoral goods and   j

Ytj denotes output of sector j used by the final goods sector at date t. Using Ptj to denote the price

of sector-j goods, we can derive the demand function for sector-j goods as

                                                            1
                                          Ytj = Yt η j Ptj ρ−1                                      (2)


Equation 4 can be used to derive the price of the basket of final goods, which is unity, as it is the

numeraire:
                                          J             ρ
                                                η j Ptj ρ−1 = 1
                                          X
                                                                                                    (3)
                                          j=1

In the special case where sectoral goods are perfect substitutes in producing the final good, or

ρ = 1, all sectoral prices must be equal and therefore: Ptj = 1

the input weight of occupation i in sector j, and we assume that 0 δ j (i)di = 1. Since both ρj and

across sectors.    1

market. The productivity of occupation i working from home or market is denoted by Aki . We

     In subsequent analysis, we can allow for sectoral use of other sector’s output as part of the production technology,
thereby allowing for intermediate input usage in gross production. This can allow us to incorporate different sectoral
centrality measures in that analysis of alternative lockdown policies.


                                                                       6
assume throughout that γIk < 1 for k = h, m, so that the productivity of infected individuals is

strictly less than non-infected workers in every occupation. The productivity terms are not indexed

by the time subscript t indicating the assumption that productivity is constant.2

     In addition, we allow for a tax rate on market work equal to τm . This tax may be rebated

to each affected occupation as a lump-sum rebate, although we also allow for the tax as a pure

deadweight cost. We think of this parameter as controlling a policy of health-driven shutdowns in

market activity.

     Competitive labour markets then imply that wage rates for market and home work are given

by


                                           wm (i, t) = (1 − τ m )Pt (i)Am
                                                                        i ,                      (7)

                                           wh (i, t) = Pt (i)Ahi ,                               (8)

                                           wIm (i, t) = (1 − τ m )Pt (i)γIm Am
                                                                             i ,                 (9)

                                           wIh (i, t) = Pt (i)γIh Ahi                           (10)


These conditions determine the after-tax wages in each occupation i for all groups of individuals.

Wages in every occupation are constant over time here because both occupational productivity and

prices are constant, and assuming also that taxes are constant.


2.2        The Pre-Infection Economy

     Take an initial situation where there is no risk of being infected in the marketplace. We also

assume that there is no tax on market labour during this period. Then

                                                                             ln wh (i)
                                   V h (i, t) = ln wh (i) + βV h (i, t + 1) =
                                                                               1−β
                                                                              ln wm (i)
                                  V m (i, t) = ln wm (i) + βV m (i, t + 1) =
                                                                                1−β

where the second equality in both equations above follow from the fact that since there are no shocks

in this economy and there are no sticky variables that evolve gradually over time, wages have to

be constant over time. With all other exogenous variables being constant, in each occupation the
     2
         It is straightforward to allow for exogenous productivity growth in the model.


                                                              7
choice between home and market work depends only on the wage comparison wm (i) − wh (i). Since

this is constant, the choice between home and market work remains unchanged over time in every

occupation i. Thus, an occupation that is performed from home today yields a lifetime utility of
ln wk (i)
  1−β       for k = h, m.

    There is a cutoff occupation ī that is determined by the condition V h (ī) = V m (ī). From the

expressions for the value functions derived above, the cutoff condition reduces to wh (ī) = wm (ī).

All occupations for which i > ī will be performed through market works while those below the

threshold occupation will work from home. The threshold then determines the total number of
                                                  R ī
individuals working in the marketplace as Lm = L − 0 L(i)di. The cutoff and the distribution of

market versus homework remains unchanged over time.

    Occupational output produced by occupation i is given by
                                                          

where L0 (i) is the measure of individuals in occupation i, which is constant over time absent any

pandemic dynamics.

    Sectoral output, which is produced by combining occupations, is given by

                        "Z                                                                        # 1j

Note that all sectoral outputs remain constant over time because occupational goods are constant

over time.

    Given sectoral outputs, output of the final good in the uninfected economy is is given by

(1). This is a stationary economy with the occupations choices, population distribution across

occupations, sectoral output, the final good as well as all prices remain constant over time.


2.3         A Special Case

    There is a special case of the model which will be useful to analyze below. Specifically, consider

the case where the following condition holds:



                                                                   8
Condition 1.

                                              ρ = ρj = 1 for all j

    Under Condition 1, equations (2) and (5) imply that Pt (i) = Ptj = 1. Hence, all prices are

constant and equal to one. This directly implies that we must have wtk (i) = wk (i) = Aki and

wIk (i) = γIk wk (i). Thus, all occupational wages are also constant.

    It is straightforward to verify that under Condition 1 we must have

                                                       Z   1
                                                Yt =           Lt (i)di
                                                       i=0



3       A Pandemic

    We shall now study the outbreak of a pandemic in the context of the special case of the model

outlined in Section 2.3 above. Suppose that starting at some date t = 0, a fraction 0 of the

population becomes infected with the virus. Hence, the measure I0 = 0 L0 of individuals becomes

infected. This information is public knowledge. Infection can be spread in multiple ways. Our focus

is infection through the workplace, but we also allow for infection through random association (e.g.

through leisure activities), and through consumption activities, such as retail. We assume that

these second types of infection cannot be avoided, but individuals can reduce risk by choosing to

work at home.3

    In the following we shall denote the lifetime utility value of susceptible, infected and recovered

individuals in occupation i at date t with V S (i, t), V I (i, t), V R (i, t), respectively. It will prove useful

to first describe the choices of recovered agents, then those of infected agents and finally the choices

of susceptible agents.


3.1     Recovered individuals

    Recovered individuals are those who contracted the disease and survived. They are as productive

in the labour market as susceptible individuals. The choices of a recovered agent i at date t working


    3
      Endogenous choice of activities with respect to leisure and shopping activity are of course important, but our
objective in this study is essentially on the implications of the pandemic for the labour market and employment
differences across occupations.


                                                           9
in location j = h, m are determined by

                                                    n                                 o
                      V Rh (i, t) = ln wh (i) + βMax V Rh (i, t + 1), V Rm (i, t + 1)
                                                    n                                 o
                      V Rm (i, t) = ln wm (i) + βMax V Rh (i, t + 1), V Rm (i, t + 1)


    Since the continuation values from both home and market work (the second terms on the right

hand side of the two equations above) are the same, the threshold occupation for recovered agents

is given by

                                              wh (īR ) = wm (īR )

This defines the measure of occupations in which recovered agents work in the market as θR = 1−īR .

Crucially, the constancy of occupational wages implies that this measure of recovered agents working

in the market remains constant over time.

    The preceding implies that (a) a recovered agent in occupation i chooses to always work at

home or always in the market; (b) V Rk , k = h, m remains constant over time; and (c) the threshold

īR remains constant. We collect these results in the following:

                                                              ln wh (i)
                                      V Rh (i, t) = V Rh (i) =
                                                               1−β
                                                              ln wm (i)
                                     V Rm (i, t) = V Rm (i) =
                                                                1−β
                                                      n                   o
                                (1 − β)V R (i) = Max ln wh (i), ln wm (i)


3.2    Infected individuals

    To determine the lifetime utility of an infected agent V I (i), we assume that infected individuals

can earn wIh (i) in home work, and wIm (i) in market work. As noted above, we assume that wIh (i) <

wh (i) and wIm (i) < wm (i) for all i. The assumptions capture the realistic scenario of an infected

worker being less productive than a healthy worker. Infected individuals recover with probability

πR and die with probability πD . These probabilities are assumed to be time invariant in the current

formulation.   4



   4
     In subsequent analysis we can allow for πD to vary based on the degree of congestion in the capacity of the
health system.


                                                       10
   An infected individual’s value functions from working either at home or in the market are

defined as

                               h                 n                                o                    i
   V Ih (i, t) = ln wIh (i) + β (1 − πR − πD )Max V Ih (i, t + 1), V Im (i, t + 1) + πR V R (i, t + 1)
                                h                n                                o                     i
   V Im (i, t) = ln wIm (i) + β (1 − πR − πD )Max V Ih (i, t + 1), V Im (i, t + 1) + πR V R (i, t + 1)


   The cutoff market occupation for the set of infected individuals will be determined by V Ih (īI , t) =

V Im (īI , t). Since the continuation values from both market work and home work today are identical,

the cutoff condition reduces to

                                             wIh (īI ) = wIm (īI )

The associated measure of occupations with infected people working in the marketplace is θI =

1 − īI . Note that the constancy of occupational wages implies that both īI and θI are constant

over time.

   These results can be collected in the following expressions:



                                                      ln wIh (i) + βπR V R (i)
                              V Ih (i, t) = V Ih (i) =
                                                       1 − β(1 − πR − πD )
                                                      ln wIm (i) + βπR V R (i)
                             V Im (i, t) = V Im (i) =
                                                       1 − β(1 − πR − πD )
                                                    n                o
                                    V I (i) = Max V Ih (i), V Im (i)


   In deriving these expressions we have used the fact that the lifetime value of a recovered agent

V R (i) is a constant over time. We established that above.


3.3   Susceptible individuals

   Having described the choices of recovered and infected agents, we now turn to susceptible agents.

For these individuals, their current choices have implications for their utility continuation values

since susceptible agents are at risk of contracting the virus.

   There are three ways in which an individual can get infected. The first is through interactions

with infected people while working in the market, which we denote by πtm . The second is in the


                                                      11
process of random interactions with infected people, through physical closeness in leisure activities

or through travel, for instance. We denote this risk by πtI . Finally, we allow for infections through

consumption activity, intended to capture the interaction of individuals through retail activity. We

denote this risk as πtc . While πtI and πtc are common to all susceptible individuals, the risk of

infection at work is specific to agents who choose to work in the market rather than at home. πtc ,

πtI and πtm fluctuate over time as the market participation of agents changes in the economy and

as the overall number of infected people changes.

    When there is a risk of infection from market work, the value functions for a susceptible indi-

vidual in occupation i are

                              h                                         n                                 oi
   V Sh (i, t) = ln wh (i) + β (πtI + πtc )V I (i) + (1 − πtc − πtI )Max V Sh (i, t + 1), V Sm (i, t + 1)
                            h                                                      n                               oi
V Sm (i, t) = ln wm (i) + β (πtm + πtI + πtc )V I (i) + (1 − πtm − πtI − πtc )Max V Sh (i, t + 1), V Sm (i, t + 1)


where V I (i) is the function that we solved for above.

    From the point of view of a susceptible person, the probability of being infected in the market
                            Stm Itm
place is equal to πm =        Stm      = Itm . Individuals take this probability of getting infected to be

given exogenously when they make their decisions regarding market versus home work in their

occupations.

    The cutoff īS is determined by

                                             h                n                                       oi
           ln wh (īS ) = ln wm (īS ) + βπtm V I (īS ) − Max V Sh (īS , t + 1), V Sm (īS , t + 1)


    We now prove the following result that will be crucial in characterizing the solution:

Condition 2. V I (i) < Max V Sh (i, t), V Sm (i, t) for all i and all t.5
                          


Proposition 1. Condition 2 is necessary and sufficient for the threshold occupation īSt to be in-

creasing in the probability of infection πtm .




   5
     There always exists a weakly positive wage from home or market work which will guarantee that this condition
holds.


                                                        12
Proof. From the expressions for V Sh (i) and V Sm (i) above we get

                                                         h             n                                 oi
 V Sh (i, t) − V Sm (i, t) = ln wh (i) − ln wm (i) − βπtm V I (i) − Max V Sh (i, t + 1), V Sm (i, t + 1)


Differentiating this with respect to πtm gives

              ∂ V Sh (i, t) − V Sm (i, t)
                                         h    n                                 o          i
                                                   Sh               Sm                  I
                                          = Max  V    (i, t + 1), V    (i, t + 1)   − V   (i)
                         ∂πtm

This derivative is positive under Condition 2. The threshold condition is V Sh (īS ) = V Sm (īS ). Since

Corollary 1. Along paths with a falling probability of infection from market work πtm , the threshold

occupation īS declines so that more occupations become market based over time, or θS = 1 − īS

rises.

    The Proposition says that as long as getting infected reduces lifetime utility sufficiently, a

higher risk of infection raises the benefit of working from home. Consequently, along paths with

monotonically rising πtm , the threshold θS falls as īS rises.

    More generally however, during the evolving dynamics of the pandemic, πtm will typically be non-

monotonic, rising initially as more infected individuals come in contact with susceptible individuals,

but then falling as both the population of infected and susceptible individuals falls. In this case, īS

will move in a non-monotonic direction also. The path of īS is then determined by the peak value

of π m that is attained as the pandemic spreads. In this case we can establish Proposition 2

Proposition 2. Take a sequence of infection probabilities π1m . . . πTm such that π1m < π2m < . . <
 m , and π m > π m
πM                              m
          M     M +1 > . . . > πT .

    Then for πtm < πM
                    m , īS is governed by the dynamics:


                                                      h                                       i
                      ln wh (īS ) = ln wm (ī) + βπtm V I (īS , t + 1) − V sh (īS , t + 1)

                V Sh (i, t) = ln wh (i) + β (πtI + πtc )V I (i) + (1 − πtc − πtI )V Sh (i, t + 1)

and for πtm > πM
               m , īS is governed by the dynamics:




                     ln wh (īS ) = ln wm (ī) + βπtm V I (īS , t + 1) − V Sm (īS , t + 1)

        V Sm (i, t) = ln wm (i) + β (πtm + πtI + πtc )V I (i) + (1 − πtm − πtI − πtc )V Sm (i, t + 1)
                                                                                                     



Proof. This follows directly from the proof of proposition 1 when combined with the non-monotonic

path of πtm                                                                                               Q.E.D.

Proposition 3. Under Condition 2, the threshold occupation of susceptible individuals, īSt , is

greater than the threshold for recovered agents īR for all t. Hence, the share of occupations under

market work is greater for recovered individuals than susceptible agents, or θR > θtS .

Proof. The cutoff condition for recovered agents can be written as ln wm (īR ) − ln wh (īR ) = 0. The

threshold condition for susceptible agents is

                                           h   n                                      o          i
         ln wm (īS ) − ln wh (īS ) = βπtm Max V Sh (īS , t + 1), V sm (īS , t + 1) − V I (ī) > 0


where the last inequality holds under Condition 2. Since ln wm (i) − ln wh (i) is rising in i, we must

have īSt > īR . The statement on the share of market occupations for types R and I follows trivially

as θj = 1 − īj for j = R, I.                                                                             Q.E.D.


3.4    Occupation populations

   The absolute measures of individuals working in the market in this economy at any date t is

the sum of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals working in market occupations: Ptm =

Stm + Itm + Rtm . The number of market workers within each group is given by

                                                     Z    1
                                           Stm   =             St (i)di                                     (11)

Equation 11 is the measure of susceptible individuals engaged in market work.


                                                           14
    Since infections are dependent on whether susceptible individuals work in the market or at

home, we also need to describe the evolution of occupation specific populations in each of the three

groups S, I and R. The evolution of susceptible agents in occupation i is given by
                                  
                                  St (i) − St (i)Itm − πc CtS (i)CtI − πSt (i)It if i > īSt

                     St+1 (i) =                                                                            (14)

where  is the matching rate which generates new infections through work and π is the probability

of infection from random contact between susceptible and infected people. πc is the exogenous

probability of getting infected due to random interaction between consumption of the susceptible

and infected individuals. CtS denotes aggregate consumption of susceptible individuals while CtI is

total consumption of infected individuals. We shall solve for these below. In deriving the above,

we have used the fact that only susceptible agents in occupations that are provided in the market,

i > īSt , risk getting infected.

    Integrating Equation 14 over all occupations gives the evolution of the number of susceptible

individuals as

                                    St+1 = St − Stm Itm − πc CtS CtI − πSt It                             (15)

    Similarly, the number of infected people in occupation i evolves according to
                          
                          (1 − πR − πD )It (i) + St (i)Itm + πc CtS (i)CtI + πSt (i)It if i > īSt
                          
             It+1 (i) =                                                                                    (16)
                          (1 − πR − πD )It (i) + πc C S (i)C I + πSt (i)It
                          
                                                                                             if i ≤ īSt
                                                      t      t


Integrating Equation 16 over all occupations gives the evolution of infected individuals in the

economy as

                            It+1 = (1 − πR − πD )It + Stm Itm + πc CtS CtI + πSt It                       (17)

    Lastly, the measure of recovered individuals in occupation i is given by


                                           Rt+1 (i) = Rt (i) + πR It (i)                                   (18)




                                                         15
Integrating this over all occupations yields the evolution of recovered agents as


                                               Rt+1 = Rt + πR It                              (19)


Noting that the total population is Lt = St + It + Rt , we can sum equations 15, 17 and 19 to get

the evolution of the total populations as


                                               Lt+1 = Lt − πd It


   We assume that the initially infected population is distributed proportionally across all occu-

pations so that


                                             S0 (i) = (1 − ε0 )L0 (i)                         (20)

                                             I0 (i) = ε0 L0 (i)                               (21)

                                             R0 (i) = 0                                       (22)


3.5   Consumption

   Aggregating over consumption by all individuals in each occupation gives the occupation specific

aggregate consumption as


                                              CtS (i) = cSt (i)St (i)

                                              CtI (i) = cIt (i)It (i)

                                              CtR (i) = cR
                                                         t (i)Rt (i)



   Hence, total consumption in the economy, which must be the sum of consumption by each

group, is
                              Z
                                      CtS (i) + CtI (i) + CtR (i) di = CtS + CtI + CtR

                       Ct =                                                                   (23)

3.6   Government

    The government maintains a balanced budget by rebating all its tax revenues through lump

sum transfers to individuals. This implies that

                                           Z   1
                                       m

                                           i=0


3.7   Market clearing

    We conclude the description of the key relationships by describing the market clearing condition

for the final good. Since, the government rebates all tax revenues to individuals in the form of lump

sum transfers we have

                                                      C t = Yt                                  (25)



4     Quantitative Results

    We now turn to quantifying the special case of the model under Condition 1 where all the

elasticities of substitution between occupations in producing the sectoral output and between sectors

in the final goods technology are equal to unity, as are the sectoral weights. Recall that in this

special case, GDP becomes just a sum of all the occupational outputs. The model has a number

of margins that affect outcomes. We flesh out some of these through comparative static exercises

on the parameters that control these margins.


4.1   Calibration

    There are ten key parameters in the model. The parameters are mostly taken from Eichen-

baum et al. (2020). They calibrate the probability parameters , πC , and π to jointly match the

probabilities of infection from consumption, market work and random interactions in the USA.

They estimate these probabilities by combining the estimates of Ferguson et al. (2006) with the

Bureau of Labour Statistics 2018 Time Use Survey and the 2018 BLS data on total workers. Their

estimates imply that 16 percent of transmissions occur during consumption, 17 percent at work

and remainder are through random interactions.

    We follow Atkeson (2020) in assuming that it takes 18 days to either recover from the virus

or die from it. Since our time unit is a week, we set πD + πR = 7/18. Based on South Korean

data, Eichenbaum et al. (2020) estimate the mortality rate from the virus to be 0.5 percent. This

yields individual estimates for πR and πD . The baseline values for the relative productivity of

infected people is set to 0.8. They set this value based on the China Center for Disease Control and

Prevention’s estimate that 80 percent of infected people are asymptomatic and that symptomatic

individuals withdraw from work. The values of the discount factor and the initially infected are

also taken from Eichenbaum et al. (2020).

   We estimate the share of individuals engaged in occupations classified as fully working from

home at 6 percent. This is based on estimates from the 2016 Canadian Census. The weekly

discount factor is computed by using the annual discount factor of 0.96 and converting it to its

weekly equivalent. Lastly, we start the pandemic off by assuming that there an exogenous infection

of 0.1 percent of the population at an initial date t = 0. The values for these parameters that we

use for the simulations are given in Table 1.


4.2   Data

   We implement the model using occupations mapped into the share of occupations in British

Columbia using the National Occupational Classifications (NOC) from Statistics Canada Labour

Force Survey and partly from the Canadian Census of 2016. Figure 1 shows the different occupations

at the 2 digit NOC level with their share based on the November 2019 Labour Force Survey (left

hand side axis) as well as the measure of each occupation that reported some degree of working

from home from the Canadian 2016 census (right hand side axis).

                       Figure 1: NOC occupations and ‘Work From Home’




   Figure 2 reports the change in employment by occupation from February to April, 2020, and

then from April 2020 to June 2020 (based on May Labour Force Survey from Statistics Canada).

Each change is weighted by the share of the occupation in the total labour force. The first two

months of the pandemic saw job losses on almost 400 thousand in BC. Hardest hit were occupations

in service sectors such as customer service sales representatives, and service support occupations.

Other occupations, such as senior managers, were almost untouched. In addition, occupations

related to essential services, such as nursing occupations, or occupations in front line protection

services increased in employment during the first period. The June Labour Force Survey then

shows a pick-up of approximately 200 thousand jobs from the April low point. The message from

Figure 2 indicates substantial heterogeneity in job losses among occupations.

   The model set out above does not have an explicit role for unemployment. We assume each

occupation either works at home or in the market. However, we can connect the model to the data

by interpreting large job losses among occupations which face a major loss of income from home

working as being equivalent to unemployment, while other occupations such as senior management

or professional occupations in business and finance can easily remain in the category of being

6.   This represents the 90th percentile in the occupational distribution of work-from-home shares.

This chosen threshold leaves four occupations (professional occupations in art, insurance, middle

management, and senior management) that are classified as entirely working from home in the

initial steady state.

     In order to map the model to the data we also need a measure of wages from working at home

in each occupation. Since our data on occupational wages only reveals equilibrium wages, the home

wage schedule for workers who work exclusively in the market during normal times needs to be

imputed. In order to make progress, we start with the assumption that the difference between the

home and market wage schedule in any occupation is a linear, increasing function of the ease of

performing the occupation specific tasks from home. We proxy the ease with which tasks can be

performed from home in an occupation by the fraction of workers in that occupation who work

from home.

     Using λ(i) to denote the share of workers in an occupation that works from home, the home

wage schedule is computed as

                                                    h             i
                                     wh (i) = wm (i) 1 + λ(i) − λ̂                                         (26)


where wm (i) is the median weekly wage in occupation i. Hence, occupations with home work

shares below the threshold will have home wages below the market wage while those with home

work shares above the threshold will have home wages that exceed the market wage. As noted

above, our data contains information on 40 2-digit occupations. Data on occupation wages comes

from the Census 2016.

     Figure 3 shows the estimated relative home wage schedule along with the work-from-home

shares in all the occupations in our data.

     In the following we shall use this estimated home wage premium schedule to determine optimal

choices by individuals within each occupation.




     6
    The employment share of individuals working at home over all occupations is estimated at 10 percent. But the
model definition of working at home instead requires that we compute the employment share of those occupations
which are performed at home. This estimate from the data is 6 percent.

4.4   Results

   We now show the dynamics of the model starting from a steady state when 0.1 percent of the

population gets exogenously infected with a contagious virus. We start by showing the dynamics in

the baseline case of the model with parameter values as in Table 1. Figure 4 depicts the dynamic

behaviour of the key variables. The time unit for our analysis is weeks.

   The solid blue line shows the dynamics in the baseline case of the model. The infection rate

peaks at slightly under 5 percent after around 7 months from the initial infection. The pandemic

kills a cumulated 0.25 percent of the population. These numbers imply that for a country with 30

million people, 1.5 million people get infected while 75,000 people die. Currently in Canada, total

reported cases are 128,000. But it is widely understood that infection rates are much higher than

actually counted in tests. The CDC in the US estimates that infection rates are up to 10 times

those officially reported Mandavilli (2020). With this adjustment, the infection rates implied by

the model are of the same magnitude as suggested by the data.

   The economic costs of the pandemic occur due to both a decline in market employment as well

as a fall in productivity due to infection. At the deepest point of the recession, which occurs at the

same time as the peak of the infections, market employment falls by around 45 percentage points

while output and consumption decline by over 5 percent relative to steady state. These numbers

appear to be in line with the initial estimates of job losses and output contractions reported from

Canada and around the world.

   A distinguishing feature of the model is that private agents endogenously select into market

versus working from home. Figure 4 shows the crucial role played by these endogenous work

choices made by individuals. The dashed black line shows the dynamic macro-pandemic responses

when the work location choices of individuals are shut down completely. The dashed lines in the

figure show that when work choices are constrained to remain at the pre-pandemic level, the peak

infection rate and the cumulated death rate is 2 percentage points and 0.05 percentage points higher,

respectively, than in the endogenous choice case. The higher infection and death rates occur due to

people continuing to work in the market instead of withdrawing to working from home. Relative

to the endogenous choice case, consumption declines by almost 4 percentage points less in the

exogenous choice case. Clearly, the effect of endogenous choice of work location is quantitatively

substantial.

4.5   Temporary Lockdowns

   Countries globally have chosen various degrees of lockdowns to fight the spread of the infection.

This aspect of policy behavior can be captured in the model through taxes on market production.

How effective is shutting down markets in reducing the prevalence of infections? How costly is it?

Figure 5 shows the effect of two different lockdown intensities. The first is a lockdown for 36 weeks

with a τ = 0.05. The second is a shorter lockdown of 12 weeks but more intense with τ = 0.12.

The figure also shows the baseline case of τ m = 0 with the solid line. The dashed black line depicts

the case with τ m = 0.05 and the dashed red lines corresponds to τ m = 0.12.

                          Figure 5: Varying the Intensity of a Lockdown




   Figure 5 makes clear that a more intense but shorter lockdown of market work for 12 weeks

does not materially alter either the peak infection rate or the cumulated number of deaths. It

essentially delays the peak by the duration of the lockdown. Market employment collapses by over

40 percentage points on impact of the shock with attendant output losses of almost 3 percent rel-

ative to steady state. However, these effects are relatively short lived as the end of the lockdown

results in a rapid recovery of market employment. Interestingly, the economy begins a fresh con-



                                                 24
traction in market employment and output after the end of the lockdown, but this is entirely due

to the endogenous response of individuals sheltering from infections and from the continuing rise

of infections in the economy.

    The other case is where the lockdown is less intense with τ = 0.05 but lasts for 36 weeks. Figure

5 shows that this longer lockdown does have the effect of significantly lowering the peak infection

rate by 1 percentage point relative to the baseline. This policy is also less costly in terms of output.

The reasons are twofold. First, the initial collapse in market work is lower under the less intense

lockdown. Second, the lockdown lasts long enough to ensure that the pandemic reaches its peak

before the program ends. Consequently, there is no renewed endogenous decline in market work

and output after the end of the program.

    An interesting feature of the temporary lockdown policies is that they have little impact on the

long run outcome of the pandemic, in terms of total infections and deaths. This contrasts sharply

with the impact of endogenous shifts out of market work. Comparing Figure 5 with Figure 4, we see

that the final death rate from the pandemic is reduced from 0.3 to 0.25 percent of the population

through endogenous response of individuals in their occupation location choices, which in itself

represents a temporary phenomenon. The additional reduction in deaths coming from lockdowns

is negligible.

    While each of these policies have some impact on the infection curve, neither manages to

completely ’flatten the curve’ as described in media discussion of pandemic responses. Figure

6 shows a drastic lockdown policies, involving τ = 0.20 imposed for 52 weeks. This causes an

immediate and complete shift to working from home for all occupations, and significantly reduces

infections and final death rates, but this comes at a huge cost in terms of overall consumption.



5    Robustness of Results

    Amongst the various assumptions underlying the baseline model, three appear to be potentially

crucial. First, the model assumes that the infection risk from working in the market is common

across all occupations. Second, we assumed that utility is log-linear in consumption. This leaves

open the question of the sensitivity of the model to the degree of risk aversion. Third, the size of

the output losses as well as the attitude to exposing oneself to the risk from market work has to


                                                  25
                             Figure 6: An Extreme Lockdown Policy




be dependent on the productivity of labour contingent on becoming infected. We now examine the

importance of these three margins.


5.1   Occupation-Specific Risk

   Thus far we assumed that π m was independent of occupation i. This is a strong assumption.

The exposure to infection risk varies across occupations due to occupation specific characteristics

like proximity to others at work, the degree of IT intensity of the occupation, the number of people

one has to interact with at work, etc.. Using the VSE Risk-Tool, 2020, one can construct a 2-

digit NOC occupation level risk index. Figure 7 depicts the variation in this risk index across

occupations. The figure clearly indicate that different occupations experience different degrees of

infection risk, quite separately from their market versus home wage premium. Does this matter?

   We examine the importance of occupation-specific risk by modifying the model. Recall that the

probability of getting infected through market work was πtm = Itm . We now modify this to


                                             m
                                            πit = i Itm


                                                26
                                   Figure 7: Indices by Occupation




In order to compute the occupation-specific infection risk we first compute the mean risk factor

across all occupations based on the VSE risk tool. We then define the risk factor proportionality

of each occupation as

                             VSE risk index for occupation i − Mean risk index
                      zi =
                                              Mean risk index

Using this, we compute the occupation-specific infection risk parameter i as


                                            i =  (1 + zi )


where  is the common risk parameter that we were using before. Figure 8 compares the responses

of the model under occupation specific risk with those under common risk. The dashed lines are the

responses under common risk while the solid lines are the responses under occupation-specific risk.

The key point to note is that the differences are relatively minor. Put differently, the results that we

obtained under common infection risk across occupations are robust to accounting for occupation

specific risk.

5.2    Role of risk aversion

   We now examine the importance of the degree of risk aversion of individuals in driving the

dynamics of the pandemic.

   To study the importance of risk aversion, we assume that the periodic utility function of indi-

viduals is linear:

                                             u(ct ) = ct

   Figure 9 shows the key dynamics of the economy under risk neutrality. For comparison, we also

plot the responses under log-linear preferences, which was the baseline case. Figure 9 makes clear

that risk aversion is a key parameter underlying the effect of endogenous choices. The responses

when individuals are risk neutral are much closer to the responses under exogenous choices. This

is intuitively obvious. The greater the risk aversion of the individual, the more she avoids market

work when it entails the risk of exposure to infection.

5.3     Costs of infection

   The main focus of our work is on the salience of the individual’s endogenous response to minimize

the exposure risks posed by the pandemic. A key factor in assessing this risk is the impact of

infections on earnings potential. In our model, there are two consequences of becoming infected.

First, during the duration of the infection the individual’s productivity declines by 1 − γIm percent

for market work and 1 − γIh percent for home work. As γIm and γIh become smaller, the cost of

infection becomes higher. The second consequence of infection is the risk of death, which occurs

with probability πD . The higher this probability the greater the expected cost of infection. We

now explore the sensitivity of the responses to these two margins.


5.3.1    Productivity of infected

   In our baseline simulations, we assumed that γIm = γIh = 0.8. To examine the sensitivity of

results to this parameter we compute the model responses to two different values: γIm = γIh = 0.9

and γIm = γIh = 0.6. Figure 10 shows the responses. The figure shows that a lower γI lowers the



                                                 29
                           Figure 10: Role of productivity when infected




peak infection rate by a full percentage point while also delaying the peak. The infection rises more

slowly and also declines less rapidly when γI = 0.6 relative to the baseline case. As a result, the

probability of infection perceived by susceptible individuals, π m , rises and falls more slowly relative

to the baseline. From Proposition 1 we know that more occupations switch to home work as the

probability of infection rises. This can be seen in the slower decline and rise of market employment

when γI = 0.6 relative to the baseline of γI = 0.8. This pattern is mirrored in the path of overall

consumption which declines more slowly but also recovers more slowly over time.

   The fact that the probability of infection falls more while the share of market employment

declines less under a lower γI might seem counterintuitive at first glance. The reason for this is the

lower consumption of the infected. Since productivity of the infected is lower, their consumption

levels are lower now relative to the baseline case. Since the probability of susceptibles becoming

infected while consuming is proportional to the consumption of the infected, the overall infection

probability declines as γI falls. The lower risk exposure due to lower consumption of the infected

also open up greater space for risk taking by susceptibles who respond by withdrawing less from

risky market work.

5.3.2   Probability of death

   The baseline simulations assume a mortality rate of 0.5 percent which implies that pid is 0.2

percent. We investigate the robustness of our results when pid is 0.5 percent (mortality rate of 1.29

percent).

                              Figure 11: Role of probability of death




   Figure 11 shows that a higher probability of death lowers the peak of infection rate by 2

percentage points compared to the baseline scenario. The death rate increases dramatically from

0.2 percent to 0.6 percent. Risk averse individuals respond to a higher probability of dying by

further reducing market work. The share of individuals working in the market drop from 40

percent to 20 percent. But since now individuals with higher market productivity shift to working

from home, the effect on consumption is now more pronounced. Consumption falls by 8 percent

relative to steady state when the probability of death is higher compared to 5 percent. Thus, a

higher mortality rate increases the economic costs of the pandemic.

5.4   Which Occupations stay home?

   Our model is calibrated to the BC labour force categorized according to the National Occu-

pational Classification. We have described how occupations differ both according to the ease of

work from home and the infection risk in the labour market. It is interesting to see what the model

predicts for the distribution of market exits by occupation. Figure 12 lists the occupations that exit

the market and for how long, in the baseline case and in response to the two lockdown scenarios,

in the case of constant infection risk across occupations.

   As one would expect, with constant risk, the occupations exiting the market are those whose

opportunity cost is lower - particularly professional occupations with less customer or client phys-

ical interaction. We see also that the lockdown policies have a relatively minor impact upon the

occupations that exit the market and the duration of exit.

                            Figure 12: Occupations exiting the market




   When we introduce occupation specific risk, Figure 13 shows that the type of occupations exiting

the market changes quite considerably. Now individuals in ‘risky’ occupations such as health, retail,

or front line protection choose to exit market work. But comparing Figures 12 and 13 it is still true



                                                 32
that most of the time outside the market is accounted for by occupations with a lower opportunity

cost of working from home. This holds both for the baseline case and for the lockdown experiments.

This observation helps to explain the result in 8 above, where we saw that the model simulations

under constant risk and occupational specific risk differ by only a minor degree.

6    Distributional Consequences of Pandemics

    The coronavirus epidemic has clearly disrupted economic life globally. Along with the aggregate

contractionary effects, it has also had huge distributional consequences. Recent work by Chetty

et al. (2020) uses credit card payments data to show that the overall consumption decline between

January and June 17, 2020 was 8.9 percent. However, underneath this overall decline lies huge

variation. This is shown in Panel (a) of Figure 14 which shows that during this period spending

by consumers in zip codes with the top quartile of median income declined by 13.3 percent while

spending by those in zip codes in the bottom quartile of incomes fell by a meagre 2.8 percent.

More broadly, the figure shows that the spending in the richest zip codes declined the most on


                                                33
impact of the pandemic and has shown the slowest recovery. In contrast, spending fell the least in

the poorest zip codes and recovered fastest. Panel (b) of Figure 14, following simulations from our

                        Figure 14: Consumption distribution: by quartiles




                     (a) Data                                     (b) Model
   Note: The figure in panel (a) is from the Opportunity Insights Economic Tracker. Work
   using this data can be found in Chetty et al. (2020).


model shows the model counterparts consumption responses by quartile for the baseline simulation.

These responses are generated from the version of the model without any lockdowns, or for τm = 0.

   A few features of panel (b) are noteworthy. First, as in the data, the consumption of the

lowest income quartile in the model recovers the fastest while the consumption recovery of the

top quartile is the slowest. Second, up to about 16 weeks after the start of the infection, the

consumption declines are positively ordered by the income quartiles: the largest declines are for

the richest quartiles followed by the 3 quartile, 2nd and poorest quartiles. This also fits the

qualitative features in panel (a). We should note that this is even without accounting for the the

transfer payments (made both in Canada and the US) that were directed at the relatively poorer

income groups.

   Panel (b) of Figure 14 also suggests that even though the lowest income groups have held up

their consumption levels up until now, there may be significant consumption declines ahead for

this group as their incomes decline due to more infections that are induced by their inability to

substitute into home production. This is due to the fact that the lower income groups are mostly


                                                34
in occupations where the home wage premium is negative and large.



7    Conclusion

    We have developed a simple macro model which, in conjunction with a standard SIR model, gives

to rise to endogenous cycles in both infections and output. The model has the standard interaction

between economic and infection outcomes. Economic market activity increases infection risks while

lockdowns reduce infections at the cost of deeper recession. The key innovation of our model is

that it focuses on occupations and the endogenous choice by individuals whether to work in the

market or from home.

    The quantitative results from the model calibrated to Canadian data from the 2016 census

suggest that the endogenous response of private agents to market risk can be significant with

the peak infection rate being 1 percentage point lower than when private supply of market work

is exogenously given. Correspondingly, the output loss at the deepest point (the trough) is 4

percentage points greater under the endogenous choice case.

    Our results have a key policy implication. Since individuals are willing to pay to insure them-

selves against infection risk by withdrawing from the market, opening up the economy may not lead

to a sharp recovery. Until people develop confidence about the safety of market activity, they will

continue to self-isolate. While self-isolation may not be an option for people in occupations that

are intensive in social interactions, their returns from market activity are often dependent on the

market consumption activity by others. If a significant share of people withdraw from consuming

in the market, upstream suppliers of these services and goods will suffer income and job losses as

a result. Our results suggest that this effect can be quantitatively high. Dealing with this confi-

dence problem may involve spending on intensive testing rather than direct fiscal infusions into the

economy.

    The model also provided interesting insights into the effects of lockdowns. We found that intense

but shorter lockdowns do not materially change the infection dynamics or the cumulated number of

deaths except for marginally postponing the peak of the infection. Longer and possibly less intensive

lockdowns on the other hand may be more effective in lowering the infection peak. However, they

have the opposite effects on the economic costs of the pandemic. The shorter but more intensive


                                                 35
lockdown has lower cumulated output costs relative to the longer but milder lockdown.
