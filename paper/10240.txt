                                            ABSTRACT

Dual-class common stock allows for the separation of voting rights and cash flow rights across the

different classes of equity. We construct a large sample of dual-class firms in the United States and

analyze the relationships of insider's cash flow rights and voting rights with firm value, performance,

and investment behavior. We find that relationship of firm value to cash flow rights is positive and

concave and the relationship to voting rights is negative and convex. Identical quadratic

relationships are found for the respective ownership variables with sales growth, capital

expenditures, and the combination of R&D and advertising. Our evidence is consistent with an

entrenchment effect of voting control that leads managers to underinvest and an incentive effect of

cash flow ownership that induces managers to pursue more aggressive strategies.

1. Introduction

          In the classic analysis of Jensen and Meckling (1976), managerial equity

ownership helps to align the interests of the manager and minority shareholders. There,

the focus is on the cash flow rights associated with ownership. But managerial equity

ownership has implications not only for incentives, but also control. The votes included

with equity ownership can create entrenchment, and an entrenched management may be

immune to career concerns [Fama (1980) and Holmstrom (1999)], the discipline of the

product market [Hart (1983)], monitoring by large shareholders [Shleifer and Vishny

(1986)], and value-enhancing takeovers [Jensen and Ruback (1983), Franks and Mayer

(1990)].1 In this situation, managers may expropriate minority shareholders and extract

what Grossman and Hart (1988) call the private benefits of control. Although in principle

incentives could be provided without giving the control of equity, in practice the vast

majority of managerial incentives come from equity ownership [Jensen and Murphy

(1990)]

          Since theoretical arguments identify both positive (incentive) and negative

(control) effects of managerial ownership, an active empirical literature has attempted to

disentangle the two effects and identify an optimal level of ownership.2 The seminal

work of Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988) finds that market value is related to insider

ownership in a non-monotonic way. For the largest listed firms in 1980, market value is

  Of course, managers cannot do their job – nor gain the benefit of any incentives --
without some form of control over the organization. In this paper, when we refer to
control we mean “voting control”, as opposed to the “administrative control” enjoyed by
all delegated management. Administrative control is always subordinate to voting
control.


                                                                                        1
increasing in board ownership over the range of zero to five percent, consistent with the

agency theory. But, consistent with entrenchment, over the range of five to twenty-five

percent, market value falls with board ownership. This result has been confirmed in

various samples since then. For example, McConnell and Servaes (1990) use a more

comprehensive sample of firms and find a similar non-monotonic relationship between

ownership and Q. Holderness, Kroszner, and Sheehan (1999) find a similar pattern in

firms from 1935.

       The relationship between inside ownership and firm value has also been explored

outside the U.S. La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Sheifer, and Vishny (2002) examine the

relationship between control ownership and firm value in 27 countries. They find that

higher cash flow ownership by insiders increases firm value. A similar analysis was

undertaken by Seifert, Gonenc, and Wright (2002) for the U.S., U.K., Germany, and

Japan. They examine a much larger sample of firms than La Porta et al. and find similar

results. In all four countries, greater inside ownership of shares leads to higher market

valuations.

       One constraint in these studies is that the two separate forces – incentives and

control – must be identified using only one variable – ownership. An analysis of “dual-

class” companies offers a way around this problem. The typical dual-class company

offers one class of common stock with superior voting rights and one class of common

stock with inferior voting rights. Management and other insiders often hold the superior

voting class in greater proportion. Since these firms have equity structures that break the

link between cash flow incentives and voting control, determining the ownership

structure of dual-class firms allows one to separate the role of these two effects.




                                                                                         2
       Previous studies of dual-class firms suggest that the separation of voting and cash

flow ownership may have significant negative implications for firm valuation. Bebchuk,

Kraakman, and Triantis (2000) explore the costs of a manager’s ability to separate cash

flow rights from control rights. They argue that many of the common mechanisms, such

as dual-class shares, can lead to large agency costs. They further maintain that the

agency costs associated with such structures are an order of magnitude larger than those

existing in firms in which insiders own a majority of the shares. One result that has

appeared prominently outside the U.S. has been a transfer of value from holders of the

inferior class to holders of the superior class. Nenova (2000), Levy (1982), and Zingales

(1995) examine the value of voting rights by examining the valuation differential

between inferior and superior voting stock in international dual-class firms. In these

papers, the superior voting stock trades at a premium to the inferior voting shares.

Amoako-Adu and Smith (2001) examine dual-class IPOs and find that the managers of

these firms, in general, are perceived to not pursue the interests of shareholders.

       In emerging markets, cash flow rights and control rights are often separated

through multiple classes of stock or pyramidal ownership structures. Two recent papers

exploit this separation with studies in the same spirit as our paper. Lins (2003) examines

the relation between management ownership of shares in over one thousand companies in

18 emerging markets. In particular, Lins looks at the effect of separating cash flow and

control rights. He finds that when the voting ownership of management is higher than the

cash flow ownership, firm value is lower. Claessens et al. (2002) study 1300 firms from

eight East Asian countries and find that firm value increases with the cash flow




                                                                                        3
ownership of the largest shareholder but decreases when the voting ownership exceeds

the cash flow ownership.

       Because emerging markets have a large potential for agency problems, they are an

important source for these studies. Nevertheless, these markets are very different from

those in developed countries in terms of legal, regulatory, and institutional factors, so it is

difficult to extend the conclusions between them. To determine the relative importance

of incentives and control for the largest capital markets, we need to build and analyze a

dataset for those markets. That is the primary purpose of this paper. To carry out this

task, we collect ownership information of each class of common stock and tabulate the

fraction of cash flow rights and the fraction of voting rights that are held by insiders of

the firm. We show that in many firms there is a large divergence between these two

ownership measures. We then undertake an examination of the relationships among

voting ownership, cash flow ownership, firm value, and firm performance.

       We find that firm value (as measured by Tobin’s Q) is increasing in cash flow

ownership and decreasing in voting ownership. Both of these effects are non-linear:

positive and concave for cash flow and negative and convex for voting. The positive

effect of incentives peaks at approximately 33% while the negative impact of voting

ownership peaks at approximately 45%. For operating performance, we find that the

relationship of ownership and sales growth follows the same patterns: positive and

concave with cash flow rights and negative and convex with voting ownership. We again

find the same patterns for capital expenditures and for the combined level of R&D and

advertising.




                                                                                             4
        These empirical results can be interpreted two ways. One interpretation is causal:

the misalignment of incentives leads dual-class firms to invest too little, leading to lower

sales growth and valuations. A second interpretation is not causal: the observed patterns

of voting and cash-flow ownership are endogenous responses by firms to their different

environments. While we do not have any instruments to allow us to distinguish between

these two interpretations, we are skeptical of the second. While some part of ownership

structure across a broad group of firms is certainly endogenous to other firm

characteristics, it is difficult to reconcile our full set of results with any plausible model of

this endogeneity. To do so would require the same quadratic structure of relationships

among all of tests.     Also, since our regressions are estimated on industry-adjusted

dependent variables for samples that include only dual-class firms, any endogeneity story

must work within this sample and not through selection into the dual-class category. The

causal story is straightforward, the non-causal story is not. Thus, we will use causal

language in some parts of the paper, even though we acknowledge at the outset that we

do not make a statistical demonstration of causality.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The data construction and summary

statistics are presented in Section 2. The effect of cash flow ownership and voting

ownership on firm value and performance is examined in Section 3. Section 4 concludes.



2. Data

2.1. Data Formation Procedure

        Because no single source provides comprehensive information on companies with

dual-class common stock, we collect data from three separate samples and combine them




                                                                                               5
in our analysis. Our master sample is formed by identifying dual-class companies from

the Securities Data Company (SDC), the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP),

and the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC). Each source has strengths and

weaknesses in its identification of dual-class companies.

       The SDC sample is compiled from the Global New Issues Database, which tracks

corporate new issues activity since 1970. Using a “flag” embedded within this database

for new stock issues where the firm already has an existing, separate class of stock, a

preliminary list of potential dual-class firmswas formulated. Similarly, we searched the

CRSP database to identify companies that had more than one existing class of stock.

This was accomplished by identifying companies with more than one seventh and eighth

digit suffix to their six-digit root Committee on Uniform Security Identification

Procedures number (CUSIP). While the first six digits of a CUSIP (the “issuer number”)

identify the particular firm that has issued the security, the last two digits (the “issue

number”) identify particular issues.     A third list was assembled using the IRRC’s

Corporate Takeover Defenses texts from 1990 to 2002 (Rosenbaum 1990, 1993, 1995,

1998, 2000, and 2002). In these texts, the existence of a dual-class structure is one of the

many takeover provisions that the IRRC identifies.

       These three lists provide our sample of potential dual-class firms. While we

believe our filters will capture most large firms with dual-class structures, we recognize

that some firms will escape our screens. For instance, the SDC filter would miss firms

whose second class of stock was either non-trading or issued before 1970, whether

trading or non-trading. The CRSP database, meanwhile, is designed to isolate solely

dual-class firms for which both classes trade. Finally, the IRRC source, while being able




                                                                                          6
to identify dual-class firms with trading or non-trading stock, is limited only to stocks in

the S&P Super 1500. While these sources sometimes offset each other’s weaknesses,

some dual-class firms are likely to slip through our data filters—for example, a small

dual-class firm whose second class of stock was issued in 1975 but is non-trading.

       For each potential dual-class firm, proxy statements were reviewed to remove the

firms that were not actually dual class at any time during the available period of

electronic reporting (usually 1994-present). In addition, trust funds and some foreign

firms with American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) were eliminated from the sample.

Using proxy reports, 10-Ks, and all other available and relevant documentation, all

accessed via the SEC research engine LIVEDGAR, data were collected by class on

outstanding shares, total ownership, option ownership, and “other” ownership (defined as

ownership of warrants, deferred shares, and/or purchase rights).        Subtracting option

ownership and “other” ownership from total ownership resulted in a figure for the actual

common stock ownership, by class, of directors and officers for each year. We also

collected dividend data for all firms. First, we coded the dividend information contained

in the 10-Ks by class for each firm and year. Second, we identified large, “special”

distributions paid out to shareholders in a given year using CRSP.



2.2. Summary Statistics

       Table 1 provides a summary of the data on the characteristics of the dual-class

firms in 2001 relative to all publicly-traded companies in the CRSP-Compustat merged

database. We refer to this full sample of non-dual-class firms as “single-class” firms,

while at the same time recognizing that this group will include some dual-class firms that




                                                                                          7
have escaped our filters. Indeed, some of the differences in the sample must be ascribed

to the differential ability of our filters to identify large and small dual-class firms.

        The average firm size does not appear to differ substantially between the two

samples. Both dual- and single-class firms have about $4 billion in assets and market

values of between $2 and $3 billion on average. Differences in size distributions become

more apparent when we compare the median firm size (either assets or market values).

The median summary statistics emphasize the very high number of small firms in the

single-class sample. The median dual-class company has $816 million in assets while the

single-class sample has median assets of $187 million. Similarly, dual-class firms have

median market values of $656 million versus $151 million for single-class companies.

        We also find that the dual-class firms have significantly lower book-to-market

ratios on average than do single-class firms. The median book-to-market ratio, however,

is not significantly different for the two samples.3 The differences in average book-to-

market ratios are largely due to the high proportion of small single-class companies that

have high book-to-market ratios.

        We also find that dual-class firms are significantly more levered than single-class

firms: the median debt-to-assets ratio for dual-class firms is 0.21 versus 0.09 for single-

class companies. A potential explanation for dual-class firms’ heavier reliance on debt

financing is that investors may be reluctant to purchase the inferior voting stock of these

firms, and they may therefore have to rely more heavily on debt financing.




3
  For dual-class companies where only one class of stock trades, we compute market
value by assuming that the non-traded stock has the same value per share as the traded
stock.


                                                                                           8
         Dual-class firms are, on average, significantly older than single-class firms. We

define age as the time (in years) from the firm’s CRSP listing date.         The average

(median) age of dual-class firms in 2001 is 16.30 (12.79) years while the average

(median) age for single-class firms is 12.62 (7.75) years.

         Finally, we compute the Governance Index (G) of Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick

(2003) for the IRRC sample of firms.4 This index is comprised of 24 distinct corporate-

governance provisions, most of which can be interpreted as takeover protections. High

values of the index are considered to be firms with high managerial power. We find that

the average (median) G of dual-class firms is 7.18 (7.0) while the average (median) G of

single-class companies in 2001 is 9.09 (9.0). It is not surprising that the dual-class

companies have lower G indexes: since a dual-class structure is perhaps the most

powerful antitakeover protection possible, firms with a dual-class structure may find most

other protections to be superfluous.

         In Table 2, we list the five most common industries in both the dual-class sample

and single-class sample. We utilize Fama and French (1997) to classify each four-digit

SIC code into one of 48 industry groups as of December 2001.                We find that

Communications, Business Services, Printing and Publishing, Retail, and Machinery are

the five industries with the greatest number of dual-class firms in 2001. This distribution

is different from the rest of the population of firms. Business Services is the largest

industry for single-class companies, followed by Electronic Equipment, Trading,

Pharmaceutical Products, and Retail. The predominance of communications and printing

and publishing is not surprising. DeAngelo and DeAngelo (1985) argue that the non-



4
    This index can be computed only for firms in the IRRC subsample.


                                                                                         9
pecuniary private benefits of consumption may be high in media-related firms and hence

may lead founders to establish a dual-class structure in order to preserve control.

       In Panel B, we tabulate the ten largest dual-class companies in December 2001

based on market capitalization. Not surprisingly, communication firms make up five of

the ten largest dual-class companies. Viacom, Comcast, Cox Communications, Echostar,

and HSN were all dual class at the end of 2001. This is consistent with these firms

having higher levels of non-pecuniary private benefits of control.

       Table 3 shows the number of dual-class companies in each year of the sample

from 1994 through 2001. The sample grows substantially over time, from 100 dual-class

firms in 1994 to 255 in 1998. A few observations can be made from these statistics.

Because LIVEDGAR has very few filings available before 1994, there were not a

significant number of observations until then.          Furthermore, sharp increases in

observations, ranging from roughly 100 to 214 in magnitude, from 1994 to 1997 can be

attributed almost entirely to movement in the CRSP/SDC portion of the dataset, as the

IRRC portion remained fairly stable during that period. However, a similar spike from

1997 to 1998 is primarily due to an increase in the IRRC subset, as opposed to

CRSP/SDC.

       It should be noted, however, that this movement in the number of observations is

due as much to the nature of the available yearly data in LIVEDGAR as it is to actual

changes in the number of dual-class firms in each year. While the number of IRRC-

flagged dual-class firms does increase through their editions and spikes significantly in




                                                                                      10
1998, it can be seen that even that alone cannot account for the movement particular to

our dataset.5

        Table 3 also shows the characteristics of the firm’s equity. In Panel A, we show

how many of the classes trade on an organized exchange. We see that in each year, only

about 20 to 30 percent of the dual-class firms have all classes of common stock trading.

This illustrates why our sample is substantially larger than previous dual-class samples

that have been analyzed. Previous samples are identified if both classes of shares trade.

As we can see in Table 3, this is a minority of the dual-class companies that exist on the

public markets. In addition, it is not surprising that in the vast majority of cases in which

some classes of common stock do not trade, only the inferior class trades. This is

consistent with the dual-class structure being employed to provide increased control to

management.

        We also note the voting structure of the dual-class firms in Panel A. The most

common structure of dual-class firms is a 1:10 voting structure in which the superior

voting stock has ten votes for each share while the inferior voting stock has only one.

Panel B shows the resulting cash flow ownership and voting ownership patterns for dual-

class firms. We tabulate the fraction of cash flow ownership that comes from the

superior voting stock and the percentage of cash flow ownership that comes from the

inferior voting stock. We assume that cash flow rights are proportional to the ordinary

dividends on the shares if they exist. If dividends are not paid, we assume cash flow

rights are equal across all classes.




5
 IRRC-flagged dual-class firms totaled: 111 in 1990, 120 in 1993, 123 in 1995, 207 in
1998, 217 in 2000, and 225 in 2002.


                                                                                          11
         Overall, the managers and directors of dual-class firms own a significant fraction

of the firm’s cash flow rights. On average, 26.7 percent of the cash flow rights are owned

by managers and directors. At 22.0 percent, the median ownership is also quite high,

with a maximum cash flow ownership of 86.9 percent. This cash flow ownership comes

primarily from ownership of the superior voting stock. On average, 16.0 percent of cash

flow rights come from the superior voting stock and only 10.6 percent comes from the

inferior voting class.

         Voting ownership is, not surprisingly, substantially higher than cash flow

ownership. Managers and directors of dual-class firms in our sample own, on average,

50.7 percent of the voting rights of the firm. Median inside ownership of voting rights is

quite high, 54.2 percent. On average, nearly all of the voting rights ownership comes

from the superior voting class stock. 47.1 percent of the voting rights are owned through

the superior voting class stock while only 3.7 percent comes from the inferior voting

class.

         A more complete picture of the ownership structure of these firms can be seen in

Table 4 in which we present a cross-tabulation of cash flow ownership and voting

ownership. First, voting rights ownership is higher than cash flow ownership, i.e., most

firms lie in the southwest quadrant of the table. It is not surprising that the majority of

firms in the sample have managerial and director ownership of voting rights that are

higher than their ownership of cash flow rights. Note, however, that there are a few dual-

class firms in which managers and directors own less of the firm’s voting rights than they

do of the cash flow rights.




                                                                                        12
3.   The Relationship of Incentives and Control with Firm Valuation and

Performance

       In this section, we explore the relation between firm performance and insider

ownership of cash flow rights (incentives) and voting rights (control). In particular, we

examine the effect that these ownership variables have on firm value; operating

performance as measured by net profit margin, sales growth, and return on equity; and

firm investment rates.

       In order to examine the non-linear effects of cash flow and voting ownership on

performance, we use both the level of ownership as well as the square of the level of

ownership. We employed other types of non-linear specifications including the piece-

wise regressions of Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988) and found qualitatively similar

results. The quadratic specification, however, allows the peak in the relation between

cash flow or voting ownership and firm performance to be identified from the data rather

than being pre-specified.



3.1. Firm Valuation

       Our valuation measure is Tobin’s Q, which has been used for this purpose in

corporate-governance studies since the work of Demsetz and Lehn (1985) and Morck,

Shleifer, and Vishny (1988). We follow Kaplan and Zingales’ (1997) method for the

computation of Q. For dual-class firms with an untraded class of stock, we assume that

the untraded shares have the same per-share price as the traded shares.6 We also compute

the median Q in each year in each of the 48 industries classified by Fama and French

6
  On average, non-traded stock makes up a small part of capital structure, so this
assumption does not have a significant quantitative impact on our results.


                                                                                      13
(1997) and classify all firms into one of these 48 industries based on their four-digit SIC

code. We then regress:



(1)                           Q’it = a + bXit + cWit + eit,



where Q’it is industry-adjusted Q (firm Q minus industry-median Q), Xit is a vector of

ownership variables (managerial cash flow ownership and cash flow ownership squared

as well as managerial voting rights ownership and voting rights ownership squared) and

Wit is a vector of firm characteristics. As elements of W, we follow Shin and Stulz (2000)

and include the log of the book value of assets and the log of firm age as of December of

year t. Morck and Yang (2001) show that S&P 500 inclusion has a positive impact on Q,

and that this impact increased during the 1990s; thus, we also include a dummy variable

for S&P 500 inclusion in W. Previous work has also argued that younger firms may have

more future growth opportunities and, hence, higher Tobin’s Q.

       We present two regression specifications in Table 5: median Fama-MacBeth and

pooled median regressions. Because the distribution of Q for our sample of firms is

heavily skewed with some outliers, we employ median regression analysis.7 Using a

variant of the methods of Fama and MacBeth (1973), we estimate annual cross-sections

of (1) with statistical significance assessed within each year (by cross-sectional standard

errors) and across all years (with the time-series standard error of the mean coefficient).

While this method allows for cross sectional correlation, it assumes no correlation in the

  We also estimated other forms of robust regression analysis and the results were
qualitatively similar to the median regression results.


                                                                                        14
time-series dimension. In Table 5, we present only the time series means and standard

errors of the coefficients.

         In addition to the Fama-MacBeth regressions, we estimate a pooled cross-section

regression. In this regression approach, the standard errors are calculated using a block

bootstrap method that treats each firm as an independent vector. It assumes cross-

sectional independence but allows for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and serial correlation.

         In the median Fama-MacBeth framework we see that total relationship between

firm value and cash flow ownership is positive and concave: the average coefficient on

cash flow ownership is positive and significant, and the coefficient on the square of cash

flow ownership is negative and significant. Taken together, the results are consistent

with the view that ownership of cash flow rights by insiders does indeed align incentives.

As the fraction of cash flow ownership increases, the incentives of management become

more closely aligned with those of outside shareholders and thus leads to better decisions

(from the outside shareholders’ perspective) and higher valuations. The positive incentive

effects of cash flow ownership, however, are decreasing at higher levels of cash flow

ownership. The declining incentive effect may be due to several factors including wealth

effects in which the incentive to work hard declines as CEOs become wealthier.

Alternatively, the increasing lack of diversification on the part of insiders at high levels

of ownership may induce them to pursue less risky strategies than outside investors

would.

         The total relationship between firm value and voting ownership is negative and

convex: the coefficient on voting ownership is negative and significant while the

coefficient on its squared term is positive and significant.      The result implies that




                                                                                         15
increases in inside ownership of votes, keeping the level of inside cash flow ownership

constant, decreases firm value at a decreasing rate.          This is consistent with an

entrenchment effect of voting ownership, i.e., the more control that the insiders have, the

more they can pursue strategies that are at the expense of outside shareholders. Our

results appear to be able to separately identify an incentive effect associated with insider

ownership of cash flow rights and an entrenchment effect associated with insider

ownership of voting rights. The median pooled regression gives qualitatively similar

results but is less statistically significant.8

        Figure 1 provides a useful benchmark for the reasonableness of these results.

From the coefficient estimates in the Fama-MacBeth regressions, we plot the total effect

of incentives (cash flow + cash flow2) and control (voting + voting2) of changes in levels

of voting and cash flow ownership by insiders on firm value. The incentive effect

reaches a maximum at around 33 percent ownership of cash flow rights while the

entrenchment effect of voting ownership reaches its maximum at around 45 percent. The

economic impact of both effects is quite large. As Figure 1 makes clear, going from the

minimum value for cash flow and incentives to its maximal effect increases Tobin’s Q by

about 15 percentage points. Voting rights ownership has an effect of similar magnitude.

Going from zero to 45 percent inside voting ownership reduces Tobin’s Q by about 25

percentage points.

        The quadratic structure of these point estimates implies that at very high levels,

voting ownership appears to be good for firm value.           One should be cautious in

interpreting this part of Figure 1. Since few firms have very high voting ownership, the

 The results from estimating this pooled regression including annual dummy variables
were also similar.


                                                                                         16
extrapolation of the total effect is less reliable at these high levels. Also, from a pure

statistical perspective, the standard error of the total effect rises with ownership. This

standard error is approximately 6 percentage points when voting ownership is 20 percent

but rises to 53 percentage points when voting ownership is 100 percent.



3.2. Operating Performance

        In this section we explore the relation between the inside ownership of cash flow

rights and voting rights and operating performance. In the previous section, we saw that

the relationship of firm value and inside cash flow ownership is positive and concave,

while the relationship of firm value and inside ownership of voting rights is negative and

convex. This section explores whether there are also any detectable effects on the firm’s

operations.

        In Table 6, we examine the firm’s net profit margin, sales growth, and return on

equity. We again employ the two estimation frameworks that were presented in the

previous section: Fama-MacBeth median regressions and pooled cross-sectional median

regressions. The dependent variable is adjusted for the median level of performance

within the firm’s industry. Industries are defined by Fama and French (1997) and we

classify all firms based on their four-digit SIC code into 48 industries. We include the

firm’s Q as an additional regressor to control for differences in the firms’ opportunity

sets.

        The results for both return on equity and net profit margin are insignificant. The

most significant results are in the sales growth regressions. There, we find exactly the

same qualitative relationship as found for Tobin’s Q: The relationship of sales growth to




                                                                                       17
cash flow ownership is positive and concave, and the relationship of sales growth to

voting ownership is negative and convex. Note that the inclusion of Q as a regressor

ensures that these results are not merely driven by the relationship of these ownership

variables with Q – this is a separate set of relationships that have the same shape.



3.3. Capital Expenditure, Research and Development, and Advertising

       The operating results suggest that the alignment of incentives through cash flow

ownership increases the willingness of managers to invest and pursue more rapid growth,

while voting ownership does the opposite. To directly test how these two effects may

affect firm investment behavior, we explore the relationship between voting and cash

flow ownership by insiders on capital expenditure and on the combination of R&D and

advertising expenditures.

       In Table 7 we examine results for the ratios of both capital expenditure to assets

and capital expenditure to sales. We again employ the median Fama-MacBeth and

pooled cross sectional regression approaches. We find that the relation between capital

expenditure and our ownership variables is consistent with those found for Q and for

sales growth: positive and concave for cash flow and negative and convex for voting.

However, only the (linear) cash flow coefficients are significant.

       Some firms may not have significant physical assets. In these firms, investment

in future business opportunities usually takes the form of research and development

activities or advertising expenditures. While the cost of these activities is typically

expensed, they are investments in “soft” assets of the firm. In Table 8, we examine the




                                                                                       18
relation between insider ownership of cash flows and voting rights and these

expenditures.

       One complicating factor for this analysis is that some firms do not report R&D or

advertising expenditures. In this case, the values will be missing. These firms also

sometimes directly indicate that these expenditures are insignificant. In both of these

cases, we set the firm’s R&D and/or advertising expenses to zero.

       The above procedure means that a large number of firms have zero for both

advertising and R&D expenditures. Therefore in Table 8 we estimate Tobit regressions

of the ratio of R&D and advertising expenses to assets (industry-adjusted) on our

ownership variables, firm size, and Q. In particular, we specify the dependent variable

(R&D plus advertising) to be truncated if it is equal to zero. Since we subsequently make

industry adjustments, our estimation procedure uses a different truncation point for each

industry.

       The results in Table 8 provide the strongest confirmation of the underinvestment

hypothesis discussed above. In both regressions, the pattern of the coefficients mirrors

those in the Q, sales growth, and capital expenditure regressions: positive and concave

for cash flow and negative and convex for voting. In the Fama-MacBeth regressions,

three out of the four key coefficients are significant.

       Taken together, the results in Table 7 and Table 8 are broadly supportive of

underinvestment by dual-class firms driving both the valuation and sales growth results

found in Tables 5 and 6. In dual-class firms, the alignment of incentives through higher

insider cash flow ownership has a positive effect on the level of investment. Control

appears to have the opposite effect, i.e., increases in control reduce capital expenditure.




                                                                                              19
4. Discussion and Conclusion

       This paper examines the relation between ownership and firm performance in

dual-class companies. Because dual-class structures allow for the separation of cash flow

and voting ownership, we can independently identify the impact of incentives and control

on firm valuation and performance. We find that cash flow ownership (incentives) has a

positive (and concave) relationship with firm valuation while voting ownership (control)

has a negative (and convex) relationship with firm value. We find the same qualitative

relationships for our ownership variables with sales growth, capital expenditure, R&D

and advertising.

       It is of course possible that these results are driven by some outside factor: e.g.,

valuation is driven by some measure of “management quality”, and management quality

in turn drives the particular form of dual-class structure adopted across firms. While

similar arguments are often made to explain the overall (single-class) relationship of

ownership to performance, we find this argument to be less compelling in the dual-class

context. In particular, it is difficult to tell a logical story that can explain the quadratic

relationships of our ownership variables with value, sales growth, capital expenditure,

R&D and advertising. The most plausible explanation is that some firms adopt dual-class

structures when their original owners are reluctant to cede control; later, these firms are

less likely to tap capital markets (so as to avoid diluting control) and thus invest less,

grow slower, and are valued lower. Our future work will model this causal chain more

formally and directly test its implications.

This table gives means and medians (in brackets beneath the mean) of several variables for
single- and dual-class firms in 2001. The mean and median of G, the Governance Index, are
calculated only for the subsamples of single and dual-class IRRC firms. This subsample
contains 1052 single-class firms and 85 dual-class firms. For the remaining variables, the
statistics are calculated for the full dual-class sample, and the single-class sample consists of
all firms in the CRSP-Compustat merged database, excluding the firms identified as dual-class.
The calculation of G is described in Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2003). Assets is the book
value of assets in millions of dollars (Compustat item 6); Debt/Assets is the ratio of long-term
debt (item 9) to assets; SP500 is a dummy variable for inclusion in the S&P 500 as of the end
of calendar year 2000; Age is firm age in years as of December 2001; Size is market value in
millions at the end of 2001, where the market value for dual-class firms with non-trading
classes is calculated using shares outstanding from proxy statements and assuming equal prices
across classes; and BM is the ratio of book value [the sum of book common equity (item 60)
and deferred taxes (item 74)] to size at the end of 2001. Significant differences for the means
are indicated at the five- and one-percent levels by * and ** respectively. The Wilcoxon rank-
sum test p-values for the medians are given in brackets in the third column.

                               Voting and Ownership Structure
Panel A of this table describes voting arrangements for the sample of dual-class firms between
1994 and 2001. It summarizes the relationship between the superior class and the inferior class
with the most votes per share of any inferior class. Panel B summarizes cashflow and voting
ownership in the dual-class firms in 2001. VTOwn is the total percentage of votes owned by
officers and directors across classes, as reported in proxy statements. CFOwn is the total
percentage of cashflow ownership by officers and directors. Rights to the firm’s cashflows are
assumed to be proportional to the ordinary dividends of that class if dividend data exists. If
dividend data does not exist or if the dividend distribution is not ordinary, cashflow rights are
assumed to be equal across classes.

                               Relationship Between Managerial Voting Ownership and Cash Flow Ownership

The table summarizes cashflow and voting ownership in the dual-class firms between 1994 and 2001. Voting Ownership is the total percentage of
votes owned by officers and directors across classes as reported in proxy statements. Cash flow ownership by officers and directors are the rights
to the firm’s cashflows assuming that they are proportional to the ordinary dividends of that class if dividend data exists. If dividend data does not
exist or if dividend distribution is not ordinary, cashflow rights are assumed to be equal across classes.

                                         Q Regressions
This table presents median regressions of industry-adjusted Tobin’s Q on ownership
variables and controls between 1994 and 2001. The first column contains the time-series
mean coefficients and standard errors from annual, median Fama-MacBeth regressions.
The second column shows the coefficients and standard errors from pooled, median
regressions. The standard errors are calculated using 5000 repetitions of a block bootstrap
that treats each firm as a block. Q is the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value
of assets: the market value is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets and the
market value of common stock less the book value of common stock and deferred taxes.
The market value of equity for dual-class firms with non-trading classes is calculated using
shares outstanding from proxy statements and assuming equal prices across classes. The
market value of equity is measured at the end of the current calendar year and the
accounting variables are measured in the current fiscal year. CFOwn and VTOwn are
defined as in Table 3, and CFOwnSq and VTOwnSq are their respective squares. Assets is
the log of the book value of assets in millions of dollars, SP500 is a dummy variable for
inclusion in the S&P 500 as of the end of the previous year, and Age is the log of firm age
measured in months as of December of each year. Industry adjustments are made by
subtracting the industry median, where medians are calculated by matching the four-digit
SIC codes from December of each year to the 48 industries designated by Fama and French
(1997). Significance at the five- and one-percent levels is indicated by * and **,
respectively.

This table contains the results of median regressions of net profit margin, sales growth, and
return on equity on lagged ownership variables and lagged Q between 1995 and 2002. Panel A
shows the time-series mean coefficients and standard errors from annual, median Fama-
MacBeth regressions. Panel B shows the coefficients and standard errors of pooled, median
regressions. The standard errors are calculated using 5000 repetitions of a block bootstrap that
treats each firm as a block. CFOwn and VTOwn are defined as in Table 3, and Q is defined as
in Table 4. Each dependent variable is net of the industry median, which is calculated by
matching the four-digit SIC codes of all firms in the CRSP-Compustat merged database in
December of each year to the 48 industries designated by Fama and French (1997).

                                    Capital Expenditure
This table contains the results of median regressions of CAPEX/assets and CAPEX/sales on
lagged ownership variables and lagged Q between 1995 and 2002. Panel A shows the time-
series mean coefficients and standard errors from annual, median Fama-MacBeth
regressions. Panel B shows the coefficients and standard errors of pooled, median
regressions. The standard errors are calculated using 5000 repetitions of a block bootstrap
that treats each firm as a block. CFOwn and VTOwn are defined as in Table 3, and Q is
defined as in Table 4. Both dependent variables are net of the industry median, which is
calculated by matching the four-digit SIC codes of all firms in the CRSP-Compustat merged
database in December of each year to the 48 industries designated by Fama and French
(1997). Significance at the five-percent and one-percent levels is indicated by * and **,
respectively.

This table presents Tobit regressions of (R&D+Advertising)/Assets on lagged ownership
variables and lagged Q between 1995 and 2002. The first column contains the time-series
mean coefficients and standard errors from annual, Tobit Fama-MacBeth regressions. The
second column shows the coefficients and standard errors from pooled, Tobit regressions.
The standard errors allow for clustering within firms. CFOwn and VTOwn are defined as in
Table 3, and Q is defined as in Table 4. The dependent variable is net of the industry
median, which is calculated by matching the four-digit SIC codes of all firms in the CRSP-
Compustat merged database in December of each year to the 48 industries designated by
