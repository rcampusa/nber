                                            ABSTRACT

We study the role of information in asset pricing models with long-run cash flow risk. When investors
can distinguish short- from long-run consumption risks (full information), the model generates a sizable
equity risk premium only if the equity term structure slopes up, contrary to the data. In general, the
short- and long-run components are unidentified. We propose a sparsity-based bounded rationality
model of long-run risk that is both parsimonious and fully identified from historical data. In contrast
to full information, the model generates a sizable market risk premium simultaneously with a downward
sloping equity term structure, as in the data.

1       Introduction

We study the role of information in asset pricing models with long-run cash ‡ow risk. The
idea that long-run cash ‡ow risk can have important a¤ects on asset prices is exempli…ed
by the work of Bansal and Yaron (2004), who show that a small but persistent common
component in the time-series processes of consumption and dividend growth is capable of
generating large risk premia and high Sharpe ratios.1
        A crucial aspect of the long-run risk theory is that the persistent component in con-
sumption growth must be small. That is, it must account for only a small fraction of its
short-run variability. If this were not the case, the model-implied annualized volatilities of
consumption and dividend growth, as well as the correlation between the two, would be
implausibly large and both series implausibly persistent. But with the persistent component
necessarily small, it is (both in theory and in empirical work) di¢ cult to detect statistically,
even in large samples. Despite this, a maintained assumption in the theoretical literature is
that investors can directly observe the persistent component and distinguish its innovations
from the more volatile transitory shocks to consumption and dividend growth. We refer to
this assumption as the full information paradigm. While this is a natural starting place and
an important case to understand, in this paper we consider an alternative speci…cation in
which market participants face a signal extraction problem: they can observe the change in
consumption and dividends each period, but they cannot observe the individual components
of that change.
        Information about long-run cash ‡ow risk is likely to be limited. Indeed, in reality the
long-run components are unobservable and the parameters of a general dynamic system for

        An extensive literature has followed this work. See Parker (2001); Parker and Julliard (2004); Colacito
and Croce (2004); Bansal, Dittmar and Kiku (2009); Hansen, Heaton and Li (2008); Kiku (2005); Malloy,
Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2009); Bansal, Dittmar and Lundblad (2005); Bansal, Kiku and Yaron
(2007); Hansen and Sargent (2006).

consumption and dividend growth that embeds these components cannot be identi…ed from
historical data using standard estimation techniques. Thus, the full information assumption
takes the amount of information investors have very seriously: market participants must not
only understand that a small predictable component in cash ‡ow growth exists, they must
also be able to decompose each period’s innovation into its component sources and have
complete knowledge of how the shocks to these sources vary and co-vary with one another,
even though the data give us no guide for identifying these components separately.
   We propose an alternative model of behavior in which a representative decision maker
optimizes based on a cash ‡ow model that is sparse in the sense that it ignores cross-
equation restrictions that are di¢ cult if not impossible to infer in …nite samples, and fully
identi…ed from historical data. We refer to this speci…cation as the bounded rationality
limited information model. The cash ‡ow model serves as a signal extraction tool, allowing
the investor to form an estimate of the long-run components in dividend and consumption
growth, given historical data.
   As an illustration of the potential importance of the information structure, we study
the implications of models with long-run consumption risk for jointly matching evidence
for a sizable equity risk premium simultaneously with a downward sloping term structure
of equity. The term structure of aggregate equity may be computed by recognizing that
an equity index claim is a portfolio of zero-coupon dividend claims (strips) with di¤erent
maturities. A downward sloping equity term structure means that expected excess returns
on strips that pay dividends in the near future are higher than that for the market index,
an average over all strips.
   We study a cash ‡ow model in which the aggregate dividend growth rate is di¤erentially
exposed to two systematic risk components driven by aggregate consumption growth, in ad-
dition to a purely idiosyncratic component uncorrelated with aggregate consumption. One
systematic risk component is a small but highly persistent (long-run) component in con-

                                              2
sumption growth as in Bansal and Yaron (2004), while the second is a transitory (short-run)
i.i.d. component with much larger variance. The purely idiosyncratic component is volatile,
as required to match the evidence that dividend growth is substantially more volatile than
consumption growth and not highly correlated with it. In addition, we follow the existing
literature on long-run risk by employing the recursive utility speci…cation developed by Ep-
stein and Zin (1989, 1991) and Weil (1989). Under standard parameterizations of the utility
function, investors have a preference for early resolution of uncertainty, implying that shocks
to the priced long-run component of cash ‡ows command large risk premia even if they are
far less volatile over short horizons than are shocks to the priced short-run component.
   We use the framework just described to study the term structure of equity. We show
that, with full information, expected excess returns on strips that pay a dividend in the far
future are higher than the market risk premium, implying an upward sloping term structure,
contrary to the historical data. Speci…cally, the full information paradigm cannot simulta-
neously generate both a high equity risk premium and a downward sloping term structure,
unless the long-run component in dividend growth is a source of insurance, rather than risk.
Insurance means that innovations in the long-run component (holding other shocks …xed)
generate positive covariance between the pricing kernel and returns, so that the long-run
component generates a negative risk premium. In a long-run insurance model, more than
100% of the equity premium must be attributable to short-run consumption risk, and under
reasonable parameterizations of the magnitude of this risk, the equity premium is small and
the level of the term structure too low. We use approximate analytical solutions to the
model to show that this is result is quite general. By contrast, under the bounded rational-
ity limited information model, the equity risk premium can be sizable while the equity term
structure slopes down even if, under full information, the long-run component in dividend
growth would be a source of risk, rather than insurance.
   The intuition for this result is as follows. When investors with a preference for early

                                              3
resolution of uncertainty can observe the long-run component in cash ‡ows–in which a small
shock today has a large impact on long-run growth rates–the long-run is correctly inferred
to be more risky than the short-run, implying that long maturity equity strips must in
equilibrium command high risk premia. By contrast, short maturity strips command low
risk premia because they depend on exposure to the short-run consumption shock, which
does not generate as large a risk premium as the long-run shock under standard calibrations.2
       Under the bounded rationality limited information model proposed here, the opposite can
occur because the decision maker’s estimate of the long-run component in dividend growth
will be “contaminated” by shocks to the i.i.d. components in consumption and dividend
growth (including the idiosyncratic component), which cannot be distinguished from shocks
to the persistent components. Shocks to the short-run component in consumption growth
generate high risk premia on short maturity strips, both because the exposure of dividend
growth to the short-run consumption shock contributes positively to the risk premium on
the one-period strip even under full information, and because the decision maker erroneously
revises upward her estimate of the long-run component in consumption and dividend growth
in response to short-run (i.i.d.) shocks. This latter e¤ect makes short-run shocks appear more
risky under the bounded rationality limited information model than under full information,
leading to higher risk premia on short maturity strips under the former than the latter.
       On the other hand, long maturity strips have low risk premia under the bounded ratio-
nality limited information model because shocks to the persistent component in consumption
growth (which drive the persistent component in dividend growth) are too small to be distin-
guished from the large idiosyncratic dividend shocks. Dividend growth as a whole appears
close to i.i.d. and shocks to the long-run component are close to being unpriced under the
   2
       In Section 4 we consider general calibrations of the full information model, including non-standard ones.
Greater exposure to short-run risk can raise the premium on the one-period strip, but longer maturity strips
will have lower risk premia only if the model is one of long-run insurance rather than long-run risk.

bounded rationality limited information model, even though they command substantial risk
premia under full information. The end result is that long maturity strips have low risk
premia under the bounded rationality limited information model, while they have high risk
premia under full information.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses related literature
discussed here, as well as the empirical evidence for a downward sloping equity term structure.
Section 3 presents the asset pricing model, the model for cash ‡ows, and the information
assumptions. Section 4 presents the theoretical results on the equity premium, level and
slope of the term structure, beginning with approximate log-linear analytical solutions to
the full and bounded rationality limited information models. We then move on to illustrate
the role of the information structure in driving equilibrium outcomes. Section 5 concludes
the paper.


2   Related Literature

A growing body of literature documents evidence that the term structure of the stock market
is downward sloping (e.g., van Binsbergen, Brandt and Koijen (2010), Ang and Ulrich (2011),
van Binsbergen, Hueskes, Koijen and Vrugt (2012), and Boguth, Carlson, Fisher and Simutin
(2011)). As mentioned, a downward sloping equity term structure means that risk premia
on strips that pay a dividend in the near future are higher than that for the market index,
an average over all strips. The magnitude of these negatives spreads found in the data is
substantial. These …ndings are consistent with those showing that short duration individual
stocks that make up the equity index have higher expected returns than long duration
individual stocks (Cornell (1999, 2000); Dechow, Sloan and Soliman (2004); Da (2005); van
Binsbergen et al. (2010)).
    A number of recent papers address issues related to those studied here. Hansen and Sar-

gent (2006), also concerned about the agent’s ability to observe the long-run risk component
in aggregate cash ‡ows, study these models in a robust control framework but do not study
implications for the equity term structure.
       Our paper is related to a recent literature that seeks to reconcile the cross-sectional
properties of equity returns simultaneously with the cash ‡ow duration properties of value
and growth assets (Lettau and Wachter (2007) and Lettau and Wachter (2009)).3 None of
these studies investigate the role of the information structure on asset prices, a focus of this
paper.
       Finally, our work builds on an earlier literature that studies the e¤ect of information
quality and learning on asset prices. Since the cash-‡ow speci…cations in our model can be
represented by linear Gaussian state space models, the …ltering problem our agents solve is
a special case of Bayesian updating used in many learning models, such as Veronesi (2000),
Li (2005), Ai (2010), and Johannes, Lochstoer and Mou (2013). All of these models consider
learning about the cash-‡ow or production process, but they di¤er in their modeling of
preferences and/or technologies and/or the speci…c variables about which agents learn. In
fact, Veronesi (2000), Li (2005), and Ai (2010) are special cases of our model.4 None of these
papers focus on the implications of learning for the term structure of equity, the goal of this

       Two other papers study duration indirectly. Lustig and Van Nieuwerburgh (2006) study a model with
heterogenous agents and housing collateral constraints and …nd that conditional expected excess returns are
hump-shaped in their measure of duration. Zhang (2005) shows that, when adjustment costs are asymmetric
and the price of risk varies over time, growth assets can be less risky than assets in place (value stocks),
consistent with the cash ‡ow and return properties of value and growth assets. But the Zhang model does
not account for the …nding of Fama and French (1992) that value stocks do not have higher CAPM betas
than growth stocks.

     Veronesi (2000) and Li (2005) study endowment economies with constant relative risk-aversion utility (a
special case of our recursive preferences), while Ai (2010) and Johannes et al. (2013) study economies where
agent’s have recursive preferences, but with consumption equal to dividends (a special case of our model
where consumption and dividend growth are imperfectly correlated).

    Although not modeled explicitly as such, we can think of our information friction about
the consumption process as the result of limited information about deeper variables of the
economy. Examples include Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2010), where the persistent com-
ponent of consumption growth arises from consumption smoothing, or Croce (2014), where
there is a persistent component in the growth of TFP. In both studies, the primitive shock is
a technology shock and limited information could arise about the technology process itself,
which could be subject to shocks with di¤erent degrees of persistence in either the …rst or
second moments.

Consider a representative agent who maximizes utility de…ned over aggregate consumption.
To model utility, we use the more ‡exible version of the power utility model developed by
Epstein and Zin (1989, 1991) and Weil (1989), also employed by other researchers who study
the importance of long-run risks in cash ‡ows (Bansal and Yaron (2004), Hansen et al. (2008)
and Malloy et al. (2009)).

3.1    The Cash Flow Model

Equities are modeled as claims to the aggregate dividend stream. We are interested in a
model for equity cash ‡ows that allows dividend growth rates to be potentially exposed to
both transitory and persistent sources of consumption risk, as well as to purely idiosyncratic
shocks that command no risk premium. We use lower case letters denote log variables,
e.g., log (Ct )   ct . Denote the conditional means of the log di¤erence in consumption
and dividends as xc;t and xd;t ; respectively. Consider a general system of equations for log
consumption, ct , and log dividends, dt , taking the form



                           ct+1 =        c   + xc;t + "c;t+1                                       (4)

where   i;j   denotes the correlation coe¢ cient between the shocks "i and "j .
   We use the term short-run “SR”risk to refer to the i.i.d. consumption shock, and long-
run “LR”risk to refer to the persistent conditional mean xc;t . This “long-run”terminology
is used in the literature because even small innovations in xc;t ; if su¢ ciently persistent, will
have large a¤ects on cash ‡ows in the long-run, resulting in high risk premia when investors
prefer early resolution of uncertainty. The model of Bansal and Yaron (2004) is a special case
of the system (4)-(8) in which consumption and dividend growth contain a single, common
predictable component:

                                dt+1 =            d + xd;t +                  c    "c;t+1 +       d   "d;t+1                            (10)

This special case imposes the parameter restrictions                                          d   =    ;    xd   =   x xc ;   "xd;t = "xc;t ;
xc;0 = xd;0 = 0,    xc;xd   = 1; and    c;d   =       c;xc   =       c;xd         =    d;xc   =   d;xd     = 0. The Bansal and Yaron
(2004) speci…cation also sets          c   = 0 so that dividend growth is not exposed to short-run
consumption risk.


                                                                     9
      The representative agent in the Bansal and Yaron (2004) is assumed to have the power to
observe both the conditional means xc;t and xd;t as well as all the parameters of the cash ‡ow
process (4)-(8). These assumptions imply that the agent takes the cash ‡ow model (9)-(13)
as given, if the true data-generating process embeds the appropriate parameter restrictions.
We refer to this assumption as full information (“FI” for short). In reality, the variables
xc;t and xd;t are unobservable and the parameters of the general system (4)-(8) cannot be
identi…ed from historical data using standard estimation techniques (see below). We de…ne
limited information as a state of the world in which this reality holds for the decision maker
in the model: investors cannot directly observe the latent variables xc;t and xd;t and they do
not know, nor can they identify from data, the parameters of the data generating cash ‡ow
process.


3.2     Limited Information

We assume that investors in a limited information state of the world can observe all historical
data, even asset price information. Because asset prices are endogenous outcomes conditional
on the information in cash ‡ows, asset price data are redundant once the information in
historical consumption and dividend data has been taken into account. Therefore adding
asset return data to the information set that includes consumption and dividend data leads
to the same equilibrium allocations as the model where the information set includes only the
history consumption and dividend data.
      Armed with historical data on dividends and consumption, how could one estimate the
parameters of the system together with estimates of the latent variables xc;t and xd;t ? A
standard approach would be to write the dynamic system (4)-(8) in state space form and
apply Maximum Likelihood estimation simultaneously with the Kalman …lter to estimate
both the latent state variables xc;t and xd;t and the parameters of the general dynamic
system (4)-(8). Without further restrictions on the parameter space, however, the system

                                              10
(4)-(8) is unidenti…ed. That is, more than one set of parameter values can give rise to the
same value of the likelihood function and the data give no guide for choosing among these.
        To see why note that, given historical data and knowledge of the system (4)-(8), an
investor with limited information can estimate the Wold representation for this system,
which will exist as long as                    ct+1 and        dt+1 follow covariance-stationary processes. For
arbitrary parameter values (limiting to stationarity of the data), the dynamic system (4)-(7)
has a Wold representation that is a …rst-order vector autoregressive-moving average process,
or V ARM A (1; 1):

The parameters ,                  d;   bcc ,:::, bdd and as well as those in the variance-covariance matrix
of vc;t+1 and vd;t+1 are functions of the deep parameters of the cash ‡ow system (4)-(8).
The system (4)-(8) has 15 unknown parameters (including six unknown parameters in                                         ).
Estimation of (14) identi…es 11 parameters (including three from the covariance matrix of
the VARMA innovations), four short of what’s needed for identi…cation.5 That is, given an
in…nite sample of data on consumption and dividend growth, the parameters of the dynamic
system (4)-(8) can only be observed in certain combinations as the estimates ,                             d;   bcc ,:::, bdd
and the variance-covariance matrix of vc;t+1 and vd;t+1 , and this information is not enough
to separately identify the deep parameters of (4)-(8).
        As we demonstrate in the last section of the paper, under common parameterizations
of the long-run risk cash-‡ow process, a limited information VARMA model generates an
equity term structure slope that is very similar to the full information case, counterfactually
    5
        One could restrict    d;c      and   d;xc   to zero to account for the fact that one shock to dividends captures
purely idiosyncratic risk. In this case, the full system is underidenti…ed by two parameters rather than four.



                                                                   11
implying that it slopes up. Quite di¤erent implications for the term structure can be gener-
ated, however, if the o¤-diagonal elements of the b matrix are presumed to be zero, so that
the system (14) collapses to a pair of …rst-order univariate autoregressive moving average
(ARMA(1,1)) processes, each with 4 free parameters:

                                                                   A               A
                              ct+1 =      c   (1   )+        ct + vc;t+1       bc vc;t                     (15)
                                                                       A              A
                             dt+1 =       d   (1   d)   +    d   dt + vd;t+1      bd vd;t :                (16)

Under parameter values typically employed in the long-run risk literature, the o¤-diagonal
elements bcd and bdc are in fact close to zero and impossible to distinguish from zero with
statistical tests, both in samples of the size currently available as well as in samples consid-
erably larger.6 In the data, consumption and dividend growth are only modestly correlated,
and dividend growth is considerably more volatile (Table 1). Typical parameterizations of
long-run risk models are calibrated to match these facts, so the idiosyncratic component
of dividend growth is speci…ed as highly volatile. This is the primary reason why the o¤-
diagonal elements of b are so small in benchmark long-run risk models.


3.2.1       A Bounded Rationality Limited Information Model

With these implications of long-run risk models in mind, we propose a bounded rationality
model of behavior in which the decision maker considers a simpli…ed representation of (14)
that is “sparse” in the sense that the small and di¢ cult to infer o¤-diagonal elements of

       This statement is con…rmed by Monte Carlo experiments. Speci…cally, under the benchmark calibration
in column 3 of Table 1 (discussed below), the population (large sample) values for bcd and bdc 0.004 and
-0.038, respectively. In …nite samples, there is a signi…cant downward bias in bcd but the standard errors are
large: the average (across 1000 arti…cial samples of size equal to that of our historical dataset) maximum
likelihood point estimates (standard errors) for bcd and bdc are 0.005 (0.004) and -0.126 (0.111), respectively.




                                                        12
the b matrix are set to zero.7 Even if the true data generating process implies small but
non-zero values for the o¤-diagonal elements of the b matrix, this sparsity is nevertheless
optimal in a forecasting sense, as explained below.
       In the present context, it is the o¤-diagonal elements of the b matrix where the natural
sparsity arises, since these values will necessarily be very small with standard error bands
that include zero. We assume that the decision maker sets those elements to zero and
estimates two univariate ARMA(1,1) speci…cations, one each for consumption and dividend
growth. The ARMA parameters are functions of the primitive parameters of the dynamic
                                 A          A
system (4)-(7). The innovations vc;t+1 and vd;t+1 are in general correlated and are composites
of the underlying innovations in (4)-(7). We refer to this model of behavior as the bounded
rationality limited information model hereafter (“BRLI” for short), to emphasize that this
speci…cation embeds both a change in the information structure and a behavioral assumption,
vis-a-vis the full information model.8
       One way to interpret this restriction on the b matrix is to recognize that movements in
consumption growth comprise too small a part of the volatility of dividends (given the noise
created by the large idiosyncratic component) to be informative, so the tiny contemporaneous
                                           V        V
correlation between the VARMA innovations vc;t and vd;t is e¤ectively ignored by setting the
o¤-diagonal parameters to zero.
       This model of behavior may be motivated by statistical considerations. Given the small
   7
       Di¤erent forms of sparsity-based bounded rationality models have been proposed in the literature. See,
for example, Gabaix (2011).
   8
     Anderson, Hansen and Sargent (1998) study risk premia for a claim to aggregate consumption in an
asset pricing model where the true data generating process for consumption growth follows an ARM A(1; 1).
We note that if the true data generating process were an ARM A(1; 1), the limited and full information
speci…cations in our paper would coincide. As we explain below, this case, can match the evidence for
a downward sloping term structure only if ‡uctuations in expected consumption growth are a source of
insurance rather than risk.

(and poorly identi…ed) values of the o¤-diagonal elements of the b matrix, forecasts of con-
sumption and dividend growth are actually improved by using the more parsimonious ARMA
processes in place of an estimated VARMA speci…cation. This is true in samples as large or
even considerably larger than that currently available.9 The reason is that estimation of the
VARMA requires 11 unknown parameters to be identi…ed, compared to just 4 unknown para-
meters in each individual ARMA estimation. The estimation of these additional parameters
creates su¢ cient noise so as render the VARMA statistically inferior as a forecasting model
for      ct+1 and     dt+1 , and therefore inferior as a model for estimating the latent conditional
means xc;t and xd;t :10

former is the optimal sequence when the data are generated by (4)-(8) but the agent uses
the two ARMA processes (15) and (16) as a cash-‡ow model, while the latter is the optimal

    Notice that, in the limited information models considered here, there is no learning or
Bayesian updating on the parameters, although there is learning about the latent conditional
means of consumption and dividend growth based on the noisy information from the cash-
‡ow model. The parameters in the general system (4)-(8) are unidenti…ed, so even with
an in…nite amount of data the parameters of the true data generating process can never be
learned. This contrasts with much of the learning literature, e.g., Veronesi (2000), Li (2005),
and Ai (2010), where these papers entertain the possibility that agent’s have some additional
information–a signal–about dividends, consumption, or some component of output that can
be used to learn about parameters.12
    The cash ‡ow model (15)-(16) serves as a signal extraction tool, allowing the investor to
form an estimate of the long-run components in dividend and consumption growth, given
historical data. This is immediately evident by noting that the pair of ARM A(1; 1) processes
may be equivalently expressed in terms of the following pair of innovations representations

Under the re…ned calibration, with = 1, this ratio has an analytical solution. See Croce (2007).

    Johannes et al. (2013) show that learning about parameters can generate predictability of excess returns.
The model considered here has no scope for generating time-varying risk premia. Adding time-varying con-
sumption volatility to the model could in principle generate predictable variation in excess stock returns,
e.g., (Bansal and Yaron (2004)). Even with a very highly persistent stochastic volatility process for con-
sumption growth, however, long-run-risk models without parameter learning generate tiny magnitudes of
forecastability in returns (see Bansal, Kiku and Yaron (2012), Ludvigson (2012)).

are non-linear functions of the primitive shocks in (8). The innovations representations
above contain the same information about the latent variables xc;t and xd;t as do the ARMA
processes (15) and (16).


3.3    Model Solution

Under full information, solutions to the model’s equilibrium price-consumption and price-
dividend ratios are found by iterating on the Euler equations (1) and (2), assuming that
individuals observe the consumption and dividend processes. This means that under the
special case (9)-(11), investors know that xd;t =               x xc;t ,   thus the solution delivers a policy
function for the price-consumption and price-dividend ratios as a function of a single state
variable xc;t .

                                                       16
         Under the BRLI model, equilibrium price-consumption and price-dividend ratios are
found by iterating on the Euler equations (1) and (2) assuming market participants observe
(15)-(16), even though the data are actually generated by the dynamic system (4)-(8) with
distinct short- and long-run components. In this case, the policy function for the price-
                                                             bA
consumption ratio is a function of the single state variable x c;t , while that for the price-

                                                    bA
dividend ratio is a function of two state variables x         bA
                                                      c;t and x d;t . For each speci…cation,

we simulate histories for consumption and dividend growth from the true data generating
process and use solutions to the policy functions to generate equilibrium paths for asset
prices.13 The process is iterated forward to obtain simulated histories for asset returns. The
Web Appendix explains how we solve for these functional equations numerically on a grid of
values for the state variables.


4        Theoretical Results

This section presents theoretical results on the level and term structure of equity for both
the full and BRLI models discussed above. We begin by illustrating the general nature of the
challenge posed by evidence on the equity term structure for the full information paradigm,
by considering the role played by key model parameter values. This can be accomplished by
examining an approximate log-linear solution of the model, similar to Campbell (2003). We
do this in Section 4.2, after introducing the concept of zero-coupon equity in Section 4.1. We
then move on to show how assumptions about behavior and information structure matter,
using numerical solutions.
    13
         A minor complication is that the policy functions for the limited information speci…cations are a function
of the current innovations in (15) and (16), whereas the actual innovations are generated from (9)-(11).
However, the moving average representations are invertible, and their innovations can be recovered from
P i                               P i
  i bc ( ct i   ct i 1    c ) and  i bd ( dt i      dt i 1     d ), respectively.

4.1   Zero-Coupon Equity

An equity claim can be represented as a portfolio of zero-coupon dividend claims with di¤er-
                              (n)
ent maturities (strips). Let Pt       denote the price of an asset at time t that pays the aggregate
                                             (n)
dividend n periods from now, and let Rt               be the one-period return on a zero-coupon equity
strip that pays the aggregate dividend in n periods:
                                                              (n 1)

Zero-coupon equity claims are priced under no-arbitrage according to the following Euler
equation:

Denote the log return on the n-period strip rt+1 = ln Rt+1 . Plotting E rt+1                     rf;t+1

the aggregate market is the claim to all future dividends, the market price-dividend ratio

over all strips. We denote the log excess return on the market index as rd;t+1          rd;t+1   rf;t+1 .


4.2   Analytical Solutions

In this section we examine an approximate log-linear solution of the full and BRLI models
to illustrate the role of key parameters in determining both the level and slope of the equity
term structure.

4.2.1       Full Information

Two parameters in (4)-(8) play an important play role in determining whether risk premia
are increasing or decreasing with maturity. These are the parameter                                                 xc;xd   that gives the
correlation between the long-run innovations "xc;t and "xd;t , and the parameter                                                   c;xc   that
gives correlation between the short- and long-run consumption shocks "c;t and "xc;t . For this
reason, we free up restrictions embedded in (9)-(13) by allowing the parameter                                                    xc;xd   6= 1
and      c;xc   6= 0. We also allow the short-run consumption shock "c;t+1 to be correlated with
                                                                                                                                     14

parameter         x   is de…ned   x       xd = xc ,   consistent with the de…nition of                              x   in (9)-(13).
       We derive approximate log-linear solutions for the spread of the term structure and
the equity market risk premium. Let Vt ( ) denote the conditional variance of the generic
argument “ ”. De…ne the spread, S, of the log equity term structure (adjusted for a Jensen’s
inequality term) as

                                          (n)ex               (n)ex                (1)ex              (1)ex

where the superscript “ex” denotes the excess return over the log risk-free rate. S gives
the di¤erence in expected excess return between equity that pays a dividend in the in…nite
future and equity that pays a dividend in one period. From the loglinear approximation to
the full information model, S can be shown to equal

       To avoid clutter in the formulas, we maintain, as a benchmark, other restrictions imposed in (9)-(13) on
the remaining correlations. Speci…cally we set             d;xd   =    d;xc   =     c;d    = 0: Freeing up these correlations does
not change the conclusions of this section.


                                                                  19
   The parameter     x   controls the exposure of dividend growth to the persistent component
in consumption growth. The exposure of dividend growth to long-run consumption risk
a¤ects the slope of the term structure because it a¤ects expected future dividend growth.
Equation (22) shows that, the lower is       x,   the less persistent is dividend growth and the
less upward sloping is the term structure. This happens because, when dividend growth has
little persistence, only the expected growth rates of dividends paid in the near future are
revised signi…cantly in response to an innovation; those paid in the far future are relatively
una¤ected. Thus a lower exposure of dividend growth to long-run consumption risk raises
risk premia on short maturity strips relative to those on long maturity strips, driving down
S. This e¤ect must be multiplied by the correlation        xc;xd ,   since that controls the extent to
which a movement in expected dividend growth is correlated with the pricing kernel, and
therefore priced.
   The EIS      a¤ects the slope of the term structure by a¤ecting expected future returns,
rather than expected future dividend growth. The lower is              , the more the expected risk-
free rate increases in response to an increase in expected consumption growth. A positive
innovation in expected consumption growth does two things. First, it leads to an increase
in the expected future risk-free rate (increasingly so with smaller values of             ), which is
associated with a capital loss for the asset today. Second, it leads to a decline in the stochastic
discount factor. The two combined produce a positive contemporaneous correlation between
the pricing kernel and returns, reducing the overall risk premium on the asset. This e¤ect
is stronger for assets that pay a dividend in the far future because shocks to expected
consumption growth are persistent and cumulate over time. Consequently, the lower is the
EIS   , the lower are risk premia on long-duration assets relative to short-duration assets,
and the less upward sloping is the zero-coupon-equity curve.
   For the rest of this discussion, we maintain the assumption that               > 1= . If we also
assume for the moment that      c;xc   0, then the term in the square brackets of (22) is positive,

                                                  20
and it is possible to generate a downward sloping term structure of equity (a negative spread,
S < 0) by setting             x xc;xd   < 1= .     In the Bansal and Yaron (2004) parametrization,

 xc;xd   = 1, so a downward slope could be generated by simply changing parameter values so
that     x   < 1= .15
       Under full information, however, this strategy for obtaining a downward sloping term
structure presents a di¤erent problem. When                  x xc;xd   < 1= , equivalently with S < 0, the
model becomes one of long-run insurance rather than long-run risk. That is, innovations in
xd;t (holding other shocks …xed) generate a positive correlation between the pricing kernel
and returns, so that the marginal contribution of the long-run component to the market risk
premium is negative. In a long-run “insurance” model, the full information term structure
slopes down, but the overall equity premium for the market will be low or negative. This can
be con…rmed by examining the loglinear approximate solution for the log equity premium
(adjusted for Jensen’s inequality terms), given by
                                                    h                   i                    (1           )

                                                                                             1            d

                              > 0 and the …rst term on the right-hand-side is excess return on the
one-period zero coupon equity strip. It is evident that if the spread S of the equity term
structure is negative, the equity premium on the left-hand-side will be small or negative,
depending on the size of the risk premium on the one-period strip. But the size of the
premium on the one-period strip–and therefore the level of the term structure–depends only
on the dividend claim’s exposure to short-run consumption risk:
                          h                   i                   1=

  15
       When      = 1, the valuation calculations in Hansen et al. (2008) can be used to obtain an exact solution
for S. Under the assumptions just made, such calculations show analogously that                   x       < 1 is required to
generate a downward sloping equity term structure.



                                                        21
Long-run consumption risk xc;t contributes to the premium on the one-period strip, but only
in so far as it has a non-zero correlation with short-run risk               c;xc   6= 0. The one-period strip
will have a zero risk premium in any model where exposure                c   to short-run consumption risk
is zero.
   These facts imply that to generate S < 0 under full information, shocks to the long-run
component of dividend growth must be a source of insurance so that long-run consumption
shocks generate a negative risk premium. This can be seen by re-writing the market risk
premium as a function of the covariance between the log stochastic discount factor, mt+1 ,
and the log excess return on the dividend claim:

       Et rd;t+1 + :5Vt (rd;t+1 )        Covt rd;t+1 ; mt+1                                                            (25)

The term in (26) is the component of the total risk premium attributable to short-run
consumption risk. This term always generates a positive risk premium as long as                                    c   > 0
because the short-run shock "c;t+1 is negatively correlated with mt+1 . The term in (27) is the
component of the total risk premium attributable to long-run consumption risk. This term
can, under some plausible parameters, contribute a negative risk premium, implying that the
long-run shock is a source of insurance. This term will generate a negative risk premium if                              x

and    are su¢ ciently small because, with "xd;t+1 and "xc;t+1 both negatively correlated with

mt+1 ; su¢ ciently low values for   x   and   imply Covt          x "xd;t+1             "xc;t+1 ; mt+1 > 0 so the
second term in (26) is negative. (Note that the outer multiplicative term                         1
                                                                                                      d

Under these parameter values, the impact of a long-run risk shock on expected dividend
growth is more than o¤set by the countervailing e¤ect on the expected risk-free rate, and
long-run shocks to consumption growth are a source of insurance, rather than risk.
   But the question of whether shocks to consumption growth are a source of insurance

                                                  22
rather than risk boils down to the question of whether S is positive or negative:

                     d   (1        )              d                                           1
                                       S=                     xc   Covt     x "xd;t+1             "xc;t+1 ; mt+1 :
                     1         d             1            d

                                                                                    1
This shows that S < 0 only when Covt                                x "xd;t+1           "xc;t+1 ; mt+1 > 0, where long-run
consumption risk generates positive covariance with the log pricing kernel and a negative
risk premium.
   What about             xc;xd ?      Equation (22) shows that we can make the spread S negative by
lowering   xc;xd :   But, (23) makes clear that S < 0 in this model comes at the expense of
a lower equity premium. Moreover this problem cannot be remedied by freely setting the
correlation   cxc        between short-run consumption shocks "c;t and long-run shocks "xc;t . For
example, if we restrict                x xc;xd   > 1=         to avoid the implications just discussed, then (22)
shows that we can obtain a downward sloping term structure by setting                                            cxc   < 0. But (23)
and (24) show that this will again make the overall equity premium low or negative, since it
makes both S and the …rst term of (24) negative.
   In summary, the full information paradigm can generate a negative equity term structure
spread S, but only if the model is one of long-run insurance rather than long-run risk.
Since in this case the persistent component of consumption growth generates a negative risk
premium, the overall market risk premium will typically be small or negative. We explore
the magnitudes of these e¤ects for speci…c parameter values below.

In the BRLI model, there is one source of risk, captured by the ARMA innovation vc;t . The

rium,       vcA ;vdA   is the correlation between the two ARMA innovations vcA and vdA , and                            vcA   and
                                                                                A
 vdA   are their respective standard deviations. Thus                           x     is the coe¢ cient from a projection of
bA
x        bA
  d;t on x c;t and is therefore a measure of the exposure of the estimated long-run component

in dividend growth to the estimated long-run consumption component (See the Appendix for
                                  A
a derivation). The                x   coe¢ cient plays the analogous role to                x xc;xd     in (22), which measures
the exposure of dividend growth to the persistent component in consumption growth under
full information.
       In the BRLI model, this exposure is not observed and what is observed–the history of
dividend growth                dt+1 –is but a noisy signal of the long-run component, xd;t . The estimate
                          bA
of the long-run component x d;t is contaminated by the two i.i.d. shocks that a¤ect                                           dt+1
through the terms                 c   "c;t+1 +   d   "d;t+1 in (5). The more volatile are these shocks relative
to xd;t , the lower is the information content of observable dividend growth for movements in
the long-run dividend component xd;t . The idiosyncratic shock "d;t+1 is especially important
here, since it is the most volatile. The higher is                              d,    the less correlated dividend growth
appears to be with consumption growth and the lower is                                      vcA ;vdA   in (28). A low value for
                         A
 vcA ;vdA   lowers       x,   making dividends appear to have little exposure to long-run consumption
risk, and lowering S. Thus shocks to the long-run risk component of dividends are close to
being unpriced in the BRLI model, even though they command a substantial risk premium
under full information. For this reason, long maturity strips have low risk premia in the
BRLI model, generating a low or negative value for S.
       Turning our attention to the level of the term structure, we prove in the Appendix that




                                                                  24

The term in square brackets, which is positive under common parameter con…gurations, is
the price of consumption risk in the BRLI model, and CovtA is the quantity of that risk.
     It is instructive to compare (29) with its counterpart under full information (24). There
are two ways in which these equations substantively di¤er. First, the quantity of risk CovtA
in (29) di¤ers conceptually from the true covariance between the short-run components
                                                   2
Cov ( "c;t ;               c   "c;t ) =       c        that appears in (24). But it is straightforward to show that, un-
der a range of parameter values around the benchmark, CovtA is virtually indistinguishable
                     2
from             c       . To see why, recall that CovtA is not appreciably a¤ected by shocks to the long-run
component of dividend growth "xd;t+1 in (7) because those shocks are too small to be detected
given the larger short-run shocks "c;t+1 in (5). And covtA is not greatly a¤ected by the idio-
syncratic dividend shocks because those shocks are uncorrelated with consumption. Thus,
CovtA                Cov ( "c;t ;         c   "c;t ) =      c
                                                                2
                                                                    implying that the quantity of short-run consumption risk
is virtually identical in the BRLI and LI models. In both cases, it increases monotonically
in      c.

     By contrast, the price of short-run consumption risk is a¤ected by the information struc-
ture. The price of risk (in square brackets) di¤ers across these models in the terms that
govern the perceived standard deviation of the long-run consumption component (relative
to the standard deviation of the short-run component), scaled by the perceived correla-
tion between the short- and long-run consumption shocks. In the full information for-
                                                                                                2
mula, (24), this term is                               xc c;xc ,    where recall that           xc   = V art (xc;t+1 ) = 2 : In (29), the
term             xc c;xc       is replaced by the Kalman gain parameter KcA : Note that this parameter, like

 xc ,   controls the relative volatility of the estimated long-run consumption risk component:

 KcA                     bA
                 = V art x c;t =

model than under full information. This happens because, as we show in the next section,
the BRLI decision maker cannot distinguish the short-and long-run components. As a con-
                                                                                bA

sumption innovation, thereby making x c;t look more volatile (relative to short-run risk) than

is the true xc;t+1 observable under full information. For this reason, short-run consumption
shocks generate a larger negative covariance between the pricing kernel and returns under
the BRLI model than under full information, for any given quantity of risk. This feature
of the model generates higher risk premia on short maturity strips under the BRLI model
than under full information. In the web Appendix we prove that, up to the parameter
 A      P D =D
 d     1+P D =D
                  (now a function of the equilibrium P D =D ratio under the BRLI model), the
approximate solution (23) for the market risk premium in full information also holds under
the BRLI model:

                                                                                            S       (30)

But since Et rt+1 + :5Vt rt+1     will, under plausible parameter con…gurations, be greater
under the BRLI model than under full information, (30) shows that, all else equal, the market
risk premium will also be higher under the BRLI model than under full information.
     We close this section by noting that the full information long-run risk paradigm cannot
generate both a non-trivial downward sloping term structure and sizable equity premium
even if the true cash ‡ow process is a pair of ARM A (1; 1) processes. As we show in the
appendix, in this case the only parameterizations of the cash ‡ow process for which this

                                                   26
is possible are those in which the model is one of long-run insurance, where the persistent
component of consumption growth reduces the equity premium, rather than increases it.
This is not true of the BRLI model, in which the true cash ‡ow process still implies that
the persistent component of consumption growth would contribute positively to the equity
premium if the agent could observe it. It is only because the agent con‡ates the sources
of cash-‡ow variation, coupled with the bounded rationality behavioral assumption, that
the term structure can be downward sloping along with a sizable equity premium. In the
next section we employ numerical solutions to explore the magnitudes of these e¤ects under
plausible parameter values.


4.3        Numerical Solutions

4.3.1           Benchmark Parameter Values

We begin by presenting theoretical results based on a benchmark calibration, and then ask
how those results change as we change key parameters. To form a benchmark, we take a
special case of the general cash ‡ow model (4)-(8) that is close to what has been used in
the long-run risk literature. In this special case, as in (9)-(13), consumption and dividend
growth contain a single, common predictable component xd;t =                                            x xc;t   implying           xc;xd   =1
and        xd    =     x xc :     Also,       d   =     ; xc;0 = xd;0 = 0, and except for                     xc;xd ,   the o¤-diagonal
elements in (8) are all zero. The benchmark calibration of (4)-(8) with parameters set
at monthly frequency is as follows:                                 = 10;      = 1:5;         = 0:998985;          c    =    d   = 0:0015,
  = 0:979,             = 0:0078,          x   = 1;       c   = 4;    xc   = 0:044,   xd   =    x xc ,     d   = 4:5;        xc;xd   = 1 and

 c;d   =        c;xc   =   c;xd   =   d;xc    =       d;xd   = 0. With the exception of            x    and       c,    these values are
the same as those in the benchmark speci…cation of Bansal and Yaron (2004). Notice that
the innovation variance in xc;t is small relative to the overall volatility of consumption (the
standard deviation of "xc is 0.044 times the standard deviation of "c ), but the persistence of



                                                                          27
xc;t is high, a hallmark of long-run risk models. In Bansal and Yaron (2004), the loadings

 x   and   c   are set to 3 and 0, respectively; we instead set the benchmark loadings                       x   and   c

to 1 and 4, respectively. These loadings require more discussion.
     The parameters              x   and       c   are crucial determinants of the slope and level of the equity
term structure, since they govern the exposure of dividends long-run versus short-run con-
sumption risk. Although Bansal and Yaron (2004) set the exposure to short-run risk to zero
(implying       c   = 0), we have seen in (24) that this parametrization implies, counterfactually,
that the one-period zero coupon equity strip has no risk premium. Exposure to short-run
consumption risk is necessary for the model to match evidence for a non-zero (and sizable)
risk premium on the one-period strip. Since the one-period strip is estimated to have a risk
premium as much as 5 to 7 percent per annum higher than the market index itself, as a
benchmark we set             c   = 4. Table 1 compares the statistical properties of the implied cash
‡ow processes under the original Bansal and Yaron (2004) calibration with                          c   = 0 (column 1)
with this alternative where                c       = 4 and all other parameters are unchanged (column 2). Al-
though     c   = 4 is needed to help match the evidence for a sizable premium on the one-period
strip, if no other parameter values are changed, column (2) shows that dividend growth is
then too autocorrelated and too highly correlated with consumption growth. For this reason,
in our benchmark, we lower exposure of dividend growth to long-run risk by setting                                x   =1
rather than         x   = 3, largely restoring the model’s favorable cash ‡ow properties for the joint
behavior of dividend and consumption growth (column (3)). Since                           xd   =   x xc ,   under this
benchmark calibration                 xd   =       xc :   Column 4 of Table 1 shows the cash ‡ow properties of a
“re…ned”calibration that will be discussed below.
     It is instructive to begin by comparing the full information and BRLI models with re-
gard to how the cash ‡ow state variables react to primitive shocks under the benchmark
calibration. Figure 1 compares the full and BRLI cases by plotting the impulse responses
to primitive shocks (in percent deviations from steady state). The responses plotted are for

increase in the i.i.d. consumption shock, "c;t ; the second row displays the responses to a
one-standard deviation increase in the idiosyncratic dividend shock, "d;t ; and the third row
displays responses to a one-standard deviation increase in the innovation to the persistent
component of consumption growth, "xc;t . In the …gures, we denote all variables under full
information without hats, while variables in the BRLI model are denoted with hats.
   Figure 1 shows that a one-standard deviation increase in the i.i.d. consumption shock "c;t
leads to a sharp, unexpected increase in dividend growth in both the FI and BRLI models
(row 1, column 3). With full information, the agent observes the source of the shock and
understands that it has no persistence. Accordingly, expectations of future consumption
growth and future dividend growth are unchanged, so the impulse responses of xc;t and
xd;t are ‡at at zero. By contrast, in the BRLI model agents cannot directly observe the
source of the shock and do not know if it is persistent or transitory. The solution to their
…ltering problem implies that agents erroneously revise upward their expectation of future
consumption growth and, to a lesser extent, future dividend growth, even though in reality
                                         bA
the shock has no persistence. Thus, both x         bA
                                           c;t and x d;t rise. In response to a transitory shock,

agents in the BRLI model revise their expectations of future consumption and dividend
growth more than they would under full information.
   Now consider the responses to an innovation in the persistent component of consumption,
"cx;t , in the third row of Figure 1. Under full information, investors recognize that this is a
shock to the persistent component of consumption and dividend growth and they accordingly
revise upward their expectations of future consumption and dividend growth immediately
upon observing the shock. Row 3 of Figure 1 shows that a one-standard deviation increase in
"cx;t leads to a jump upward in xc;t and xd;t : By contrast, investors in the BRLI model revise

                                               29
upward their expectation of future consumption and dividend growth only gradually and by
                                                                   bA
much less than they do under full information. The state variable, x c;t responds sluggishly

                 bA
to the shock and x d;t barely responds at all. This happens because the persistent component

in consumption growth (which drives the persistent component in dividend growth) is too
small to be distinguished from the large idiosyncratic dividend shocks. In response to a
persistent shock, agents in the BRLI model revise their expectations of future consumption
and dividend growth less than they would under full information.
       Finally, the middle row of Figure 1 shows that a purely idiosyncratic shock to dividend
growth, "d;t , has no a¤ect on expected consumption or dividend growth in full information,
and has only a tiny a¤ect on expected dividend growth in the BRLI model. This i.i.d.
shock is the most volatile component of dividend growth and in the BRLI model it swamps
everything, making dividend growth appear close to i.i.d. We return to these responses to
interpret why risk premia di¤er depending on the information structure.
       To illustrate how risk premia depend on the information structure, it is useful to compare
economies with di¤erent aggregate dividend processes. Speci…cally, we study how risk premia
di¤er across information speci…cations when the relative exposure of dividend growth to long-
run versus short-run consumption risk di¤ers. This is accomplished by comparing how the
loadings governing long-run and short-run risk exposure e¤ect equilibrium outcomes.
       Table 2 presents the model’s implications for summary statistics on the price-dividend
ratio, excess returns, and risk-free rate under limited and full information. The model
output is generated by simulating 1000 samples of size 840 months, computing annual returns
from monthly data, reporting the average statistics across the 1000 simulations.16 With the

       The average levels of the price-dividend ratios reported below are not directly comparable to their
empirical counterparts for actual …rms, since unlike real …rms, the …rms in the model have no debt and do
not retain earnings. Dividends in the model are more analogous to free cash ‡ow than to actual dividends,
implying that model price-dividend ratios should be lower than measured price-dividend ratios in historical

exception of the parameters           c   and      x   (where results for a range of values are presented), the
results in Table 2 are based on the benchmark parameter con…guration discussed above.17
The log return on the dividend claim is denoted rd;t+1 = ln (Rd;t+1 ) and the log return on
the risk-free rate rf;t+1        ln Rf;t+1 .
     The results in Table 2 show that, with full information, high exposure to long-run con-
sumption risk is required to generate high risk premia. Economies comprised of assets with
relatively low exposure         x   to long-run consumption risk and high exposure                   c   to short-run
consumption risk (e.g., row 2 of Table 2), have lower risk premia and higher price-dividend
ratios than do economies comprised of assets with higher                   x   and lower   c   (e.g., row 5 of Table
2). In addition, substantial variation in risk premia can only be generated by heterogeneity
in the exposure to long-run consumption risk; heterogeneity in short-run risk is inadequate.
For example, when         x   = 3 and       c   is increased from 2.5 to 6, the log risk premium E (rd               rf )
increases by just one and a third percent, from 7.33% to 9.66% per annum. By contrast if
we keep    c   = 2:5 and increase          x    from 1 to 3, the risk premium rises almost three-fold, from
2.73% to 7.33%.
     The results under the proposed bounded rationality limited information model of behavior
are much the opposite. Economies comprised of assets with relatively low exposure to long-
run consumption risk and high exposure to short-run consumption risk, (e.g., row 2 of Table
2), now have high risk premia and low price-dividend ratios. Under this parametrization,
the log risk premium E (rd            rf ) is over 8 percent per annum in the BRLI model, while it is
a smaller 5.24 percent per annum under full information. At the same time, assets with high

 x   and low    c   (e.g., row 5 of Table 2), have a log risk premium that is a much smaller 4.9%
data.
  17
     The table reports values for    c    ranging from a low of 2.5 to a high of 6. Smaller values for      c   are ruled
out in the BRLI model by the requirement that the price-dividend ratio be …nite. This is analogous to
the requirement in the Gordon growth model that the expected stock return be greater than the expected
dividend growth rate to keep the price-dividend ratio …nite.

per annum whereas the premium under full information is 7.3% per annum. And, unlike
full information, in the BRLI model substantial variation in risk premia can be generated
by heterogeneity in the exposure to short-run consumption risk. For example, when                     x   =3
and      c   is increased from 2.5 to 6, the log risk premium increases by over 5 percentage points
from 4.91% to 10.73% per annum. On the other hand, …xing                    c   and varying    x   generates
much less variation in risk premia in the BRLI model.
       These …ndings can be illuminated graphically as in Figure 2, which plots annualized price-
dividend ratio policy functions as a function of the ratio of long-run to short-run consumption
risk exposure,        x= c:   For this …gure, the ratio    x= c   is varied along the horizontal axis in

                                                      bA
the price-dividend ratio at the steady state value of x d;t , along with plus and minus two

                                           bA

                                             d;t (holding …xed x c;t at its steady-state level).

The right-most panel plots the price-dividend ratio under full information as a function of

 x= c;       plus and minus two standard deviations around steady state in the single state variable
xc;t : Note that the plots in Figure 2 are upward sloping in the BRLI model but downward
sloping under full information. Since price-dividend ratios are high when risk premia are
low, and vice versa, this shows that assets with cash ‡ows that load heavily on the long-run
component, xc;t ; are more risky under full information but less risky in the BRLI model.
       These results can be understood intuitively by noting that the risk premium on these
assets is determined primarily by the covariance between the pricing kernel Mt and revisions
in expectations (news) about future cash ‡ow growth.18 As such, cash ‡ow shocks have two
  18
       Revisions in expected future returns are relatively unimportant because we have not introduced mecha-
nisms such as changing consumption and dividend volatility for generating time-varying risk premia on the



                                                      32
o¤setting e¤ects on the equity premium in the BRLI model as compared to full information.
First, when a positive innovation "xc;t+1 to the persistent component of consumption growth
occurs, investors using the BRLI cash ‡ow model assign some weight to the possibility that
the change in observed cash ‡ow growth rates is attributable to one of the i.i.d shocks
("c;t+1 or "d;t+1 ). As a consequence, these investors revise upward their expectation of future
consumption and dividend growth in response to a persistent shock by less than they would
if they had full information. Persistent shocks therefore generate a larger (in absolute value)
negative correlation between Mt and cash ‡ow news under full information than in the BRLI
model. Second, when a positive innovation "c;t to the short-run risk component occurs,
investors using the BRLI cash ‡ow model assign some weight to the possibility that the shock
is persistent (coming from the long-run risk component). As a consequence, these investors
revise upward their expectation of future consumption and dividend growth in response to
an i.i.d. consumption growth shock more than they would if they had full information. The
i.i.d. shocks therefore generate a larger (in absolute value) negative correlation between Mt
and cash ‡ow news in the BRLI model than in the FI model.
    When      x   is large and       c   relatively small, the …rst e¤ect dominates the second. In this case,
the risk premium in the full information case can be substantial while the premium in the
bounded rationality limited information case is small. On the other hand, when                        x   is small
and    c   relatively large, the second e¤ect dominates. In this case, the risk premium bounded
rationality limited information case can be substantial while that under full information is
                                                                                      A
small. Note that when            c   is small, volatility in the ARMA dividend shock vd;t+1 is dominated
by the volatile idiosyncratic cash ‡ow shocks "d;t+1 that carry no risk premium. This explains
why su¢ ciently high exposure to short-run risk                 c   is required to generate a large risk premium
in the BRLI model. These results help explain the di¤ering implications for the slope and
level of the equity term structure, discussed next.
asset, and because the expected risk-free rate has small volatility.

4.3.2   The Term Structure of Equity

We now turn to the equity term structure. Figure 3 plots summary statistics for expected log
                   (n)
excess returns E rt+1    rf;t+1 as a function of maturity, n, in months, directly comparing
the FI and BRLI models using the benchmark calibration. It is immediately evident that,
under full information, the annualized log risk premium increases with maturity (top panel).
The log risk premium is 1:3% per annum for equity that pays a dividend one month from
now and 2:3% per annum for equity that pays a dividend 15 years from now.
   Keeping the same parameter values but imposing the bounded-rationality limited infor-
mation assumptions, we see that the slope of the term structure is reversed. The annualized
log risk premium now declines with maturity. At the benchmark parameter values the spread
is modest (a point we return to below), with the log risk premium for equity that pays a div-
idend one month from now equal to 5.5% per annum compared to 4.5% for equity that pays
a dividend 15 years from now (top panel). Nevertheless, short-horizon strips have higher
expected returns and lower price-dividend ratios than do long-horizon strips and the term
structure slopes down.
   The key to the downward sloping term structure in the BRLI model is that the process
for dividend growth given by the estimated ARMA cash ‡ow model appears close to i.i.d.
(the estimated moving average and autoregressive roots in (16) are close to canceling). Thus,
surprises to dividend growth are perceived only to a¤ect dividend growth and returns in the
near term, so only assets that pay a dividend in the near future command high risk premia.
By contrast, when agents can directly observe xc;t , it is understood that innovations to this
component can have large, long-term e¤ects on consumption and dividend growth. Accord-
ingly, the long-run appears risky, and assets that pay a dividend in the far future command
higher risk premia than those that pay a dividend in the near future. The endogenous
relation between equity maturity and risk premia goes the wrong way.

       The middle panel of Figure 3 shows that in both models, volatility increases with the
horizon. But the bottom panels show that the Sharpe ratios decrease with the horizon under
the BRLI model whereas they rise with the horizon under full information. This suggests
that the BRLI speci…cation is better able to explain the empirically higher Sharpe ratios
of short-duration value stocks as compared to long-horizon growth stocks (Cornell (1999,
2000); Dechow et al. (2004); Da (2005)).
       Figure 4 shows that, in the BRLI model, short maturity strips have high CAPM alphas,
whereas the long maturity strips have smaller (in absolute value) negative alphas. This
feature of the model is consistent with the data and with the prior …ndings of Fama and
French (1992). The bottom panel also shows that, in the BRLI model, long maturity strips—
despite their lower expected excess returns— have slightly higher CAPM betas. This also is
consistent with the evidence in Cornell (1999, 2000); Dechow et al. (2004); Da (2005); van
Binsbergen et al. (2010). By contrast, under full information there is much less variation
in the alphas with maturity and the alphas of short maturity strips are lower than those of
long maturity strips.19


Alternative parameterizations: Full Information We have seen that the full informa-
tion model generates an upward sloping term structure under the benchmark parametriza-
tion. Accordingly, assets that pay a dividend in the far future counterfactually command
higher risk premia than those that pay a dividend in the near future. Here we explore the
sensitivity of this result to alternative parameter values.
       Figure 5 illustrates graphically the role di¤erent parameters play in determining both the
equity term structure spread S and the total equity premium under full information. Panel

       The plots are reminiscent of Hansen et al. (2008). Hansen et. al. report price-dividend zero-coupon
equity structures for value and growth …rms separately, whereas we plot the zero-coupon-equity curve for
aggregate dividends. In this sense, the results in this section are not directly comparable to those in Hansen
et al. (2008).

(a) illustrates the role of       x,   by showing the results when this parameter is altered and all
others are kept at their benchmark values. When                   x    = 1; as in the benchmark, the term
structure slopes up and the log equity premium is 3.82% per annum. When we shut down
the exposure of dividend growth to long-run risk entirely, setting                     x   = 0; the term structure
now slopes down, S < 0, but the log risk premium is only 0.9% per annum. We can make
S more negative by making exposure to long-run risk negative, e.g.,                         x   =   0:5, but now the
equity premium is negative, equal to -0.96%.
     Panel (b) of Figure 5 illustrates the role of the correlation between the long-run compo-
nents in consumption and dividend growth "xd;t+1 and "xc;t+1 by altering only                         xc;xd   and keep-
ing all other parameters …xed at their benchmark values. Under the benchmark                                  xc;xd   = 1,
the term structure slopes up and the log equity premium is 3.82% per annum. Panel b shows
that we can make the spread S negative by lowering                    xc;xd :   When   xc;xd    = 0:5, the spread is
slightly negative but almost ‡at. When               xc;xd   = 0, we get a more sizable negative spread,
but now the log risk-premium is low, equal to 0.88% per annum. An empirically plausible
value for S would require a steeply negative risk-premium.
     The full information speci…cation can produce a sizable equity premium with S < 0 if
exposure of dividend growth to short-run risk is su¢ ciently high, while exposure to long-run
shocks su¢ ciently low. This is displayed in Panel (c) of Figure 5, where we …x                               x   = 0, so
as to completely eliminate the exposure of dividend growth to long-run shocks, and vary
exposure to short-run shocks            c   (all other parameters remain at their benchmark levels.) If

 c   = 4, we get a modest downward spread S =                    2% with a small log equity premium of
0.9% per annum. We can increase the log of the market risk premium to 2.42% by increasing

 c   to 6. Notice however that, whenever S < 0; there is no more long-run risk, only long-run
insurance, so more than 100% of the equity premium must be accounted for by short-run
risk. For example, when       c   = 6; the total equity premium is 2.42% but the part attributable
to short-run risk is greater than this, equal to 4.38%.

                                                        36
     Finally, panel (d) of Figure 5 shows that these challenges cannot be addressed by freely
setting the correlation            c;xc   between short-run consumption shocks "c;t and long-run shocks
"xc;t . Even when       c;xc   =     1, the term structure is essentially ‡at while the log risk premium
on the market is -2.11%.


Alternative Parameterizations: The BRLI Model Figure 6 shows the role of key
parameters in determining the slope and level of the term structure in the BRLI model.
Panel (a) shows the crucial role of               d;   the standard deviation of idiosyncratic dividend shocks,
                                              A                                         A
in determining the parameter                  x   in (28). Recall that                  x    is a measure of the exposure of
                                    bA
estimated expected dividend growth, x                                                 bA
                                      d;t , to estimated expected consumption growth, x c;t , as

measured by the coe¢ cient from a projection of the former onto the latter. The panel plots
 A
 x   as a function of        d,   for various values of            c.   Also plotted in this panel is the value of             x,

which by de…nition doesn’t vary with                    d   but governs the true exposure to of dividend growth
                                                                                                 A
to long-run consumption risk. The higher is                             d   the lower is         x.   This represents a crucial
di¤erence with full information: the size of the volatility of the idiosyncratic component in
dividend growth has no e¤ect on the agent’s perception of how exposed dividend growth
is to long-run consumption risk under full information (axiomatically since the agent can
distinguish the shocks), whereas it can have a large e¤ect in the BRLI model. Panel a also
                                                   A
shows that while        c   plays a role in        x   for small values of               d   (with lower values of   c   implying
         A
lower    x ),   in the empirically plausible region of                           d   > 3, the exposure of dividend growth
to short-run consumption shocks is too small relative to the idiosyncratic dividend shocks
                                      A
to have a large e¤ect on              x    and therefore only the volatility                     d    of the idiosyncratic shock
                 A                                                              A
matters for      x.   The bigger is          d,   the smaller is                x.

     Panel (b) of Figure 6 shows that a higher                              d   translates into a lower slope S. Under a
range of plausible parameter values for                     d,   the slope S of the term structure is negative. Be-
cause the large idiosyncratic shocks to dividend growth cannot be distinguished from either


                                                                  37
of the other two shocks that drive consumption growth, dividend growth appears close to
i.i.d. and shocks to the long-run component of dividend growth are virtually undetectable.
Since long-run consumption shocks are undetectable, they are not priced and long maturity
strips have lower risk premia than short maturity strips, leading S to be negative. Note
that for this result, it is crucial that agents do not use information on consumption growth
when modeling the dynamics of dividend growth. If they did, it would be possible to observe
whether a given movement in dividend growth is correlated with consumption growth and
therefore to distinguish idiosyncratic shocks from systematic ones. Since the i.i.d. idiosyn-
cratic component of dividend growth would then be correctly identi…ed as uncorrelated with
consumption growth, it would no longer contaminate the decision maker’s estimates of the
systematic components of dividend growth that do command a risk premium. Under stan-
dard calibrations, the sum of the two systematic components is not close to i.i.d., instead
displaying persistence (the moving average and autoregressive roots no longer almost cancel
as in the case where all three components are con‡ated). Long-run shocks would e¤ectively
be priced, leading S to be positive. To summarize, it is the large value of           d,   coupled with the
bounded rationality behavioral assumption that leads agents to use a univariate speci…cation
for dividend growth that generates a negative term structure slope in this model. This result
is exhibited below when we compare the implications of the limited information VARMA
model–where consumption data are used in a system with dividend data–with those of the
BRLI ARMA model.
   Panel (c) of Figure 6 shows the impact of         c   on the level of the term structure under
                                        (1)ex
the BRLI model: This panel plots Et [rt+1 ] as a function of           c,   for various values of    d.   For
                                (1)ex
comparison, it also plots Et [rt+1 ] as a function of       c   under full information. Two points
bear noting. First,   d   has virtually no a¤ect on the risk premium of the one-period strip
(the three lines corresponding to di¤erent values of            d   lie on top of one another). The
idiosyncratic shock creates no correlation with consumption so it generates no premium for

                                                38
strips of any maturity. Second, both the FI and BRLI models imply that the risk premium
on the one-period strip is increasing in the exposure              c   of dividend growth to short-run
consumption risk. The premium in the BRLI model is, however, more steeply increasing
in    c.   This occurs for the reasons explained in the discussion of equation (29):         c   controls
the quantity of short-run risk in both models but short-run shocks have a higher e¤ective
price of risk in the BRLI model than in the FI model. This result implies not only that
premia on one-period strips are higher under the BRLI model than under full information,
it also implies that the market risk premium can be much higher–see (30). This can be seen
in Panel (d) of Figure 6, which shows that the market risk-premium in the BRLI model is
sharply increasing in      c;   and sizable (e.g., greater than 5% per annum) at plausible values
for    c   such as the benchmark value of        c   = 4. This contrasts with Panel (c) of Figure 5,
which shows that even with          c   = 6; the full information paradigm generates a risk-premium
of just 2.4% when other parameters are set so that S is at most modestly negative (and the
model is one of long-run insurance).
      Finally, we turn to the magnitude of the zero coupon equity spread. Under the benchmark
parameter values used for Figure 3, the absolute value of the spread in risk premia between
short and long maturity equity in the BRLI model, while negative, is small, roughly 1% per
annum. Figure 7 (left panel) reproduces the zero-coupon equity curve for this benchmark
case and reports the log equity premium of 5.4%. Figure 7 also shows that, with a re…ned
calibration, our limited information model of behavior is able to generate a much more
negative S, while maintaining the sizable market risk premium. Figure 7 plots the term
structure for the calibration given in column (4) of Table 1. This alternative calibration
changes the benchmark values by reducing                   from 1.5. to 1, reducing     from 0.78% to
0.76%, increasing        from 0.979 to 0.984 and increasing            xc   from 4.40% to 4.84%. With
these changes, the summary statistics for dividend growth are plausible, and within range
of those recorded for the benchmark case and for the data, as can be seen from Table 1,

                                                      39
column (d). But Figure 7 shows that the equity term spread is now much more negative
(S =    3:4%) with the log equity premium at 5% per annum (Figure 7). By comparison,
under full information this re…ned calibration generates a spread S = 0, while the market
risk premium is 2.8%.
    We close this section by showing, in the right panel of Figure 7, the term structures under
the VARMA limited information model, with the same two parameterizations. Under either
parameterization, the slope of the term structure under the VARMA limited information
speci…cation is very close to that under full information. As explained above, this occurs
because the use of consumption data in a system with dividend data allows the agent to
distinguish idiosyncratic shocks from systematic shocks. The i.i.d. idiosyncratic component
of dividend growth no longer contaminates the two systematic components, while the latter
no longer look close to i.i.d. once combined. Long-run shocks are now e¤ectively priced,
leading S to be positive. Thus, the slope under VARMA limited information is either
upward sloping or ‡at for these parameterizations, and the only di¤erence between this case
and full information is that the equity premium is slightly higher under VARMA limited
information.


5   Conclusion

A recent strand of asset pricing literature emphasizes the potential role of long-run con-
sumption risk for explaining salient asset pricing phenomena. A maintained assumption in
the existing theoretical literature is that investors can directly observe the small long-run
component of consumption risk and can distinguish its innovations from transitory shocks to
consumption and dividend growth, even though in general these components cannot be iden-
ti…ed from historical data. In this paper we study how equilibrium asset prices are a¤ected
if decision makers in the model must use consumption and dividend data to infer small long-



                                              40
run components in cash ‡ows and consumption. We propose a model of behavior in which
a representative decision maker optimizes based on a cash ‡ow model that is both sparse
in the sense that it ignores cross-equation restrictions that are di¢ cult if not impossible to
infer in …nite samples, and fully identi…ed from historical data.
   A key result of the present study is that, under many parameter con…gurations, the
bounded rationality limited information model studied here causes market participants to
demand a higher premium for engaging in risky assets than would be the case under full
information and rational expectations. Speci…cally, assets that have small exposure to long-
run consumption risk but are highly exposed to short-run, even i.i.d., consumption risk can
command high risk premia in the bounded rationality limited information case but not under
full information. Thus the term structure of equity can be downward sloping in the former
case, as in the data, but is upward sloping under full information.
   In general, these patterns mean that the bounded rationality limited information speci-
…cations we explore are better able than their full information counterparts to reconcile the
return properties of zero-coupon equity strips with those of the market index, an average
across all strips. In a full information world, long maturity strips can be made less risky
than short maturity strips only if the long-run component in consumption growth is a source
of insurance rather than risk, implying that the long-run component generates a negative
market risk premium. By contrast, the bounded rationality limited information framework
we consider here matches empirical evidence for a downward sloping equity term structure
simultaneously with a sizable equity market risk premium.

Notes - This table reports consumption and dividend growth statistics from four monthly
calibrations with alternate parameter configurations given in the top portion of the table.
Benchmark parameter values are in column (3) Ψ = 1.5, γ = 10, δ = 0.999, µc = µd =
.15%, ρc = ρd = 0.979, σ = .78%, σxc = 4.4%, σd = 4.5, φx = 1.0, σxd = φx σxc , φc = 4,
ρ xc ,xd = 1, ρc,xc = ρc,d = ρd,xc = ρd,xd = ρc,xd = 0. For other columns, deviations from this
benchmark are reported in the top portion of the table. The calibration in column (1) and
the statistics under “Data”are from Bansal and Yaron (2004). The entries for the cash-flow
models are obtained by repetitions of small-sample simulations. Simulated monthly data
are time aggregated to annual data, as in Bansal and Yaron (2004).

Notes - This table reports financial statistics of the model with full information (FI) and
limited information ARMA(1,1)-based signal extraction (BRLI), for varying degrees of
exposure to the long-run and short-run risk components, governed by φx and φc , re-
spectively. All
               other parameters
                                  are set as in the benchmark calibration–see notes Table
1. E rd − r f and E r f denote the annual average of the equity excess return and the
risk-free rate, respectively.
                             The standard deviation of the annual equity excess return is
denoted by σ rd − r f . E ( P/D ) is the annual price-dividend ratio.

Notes - The figure shows the 40-month impulse response of variables to a one-standard deviation innovation in the shock
labeled at each row. The vertical axis represents monthly percent deviations of variables from steady state. Variables
denoted with “hat” correspond to those from the BRLI model and are based on ARMA(1,1) estimations for consumption
and dividend growth. Variables without a “hat” are from the full information (FI) benchmark. The responses are based
on the benchmark monthly calibration: µc = µd = .15%, ρc = ρd = 0.979, σ = .78%, σxc = 4.4%, σd = 4.5, φx = 1.0,

Notes - This figure displays price-dividend ratios at steady state, and plus/minus two
standard deviations of the state variables(s) around steady state, as a function of the rel-
ative exposure to long-run risk, governed by φx , and to short-run risk, governed by φc .
Held fixed is the 2-year variance of dividend growth attributable to the consumption in-
novations. All parameters other than φx and φc are set at benchmark values given in notes
to Table 1. The BRLI case refers to the ARMA(1,1)-based signal extraction procedure.

Notes - This figure shows annualized real risk-premia on zero-coupon equity, E[rt+1 − r f ,t+1 ], as a function of maturity n
under Full Information (FI). The data generating process is described by the system of equations (9)–(13) and is assumed
to be known under FI. In each panel we vary the parameter indicated and keep all the others unchanged at benchmark
values given in notes to Table 1. In Panel A, we vary the exposure of dividends to long-run risk, φx , and assume ρ xcxd =
corr ( xd,t , xc,t ) = 1. In Panel B, we allow the correlation between consumption and dividends long-run components, ρ xcxd ,
to be less than perfect. In Panel C, we assume that dividends have no exposure to consumption long run-risk, φx = 0,
and run sensitivity analysis with respect to the dividends exposure to short-run consumption shocks, φc . We also report
the portion of market risk-premium attributable to short-run (i.i.d.) consumption risk, ec,t+1 . In Panel D, we study the
relevance of the correlation of short- and long-run news, ρcxc = corrt ( xc,t+1 , ec,t+1 ).

Notes - The data generating process is described by the system of equations (9)–(13) and is as-
sumed to be known under full information (FI). All parameters are set at benchmark values given
in notes to Table 1. In Panel A, we vary both the exposure of dividends to short-run consump-
tion shocks, φc , and the volatility of dividends-specific shocks, σd . We compare the true dividends
long-run risk exposure, φx , with its counterpart, φxA , computed under the BRLI case (see equations
(17)–(20) and (29)). In panel B, we depict the term structure slope, S = E[r∞ − r1 ], for the same
parameters chosen in Panel A to show the direct correspondence between S and φx (φxA ) in the FI
(BRLI) case. Panel B shows that σd is the key determinant of the term structure slope. In Panel C
and D, we show the intercept, E[r1ex ], and the value-weighted average level of the term structure
(i.e., the aggregate equity premium, E[rdex ]), respectively. Panels C and D show that under BRLI
the level of the term structure is primarily determined by φc .

Notes - This figure shows annualized real risk-premia on zero-coupon equity,                                                                               E [ r t +1   − r f ,t ], as a function of maturity n.
E[rdex ], E[r f ,t ], and S denote the aggregate equity risk premium, the average risk-free rate, and the equity term structure
spread, respectively. The true data generating process is given by the system of equations (9)–(13). In Panel A, equilibrium
asset prices are obtained using an ARMA-based signal extraction procedure (BRLI), defined by the system of equations
(17)–(20). In Panel B, asset prices are computed using the VARMA-based signal extraction procedure described in equation
(14). In both panels, the “Benchmark calibration” is given in the notes to Table 1. The “Refined calibration” refers to the
calibration in column (4) of Table 1, and it features a slightly lower IES and a more persistent long-run risk process.
