                                          ABSTRACT

We evaluate the Reggio Approach using non-experimental data on individuals from the cities of
Reggio Emilia, Parma and Padova belonging to one of five age cohorts: ages 50, 40, 30, 18, and 6
as of 2012. The treated were exposed to municipally offered infant-toddler (ages 0-3) and
preschool (ages 3-6) programs. The control group either did not receive formal childcare or were
exposed to programs offered by the state or religious systems. We exploit the city-cohort
structure of the data to estimate treatment effects using three strategies: difference-in-differences,
matching, and matched-difference-in-differences. Most positive and significant effects are
generated from comparisons of the treated with individuals who did not receive formal childcare.
Relative to not receiving formal care, the Reggio Approach significantly boosts outcomes related
to employment, socio-emotional skills, high school graduation, election participation, and
obesity. Comparisons with individuals exposed to alternative forms of childcare do not yield
strong patterns of positive and significant effects. This suggests that differences between the
Reggio Approach and other alternatives are not sufficiently large to result in significant
differences in outcomes. This interpretation is supported by our survey, which documents
increasing similarities in the administrative and pedagogical practices of childcare systems in the
three cities over time.

1        Introduction
The Reggio Approach is a birth to age-6 early childhood program implemented in Reggio Emilia,
Italy starting in the early 1960s. It is based on a vision of the child as an individual with rights
and potential. It has been a source of inspiration for hundreds of early childhood centers around
              1                                                                         2
the world.        Reggio Approach schools have been awarded numerous prizes.                Despite its widespread
recognition, the Reggio Approach has never been formally evaluated and there is no rigorous em-
pirical evidence of its eects on children's life-cycle outcomes.
        This paper presents an evaluation of the Reggio Approach using non-experimental comparison
groups constructed from data on individuals from ve dierent age cohorts (three cohorts of adults,
one cohort of adolescents, and one cohort of children in their rst year of elementary school)
in three dierent cities:       Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova.            Although Parma and Padova are
geographically close to Reggio Emilia and similar in economic and demographic characteristics,
they have somewhat dierent preschool systems as described below.                    At issue is whether or not
these dierences are consequential.            Children in each city are exposed to one of four dierent
early childhood experiences: municipal, state, religious, or none. The Reggio Approach is delivered
through the municipal early childhood schools of Reggio Emilia. Our evaluation strategy consists of
comparing the outcomes of those who attended municipal institutions in Reggio Emilia (treatment
group) to control groups who experienced other preschool types (including no preschool) either in
Reggio Emilia or in Parma and Padova.
        Our evaluation of the Reggio Approach faces several challenges. First, the non-experimental
nature of the data raises concerns about bias from self-selection of individuals into dierent early
childhood programs.          We employ a number of econometric techniques in an attempt to control
for potential selection problems.          Second, other high-quality childcare programs are available in
northern Italy that enroll many youth. In the mid-20th century, northern Italy witnessed a rise
in local early childhood programs many of which were inuenced by Loris Malaguzzi as well as
other respected early childhood experts (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Develop-
ment, 2001). This rise in quality of childcare alternatives was accompanied by an increase in the
preschool attendance rate of Italian children aged 3-6 years from 50% in the 1960s to 96% in the
1990s (Hohnerlein, 2015). The common inuences across regions in our control group pose serious
problems for any analysis based on comparison groups across cities in the region. The evidence of
common preschool practices currently in place in northern Italy is consistent with two interpreta-
tions: (i) that a common inuence was at work across towns; or (ii) that the Reggio Approach was
unique, but its essential elements diused rapidly across towns and alternative schools within the
same towns. Malaguzzi was active in promoting high-quality preschool throughout northern Italy.
        In this paper, we compare individuals who attended the Reggio Approach with those who
attended other center-based programs within Reggio Emilia and in our comparison cities. These
estimates capture the benets of attending the Reggio Approach relative to other center-based
programs.         They are generally small and statistically insignicant.         However, when we compare
individuals who attended Reggio Approach schools with those who did not attend any center-based
program, we nd benecial eects.
        In contextualizing our ndings, it is essential to understand the heterogeneity in early childhood
approaches across school types, cities, and cohorts.               Towards this end, Section 2 presents key
ndings from an extensive review of the literature as well as results from a survey we conducted

to quantify dierences in administrative and pedagogical components among the dierent school
types in the three cities. The survey allows us to track the evolution of dierences in approaches
to early childhood education across cities and across school-types within cities. Results from our
survey show that non-Reggio Approach schools have historically shared many of the same features
with Reggio Approach schools, and that the commonalities of these features increase over time
(across cohorts). Given the overlaps in these features, it is reasonable to expect that comparisons
of outcomes for Reggio Approach attendees with outcomes for those who attended alternative
programs produce small, possibly negligible, treatment eects.
        Results dier across age cohorts and with respect to the control group used. With the exception
of some socio-emotional outcomes, we do not nd any consistently statistically signicant positive
eects of the Reggio Approach on children and adolescents. Our most favorable comparisons are
for the age-40 adult cohort when we compare Reggio Approach individuals with those from Reggio
Emilia who did not attend preschool.               Positive and statistically signicant eects are estimated
for employment, socio-emotional skills, and voting behavior. We do not reject the hypothesis that
attending Reggio Approach preschools improved outcomes relative to not attending preschool.
        However, when we compare outcomes for Reggio Approach attendees with those who attended
alternative preschools within the city, few statistically signicant eects are found. If any appear,
they are found for the oldest cohorts.               The lack of positive and statistically signicant results
remains when we make comparisons with those who attended any type of programs in other cities,
                         3
especially Padova.           We do not reject the hypothesis that attending Reggio Approach preschools
did not improve outcomes relative to attending other regional preschools. When we compare any
preschool attendance versus no attendance for each town, we nd results as strong as or stronger
                             4
than Reggio Emilia.              We reach similar conclusions for infant-toddler centers, but the data are
much more sparse.
        The rest of the paper is organized in the following way. Section 2 describes the Reggio Ap-
proach. We discuss childcare programs in our three comparison group cities drawing from historical
records and a survey we constructed and administered to ocials across the dierent areas. Section
3 describes the research design, including the selection of cities, the survey data collection, and the
questionnaires. Section 4 presents the methods used to estimate the Reggio Approach treatment
eects. Section 5 presents our estimates. Section 6 discusses the results in the context of historical
information on dierent childcare programs.



2        Early Childhood Programs in Northern Italy
Our study compares individuals who experienced the Reggio Approach with those who participated
in other northern Italian early childhood programs, as well as some who were not enrolled in any
formal program. In this section, we discuss the Reggio Approach and explore the extent to which
other early childhood programs in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova share common features with
the Reggio Approach.



2.1       Municipal Early Childhood Schools of Reggio Emilia: The Reggio Approach

Of the municipal systems in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova, the Reggio Approach is notable
for its investment in stang, early inclusion of children with disabilities, and high rates of provision

    3
        This is consistent with historical information about the lower availability of alternative preschools at this time
and the unavailability of the municipal system in Padova before the age-30 cohorts.

of early childhood services. Of the three cities, Reggio Emilia was the rst to develop a municipal
early childhood system. It funds and manages the largest number of municipal infant-toddler and
                    5
preschool sites.
       In 1963, Reggio Emilia constructed its rst municipal preschool for children aged 3-6 years; by
1975, the municipality oered 19 preschools (Hohnerlein, 2009). In 1965, the municipality legislated
funding for infant-toddler centers for children aged 3 to 36 months. The rst early childcare site
opened in 1971, and another 10 were added by 1979 (Cagliari et al., 2016). The municipal early
childhood system in Reggio Emilia thus preceded Italy's key educational reforms of 1968 and 1971
                                                                                                      6
which legislated free state preschools and local provision of infant-toddler childcare.
       The Reggio Approach is a form of progressive early childhood education shaped by Loris
Malaguzzi, a psychologist and educator inuenced by Dewey's model of progressive education,
Vygotsky, and the psychological theories of Piaget, Erikson, Bronfenbrenner, and Bruner (Rinaldi,
2006; Cagliari et al., 2016). Malaguzzi was also inspired by Bruno Ciari, who implemented Dewey's
model in Bologna. Together, Ciari and Malaguzzi are credited with inciting a municipal school
revolution in Italy by emphasizing learning, democratic participation, and social activism in early
childhood, as an alternative to the welfare model and religious programming then oered by the
Catholic Church (Lazzari, 2012; Cagliari et al., 2016).
       Under Malaguzzi's direction, in 1972, Reggio Emilia ocially adopted Regulations for Munic-
ipal Schools that claried the municipality's values for early childhood education, roles of parents
and community members in municipal school management, stang, professional development, en-
rollment priorities, and environmental features of preschools and infant-toddler centers (Giaroni,
                                                                                7
1972). These regulations incorporate many of Ciari's innovations.
       From its inception, the engagement of families and the community was embedded in Reggio
Approach practices. For example, parents and community members participate in school manage-
ment to shape policies. Parents volunteer in classrooms and community members host eld trips
in the city (Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), 2016; Cagliari et al., 2016).
To accommodate the needs of working parents, preschools and infant-toddler centers remain open
ve full-time days per week from September through June (Giudici and Nicolosi, 2014).                            Many

   5
       In 1987, the Municipality of Reggio Emilia began to contract with private infant-toddler care providers to comply
with mandates regarding the provision of childcare according to local family demand and increasingly stringent
state laws. In the 1990s, the number of municipal aliated programs expanded (due to a rise in the local birth
rate) to include a network of several cooperatives serving local children aged 0-6 years.       By 2007, this aliated
network includes 12 infant-toddler centers and 4 preschools sites (Preschools Reggio Children and Infant-toddler
Centers Istituzione of the Municipality of Reggio Emilia, 2008). Municipal aliated programs need not follow the
Reggio Approach. Survey results indicate that the municipality perceives administrative and pedagogical practices
of aliated programs to be somewhat dierent from the Reggio Approach, thus, we consider this a separate group
during analysis.   Appendix Tables A9 and A10 test if the baseline characteristics of municipal-aliated groups in
each city is signicantly dierent from the group that attended the Reggio Approach. This is only tested for child
and adolescent cohorts, as the sample size of adults who attended municipal-aliated is very small. It is shown that
Parma municipal-aliated preschool children had better characteristics than Reggio Approach children regarding
birthweight, premature birth, and mother's education level.
   6
       Whether or not the Municipality of Reggio Emilia inuenced the 1968 reform is problematic. Hohnerlein (2009)
credits Bruno Ciari (and not Loris Malaguzzi) for inuencing the 1968 state reforms for public preschool. In March
1971, Reggio Emilia hosted the rst secular conferences for early childhood education in Italy, Experiences for a New
School for Young Children that were attended by 900 educators. To disseminate their new municipal approaches for
the development of early childhood services throughout Italy, conference proceedings were published in a reference
book (Cagliari et al., 2016). Thus, Malaguzzi's inuence came after the early 1970s in techniques to better engage
families and in pedagogy (i.e., creativity as a vehicle for learning, use of pedagogistas, arts educators) (Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2001).
   7
       As director of municipal schools in Bologna from 1966-1970, Ciari promoted the physical learning environment,
strong teacher-family relationships, participatory committees of parents and community members, and two co-teachers
per classroom (Edwards et al., 1998).



                                                            4
municipal sites oer programming in July, and extended day options are available throughout the
school year. To support all children in the community, Reggio Approach schools prioritize admis-
sion for children with disabilities and provide occupational, physical, and speech therapy as needed
(Edwards et al., 1998; Giaroni, 1972).
       In preschools, incoming 3-year-old cohorts are grouped in classrooms of about 25 children. Ac-
cording to municipal guidelines, each classroom is assigned two full-time co-teachers (teacher-pupil
ratios are 1:12-13). At least one of the two teachers remains with each classroom for three con-
secutive years, oering extended time for continuity of care and strong teacher-family engagement.
Each preschool is also staed by a full-time atelierista, an instructor with a background in visual
arts, who helps teachers develop creative learning activities. On a biweekly basis, a pedagogista
with at least a bachelor's degree in psychology or pedagogy supports the professional development
for the educational sta of approximately 4-5 municipal preschools. Auxiliary site sta, such as
cooks and janitors, are considered members of the educational team and participate in the biweekly
           8
training.
       Reggio Approach environments oer a light-lled, open interior design, furnished with natural
materials and a garden. Each preschool is equipped with an atelier, or dedicated studio laboratory,
where children and educators collaborate on creative instructional activities. In-house kitchens are
surrounded by glass walls, to allow children to observe the meal preparation process, and is used
daily for preparing meals (Rinaldi, 2006; Vecchi, 2010).
       In Reggio Approach pedagogy, there is no institutionally prescribed curriculum that educators
convey to children to achieve a specic academic goal, such as school readiness.             Instead, the
curriculum is viewed as an ongoing, collaborative project among educators, children and families.
Learning goals are determined by children and adults, and achieved through creative long-term
projects with exible timelines. Thus, teachers and children are jointly viewed as researchers and
co-creators of knowledge.       For example, adults and children collaborate to dene a question or
topic to investigate. Learning follows an iterative process: provisional theories are shared, tested,
and revised through socratic dialogue.          Teachers observe children's development, listen, interact
with children through questions and dialogue, and provide scaolding to extend learning. Children
demonstrate their emerging knowledge through expressive art forms, with aid from the atelierista.
Teachers organize each child's documented work in a portfolio that is shared with children and
parents over the year to observe the child's development (Rinaldi, 2006; Giudici and Nicolosi,
2014).



2.2      Comparisons of Early Childhood Programs in Northern Italy: 1950-2010

We were unable to perform a randomized control trial evaluation of the Reggio Approach. Instead,
we compare the outcomes of children who attended Reggio Approach preschools with those who
attended no preschool in Reggio Emilia and with those who attend preschools in Reggio Emilia
and in other cities. The rst type of comparison is based on a small sample, because many children
living in Reggio Emilia attend other types of preschools. The second comparison is problematic
given the common inuences on alternative preschool programs.               If the common inuences are
the essential components of the Reggio Approach, estimates of the eect of the Reggio Approach
compared to other programs are uninformative about the eect of the Reggio Approach compared
to no program at all.
       To increase our understanding of early childhood systems in our comparison cities, and how
each evolved from 1950 through 2010, we created and administered a survey to current and former

   8
       The Reggio Approach encouraged stang of male educators in preschools from its inception.   This policy
conicted with state law until 1978 (Hohnerlein, 2015).




                                                          5
educational coordinators and school administrators in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova.                                              The
survey was designed to explore the extent to which the key administrative and pedagogical com-
ponents of the Reggio Approach were present in each city's municipal, state, and religious early
childhood programs at dierent points of time (Center for the Economics of Human Development
(CEHD), 2016).
        To conrm the results of our survey and document provision and enrollment in each of the
available early childhood systems, we further collected administrative data from historical archives

nicipality of Padova, Italy, 2011; Municipality of Reggio Emilia, Italy, 2006; Istituzione del Comune

        Together, survey results and administrative data indicate that central features of preschool
programs were available to each cohort in each of the various systems listed in Table 1.

        The survey inquires about key pedagogical and administrative features of the Reggio Approach.
Selected components were identied by published program descriptions and conrmed by scholars of
                                                                                                       9
the Reggio Approach and other early childhood programs in northern Italy.                                  The list of components
includes aspects of administrative program operations such as stang, supervision, enrollment, and
funding. It also considers pedagogy and educational practices for children's learning and parental
engagement. Respondents were asked to indicate whether these features of the Reggio Approach
were present in their systems during dierent decades.                            Additional questions were included to
understand (i) the extent of variation between municipal programs and private providers contracted
by the municipality; (ii) the extent of site-level variation within systems; (iii) the perceived variation
between similar systems in other cities; (iv) the sources of program funding, and (v) the services
available for immigrant families. See Appendix A for the full survey.


2.2.1 Survey Results
Table 2 identies the school systems in each city that completed our survey. We acknowledge the
small sample of survey respondents. Our samples may be too limited to ensure reliable reporting
of representative results. Despite this, the responses are useful for presenting information that is
not readily available in the published literature.

                  Note: This table indicates the systems represented by survey respondents. These individu-
                  als include current and former administrators and educational coordinators. One survey was
                  administered for each system noted. Answers reect the input of multiple people associated
                  with the system. Responses were provided by religious systems in Reggio Emilia and Parma;
                  we do not report them here as they are incomplete.



      Overall, results from the survey indicate that early childhood education systems within Reggio
Emilia, as well as in Parma and Padova, share a number of common features. The general trend
shows that programming and practices endorsed by the municipality of Reggio Emilia are present
in other early childhood systems, albeit to dierent degrees and at dierent times.
      We compare the dierent programs in a rough way in Figures 1a and 1b.                                                          We examine 14
administrative components and 16 pedagogical components (not all of the pedagogical components
were present in the Reggio Approach). Using our survey, we calculate the number of administrative
and pedagogical components that each program shared with the Reggio Approach by school type,
city, and year. The evidence indicates that, over time, non-Reggio Approach programs increasingly
implemented more of the pedagogical and administrative practices endorsed by the Reggio Ap-
proach. This is especially true for Parma's municipal program, and to a lesser extent for Padova's
municipal program. State and religious systems report implementing more administrative practices
endorsed by the Reggio Approach than pedagogical components.

Note: These graphs show the number of administrative and pedagogical components that each program has in
common with the Reggio Approach. We consider 14 administrative components and 16 pedagogical components.
Some of the pedagogical components were not present in the Reggio Approach.



      The alternative systems surveyed in our study evolved to include a substantial portion of the
elements in Reggio Emilia's municipal system. To better understand which features of the Reggio
Approach were adopted by other programs and how they evolved, we document key components

       These tables indicate that the main components of the Reggio Approach practiced in non-
Reggio Approach programs include (i) the engagement of families in school management; (ii) ad-
ministrative practices for at-risk children and working families, and; (iii) the use of highly trained
educational coordinators to routinely support professional development.                In general, non-Reggio
Approach programs are similar to each other, and dierent from the Reggio Approach, in providing
religious teaching and following a daily program designed to guide children in acquiring knowledge
of specic concepts.
       The general pattern in these tables is consistent with fairly rapid dissemination of the Reggio
Approach across cities. Below, we document that treatment eects comparing outcomes of dierent
programs across cities are found only for the oldest cohorts, consistent with the diusion hypothesis.



2.3      State Preschools

Over time and across cities, each cohort in our sample had access to dierent numbers of state
preschools.      Those who enrolled in state programs experienced varying early childhood curricula
and administrative practices.
       In 1968, Law 444 ensured access to a system of free state preschool for all families that ap-
        10
plied.       It is considered a key shift in Italian policies for early childhood because it legitimized state
involvement in public and private education for children ages 36 years (Hohnerlein, 2009). The
law made the state responsible for school construction, materials and equipment. However, munic-
ipalities were mandated to maintain state preschools and fund the salaries of an all-female teaching

  10
       In state programs, parents pay only for meals and transportation.




                                                          10
sta under 35 years of age, with a vocational diploma from a 3-year high school (Organisation for
                                                           11
Economic Co-operation and Development, 2001).
       By providing funds only to construct state preschools where local demand was not met by
existing non-state systems such as municipal and religious schools, Law 444 resulted in disparate
numbers of state preschools in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova for each of the cohorts in our eval-
uation sample (Hohnerlein, 2009). Historical records indicate that state preschools rst appeared
in Reggio Emilia and Padova between 1973-1975 (Municipality of Padova, Italy, 2011; Municipality
of Reggio Emilia, Italy, 2006; Istituzione del Comune di Reggio Emilia, 2011). In contrast to other
areas of Italy where the state is currently the largest provider of preschool education, enrollment in
state preschools in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova has historically been lower than enrollment
in municipal and religious preschools. Although the state does not oer infant-toddler childcare, it
regulates and subsidizes such programs through regional governments through Law 1044 enacted
in 1971.
       Reports suggest that the policy reforms and improved guidelines for state preschools (Orien-
tamenti) were inuenced by municipal programs from the region of Emilia Romagna, including
Reggio Emilia, Milan, and Pistoia (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
2001). In particular, revised mandates for lower teacher-child ratios and higher qualications for
teacher education are proposed as key quality indicators associated with diminishing disparities
between state and non-state programs by the end of the 20th century (Hohnerlein, 2015).                          For
example, between 1969 and 1980 for the age-40 and age-30 cohorts, teacher-child ratios were very
low ranging from 1:17-30 for children aged 3-6 years, and teacher education took place in religious
                12
institutions.        In 1977, a new state law mandated inclusion in public schools for children with
disabilities, shaping the educational experiences of the age-30, adolescent, and child cohorts. After
1991, attendees of state preschools in the adolescent and child cohorts experienced better physical
accessibility to schools, a 1:12-13 teacher-child ratio (equivalent to that of the Reggio Approach),
and teachers who were trained in universities (Hohnerlein, 2015). The two younger cohorts further
benetted from 1991 revisions to Orientamenti stressing the contributions of social relationships
for cognitive development and the value of communication for home-school relationships (Organi-
sation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2001). Six content goals for early childhood
education and their associated skill-sets were also outlined by the state for the rst time, including
(i) body and movement; (ii) language and speech; (iii) space, order, and measure; (iv) things, time,
and nature; (v) messages, forms and media, and; (vi) the self and other (Ministry of Education,
         13
1991).        The precise methods by which these concepts should be taught were not specied in order
to enable autonomy and exibility at the school-level.
       In theory, mandated administrative operations and policies for state preschools should be
consistent throughout Italy.         Indeed, survey results indicate that administrative operations for
state preschools in Padova are similar to state preschools in Reggio Emilia, with two interesting
exceptions. In Padova, parents must pay for extras such as eld trips, whereas in Reggio Emilia,
eld trips for children in state preschools are funded by the municipality. Padova's state preschools
report stang full-time educational coordinators to provide professional development for state
teachers from the 1990s forward, which is a feature of the Reggio Approach.                       In Reggio Emilia,
however, state preschools do not report any hiring of full-time educational coordinators (Center for
the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), 2016).

  11
       Later reforms transferred constructions costs from the state to municipalities, allowed men to work as early
childhood educators, and required laureate degrees.
  12
       In contrast, teacher-child ratios in the Reggio Approach were 2:25-30 from 1972 forward.
  13
       In the Reggio Approach, specic skill-sets to be acquired are explicitly not stated as a requirement for early
childhood education.




                                                          11
      Survey results indicate that several administrative features of state preschools are dierent
from the Reggio Approach (and from municipal programs in Parma and Padova). State preschools
do not hire a full-time expert in the creative arts and do not set aside time for teachers to engage
families.   State preschools do not oer extended hours to working families.       And, at 30 hours
per week, state teachers work 6 hours less than their municipal counterparts who work 36 hours
per week. With reduced teaching hours and reduced numbers of full-time sta, children in state
preschools spend more hours with only one teacher than do children in Reggio Approach preschools
(see Appendix Table A1).
      In support of a spillover argument, state preschools in Reggio Emilia implement three Reggio
Approach practices that are not oered in Padova's state preschools.         These practices include
enrollment priorities for disadvantaged families, the use of homogeneous-aged classrooms, and the
focus on continuity of care for children and families by keeping at least one teacher with each cohort
for three years. Overall, however, pedagogy in state preschools of both Reggio Emilia and Padova
supports children's learning dierently than in the Reggio Approach. State preschools (like religious
preschools in all three cities, discussed next) emphasize moral development, national patriotism
and family values. Survey results further indicate that teaching in state preschools (like municipal
schools in Parma and Padova), is nominally inuenced by somewhat dierent academic theories,
includes religious teaching, and use programmed daily activities to guide children in learning of
specic concepts (see Appendix Tables A1 to A4).
      Our study evaluates whether the unique features of the Reggio Approach not in place in
state preschools were eective in benetting individuals suciently to cause statistically signicant
improvement in outcomes relative to individuals who did not receive the Reggio Approach. They
appear not to do so, except possibly for the oldest cohorts where diusion was the weakest.



2.4    Religious Early Childhood Programs

The Catholic Church is the oldest early childhood provider in Italy, oering both religious training
and charitable social services for disadvantaged children since the 19th century (Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development, 2001). All ve cohorts in our evaluation had access to
religious programs for ages 36 years. Of the three cities in our study, Padova has the largest number
of religious preschools. Until the 1990s, religious sites in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova did
not oer educational infant-toddler programs. At some sites in each municipality, the adolescent
cohort had access to several months of transitional programming for children over 24 months of
age. From 12 months of age, the child cohort had access to infant-toddler childcare (Malizia and
Cicatelli, 2011; Center for the Economics of Human Development (CEHD), 2016).
      To provide administrative support for independent religious schools, local federations began to
assemble throughout Italy in the mid-1970s. Religious preschools within the cities of Reggio Emilia,
Parma, and Padova could join a city-level federation that supported administrative operations. In
contrast to the Reggio Approach, however, religious schools within the same local federation are
not mandated to implement a unied pedagogy for preschool education. In this sense, the Church
supports the autonomy of individual sites to determine their own methodologies (Malizia and
Cicatelli, 2011).
      Following a 1997 policy that enabled state funding for non-state programs meeting national
guidelines for early childhood, the Catholic Church undertook signicant eorts to quantify and
achieve equitable program quality in religious schools for all ages. At some time after 1997, we can
expect that policies and educational goals in religious preschools seeking equitable status began to
reect state laws and guidelines. Indeed, after 2000, the Church reports eorts throughout Italy
to replace religious educators with secular teachers trained in institutions of higher education and



                                                  12
reducing teacher-child ratios to reect national standards (Malizia and Cicatelli, 2011). Religious
programs that succeeded in achieving equitable status would thus, like state preschools, reect
the inuence of municipal systems in the Province of Emilia Romagna, including Reggio Emilia
(Hohnerlein, 2009; Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2001).
       Our study did not collect site-level data that would conrm which religious early childhood
programs achieved equitable status or the timing of such a shift. Thus, we cannot determine the
extent to which adolescents and children in our evaluation may have attended equitable religious
schools.     Survey results indicate that the majority of religious sites in all three municipalities
achieved equitable status during the 2000s.            We thus estimate that the child cohort likely had
access to equitable religious preschools; those children who enrolled experienced a program of
similar quality as children who enrolled in state preschools. We further note that parents of the
youngest cohort who chose equitable religious preschools were eligible for subsidized tuition on a
sliding-scale basis; prior to 2000, tuition and fees for religious preschool in all three cities was more
expensive than the cost of attending municipal and state preschools.
       Survey results for religious preschools are available for Reggio Emilia for the 2000s, reecting
only the experience of the child cohort in our study.            In support of our spillover story, religious
preschools in Reggio Emilia are the only other system we survey that do not implement daily
activities to guide children in acquiring specic content knowledge. Religious preschools in Reggio
Emilia, further like Reggio Approach schools and unlike religious preschools in Padova, hire full-
time educational coordinators, keep at least one of two co-teachers with each cohort for three years
                                                                                    14
to ensure continuity of care, and maintain homogenous-aged classrooms.                   Religious preschools in
Reggio Emilia, like the Reggio Approach, also oer extended hours for working families; include an
atelier, in-house kitchen, and emphasize natural materials and open spaces; encourage parents to
serve on school boards; hire full-time educational coordinators to oversee professional development;
are inuenced by the same academic theories; employ project-based learning with exible timelines;
set weekly hours for teachers to engage families and document children's work; and incorporate ne
arts to support children's learning.
       Of all the systems we survey, only Padova's religious early childhood system reports in our
survey that Malaguzzi's educational practices shaped their daily program; this inuence is reported
only for some religious sites starting in the 2000s (Center for the Economics of Human Development
(CEHD), 2016). Regardless, survey evidence suggests that religious preschools in Padova share the
following practices with the Reggio Approach.             From the 1970s, schools were open 8 hours and
extended hours were available for working parents; parents were encouraged to serve on school
boards and weekly time was set aside for teachers to engage families.               From the 1980s, teachers
began to document children's work and school environments included an atelier. From the 1990s,
Padova's religious schools prioritized enrollment for children with disabilities.
       Unlike the Reggio Approach, pedagogy in both systems include religious teaching; an emphasis
on moral development, national patriotism and family values, and; the inuence of Agazzi, Froebl
and Montessori.       Only Padova's religious preschools follow a daily program to guide children in
learning specic concepts (see Appendix Table A3). Municipal archives from 1970 indicate that
children aged 3-6 years enrolled in Padova's religious preschools experienced one teacher for 34-44
children (Municipality of Padova, Italy, 2011).
       Unlike the Reggio Approach, religious preschools in Reggio Emilia and Padova do not prioritize
the enrollment of children from economically disadvantaged families (see Appendix Table A2). In
Reggio Emilia only, religious preschools are not open 8 hours daily; do not hire full-time atelieristas;

  14
       Survey results indicate that homogenous-aged classrooms are only practiced in Reggio Emilia; all systems in
Parma and Padova maintain mixed-age classrooms.




                                                        13
do not include cooks and janitors in teacher trainings, and; do not provide teachers with supervision
and training on a biweekly basis. However, as noted below, absence of these features appears to
have no eects for the outcomes that we study.



2.5       Municipal Early Childhood Systems in Parma and Padova

Survey results, reports, and interviews indicate that the municipal systems in Parma and Padova
both grow more similar to the Reggio Approach over time. From their inception, the three mu-
nicipal systems share many features including a strong emphasis on the provision of high quality
programming for infant-toddler centers (Ghedini, 2001).                   From the 1970s forward, each city in-
vested in stang municipal schools for 8 hours daily, extended hours for working families, and
prioritized enrollment for low-income families. Each city emphasized family participation in school
management. From the 1980s forward, all three municipal school environments featured an atelier,
in-house kitchens, open spaces, and the use of natural lighting and materials.                      Furthermore, the
educational approaches in Parma and Padova were inuenced by the same academic theories of
psychology and education.            From the 1990s forward, all cities prioritized enrollment for children
                       15
with disabilities           and included project-based learning as a teaching method.
        Of the two cities, Parma's municipal system is more similar in policy and administration to
that of Reggio Emilia, sharing the same approach from the 1990s. For example, Parma reports that
administrative operations, weekly scheduled hours to engage families, and professional development
                                                                 16
for teachers began to appear in the mid-late 1970s.                   From the mid-late 1980s, Parma focused on
improving management of infant-toddler centers to support the varying needs of working parents.
        From a pedagogical perspective, however, survey results suggest that of all the programs we
study, municipal preschools in Padova are more consistently similar to the Reggio Approach. In
Padova, teachers began to document children's learning in the 1970s.                        By the 1980s, ne arts
specialists were hired to support creative learning activities.
        Where the Reggio Approach and the municipal systems in Parma and Padova dier is in
the application of psychological theories to pedagogical methods.                    In both Parma and Padova's
municipal systems, classrooms are heterogenous in age and religious instruction is provided.                          In
contrast to the progressive Reggio Approach where content knowledge is secondary to creative
expression, daily activities in the municipal preschools of Parma and Padova follow a program
to guide children in learning specic concepts such as communication, culture, order, measure,
space, time, nature, self, and other.            In Padova, cognitive development is emphasized, teaching
includes direct-instruction, and children complete worksheets as a learning activity (Center for the
Economics of Human Development (CEHD), 2016).
        Overall, relative to Reggio Emilia, investment in municipal early childhood programs and
services for ages 0-6 by Parma and Padova occurred approximately 10 years and 15 years later,
                  17
respectively.          In considering selection into dierent systems by families in each city, we note

   15
        In Padova's municipal preschools, prioritized enrollment for children with disabilities began in the 1970s.
   16
        In Padova, professional development for municipal early childhood sta began in the mid-1980s (Becchi and
Ferrari, 1990).
   17
        Like Reggio Emilia, by 2003 both Parma and Padova contracted with local aliated private providers and
cooperatives to meet the childcare needs of their respective populations.        Each municipality, however, contracts
dierently with such institutions and the extent to which their agreements reect municipal administrative and/or
pedagogical practices is unclear. For example, in Parma, all aliated programs are secular; some are co-managed
by the municipality whereas others are managed independently. In Padova, aliated centers include both religious
and secular programs.        Survey results indicate that Parma and Padova each perceive their aliated providers to
operate very dierently from their respective municipal approaches (Center for the Economics of Human Development
(CEHD), 2016).

that Parma and Padova each provided fewer municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools from
the 1960s forward.          We further note that enrollment is highest in the municipal preschools of
Reggio Emilia and Parma, whereas in Padova, it is secondary to enrollment in religious preschools
(Municipality of Padova, Italy, 2011; Municipality of Reggio Emilia, Italy, 2006; Istituzione del
Comune di Reggio Emilia, 2011). For additional information, see Appendix Tables A1 to A4.



2.6        Summary

The Reggio Approach is not unique compared to other early childhood systems in Reggio Emilia
and in neighboring cities of northern Italy.            It appears, however, that the state, religious, and
municipal programs we study do not incorporate all of the Reggio Approach practices.
         The evidence presented below supports the nding of more statistically signicant outcomes
for the earliest cohorts of those educated in the Reggio Approach compared to those educated in
other area preschools, but not for later cohorts. This is consistent with rapid diusion of the Reggio
Approach. The Reggio Approach infant toddler centers show even weaker results than preschools,
with some signicantly negative eects on education and social outcomes relative to adult cohorts
who did not attend attend any infant-toddler centers.

3.1        The Selection of Cities

We survey cohorts of individuals educated in Parma, Padova, and Reggio Emilia.                        Parma and
Padova are similar to Reggio Emilia in terms of geography, population, and socio-economic struc-
                                                                          18
ture, but they do not have the full Reggio Approach available.
         The cities are in close geographic proximity with Reggio Emilia, which may contribute to the
plausibility of spillover eects.        Parma is in the same administrative region of Emilia-Romanga.
They have similar populations as seen in Figure 2. Although the population in Padova is larger
than in Parma and Reggio Emilia, the trends are similar across time. The similarity in trends can
also be seen in comparing the migration rates among the three cities (Figure 3).                   Although the
emigration rate is highest in Padova and net migration rate is highest in Reggio Emilia for most of
the years, general trends in emigration and immigration are similar in all cities. Levels of foreign
immigration are almost identical in the three cities.
         The similarities between the cities are also seen in economic terms.             Reggio Emilia has an
average per-capita income of 25,226 euros, Parma of 28,437, and Padova of 29,915 in 2011 (Comuni-
Italiani, 2017). Other economic information, such as unemployment, is similar across the cities as
well. We present additional information on the three cities in Appendix C.

    18
         Other Italian cities were also considered, notably Brescia, Livorno, Modena, Perugia, Piacenza, Prato, and
Ravenna. Parma and Padova were the two cities that had social and economic characteristics most similar to Reggio
Emilia and were geographically close.

                         dierent from Reggio Emilia at least at the 0.05 level. Standard devia-
                         tions are reported in parentheses. See Appendix C for more information
                         on these data and the sources.



        Although the three cities are similar, Parma has more in common with Reggio Emilia than
does Padova.         This is the case for population indicators, such as those in Table 6, but also for
indicators of social setting. An example of this is seen in Appendix C which has the proportion
of votes for dierent parties between 1953 and 1993.                   In both Reggio Emilia and Parma, more
votes went towards the Communist Party, whereas Padova had a higher proportion of votes going
towards the Christian Democrats.
        The proximity and comparability of the three cities is useful for standardizing on background
variables. At the same time, it compromises sharp comparisons of the eectiveness of alternative
school systems given the similarities in preschool features and commonality of cultural inuences.



3.2       The Survey Data Collection

Respondents were sampled from the population registries of the cities based on their year of birth.
The sample was then restricted to those individuals living in the same city in which they were
raised. All cohorts, except the youngest one, are restricted to individuals who are Italian citizens.
                                                                                                      19
In contrast, the youngest cohort includes an oversampling of immigrant children.                           The sample
from Reggio Emilia, across all cohorts, includes an oversampling of those who attended municipal
schools, as this is our treatment group.
        Of the reference sample, 7,176 individuals were randomly selected. Of these, 4,019 completed
                                                             20
interviews, resulting in a response rate of 56%.                  Table 7 provides an overview of the birth years
for the dierent cohorts, the counts of the full sample, and the response rate. The most common
reasons for non-response were that nobody was home when the surveying agency solicited and sharp
refusals.
   19
        In the adult cohorts there was no immigrant who was preschool age in the same school in which they live. In
the adolescent cohort, the number was immigrant born was extremely small.
   20
        We have very limited information on those who refused. Thus, we are unable to adjust for this high non-responsive
rate.

 Note: The response rates for each city and cohort are in italics. They are the the ratio of interviews to total valid
 contacts. Valid contacts are the sum of: completed interviews, sharp refusal, no person present, talked with a
 relative, left paper questionnaire but never returned, interview began but not completed. The age at interview
 is an approximation given there is some variation in the interview date and birth year within each cohort. In
 analysis, we combine the Italian and migrant subsamples of the child cohort and control for migrant status.

       Tables 8 and 9 provide a detailed tabulation of the sample by city, cohort, and school type for
both infant-toddler care and preschool attendance. They show that the number of people who do
not attend any preschool and infant-toddler center decreases over time. Whereas the majority of
individuals from the age-50 cohort did not attend any infant-toddler care or preschool, there are
few such cases in the child and adolescent cohorts. These tables also show that the proportion of
individuals attending municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools is higher in Reggio Emilia
                               21
than in the other cities.           Note that the Reggio Approach preschools were not available for the
age-50 cohort.

  21
       This is due to the construction of the sample.

    The structure of the cohorts allows us to study the eects of the Reggio Approach at dierent
stages throughout the life cycle. The children in the youngest cohort were interviewed when they
entered primary school, the adolescent cohort was interviewed when they complete compulsory
schooling, and the adult cohorts were interviewed at dierent points of adulthood to measure key
outcomes such as engagement in the labor market, health, and family decisions.                     Although this
cohort structure allows us to study the evolution of the program, the other preschools also evolved
making it challenging to compare the outcomes from the Reggio Approach with those from a stable
control group.   Our investigation in Section 2 of the early childhood education landscape helps
characterize the comparison group over time.
    Restricting the sample to individuals living in the same city in which they were raised is
necessary in order to compare individuals who had the             opportunity   to attend the dierent types of
preschool. Table 10, based on population registry data, presents the proportion of the population
who were born in Italy, of Italian citizenship, and still resident in that town of birth. For all cohorts,
the immigration rates are very similar for all three cities. Both treatment and control cities share



                                                      21
a similar economic and labor market history. Nonetheless, it is worth noting that embedded in our
sample selection is the potential bias due to the fact that one of the eects of preschool might be a
                                          22
higher propensity to emigrate.                 In general, higher skilled individuals are more mobile. This does
not necessarily bias treatment eects because migration patterns are uniform across cities.

         In order to evaluate the eect of the Reggio Approach on a broad set of domains, we designed
a questionnaire surveying various outcomes and dimensions of life success. Respondents were asked
about family composition, fertility, labor force participation, income, schooling, cognitive ability,
social and emotional skills, health and healthy habits, social capital, interpersonal ties, as well as
attitudes on migrants. Three age-specic questionnaires were designed, piloted, and elded: one
for the Italian and immigrant child cohorts, one for the adolescent cohort, and one for the adult
                                                                                                                 23
cohorts. The parents of the children and adolescents were also administered a questionnaire.



4         Analysis
The challenges confronting the evaluation of the Reggio Approach are formidable. We do not have
access to data from a randomized control trial. Using the comparison groups we have collected,
we show in Section 2 that there is a lot of commonality in the features of the preschools in Reggio
Emilia with those in the comparison group cities. Such comparisons do not evaluate the benet of
the Reggio Approach compared to non-participation in any program. Instead, they estimate the
eect of the Reggio Approach compared to other approaches. The best we can hope to learn from
such comparisons is whether the additional features of the Reggio Approach enhance treatment
eects.
         In addition, parents choose to send their children to dierent preschools and this has potential
consequences for selection bias on estimated outcomes. The response rate of the survey is low (56%)
and restriction of the survey to non-emigrant populations likely biases downward the mean levels
of outcomes observed, although the eects on treatment eects for comparisons across cities is far

    22
         Gertler et al. (2014) show that one important benet of the Jamaica early childhood intervention was on emi-
gration to more prosperous countries.
    23
         The questionnaire was piloted in the city of Bergamo with a sample from every cohort.        A second pilot was
conducted in Reggio Emilia, Parma, and Padova on a subsample of adults. The questionnaires were subsequently
tested and rened to the nal version, which lasts approximately 40 minutes for the adults, and 1 hour for the children
and the adolescents.



                                                             22
from obvious and may be negligible. Our analysis addresses the issue of selection bias in terms of
parental choices. However, due to data limitations, it does not address other sources of selection
bias.
        Since no single analytic approach is best, we consider several methodologies to evaluate the
eect of the Reggio Approach using the survey data just described. These methodologies invoke
dierent identifying assumptions and leverage dierent control groups. Any treatment eect ro-
bustly estimated across these methodologies provides strong evidence in favor of the validity of the
assumption of no selection bias.
        We make two types of comparisons.                   First, we compare the Reggio Approach with other
childcare systems within the city of Reggio Emilia, including the default value of no childcare at
all. Section 4.1 presents various methodologies used to estimate the treatment eects of the Reggio
Approach with a restriction of the sample to individuals within the city of Reggio Emilia. Second,
we estimate the eect of the Reggio Approach relative to other childcare systems across cities.
Section 4.2 presents methodologies used for the across-city analysis.
        The Reggio Approach includes interventions at two dierent age ranges:                       (i) infant-toddler
centers between ages 0-3, and (ii) preschool between ages 36. Our analysis of the infant-toddler
centers is limited compared to our preschool analysis because attendance of infant-toddler centers
was very low in the adult cohorts, even in Reggio Emilia. However, the dierential provision of
infant-toddler centers outside of the Reggio Emilia Approach aords us with a clean control group
which we exploit. Infant-toddler centers in Parma and Padova had relatively poorer provision for
                        24
the older cohorts.           We next describe our methodology.


4.1       Within-City Analysis

4.1.1 Framework to Evaluate Preschool
We perform within-Reggio Emilia comparisons using OLS and matching models.                                 We compare
individuals from Reggio Emilia who attended a Reggio Approach preschool to those in Reggio Emilia
who attended (i) any other type of preschool (state, religious, municipal-aliated, and other), (ii)
no preschool at all, (iii) state preschool, and (iv) religious preschool.                  We focus on estimates of
the rst two comparisons in the main paper to focus on the main hypotheses of the eectiveness
of the Reggio Approach.            The estimates of comparisons to specic school types are reported in
Appendix D.1 and summarized in Section 5.                      For the child cohort (age 6), it is not possible to
compare Reggio Approach preschools with no preschool because the sample of individuals who did
not attend preschool is so small (See Table 9).
        Our OLS model takes the form for outcome                 Y   for individual   i,

                                              Yi = Î±0 + Î±1 Di + Xi Î³ + Îµi                                                (1)


where i indexes individuals, Di is an indicator for whether individual i attended municipal preschool,
Xi is a vector of baseline control variables, and Îµi is a random disturbance. Estimates from three
specications for Xi are reported: (i) no baseline control, (ii) baseline variables selected by the
                                                     25
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC),                     and (iii) the full set of available baseline variables.        In
Equation (1),      Î±1   represents the mean dierences in outcomes between the Reggio Approach and the

   24
        Among adults in Padova and Parma, only the age 30 cohorts were exposed to municipal infant-toddler centers.
   25
        Since the set of baseline variables are dierent for child, adolescent, and adult cohorts, we use separate model
selections. For the   child cohort, the a priori   designated control variables are male, CAPI (computer-assisted personal
interview), infant-toddler center attendance, and migrant indicators, and the BIC-selected variables are (i) mother
graduated university, (2) family owns house, and (3) family income 10,00025,000. For the           adolescent cohort,   the
xed variables are male, CAPI, infant-toddler center attendance indicators and BIC-selected variables are (i) high



                                                                23
other preschool types in Reggio Emilia, controlling for                  X.   Under the assumption that, conditional
on   X , there is no systematic selection of individuals into the treatment Di , this parameter estimates
the causal treatment eect of the Reggio Approach on outcome           Y.
          In order to complement the OLS analysis, we also estimate two matching models: (i) a propen-
sity score matching model that implements nearest-neighbor matching on an estimated propensity
score based on a BIC-selected set of observed baseline characteristics                  Xi   and (ii) a matching model
using Epanechnikov kernel weight and                    Xi . These matching models     are versions of non-parametric
OLS and condition on the same set of                    X variables as OLS. These      approaches match people who
attended Reggio Approach preschools with people who did not attend Reggio Approach preschools
based on similarities in observed baseline characteristics.
          The average treatment eect (ATE) under the assumption for propensity score matching is
written as:                                                                             
                                                                                     
                        E[Y (1) â Y (0)] = E E Yi |Di = 1, Ï(Xi ) â E Yi |Di = 0, Ï(Xi ) .                           (2)


where the propensity score             Ï(Xi ) = P r(Di = 1|Xi )         (the probability of selection) is predicted for
each individual      i using the estimated coecients obtained from                 a probit model. We average over
sample      X to evaluate the average treatment eect.
          The k -nearest neighbor matching estimator is dened as

treated individual using the weighted average over multiple people in the comparison group based
on Mahalanobis distance and Epanechnikov kernel weight. The standard errors for both nearest
neighbor matching estimator and the kernel matching estimator are derived by Abadie and Imbens
(2006) and we apply their analysis. We examine the robustness of the estimates across methods in
the results section.


4.1.2 Framework to Evaluate Infant-Toddler Care
We analyze the eectiveness of Reggio Approach infant-toddler care within the city of Reggio Emilia
accounting for subsequent preschool experiences. Table 11 shows the four possible combinations of
interventions that a child could receive, where 1 indicates attending the designated category and 0
indicates non-attendance.

school is father's maximum education, (ii) university is father's maximum education, and (iii) caregiver is catholic
and faithful. For      adult cohorts, the xed variables are male and CAPI indicators, and BIC-selected variables are (i)
university is father's maximum education and (ii) number of siblings.
     26
          We specify   M =3   in our analysis.

Note: We only consider municipal infant-toddler-centers (ages 0-3) and preschools (ages 3-6). (0,0): did not attend
any municipal school for both ages 0-3 and 3-6; (1,0): attended a municipal school for ages 0-3 but did           not   attend
for ages 3-6; (0,1): did   not   attend a municipal school for ages 0-3 but did attend for ages 3-6; (1,1): attended a
municipal school for both ages 0-3 and 3-6.




      There are two main methods for testing the eect of attending infant-toddler centers.                                The
rst is to compare people who did not attend infant-toddler care or preschool with people who
only attended municipal infant-toddler care.                 Using the notation in Table 11, this comparison is
between (0,0) and (1,0). The second method is to compare people who only attended municipal
preschool with people who attended both municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools. That is,
to compare (0,1) and (1,1). The hypotheses are formally written as


            H1 : Y0,0 = Y1,0             Eect of infant-toddler care with no subsequent preschool                           (4)

            H2 : Y0,1 = Y1,1             Eect of infant-toddler care with subsequent preschool                              (5)


where    Yi,j   is the outcome of the individuals who attended                i â {0, 1}      infant-toddler care and        j â
{0, 1}   preschool.
      For each of the two hypotheses above, we limit the sample to include only those individuals from
Reggio Emilia who received the treatment combinations that are relevant to testing the hypothesis
in question.        Furthermore, we restrict the sample to include only one cohort at a time to see if
treatment eects change over cohorts. To test these hypotheses, we estimate                           Î²0    in the following
equation:
                                        Yic,h = Î± + Î²0 RiIT C,h + Xi Î³ + ÎµReggio,h
                                                                          i                                                  (6)

where    RiIT C,h   is an indicator for attending municipal infant-toddler center for members of cohort                          h
and   Xi   is the vector of baseline variables for individual           i.   To test   H1 ,   we estimate   Î²0   on a sample
consisting of all individuals from cohort             h   in Reggio Emilia who received either the (0,0) or (1,0)
combination of childcare. We remind the reader that (0,0) and (1,0) is composed of those individuals
who did not attend preschool.              To test   H2 ,   we would estimate      Î²0      for all cohort-h individuals in
Reggio Emilia who were in groups (0,1) or (1,1).
      The samples are small.             As a result, these hypotheses cannot be tested for many groups.
Table 12 shows the number of individuals available in each group necessary for this strategy. It is
impossible to test      H1   in our data, because there are almost no individuals who attended municipal
infant-toddler care without attending preschool (group (1,0)). While it is possible to test                             H2   for
several groups, the number of observations for the group (1,1) is small for the adult cohorts. The
shaded regions of Table 12 highlight the groups that we use for estimation.

attended a municipal school for both ages 0-3 and 3-6. Column Total" shows the total number of people in
specied city and cohort.




        Analogous to what we do in Section 4.1.1, we also estimate (i) a propensity score matching
model that implements nearest-neighbor matching on an estimated propensity score based on a BIC-
selected set of observed baseline characteristics                         Xi     and (ii) a matching model using Epanechnikov
kernel weight and         Xi ,    in addition to OLS analysis for infant-toddler centers.



4.2       Across-City Comparisons

4.2.1 Dierence-in-Dierences
We rst estimate a dierence-in-dierences (DiD) model that allows for cross-city comparisons of
municipal preschools while controlling for permanent dierences in characteristics across cities. We
estimate the parameters separately for each cohort.                                   We present comparisons between municipal
schools and (i) all other types of preschools pooled together, and (ii) no preschool.                                                   We present
comparisons to specic school types in Appendix D.1 and summarize the results in Section 5.
        For the age-40 cohort, we compare individuals who attended Reggio Approach preschools with
those in Parma or Padova who attended any type of preschool. This is because municipal childcare
systems were not available in Parma and Padova for the age-40 cohort.
        To illustrate, we present the comparison between between Reggio Emilia and Parma for those
who either attended municipal preschool or no preschool at all. The estimation equation for this
case as follows:


                          Yi = Î²0 + Î²1 Reggioi + Î²2 Di + Î²3 Reggioi â Di + Xi Î´ + i 27                                                          (7)


where     Reggioi   is the indicator for individual                  i   having attended preschool in Reggio Emilia and                            Di
is the indicator for attending municipal preschool.                              Î²3   is interpreted as the dierence that remains
between individuals from Reggio Emilia who attended municipal schools and those from the city
who didn't attend any preschool after adjusting for city-invariant dierences in characteristics of
individuals who received the dierent early childhood experiences. In other words,                                                 Î²3   is the DiD
treatment eect estimator that amounts to (Reggio Emilia municipal - Reggio Emilia none) - (Parma
municipal - Parma none), where the rst dierence captures the unadjusted dierence between
individuals who attended municipal and no preschool in Reggio Emilia, and the second dierence
captures city-invariant dierences in characteristics of individuals who attended municipal and no
preschool. Analogous interpretations are applied to DiD comparisons between Reggio Emilia and

   27
        We tested the signicance on interaction terms with                D,    but most of them were not signicant. Moreover, there
is no consistent trend on interaction terms across dierent outcome variables and comparison group specication.




                                                                          26
Padova and comparisons between municipal schools and other school types. This approach is valid
under the assumption that individuals select into early childhood experiences in a manner that is
comparable across the three cities, and that the dierence in the outcomes between municipal and
non-municipal schools would have been the same in all three cities in the absence of the Reggio
Approach.
       For cross-city comparisons of municipal infant-toddler care across cities, we compare people
who did not attend any infant-toddler care centers but attended municipal preschool with people
who attended both municipal infant-toddler care centers and preschools across Reggio and Parma
or Padova.      We estimate the DiD models for infant-toddler care using the highlighted group in
Table 12.


4.2.2 Matching
The DiD model presented in Section 4.2.1 estimates the eect of municipal preschools relative to
other types of preschool or no preschool across cities. However, selection into municipal preschools
in Parma and Padova may not be analogous to selection into Reggio Approach preschools.                        In
order to complement the DiD analysis, we estimate a propensity score matching model and a
kernel matching model using Epanechnikov kernel weight to match people who attended the Reggio
Approach preschools with people in Parma or Padova who attended (i) all types of preschools pooled
together, including municipal preschools, or (ii) no preschool. Following Heckman et al. (1998), we
also do dierence in dierences matching.
       To illustrate, the comparison group for the matching models is limited to (i) individuals in
Reggio Emilia who attended Reggio Approach preschools and (ii) individuals in Parma who at-
tended any preschool. The purpose is to match Reggio Approach individuals with individuals who
have similar propensity scores but have attended preschool in Parma. We assume that the latter
group is similar to the Reggio Approach individuals except that they are not exposed to the Reggio
Approach. By comparing the outcomes across the matches, the propensity score matching model
estimates the eect of the Reggio Approach. Analogous interpretations are applied to comparisons
                                                                               28
for dierent control group specications, including people in Padova.
       For cross-city comparisons of infant-toddler care, we compare individuals who attended munic-
ipal preschool and municipal infant-toddler care in Reggio Emilia against individuals from Parma
and Padova who attended municipal preschool but did not attend infant-toddler care. As above,
we report estimates from both a propensity score matching model and a kernel matching model
using Epanechnikov kernel weights.


4.2.3 Dierence-in-Dierences Matching
In our nal cross-city comparison strategy, we use the dierence-in-dierences matching estimator
developed in Heckman et al. (1998). Specically, we use the repeated cross-section version of the
estimator that is also explicitly specied in Smith and Todd (2005). To illustrate, we present the
comparison between Reggio Emilia and Parma for those who either attended municipal preschool

  28
       We attempted IV and selection bias corrections but the instruments were too weak to be eective.   See the
discussion in Appendix F.




                                                       27
or no preschool at all. The analysis involves estimating the following estimator:

                                                                                                              B

where the subscripts          RM , RN , P M ,          and    PN   correspond to Reggio Emilia municipal, Reggio

indexed group; and          W (Â·, Â·)   are Epanechnikov kernel weights based on the Mahalanobis distance
between the indexed individuals constructed using baseline characteristics                                 X.     The rst matched-
dierence,       A,   captures the dierence in outcomes between individuals from Reggio Emilia who
attended municipal preschool and those from the city who did not attend any preschool.                                                 The
second matched-dierence,              B,   captures the analogous dierence in Parma. This strategy assumes
that conditional on baseline characteristics                 X,   the second matched-dierence                  B   captures average
city-invariant dierences between individuals who attended municipal preschool and those who
didn't attend any preschool.                To the extent that this assumption holds, subtracting                           B   from the
matched-dierence in Reggio Emilia,               A,    removes the bias stemming from city-invariant dierences
in characteristics of individuals across preschool treatment categories. This allows us to interpret
the DiD-Matching estimate as capturing the eect of attending Reggio Approach schools relative to
not attending any preschool. Analogous interpretations are applied to comparisons between Reggio
Emilia and Padova and comparisons between municipal schools and other school types.



5         Results
                                                                                                                                 29 , 30
We present the estimates of the methods described above for a handful of key outcomes.                                                     In
addition to unadjusted p-values, we report step-down p-values for each set of estimates to account
for the potential problem that arises from arbitrarily selecting signicant results from a set of
possible outcomes.           We rst present the results from the analysis of infant-toddler care.                                     The
results are not consistently statistically signicant with some negative eects appearing for the
older cohorts. We then present the results from our analysis of the preschool data. Although these
results are stronger than those from the infant-toddler care, very few outcomes show statistically
signicant treatment eects that are robust across dierent estimation procedures. The strongest
results are from the comparison of Reggio Approach preschool against no preschool for the age-40
cohort.
    29
         We choose outcomes that are economically signicant, outcomes that have limited missing values, and outcomes
with sucient variation across individuals. Results on the full set of outcomes are reported in Appendix D.2.
    30
         A brief description of the outcomes is as follows: We rescale socio-emotional outcomes, including SDQ (Strengths
and Diculties Questionnaire) score, Locus of Control, and Depression score, so that the higher value has a more
socially positive meaning; SDQ Composite - Child is reported by mother, and SDQ Composite is self-reported; IQ
Score is measured using Raven's Progressive Matrices; How Much Child Likes School is a single question with three
answers, where 1 means A little, 2 means So so, and 3 means A lot; High School Grade has the maximum scoring
of 100; since the mean and variance is not always the same, we standardize the high school grade for each city, cohort,
and high school type based on our data to have mean zero and unit variance; All the other measures reported in the
estimation results are binary indicators.

follows. In the child cohort, Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers had signicantly positive eect
on IQ, obesity, and number of friends relative to no infant-toddler care in Reggio Emilia. However,
the eect on IQ does not persist when compared to people who had municipal infant-toddler care
in Parma or Padova. The eect on number of friends persists in a comparison to Parma children.
In the adolescent cohort, Reggio Approach infant-toddler care had signicantly positive treatment
eects on number of friends, which persists even compared to Parma adolescents, but did not have
a clear eect relative to no infant-toddler care on all other outcomes. In the age-30 cohort, Reggio
Approach infant-toddler care had a signicantly negative eect on IQ, high school grade, university
graduation, volunteer behavior, number of friends, and trust score.    However, Reggio Approach
infant-toddler centers had a signicantly positive eect on employment status, hours worked per
week, obesity, marriage, obesity, and voting behaviors. In the age-40 cohort, the Reggio Approach
also had a signicantly negative eect on IQ, volunteer behavior, and number of friends. A positive
eect was found for employment and hours worked.
      To summarize, we have a mixed positive and negative eects of Reggio Approach infant-toddler
centers that are generally dierent for younger and older cohorts. Reggio Approach infant-toddler
centers generally have positive eect on IQ and number of friends for younger cohorts. However,
Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers have a negative eect on IQ, education, and number of
friends for older cohorts, whereas they generally have an increasing eect on employment and
hours worked for those cohorts.   Accounting for multiple hypothesis testing in the adult cohorts
weakens the inference further. However, it should be noted that it was not common to send children
to infant-toddler centers. Hence, the negative eects on adult cohorts may suggest that families
in the adult cohorts who decided to attend infant-toddler centers might have unobserved family
characteristics that might negatively aect the outcomes.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers from
multiple methods. We compare individuals who attended both municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools (1,1)
with individuals who only attended municipal preschools and no infant-toddler center (0,1). The Column titles
indicate the corresponding control set and and model.   None = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with no control
variables.BIC = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) and additional controls for male indicator and ITC attendance indicator. Full = within-Reggio Emilia OLS
estimate with the full set of controls. PSM = within-Reggio Emilia propensity score matching estimation. KM =
within-Reggio Emilia Epanechnikov kernel matching estimation. DidPm = dierence-in-dierences estimates of
(Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Parma (1,1) - Parma (0,1)). KMDidPm = dierence-in-dierences kernel matching
estimates of (Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Parma (1,1) - Parma (0,1)). KMPm = Epanechnikov kernel matching
estimation between Reggio (1,1) and Parma (0,1). DidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimates of (Reggio (1,1) -
Reggio (0,1)) - (Padova (1,1) - Padova (0,1)). KMDidPv = dierence-in-dierences kernel matching estimates of
(Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Padova (1,1) - Padova (0,1)).
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively. Empty cells show that the estimation cannot be carried out
for that outcome.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers from
multiple methods. We compare people who attended both municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools (1,1)
with people who only attended municipal preschools and no infant-toddler center (0,1). As in Section Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model.  None = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with no
control variables.BIC = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information
Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male indicator and ITC attendance indicator. Full = within-Reggio
Emilia OLS estimate with the full set of controls. PSM = within-Reggio Emilia propensity score matching
estimation. KM = within-Reggio Emilia Epanechnikov kernel matching estimation. DidPm =
dierence-in-dierences estimates of (Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Parma (1,1) - Parma (0,1)). KMDidPm =
dierence-in-dierences kernel matching estimates of (Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Parma (1,1) - Parma (0,1)).
KMPm = Epanechnikov kernel matching estimation between Reggio (1,1) and Parma (0,1). DidPv =
dierence-in-dierences estimates of (Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Padova (1,1) - Padova (0,1)). KMDidPv                                                  =
dierence-in-dierences kernel matching estimates of (Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Padova (1,1) - Padova (0,1)).
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively. Empty cells show that the estimation cannot be carried out
for that outcome.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach infant-toddler centers from
multiple methods. We compare people who attended both municipal infant-toddler centers and preschools (1,1)
with people who only attended municipal preschools and no infant-toddler center (0,1). As in Section Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model. None = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with no control
variables.BIC = within-Reggio Emilia OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC) and additional controls for male indicator and ITC attendance indicator. Full = within-Reggio Emilia OLS
estimate with the full set of controls. PSM = within-Reggio Emilia propensity score matching estimation. KM =
within-Reggio Emilia Epanechnikov kernel matching estimation. DidPm = dierence-in-dierences estimates of
(Reggio (1,1) - Reggio (0,1)) - (Parma (1,1) - Parma (0,1)). PSMPm = propensity score matching estimation
between Reggio (1,1) and Parma (0,1). KMPm = Epanechnikov kernel matching estimation between Reggio (1,1)
and Parma (0,1).    Note that comparison with Padova is not possible due to small sample size as specied in Table 12.
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively. Empty cells show that the estimation cannot be carried out
for that outcome.

5.2.1 Results for the Child Cohort
                                                                                                                         31
We next discuss the results that are robust across methods from the analysis of preschool.                                    In
the child cohort (Table 17), the Reggio Approach increased the SDQ (Strengths and Diculties
Questionnaire) scores when compared to children who attended other preschools within Reggio
         32
Emilia        . This result becomes more positive after controlling for more background characteristics.
Signicantly positive eects for SDQ score are only preserved when comparing to Padova, but not
Parma.        When we consider the sub-scales of the SDQ as outcomes, the results are positive and
signicant for the emotional symptoms, positive conduct, and pro-social tests while not signicant
on the hyperactivity and peer problems tests (see Table A18). The Reggio Approach signicantly
decreased IQ when compared to comparison children group in Reggio Emilia, and signicantly
increased how child likes school when compared to comparison groups in all three cities. The other
main outcomes do not show signicant eects.
       When we compare the Reggio Approach individuals in the child cohort to those who attended
religious schools (Table A11), the Reggio Approach individuals had lower IQ scores and were more
obese both within Reggio Emilia and in comparison to the other cities. Compared with the state
schools (Table A12), Reggio Approach children had higher IQ scores except in comparison to Parma.
The SDQ score was positive when compared with Padova, but not as positive for within Reggio
Emilia as was seen when comparing to all non-Reggio Approach schools. Adjusting for multiple
hypothesis testing weakens the inference further.

  31
       Appendix D includes more estimates including comparisons to specic school types and additional outcomes.
  32
       The    SDQ   is   a   widely-used   scale   inquiring   about   emotional   symptoms,   conduct   problems,   hyperactiv-
ity/inattention, peer relationships problems, and pro-social behavior (Goodman, 1997). For ease of interpretation,
we have converted the SDQ score such that higher values correspond to more positive outcomes.

5.2.2 Results for the Adolescent Cohort
In the adolescent cohort (Table 18), adolescents who attended the Reggio Approach were signi-
cantly less likely to be depressed according to analyses done within Reggio Emilia and DiD estimates
with Parma and Padova. The Reggio Approach individuals were more likely to be obese than in-
dividuals who attended other types of preschool in Reggio Emilia, and the estimate on obesity
is consistent across most of the methods.                                 Methods across all cities show that Reggio Approach
individuals were less likely to be involved in sport activities, which is consistent with the increase
in obesity.        Other outcomes did not have consistently signicant results, except for being more
bothered by migrants than others in Reggio Emilia (Table A23).
      In comparison to adolescents who attended religious schools (Table A13) the IQ scores are
lower for the Reggio Approach adolescents. This is consistent with the results for the child cohort.



                                                                                35
The SDQ score, capturing social-emotional skills, is higher both when considering the summary
score and the individual sub-scales. Similar to the main specication, the adolescents had lower
depression scores and higher obesity rates. There are fewer signicant outcomes when comparing
the Reggio Approach adolescents with those who attended state schools (Table A14). Additionally,
those that are statistically signicant are negative: SDQ scores were lower and adolescents reported
less exercise and fewer friends.   Adjusting for multiple hypothesis testing weakens the inference
further.

5.2.3 Results for Adult Cohorts
In the adult cohorts, the results dier depending on the comparison group. The comparison with
no preschool, shown in Tables 20 and 22, shows many more statistically signicant estimates within
Reggio Emilia. In the comparison with the other preschools, shown in Tables 19 and 21, the only
outcomes that show any statistical signicance within Reggio Emilia across dierent methods are
volunteering behavior in the age-30 cohort, and high school graduation in the age-40 cohort. The
OLS estimates show that the Reggio Approach individuals in the age-40 cohort are more likely to
graduate from high school than others within Reggio Emilia.
    There are more statistically signicant outcomes when matching Reggio Approach individu-
als with people in Parma or Padova who attended preschools.        Relative to people who attended
preschools in Parma, the Reggio Approach for both adult-30 and adult-40 cohorts show a signif-
icantly positive eect on high school grade, locus of control, voting behavior, and a signicantly
negative eect on IQ, university graduation, obesity, volunteering behavior, and number of friends.
Relative to people who attended preschools Padova for the adult-30 cohort, the Reggio Approach
shows a signicantly positive eect on high school grade and trust score, and a signicantly neg-
ative eect on IQ and university graduation, depression score, volunteering behavior. Relative to
people who attended preschools in Padova for the adult-40 cohort, the Reggio Approach show a
signicantly positive eect on high school grade, employment, hours worked, marriage, and and a
signicantly negative eect on IQ.
    In the age-30 cohort, Reggio Approach individuals had worse health along certain outcomes
compared with others in Reggio Emilia who did not attend any preschool (Table A32).           This is
seen in reporting more cigarettes per day and more sick days in the past months. Compared with
those attended other preschools in Reggio Emilia, Reggio Approach adults were less satised with
their health and more optimistic (Table A31). These two estimates ip directions when comparing
against those in Reggio Emilia who did not attend any preschool.
    In comparison to those who attended religious schools (Tables A15 and A17), age-30 and age-
40 adults had lower IQ scores.    This is similarly seen in the child and adolescent cohorts when
comparing to individuals from religious schools. Individuals in the age-30 cohort also had lower
employment levels than those who attended religious schools within Reggio Emilia. Similar to the
child and adolescent cohorts, the results ip directions in comparison to state schools (Table A16).
More results are positive in the comparison to state schools than the comparison to religious schools.
Some examples include lower obesity and more positive locus of control.
    In the comparison with no preschool, Reggio Approach individuals were signicantly more
likely to work more hours than other groups in both the age-30 and age-40 cohorts. For age-30
cohort, the Reggio Approach show a positive eect on high school grade and voting behaviors
relative to people in all three cities who did not attend preschool and a positive eect on locus
of control relative to Parma no preschool group. Negative eects are found for IQ relative to no
preschool group in Parma and Padova, on obesity, volunteering behavior, and number of friends
relative to no preschool group in Parma. For age-40 cohort, the Reggio Approach show additional
positive eect on voting behavior relative to no preschool groups in all three cities, on obesity and
depression score relative to no preschool group in Reggio Emilia, and on high school grade and
marriage relative to no preschool group in Parma and Padova (Table 22).
    Moreover, the age-40 cohort was more stressed from work in comparison to both no preschool
and other preschools, but also reported being more satised with work and their income than those
in Parma and Padova (Tables A39 and A40).
    Comparisons with the age-50 cohort that preceded the Reggio Approach give additional insight
(Table 23). When simply comparing the age-30 and age-40 Reggio Approach people with age-50




                                                 38
Reggio people without accounting for cohort eect, the signicant positive eects are shown on
high school grades, voting behavior, and not being overweight.                    However, without eliminating
cohort eect, the signicantly positive eects are only shown in hours worked per week for both
age-30 and age-40 comparisons, and locus of control and trust score for the age-40 comparison.
        To summarize, our estimation results on adult cohorts show mixed signicance and positive
eect depending on the comparison group.                 However, some of the eects that consistently ap-
pear with dierent comparison group are (i) the negative eect on IQ and (ii) positive eect on
                      33
voting behavior.           A possible explanation for the negative eect on IQ score is that the Reggio
Approach does not explicitly teach predetermined skills, which may be important for cognitive
assessments(Cagliari et al., 2016). A possible explanation for the positive eect of the Reggio Ap-
proach on voting behavior is that the Reggio Approach values children's democratic participation
in the lives of their communities (Lazzari, 2012).

   33
        One possible source of downward bias is that disabled people were enrolled in Reggio Approach schools. We lack
access to the baseline data to control for this potential source of bias.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach preschools from multiple
methods. We compare Reggio Approach individuals with those who attended other preschools. Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model.                       None = OLS estimate with no control variables. BIC =
OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male
indicator, migrant indicator, and ITC attendance indicator.Full = OLS estimate with the full set of controls.
PSMR = propensity score matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Reggio Emilia who
attended other types of preschool. KMR = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals
and individuals in Reggio Emilia who attended other types of preschool. DidPm = dierence-in-dierences
estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio Other - Parma Other). KMDidPm = dierence-in-dierences
kernel matching estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio Other - Parma Other). KMPm =
Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals who attended Parma
preschools.DidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio Other - Padova
Other). KMDidPv = dierence-in-dierences kernel matching estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio
Other - Padova Other). KMPv = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and
individuals who attended Padova preschools.
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach preschools from multiple
methods. We compare Reggio Approach individuals with those who did not attend any preschools. Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model.                        None = OLS estimate with no control variables. BIC =
OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male
indicator, migrant indicator, and ITC attendance indicator.Full = OLS estimate with the full set of controls.
PSMR = propensity score matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Reggio Emilia who
did not attend any preschool. KMR = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and
individuals in Reggio Emilia who attended other types of preschool. DidPm = dierence-in-dierences estimate of
(Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio None - Parma None). KMDidPm = dierence-in-dierences kernel
matching estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Muni) - (Reggio None - Parma None). KMPm = Epanechinikov
kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Parma who did not attend any preschool.
DidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio None - Padova None).
KMDidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Muni) - (Reggio None - Padova None).
KMPv = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Padova who did
not attend any preschool.
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach preschools from multiple
methods. We compare Reggio Approach individuals with those who attended other preschools. Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model.                  None = OLS estimate with no control variables. BIC =
OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male
indicator, migrant indicator, and ITC attendance indicator.Full = OLS estimate with the full set of controls.
PSMR = propensity score matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Reggio Emilia who
attended other types of preschool. KMR = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals
and individuals in Reggio Emilia who attended other types of preschool. PSMPm = propensity score matching
between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals who attended Parma preschools. KMPm = Epanechinikov
kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals who attended Parma preschools. PSMPv =
propensity score matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals who attended Padova preschools.
KMPv     = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals who attended
Padova preschools. Dierence-indierence is not available for this cohort due to non-existence of municipal
preschools in Parma and Padova.
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively.

Note 1: This table shows the estimates of the coecient for attending Reggio Approach preschools from multiple
methods. We compare Reggio Approach individuals with those who did not attend any preschools. Column title
indicates the corresponding control set and and model.                        None = OLS estimate with no control variables. BIC =
OLS estimate with controls selected by Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and additional controls for male
indicator, migrant indicator, and ITC attendance indicator.Full = OLS estimate with the full set of controls.
PSMR = propensity score matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Reggio Emilia who
did not attend any preschool. KMR = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and
individuals in Reggio Emilia who attended other types of preschool. DidPm = dierence-in-dierences estimate of
(Reggio Muni - Parma Other) - (Reggio None - Parma None). KMDidPm = dierence-in-dierences kernel
matching estimate of (Reggio Muni - Parma Other) - (Reggio None - Parma None). KMPm = Epanechinikov
kernel matching between Reggio Approach individiuals and individuals in Parma who did not attend any preschool.
DidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Other) - (Reggio None - Padova None).
KMDidPv = dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Muni - Padova Other) - (Reggio None - Padova None).
KMPv = Epanechinikov kernel matching between Reggio Approach individuals and individuals in Padova who did
not attend any preschool.
Note 2: Both unadjusted p-value and stepdown p-value are reported. ***, **, and * indicate signicance of the
coecients at the 15%, 10%, and 5% levels respectively.

methods. We specify various ways to compare Reggio Approach individuals with age-50 people who did have access
to Reggio Approach preschools. We compare Age-50 individuals, who preceded the Reggio Approach, with
individuals in age-30 and age-40 cohorts who attended Reggio Approach preschools. Column titles indicate the
corresponding control set and and model.            OLS30 = OLS estimate that compares Reggio Age-30 individuals who
attended Reggio Approach preschools with Reggio Age-50 individuals who did not attend any preschool.         DiD30 =
dierence-in-dierences estimate of (Reggio Age-30 Muni - Reggio Age-50 Other) - (Reggio Age-30 None - Reggio

6         Discussion
A clear pattern emerges from the results reported in the previous section. The estimates show that
the benets of attending Reggio Approach preschools relative to not attending any preschool are
greater than the benets of attending Reggio Approach preschools relative to attending alternative
preschools. This pattern is true for both the age-30 and age-40 cohorts. However, the disparity is
more pronounced for the older of the two cohorts. The pronounced dierence in results for the age-
40 cohort suggests that, at least for this cohort, the Reggio Approach was of suciently dierent
quality that it improved outcomes of its students relative to those who did not attend preschool.
However, the quality dierence between the Reggio Approach and alternative programs was not
suciently large to result in substantial positive dierences in outcomes across these groups.
         As previously noted, one possible explanation for this pattern is that over time the dierent
preschools programs within Reggio Emilia and across northern Italy improved their program qual-
ity and adopted administrative and pedagogical features that are the key features of the Reggio
Approach. For instance, as noted in Section 2, religious preschools made signicant eorts to im-
prove their program quality in the 1990s by enhancing teacher training. Similarly, state preschools
also improved their quality by decreasing teacher-child ratios in the 1990s. To the extent that these
features improve later life outcomes, we should expect the commonalities of features to narrow
the gap in outcomes between the Reggio Approach and alternative programs.                           This narrative is
consistent with these results.
         The evidence of benecial eects for the older cohorts suggests that the story of diusion
better explains the broad pattern of evidence than the common founder story. Note, however, that
diusion appears to be rapid. An alternative explanation is that the dierent programs evolved from
a common stimulus independent of the Reggio Approach because of common social and intellectual
inuences in northern Italy.           The three cities were in close geographical proximity to each other
thereby, making it easier for ideas to be transmitted between the cities, and to inuence by a
common source of ideas and social action. Malaguzzi actively promoted his ideas in the 1960s and
1970s (Cagliari et al., 2016). In part, because of his activities, the Reggio Approach has received
substantial publicity. This made it dicult for neighboring cities to ignore its features. It is also
possible that there was reverse-diusion. Perhaps important features were borrowed and adopted
by Reggio Approach programs from non-Reggio Approach schools.
         Our evidence suggests that the features of the progressive education model of the Reggio
Approach not found in the comparison groups do not substantially contribute to boosting the
studied outcomes. However, compared to no preschool, there are substantial benecial eects of
the Reggio Approach (and other approaches) on child welfare.
         Our evaluation highlights concerns in the program evaluation literature about the importance
of accounting for alternatives in control groups. Most controls receive alternative treatments. This
                                                 34
problem is pervasive in the literature.               It would have been desirable to nd control groups less
likely to be inuenced by the Reggio Approach. An extensive search was made within Italy but
did not prove fruitful in locating more distant locations in Italy with general economic and social
characteristics similar to those in Reggio.
         In addition, the response rate to the primary survey was low (roughly 56%). The information
available to us prevented us from adjusting for non-response. Similarly, outmigration rates in our
cities are substantial, especially for the adolescent and adult cohorts.                   We were unable to nd
data on the outmigrants or to adjust for their characteristics.                  Selective migration and selective

bias.

response likely bias our results, but in unknown ways. These selection indicators are similar across
all three cities. Finally, the Reggio Approach emphasizes creativity and prioritization of enrollment
for children with disabilities. We did not adequately survey creativity nor determine the variation
across programs in enrollment of children with disabilities.
    For all of these reasons, any conclusion about the eectiveness of the Reggio Approach must
remainat bestprovisional. We clearly nd that access to some form of infant-toddler care and
preschool at the level found in northern Italy is benecial.
