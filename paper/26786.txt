Between Firm Changes in Earnings Inequality: The Dominant Role of Industry Effects

                                          ABSTRACT

We find that most of the rising between firm earnings inequality that dominates the overall
increase in inequality in the U.S. is accounted for by industry effects. These industry effects stem
from rising inter-industry earnings differentials and not from changing distribution of
employment across industries. We also find the rising inter-industry earnings differentials are
almost completely accounted for by occupation effects. These results link together the key
findings from separate components of the recent literature: one focuses on firm effects and the
other on occupation effects. The link via industry effects challenges conventional wisdom.

I. Introduction
       Recent findings emphasize that much of rise in earnings inequality is accounted for by

rising between firm inequality (see, Song et. al. (2019), Barth et. al. (2016)). This follows an

earlier literature emphasizing the importance of rising between firm effects for earnings

inequality (e.g., Dunne, Foster and Haltiwanger (2004), Davis and Haltiwanger (1991)). Rising

between firm inequality might arise from many factors. It might reflect changing quasi-rents

either from changing worker shares or changing productivity and profitability dispersion. It

might reflect changes in the skill mix and skill prices in the labor market that manifest

themselves unevenly across firms. For example, changes in technology and globalization can

change the structure of production along with the relative demand for skills.

       We provide evidence that most (about 75%) of the rising between firm inequality is from

rising inequality across detailed 4-digit NAICS industries. Most of this rise in inequality across

industries is due to rising inter-industry earnings differentials and not due to changing

distribution of employment across industries. We also find that the rising inter-industry earnings

differentials are almost completely accounted for by occupation effects. For the raw rise in

rising inter-industry earnings differentials, we find that about 92% of the increase is accounted

for by occupation effects. About 66% of this is due to changing occupation mix across industries

and 27% due to changing occupation mix differentials given the existing differences in the

occupation mix across industries.

        Even after we control for detailed firm-level controls, 48% of the overall rise in between

firm inequality is due to rising inequality across detailed industries. About 94% of this residual

rise in inter-industry earnings differentials is accounted for by occupation effects. In this case,

about 26% of this is due to changing occupation mix across industries and 68% due to changing



                                                                                                      1
occupation mix differentials given the existing differences in the occupation mix across

industries.

           Our findings build on and bring together two core components in the recent literature on

rising earnings inequality. We link together the dominant role of between firm effects (e.g.,

Song et. al. (2019)) with the increasingly dominant role of the change in occupational mix and

differentials (e.g. in the handbook paper in Acemoglu and Autor (2011)). However, the link is

via industry effects which these seminal papers argued are unimportant. 1 The finding that

industry-level effects play a dominant role is important because it implies that the sources of

rising earnings inequality are working through channels involving structural change at the

industry-level.

           Our novel findings relative to the literature are accounted for by our use of high quality

detailed industry data for firms from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and the Bureau of the

Census. Song et. al. (2019) use the SSA data which is very high quality matched employer-

employee data in terms of tracking workers and firms but, as we discuss below, industry codes in

the SSA data are known to be of inferior quality. Even with arguably inferior industry codes,

follow up work by Bloom et. al. (2018) note that industry codes exhibit an especially high degree

of missingness in their analysis. Acemoglu and Autor (2011) use household data (e.g., ACS and

Decennial) with occupation codes and broad (one-digit) industry codes from self-reporting by

households. Such codes are also known to be of inferior quality and one-digit is too coarse to

capture the effects we detect. 2 In addition to taking advantage of high quality industry codes for

firms from BLS and Census, we also take advantage of the Occupational Establishment Survey

(OES) data that provides high quality occupation codes by high quality detailed industry codes.

       While we challenge the conventional wisdom that between industry effects are

unimportant, in many respects we build on the findings of this literature. Acemoglu and Autor

(2011) find especially large increases in employment and earnings for professional, technical and

management occupations while occupations such as sales, production, operators and clerical

workers experience declines. They suggest these patterns point towards a conceptual framework

that emphasizes the distinction between tasks and skills. Consistent with their findings, we find

that the occupations with the sharpest rise in earnings differentials that differ by industry are

managerial, professional and technical with occupations like production and sales being left far

behind. Our contribution is to integrate the changing role of occupations with the rise in between

firm and in turn between industry inequality. Our findings show that the changing demand for

tasks as evidenced in the changing occupational mix and occupational differentials is closely

linked to between firm and between industry inequality.

       Likewise, our findings build on the seminal findings of Song et. al. (2019). Beyond

demonstrating that rising inequality is mostly accounted for by rising between firm inequality,

they use an AKM decomposition of earnings to show that much of this increase is accounted for

by increased sorting and segregation across firms. Our findings suggest that the increase in

sorting and segregation is between industries as well as between firms. In addition, the increased

sorting and segregation between firms and industries must be consistent with the dominant role

of changing occupation mix and differentials between industries. Taken together, these findings

provide substantial guidance about where to look for the ultimate sources of rising inequality.

       For our analysis, we exploit the matched employer-employee data from the Longitudinal

Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) program at Census to revisit these issues along with

other rich data sources at Census. These include access to the industry codes used by both BLS



                                                                                                    3
and Census, as well as to the firm-level industry codes from SSA on a limited basis. We match

the findings of the recent literature showing a dominant role for between firm effects in

accounting for rising earnings inequality across workers. However, our findings depart from the

SSA based analysis in finding the dominant role of between industry effects in accounting for the

rising between firm inequality. In turn, the dominant role of industry effects enables us to

integrate the OES data at the 4-digit NAICS level. This enables our investigation of the

changing role of occupation effects within detailed industries.

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section II describes the data infrastructure. Section III

presents the main results of the paper showing the dominant role of between firm effects in

accounting for rising overall earnings inequality, the dominant role of between industry effects in

accounting for rising between firm inequality, and the dominant role of between occupation

effects in accounting for between industry effects. Section IV presents an accounting

decomposition. Our focus in this analysis is to decompose the contribution of industry and

occupation effects into that accounted for by changing composition vs. changing earnings

differentials by industry and occupation. As part of this analysis, we also investigate the

contribution of industry effects in accounting for rising between firm earnings inequality with

and without a rich set of firm controls. In turn, we also examine the contribution of occupation

effects in accounting for rising inter-industry earnings differentials both without and with firm

controls. Section V presents sensitivity analysis using alternative industry codes including the

SSA codes (as Census obtains these codes from SSA as part of their processing). Section VI

presents concluding remarks.

II. Data Infrastructure

        The Longitudinal Employer Household Dynamics (LEHD) is a longitudinally linked

employer-employee dataset created by the U.S. Census Bureau as part of the Local Employment

Dynamics federal-state partnership. The data are derived from state-submitted Unemployment

Insurance (UI) wage records and the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data.

Every quarter, employers who are subject to state UI laws -- approximately 98% of all private

sector employers, plus state and local governments -- are required to submit to the states

information on their workers (the wage records, which lists the quarterly earnings of every

individual in the firm) and their workplaces (the QCEW, which provides information on the

industry and location of each establishment). The wage records and the QCEW data submitted

by the states to the U.S. Census Bureau are enhanced with census and survey microdata in order

to incorporate information about worker demographics (age, gender, and education) and the firm

(firm age and firm size). Abowd et al. (2009) provide a thorough description of the source data

and the methodology underlying the LEHD data. A job in the LEHD is defined as the presence

of an individual-employer match, and earnings is defined as the amount earned from that job

during the quarter.

        Because states have joined the LEHD program at different times and have provided

various amounts of historical data upon joining the LEHD program, the length of the time series

of LEHD data varies by state. The data used here are private sector data from the 20 states that

have data available from 1996:Q1 through 2015:Q4. 3




3
  These 20 states are: CA, CO, CT, HI, ID, IL, KS, LA, MD, MN, MO, MT, NC, NJ, NM, OR, RI, TX, WA, and
WY. These 20 states account for roughly 46 percent of national employment. The time series of employment from
these 20 states closely tracks the national time series of total private sector employment published by BLS.

                                                                                                            5
        We use full quarter jobs in our analysis, where a full quarter job is defined as a

contemporaneous employer-employee match that also exists in the previous quarter and in the

following quarter. The underlying assumption is that individuals in full quarter jobs are working

all 13 weeks of the quarter, which avoids the issue of not knowing the number the weeks worked

during the quarter for individuals who start a job or end a job during that quarter. Restricting to

full quarter jobs is similar in spirit to the full-time or full-year restriction used when analyzing

inequality with household survey data. In the 1996:Q2 ­ 2015:Q3 time period, we have 4.9

billion jobs and 3.3 billion full quarter jobs in our 20 state LEHD data.

        We impose several recodes to the LEHD earnings data. First, to minimize the effect of

outliers and smooth the first two moments of the earnings time series, we topcode earnings at the

99.5th percentile of the state-year-quarter distribution. Second, all of our analysis uses the natural

log of real earnings, where nominal values are converted to real using the 2015:Q3 CPI-U-RS

deflator.

        We merge the quarterly LEHD with the annual revenue-enhanced Longitudinal Business

Database (RE-LBD). The RE-LBD is the Census Bureau's business register with information on

a firm's real revenue per worker, which we refer to as labor productivity. In all our analysis, we

use the enterprise as the definition of the firm, where an enterprise is defined as an aggregation

of Employer Identification Numbers (EINs). The merged LEHD ­ RE-LBD data contains

annual observations for the years 1997 through 2013. 4

        Using annual observations in our analysis requires us to choose an earnings measure from

the quarterly LEHD. We use Q1 full-quarter earnings in each year. Our key findings in Table 1

are not sensitive to whether we use Q1, Q2, Q3, or Q4 full quarter earnings. Furthermore, many


4
  The source data for revenue in the RE-LBD are sometimes missing, and we use a propensity score weight to
correct for this issue.

                                                                                                             6
of our key findings are not sensitive to whether we sum the LEHD quarterly earnings into an

annual measure of earnings with a minimum earnings threshold. Annual earnings are used by

Song et.al (2019) using SSA data, as well as by Abowd et.al (2018) using LEHD data. The key

results in Table 1 change dramatically when no minimum earnings threshold is applied to annual

earnings data, most likely due to a decline in short-duration jobs and thus a compositional change

in the lower part of the earnings distribution during the 1997 ­ 2013 time period (see Hyatt and

Spletzer, 2017). Song et. al. (2019) also impose a minimum earnings threshold. 5

         Industry codes play a fundamental role in our analysis. Our basic results use

establishment-level industry codes from the BLS QCEW program, aggregated to the enterprise

level. Aggregation from establishment level data is done using maximum employment (for

example, if an enterprise has N>1 establishments with N>M>1 industry codes, the industry code

with the maximum employment is chosen for the aggregation). In some of our sensitivity

analysis, we use industry codes from the Census' RE-LBD and from the Social Security

Administration ­ these alternative industry codes are described and analyzed in section V.

         Almost all of our analysis uses the variance as the measure of earnings inequality. 6 This

is done because of the simple formula where the variance of individual earnings can be

decomposed into variance within firms and variance between firms:

                             var(Wif) = var(Wif ­ Wf) + var(Wf)                     (1a)

where "i" refers to the individual and "f" refers to the firm. Furthermore, letting "k" refer to

industry, we can further write this variance formula as:




5
  In unreported results, we find that our results are very similar if we use exactly the same type of minimum earnings
threshold as Song et. al. (2019).
6
   We have also calculated the {10th, 50th, 90th} percentiles from the LEHD full quarter earnings and find they are
similar to the published {10th, 50th, 90th} percentiles of weekly earnings of full-time workers from the Current
Population Survey (CPS) (see Appendix Figure A.1).

                                                                                                                    7
                var(Wifk) = var(Wifk ­ Wfk) + var(Wfk - Wk) + var(Wk).       (1b)

Calculating this variance decomposition in each year, and letting  denote changes across time,

we have

             var(Wifk) = var(Wifk ­ Wfk) + var(Wfk - Wk) + var(Wk).                 (1c)

The increase in the variance of individual level wages can be decomposed into a change within

firms (the first term on the right hand side of equation 1c), the change between firms within

industries (the second term), and the change between industries (the third term).

       The variance components in equation (1c) can be estimated multiple ways. They can be

computed directly from the LEHD individual-level data ­ this is what we do in Table 1. The

firm-level and industry-level terms on the right hand side of equation (1c) can also be computed

from firm-level data with appropriate employment weights. The industry-level term can also be

computed from firm-level employment-weighted regression analysis with industry fixed effects ­

this is what we do in Table 2.



III. Main Results: The Dominant Role of Industry and Occupation Effects

       Table 1 presents the main results of the paper. Reported in Table 1 are a series of

variance decompositions of the changes in earnings inequality. The top panel depicts the

variance of (log) earnings per worker within and between firms (using the enterprise definition of

firms described above) and within and between industries in 1997. The estimates in the top

panel of Table 1 coincide exactly with the terms in equations (1a) and (1b) above. The middle

panel presents an analogous variance decomposition for 2013, and the third panel is merely a

first difference of the estimates in the top two panels. Between 1997 and 2013, overall earnings

inequality increased by about 17.2 log points (the third panel of Table 1). About 74% of this


                                                                                                   8
increase is accounted for by the rapidly rising between firm inequality. This finding is broadly

similar to the Song et. al. (2019) finding that about 70% of the increase in earnings inequality

from 1981 to 2013 is due to between firm effects (where firms are defined by EINs). 7,8

        Most of the increase in between firm dispersion is accounted for by an increase in

between industry dispersion (third panel of Table 1). Using 4-digit NAICS effects, the fraction

of the rise in between firm earnings dispersion accounted for by between industry effects is about

75%. Even 2-digit effects account for 38% of the rise in between firm inequality, 4-digit effects

account for about 75% of the increase and 6-digit effects account for 82% of the increase. Using

the OES occupation shares by detailed 4-digit industry, the fourth panel of Table 1 shows that

92.1% of the rising between industry dispersion is accounted for by occupation effects. 9

        In short, the striking finding from the recent literature is that most of the rise in individual

earnings inequality is due to rising dispersion between firms. We confirm this using the LEHD

data. Our contribution is to show that a substantial amount of this increase in between firm

dispersion is due to rising dispersion between industries. In turn the latter is almost completely

accounted for by occupation effects. These findings imply that explanations of rising inequality

need to account for jointly the connection between firm, industry and occupation effects. In the



7
  Barth et a. (2016) do not emphasize it but in using the Longitudinal Business Database they find that about 50% of
the increase in between establishment earnings is due to between 4-digit SIC effects for the period 1977 to 2007.
Several differences stand out relative to our study: their earlier time period, their use of establishment-level as
opposed to firm-level data, and importantly their use of SIC codes. The switch from SIC to NAICS yielded much
more detail in the information technology industries outside of manufacturing.
8
  For our sample period, we find that the fraction of the rise in earnings dispersion accounted for by employer
effects increases with using a narrower definition of business. For example, we find that if we use the State UI
Account number (SEIN) that over 90% of the increase in earnings dispersion is accounted for by between SEIN
effects (see Appendix Figure A.2 for details). .
9
  As we describe later in section IV.B, the occupation results require restricting to a slightly narrower set of
industries covered by the OES and covers only the 2002-13 period. However, the 19 industries in the LEHD not
published by the OES are very small, and the overall 2002-2013 increase in variance growth between 4-digit
industries is exactly the same for the larger (304) and slightly smaller (285) sample of industries. The variance
accounted for by occupation effects is from an employment-weighted regression of the industry-level earnings
differentials on shares of employment in each of the 22 occupation groups.

                                                                                                                  9
next section, we provide further details to provide guidance for such explanations. First, we

explore whether the rising contribution of industry effects is derived from changes in the mix of

employment across industries or changes in inter-industry earnings differentials. We find that,

with and without additional firm controls, most of the rising contribution of industry effects is

due to rising inter-industry earnings differentials. In turn, we explore whether the contribution of

occupation effects in accounting for the rising inter-industry earnings differentials is due to

changes in the occupation mix across industries or changes in occupational earnings differentials.

For this analysis, we further explore the patterns that emerge for specific industries and

occupations.



IV. Changing Quantities or Prices?

    A. Industry Effects

         The dominant role of industry effects could be from either changing composition of

employment across industries with different average earnings or changing earnings differentials.

To evaluate this, we use the variance accounting methodology of Juhn, Murphy and Pierce

(1993) (hereafter JMP). We don't pursue the full distribution accounting insights from this

approach but focus on the decomposition of variance. 10 This approach enables us to not only

gain insights into the "price" vs. "quantity" effects but also to investigate whether controlling for

firm-level observables accounts for the observed industry effects. 11

         To be specific, we estimate the following two specifications:



10
   There are some limitations of the JMP decomposition methodology as highlighted by DiNardo et. al. (1996) and
Fortin et. al. (2010). These limitations primarily apply to the full distribution accounting (e.g., decomposing the 90-
50 vs. the 50-10) which we do not pursue.
11
   The ordering of the decomposition potentially matters. We have used the standard approach first accounting for
changing quantities, then prices and finally the residual. We have found that results are robust to changes in the
ordering of the quantity vs. price effects.

                                                                                                                     10
                                    
                              =   +   +                             (2a)

                                    
                              =   +   +                             (2b)

Specification (2a) is a pooled specification with time invariant coefficients with the dependent

variable earnings per worker at the firm-level in each year, X is a vector of firm level controls,

Ind is a vector of industry effects (using 4-digit industries). Specification (2b) permits the effects

of the observables and industry effects to vary over time. All specifications are estimated on an

employment-weighted basis. Specification (2b) can be rewritten as follows:

                                
              =   +   +   -   +  ( -  ) +                                           (2c)

Following JMP, Davis and Haltiwanger (1991) and Dunne et. al. (2004), the changes in

dispersion (either the variance or other moments) can be decomposed into quantity (X and Ind)

effects for average prices ( ,  ), price effects ( and  ) and the residual. The estimation and

decomposition is on an employment-weighted basis to be consistent with the variance

decompositions reported in Table 1.

       The first column of Table 2 shows results for a regression with just 304 industry fixed

effects as explanatory variables. The R-squared for the pooled regression is .5429, implying that

knowing the 4-digit industry explains 54% of between firm earnings dispersion. Not reported in

Table 2 but informative are the R-squareds for the year specific regressions (corresponding to

equation 2b) ­ these are .5363 for 1997 and .5813 for 2013. When multiplied by the

corresponding between firm variances as reported in Table 1, these year-specific R-squareds

show the amount of between-firm variance that is between industries (.5363 * .485 = .260 and

.5813 * .613 = .356).

       The lower panels of Table 2 show the results of the JMP decomposition. First, looking at

the first column of Table 2, we readily observe that this regression based variance decomposition


                                                                                                     11
replicates the finding in Table 1 that industry effects account for about 75% of the rise in

between firm dispersion (as measured by the variance). The additional insight from this analysis

is that only 10% of the 75% is due to changing composition of employment across industries

while 65% is due to changing inter-industry earnings differentials.

        To shed further light on the contribution of industry-effects, we also consider a range of

firm-level controls. Specifically, we include firm-level LN real revenue per worker (labor

productivity), firm age and firm size, and worker mix controls ­ the share of workers at the firm

by worker age (seven age groups), gender, and education (four education groups). 12 We interpret

these as capturing several possible factors underlying the change in firm-level earnings

dispersion. The inclusion of labor productivity captures effects associated with rent-sharing but

might also reflect unobserved worker quality effects. Firm size and age are correlated with

heterogeneity in firm performance. Worker characteristics such as age, gender and education

capture differences in the choice of worker mix across firms.

        Results from this supplementary analysis are reported in column (2). We find that

earnings per worker are higher at firms that have higher labor productivity, are larger, older, have

a higher share of workers in the 25-34 age range, a higher share of males, and more educated

workers. Of more direct interest are the results of the variance accounting decompositions

reported in the lower panels. Even with all controls, industry effects account for 48% of the rise

in between firm inequality. Most of this (41% of the 48%) is due to rising residual inter-industry

earnings differentials rather than changing employment composition across industries.




12
   The LEHD education is directly measured for individuals that have appeared in the 2000 Decennial and ACS.
For other workers it is imputed. Our main findings are robust to exclusion of this variable. We include it to
highlight that the dominant role of industry is robust to inclusion of this control.

                                                                                                                12
         Taking stock, most of the rise in the contribution of industry effects in accounting for

rising between firm inequality is due to a rise in inter-industry earnings differentials. Even with

extensive firm-level controls such as firm performance and firm-worker type composition, the

rise in inter-industry earnings differentials still accounts for most of the increase in the

contribution of between industry effects. 13

     B. Occupation Effects

         To investigate the role of occupations further, we estimate an analogous set of regression

specifications to (2a) and (2b) but now with the dependent variable the industry-level earnings

differential and the explanatory variables the employment shares by occupation and detailed

industry from the OES. Using the same type of JMP style decomposition, we decompose the rise

in dispersion in inter-industry earnings differentials into quantity and price effects. That is, the

contribution of changing occupational distribution across industries and changing occupation

differentials for a given difference in occupational distributions across industries. For these

exercises, we consider two alternative dependent variables. First, the raw inter-industry earnings

differentials without firm-level controls. Second, the residual inter-industry earnings

differentials with all firm-level controls.

         The occupation data by 4-digit industry are downloaded from the BLS website. The

Occupational Employment Statistics (OES) program at BLS publishes employment for 22

occupations for approximately 290 NAICS industries in each year 2002 forward. The 22

occupations are listed in Table 3. After excluding industries 9991 and 9993, there are 285 4-digit


13
   Appendix Figure A.3 depicts the 3-digit NAICS industries with the largest increases (panel A) and decreases
(panel B) in inter-industry residual earnings differentials (relative to the mean) after controlling for all firm-level
controls. Also, reported are the changes in inter-industry earnings differentials for these same industries without
controls. The rank ordering and even magnitudes of the changes in inter-industry differentials are broadly similar
with and without controls (Appendix Figure A.4). There is less dispersion in the change in inter-industry earnings
differentials with controls and the slope in Appendix Figure A.4 is less than one ­ both of these findings are
consistent with firm-level controls absorbing some but not most of the rising inter-industry earnings differentials.

                                                                                                                      13
industries published in the OES each year 2002 to 2013. The 19 industries in the LEHD data but

not in the OES data are mostly in agriculture. The occupation variables on the right hand side of

the industry-level earnings regressions are the percentage of industry employment in the 22

occupations. 14

         Results from this exercise are depicted in Table 3. The basic results mimic those of

Table 1. 15 Using the raw differentials, occupation effects account for 92% of the rise in

dispersion from inter-industry earnings differentials. However, beyond Table 1, the accounting

decomposition indicates that 66% of this is due to changing occupation distributions across

industries and 27% due to rising occupation differentials. Interestingly, the basic findings in

Table 3 using the raw differentials can be replicated with OES public-domain data (see appendix

B). This highlights one of the reasons that the dominant role of industry effects is important.

Analysis of potential sources can be done with public domain data. Also, it highlights that our

findings are not being driven by the use of the LEHD earnings measures.

          With the residual differentials, occupation effects account for 94% of the rise in between

industry dispersion. 26% of this is due to changing occupation distributions across industries

and 68% due to rising occupation differentials. In short, we account for virtually all of the rise in

inter-industry earnings differentials with occupation effects (with or without controls).

         Table 3 also reports the changing occupation differentials for individual occupations. We

focus on the last column since this includes the firm controls. Since the latter controls for the

age, gender, and education mix of the workforce, this is closer to the Acemoglu and Autor


14
   The OES publishes employment for the 4-digit industry total, as well as for the 22 occupations in the industry.
We create a 23rd occupation category titled "other" which is total employment minus the sum of the 22 published
occupations.
15
   The supplemental decomposition of the contribution of occupation effects into "price" and "quantity" effects is
pushing the data hard given the sample size in Table 3. The F-tests in Table 3 provide reassurance that this
supplemental decomposition yields meaningful insights.


                                                                                                                     14
(2011) findings that report changing occupation differentials with a wide range of similar

controls at the person level. We find sharp increases especially in management but also

substantial increases for business and financial, sciences, legal, and healthcare occupations. In

contrast, occupations such as protective services, sales, and construction experience declines.

These patterns are broadly consistent with those reported by Acemoglu and Autor (2011). Our

contribution is that these changes in occupation differentials reflect changes in occupation

differentials across industries.

         The especially large increases in the occupation differential for management is especially

striking. To explore this further, Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of the management share of

employment by 4-digit industry (x-axis) vs. the inter-industry earnings differentials by industry.

The scatterplot includes both 2002 (black) and 2013 (red) data. We find that it is in industries

with especially large management shares that there is the sharpest rise in inter-industry earnings

differentials between 2002 and 2013. It is this variation that is driving the findings in Table 3 for

management. 16

         Further insights on the rising management differential emerge by considering a modified

regression specification that includes interactions between the management occupation

employment shares and industry dummies. 17 We find (see Figure 2) that the management

differential rises in almost all industries with the exception of Retail Trade. The industries with

especially large increases in management differentials include Information, FIRE, Professional

and Technical Services and Education.




16
   The patterns in Figure 1 are robust to using the inter-industry earnings differentials without firm controls
(Appendix Figure A.5).
17
   For this specification we use 15 sectors as depicted in Figure 2 for the interactions.

                                                                                                                  15
V. Sensitivity Analysis on the Quality of Industry Codes

       As discussed above, both BLS and Census have strong incentives and extensive statistical

programs to assign detailed and accurate industry codes at the establishment-level. For BLS, this

includes the QCEW program along with the Annual Refiling Survey. For Census, the periodic

surveys and the Economic Censuses of businesses provide rich sources of information on

industry codes. BLS also shares their industry codes with Census. Census also obtains codes

from SSA as part of the first step of identifying new businesses. The industry code from SSA is

based on the information provided in the application for a new EIN (the SS-4 form). While SSA

industry codes are a useful first step, Census has a clear hierarchy for industry codes in their

Business Register and their business statistical programs, with the Economic Census (and related

surveys) and BLS codes preferred (see Walker (1997)).

       Here we explore differences in the information content of industry codes from BLS vs.

Census vs. SSA for 2013. We are limited in our analysis of using SSA codes because prior to

2002 Census did not store the SSA industry codes once replaced by either Economic Census or

BLS codes (and after an Economic Census all codes have been replaced for businesses in that

Census). In 2013, we have BLS, Census and SSA codes for all firms that are 14 years old or

less. For this sample, we compute the fraction of the cross sectional between firm dispersion in

earnings accounted for by industry effects using Census, BLS and SSA industry codes (at the 4-

digit NAICS level). Using Census and BLS codes, we find that about 45% of the between firm

variance is accounted for by between industry variation. Using the SSA codes, between industry

variation accounts for only 25% of the between firm variance. Even though this is a limited

exercise, it highlights that the information content of SSA codes in terms of accounting for

variation in earnings across firms is much smaller than that for BLS and Census.



                                                                                                   16
       It still might seem surprising that Song et. al. (2019) attribute only a negligible fraction of

the increase in between firm variance in earnings over time to between industry variation.

However, Bloom et. al. (2018) indicates that the same SSA micro data used in Song et. al. (2019)

has missing industry codes for all new firms post 2002. Their Table 2 shows that this yields that

EINs with missing industry codes increased from accounting for only 4% of total employment in

the 1980-86 period to 24% in 2007-13 in their micro data. Our inference from our analysis is

that even without this substantial missingness problem, the use of SSA codes yields a misleading

characterization of the role of between industry variation in accounting for between firm

variation.



VI. Concluding Remarks

       Our findings integrate two distinct approaches and sets of results regarding rising

earnings inequality. Acemoglu and Autor (2011), both in original research and in summarizing

the literature using household surveys, highlights the increasing role of the changing

occupational mix and returns in accounting for rising earnings inequality post 1980.

Alternatively, Song et. al. (2019) highlights the dominant role of rising between firm inequality

in accounting for rising earnings inequality over this same period.

        Our findings highlight that these results are very closely related in a perhaps somewhat

surprising manner. Specifically, we find that the rise in between firm inequality is dominated by

a rise in between industry inequality. We find the latter is dominated by rising inter-industry

earnings differentials with a more modest role for the changing distribution of employment

across industries. In turn, we find that virtually all of the rising inter-industry earnings

differentials is accounted for by occupation effects. This includes both changing mix of



                                                                                                   17
occupations within and across industries and rising occupation differentials. We find, after

controlling for the mix of workers in terms of age, gender, and education (as well as other

controls), that the occupations with especially sharp increases in earnings differentials that differ

across industries are managerial, business and financial, sciences, legal, and healthcare, with

occupations like protective services, sales, and construction being left behind. The increase in

the management occupation differential across industries is especially striking.

       The somewhat surprising nature of our findings is that these results are related via

structural changes at the industry level. Both of the prior literatures missed this finding

essentially because of relatively limited industry codes in household data and in the SSA firm-

level data. By using high quality industry codes from Census and BLS and in turn high quality

industry by occupation data from BLS we have uncovered this connection.

       Our findings suggest that to be able to understand the changing structure of work across

firms and occupations that one needs to understand the changing interaction between industries

and occupations. Our findings suggest that the framework developed by Acemoglu and Autor

(2011) to understand the changing occupation effects should include an important industry-

specific component. The framework they outline has production activities requiring tasks and

different skills having comparative advantage for alternative tasks. This task based framework

lends itself nicely to considering changes in the structure of production induced by technology,

globalization and other factors. Put differently, this task based framework helps motivate why

changes in inequality associated with the changing role of occupations is linked to the changing

role of firms in inequality. Driving forces such as technology and globalization that induce

changing demand for occupations impact firms differentially. In principle, this differential

impact could be between firms or between industries. Our findings suggest there is a dominant



                                                                                                   18
role for the between industry impact. An important direction for future research is to explore the

changing role of occupations across industries.

Appendix B. Replicating Table 3 results using OES public-domain data

Using the OES public domain data (which includes earnings by industry by year), we can
replicate many of the findings in Table 3. First, we note that the unweighted correlation of OES
industry earnings with our unadjusted LEHD earnings measure is .773. Second, using the OES
earnings measure rather than the LEHD earnings measure in the Table 3 regression yields an R-
squared of .866 (compared to 0.801 in Table 3) and very similar coefficients on the occupation
measures. Furthermore, we get an R-squared of .858 using OES earnings as the dependent
variable and OES employment (rather than LEHD FQ jobs) as the weight in the regression. In
this latter regression that uses just OES data, the accounting decomposition indicates that 97% of
the increase in inter-industry earnings differentials is due to changing occupation distributions
across industries and 14% due to rising occupation differentials, with a negative residual
component of -12 percent.
