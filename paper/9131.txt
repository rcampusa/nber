Investor Behavior and the Purchase of Company Stock in 401 (k) Plans -
The Importance of Plan Design

                                            ABSTRACT


     Using panel data for nearly 1,000 companies during 1991 to 2000, this paper documents that the

average share of participant’s discretionary 401(k) contributions in company stock was almost 20

percent, and then relates this share to plan design features and firm financial characteristics. We find

that the number of investment alternatives offered, n, and whether the company requires some of the

match to be in company stock are key factors of the share of total contributions in company stock. We

cannot reject the hypothesis that participants invest 1/n of their contributions in company stock. In

addition, participants do not offset an employer match in company stock with a smaller share of their

own contributions to company stock, contrary to efficient diversification. Workers also appear to view

other plan restrictions as providing cues about the desirability of purchasing company stock. Thus, plan

design is very important in determining the share of 401(k) assets in company stock.

I. Introduction

           The dramatic collapse of Enron has led to heightened scrutiny of the structure of

401(k) plans and how participants make their investment decisions. Currently, about 45

million workers participate in a 401(k)-type plan, and aggregate assets of these plans

totaled $1.97 trillion in 2001, surpassing assets in traditional defined benefit pension

plans. The trend away from defined benefit towards 401(k)-type plans has forced

employees to assume greater responsibility for their retirement savings, requiring them to

make decisions about how much to save and how to save it. In addition to traditional

investment choices of money market, broad bond and equity funds, employees are often

also given the option to invest their 401(k) contributions in company stock. The Profit

Sharing Contribution / 401(k) Council of America reports that company stock is offered

as an investment option in 72 percent of retirement plans with more than 5,000

participants.1

           Markowitz (1952), Sharpe (1964), and Lintner (1965) would predict that

employees would forego investments in their own company’s stock in favor of diversified

portfolio. Indeed, when one considers the human capital and other forms of wealth many

workers already have tied to their firm, investment in company stock would seem an

inefficient choice. However, many workers do not have well-diversified retirement plan

portfolios. At Enron, for example 62 percent of 401(k) assets at year-end 2000 were held

in company stock. Part of the high concentration reflected that the company match was

made in Enron shares, but Enron employees were also allocating a large fraction of their


1
    Among plans with 1,000-4,999 participants, 40 percent offer company stock as an investment option. The
smaller percentage offering company stock likely reflects that many of the smaller plans are offered by
private firms.
                                                                                                              2

own, discretionary contributions to company stock as well.2

           Such a high concentration of new contributions and existing holdings of

retirement assets in company stock is not unique to Enron. For example, at General

Electric, Home Depot, and Pfizer, more than 75 cents of every dollar in defined

contribution plan assets is held in company stock. At the other end of the spectrum, less

than one-eighth of 401(k) assets are in company stock at Dell, Halliburton, and Xerox.

More broadly, several recent studies estimate that among plans that offer company stock

as an investment option, the fraction of assets held in company stock totaled between 30

and 40 percent in recent years, with a large range across companies.3

           Holding a portfolio tilted towards company stock is costly to employees, as they

are exposed to firm-specific risk that could have been diversified away. This lack of

diversification will result in an ex ante loss in welfare, and as Meulbrook (2002)

illustrates, the cost to workers can be substantial. To help understand why employees

invest in company stock and the variation in contributions to company stock across firms,

this paper examines factors that influence the investment decisions made by participants

in retirement plans. The paper first documents that the average share of participants’

discretionary 401(k) contributions in company stock was 19 percent at a sample of 994

publicly-traded companies during 1991 to 2000. We then examine how this share is

related to the design of the 401(k) plan and financial characteristics of the firm. In

particular, we examine whether purchases can be explained by the number of investment

    In 1998, the last date for which detailed contribution data are available in the company’s 11-k filing,
employees allocated 20 percent of their own contributions to company stock purchases.

America.
                                                                                            3

options available, whether there are constraints on investment choices, whether the

company matches with company stock, previous stock returns, and other firm financial

characteristics. The primary contribution of this paper is to document how company

stock purchases are related to the features of the 401(k) plan.

       Two recent papers have focused specifically on how company stock purchases in

401(k) plans respond to firm performance. Benartzi (2001) looks at employee decisions

to purchase company stock in 401(k) plans at 136 S&P 500 companies in 1993, and finds

greater discretionary purchases of company stock when the company makes its matching

contribution in company stock, and when previous company stock returns have been

high. He attributes this pattern to two factors: a tendency for investors to view employer

stock contributions as an explicit endorsement of the stock, and a tendency for investors

to extrapolate forward previous returns. This tendency to extrapolate forward past

returns is consistent with “representativeness” theory (Tversky and Kahneman, 1974), in

which people overestimate the probability that stock returns in the next period will be

high if previous returns were high. Sengmuller (2001) examines employee purchases of

company stock in retirement plans for a panel of 239 firms in the S&P 500 index at some

point between 1994 and 1998. Similar to Benartzi, he finds that past returns are a strong

predictor of purchases of company stock, but the relationship is weaker after 1993.

       We extend this research in a number of ways by focusing on plan characteristics,

in addition to firm performance, as determinants of company stock purchases. First, we

examine how the number of investment alternatives offered in 401(k) plans affects the

purchase of company stock. If participants simply follow a naïve 1/n diversification rule,

where n represents the number of investment options, fewer investment alternatives
                                                                                            4

would lead to higher purchases of company stock. Second, our time series data also

allow us to examine how purchases of company stock respond to the introduction of more

investment alternatives. For example, as a company increases the number of alternatives

from 5 to 8, does the allocation to company stock decline, and is the effect immediate?

We also consider carefully other plan features, such as whether the plan imposes

minimum or maximum limits on purchases of company stock. Third, we examine, like

Benartzi (2001) and Sengmuller (2001), whether purchases of company stock are higher

when the employer matches in company stock. However, our time series data also permit

us to examine how purchases respond to the introduction of employer matches in

company stock, alleviating the interpretation problem that the positive correlation

observed in the cross-section could reflect an underlying employee preference for

company stock in firms that offer a match in stock. Fourth, we use a considerably larger

data set than previous studies. Our sample is based on 11-k data filed by publicly-traded

companies describing company stock purchases from 1991 to 2000. Our sample has

3,412 observations covering 994 different firms; the years with the greatest number of

observations, more than 600 each, are 1997 and 1998.

       We find that the most important determinant of the share of contributions

allocated to company stock is the number of investment options, n, offered by the plan.

We cannot reject that employees follow a naïve 1/n diversification rule, investing 1/n of

their contributions in company stock. This result is consistent with Benartzi and Thaler

(2001) that find that the share of 401(k) assets in equities is largely determined by the

number of equity-type investment options offered. In addition, we find that employees

do not offset employer matches in company stock, leading to a substantial concentration
                                                                                             5

of 401(k) assets in company stock. Finally, we find evidence that employees appear to

interpret an employer match in company stock as the provision of implicit investment

advice, and increase their purchases of company stock accordingly. Additional evidence

on the effects of other restrictions, such as minimum or maximum limits on company

stock purchases, suggest that workers take investment cues from restrictions present in

the plan, also supportive of an endorsement effect.

       These results indicate that companies have very large effects on 401(k) asset

holdings through the choice of some key plan features. So, we then turn the question

around – what determines the number of alternatives that a plan offers, and what

determines whether companies match with company stock? One specific area we address

is whether these plan design features are affected by past firm performance, and thus

whether the relationship we find between company stock purchases and plan features is

merely reflecting past firm performance. We also examine whether the decision to match

in company stock could be driven by the desire of firms to reduce future taxes.

       Understanding what factors determine the decision to purchase company stock in

401(k) plans is important, as investing a large fraction of retirement savings in company

stock can impose substantially large ex ante welfare costs on employees if its leads to

lack of diversification. Our analysis will also be of use in evaluating the proposals that

have been made, in the wake of Enron’s dramatic failure, to establish new regulations for

participant investments in retirement savings plans. Section II describes our sample and

provides summary statistics. Section III discusses what the previous literature, both from

finance and psychology, suggest may motivate the purchase of company stock, and then

presents the empirical analysis of company stock purchases in retirement plans. Given
                                                                                           6

the importance of plan design, we examine what determines important plan features such

as the number of options offered and match policy in Section IV. A summary of our

findings and public policy implications follows in Section V.



II. Data and Sample Characteristics

       Our primary data source for investments in defined contribution plans is the 11-k

form that some plans are required to file with the SEC. This form is required of plans for

which the investment option to purchase company stock is deemed an offering of

securities. In general, companies that offer participants the choice to purchase company

stock with their own contributions and that issue shares for the plan, rather than purchase

shares on the open market, are required to file an 11-k. Data on plans that exclusively

buy shares on the open market are not publicly available, so our results may or may not

generalize to this population. If the employer contribution is in company stock, but the

plan does not allow employees to purchase stock, it would generally not be deemed an

offer of securities, and thus the plan would not be required to file. In our discussion with

SEC staff, the 11-k obligation is almost a fact and circumstance determination, and the

company has an obligation to determine whether it needs to file. Because 401(k) plans

are subject to ERISA, the information provided on the 11-k is in accordance with ERISA

reporting guidelines. In 1999, there was a change in ERISA reporting requirements that

led to fewer companies reporting contributions by asset category, leaving us with

contribution data for far fewer plans in 1999 and 2000 than in 1998.

       The data we collect from 11-k filings include total participant contributions,

participant contributions allocated to company stock, employer contributions, employer
                                                                                                               7

contribution in the form of company stock, total plan assets, company stock assets,

number of investment alternatives, and descriptions of limits on purchases of company

stock. As in Benartzi (2001), we collect data for the largest plan at each company.

Information on stock prices and standard deviation of returns are from the Center for

Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. Other firm financial information,

including market-to-book ratios, assets, cash flow (net income plus depreciation), and

employees are from Compustat.

           Starting with all U.S. firms listed in Compustat any year from 1993 to 1999, we

identify firms that filed an 11-k at least once during 1994 to 2001 (table 1).4 We were

able to hand-collect data for 994 companies, yielding 3,412 firm-year observations. Most

of the data are in the period 1993 to 1998. On average, there are 3.4 observations per

firm, with 41 percent of the firms with 2 observations or less and 59 percent of the firms

with 3 observations or more. The sample represents a broad cross-section of industries

(table 2), with the largest concentrations in the financial and technology sector. As noted

in the last line of the table, only about one-fourth of our sample was ever a member of the

S&P 500. Our sample is considerably larger than samples for Benartzi (2001) or

Sengmuller (2001), which included only firms that were a member of the S&P 500 in

1993 and at any time during 1994-98, respectively.

           To further characterize our sample, we focus on firms in the sample in 1998, one

of the more recent years with the largest number of firms. Almost one-half of the firms

were not in the broad S&P 1500 index in 1998, indicating that the companies are


4
    11-k filings are available on the SEC’s Edgar website starting in 1994. The 1994 filing will report plan
activity during 1993. Some firms will report not only plan activity during the past year, but plan activity
over the past three years. Thus, we have 190 observations for 1992 and 51 observations for 1991.
                                                                                                       8

considerably smaller than those examined in previous studies (table 3a). As compared to

firms in the S&P 1500, and all publicly-traded firms, there are somewhat fewer

technology firms. As expected, the firms in our sample are smaller, measured by both

assets and employees, and have slightly lower market-to-book ratios than S&P 1500

firms (table 3b). As compared to all public companies, however, the firms in our sample

are larger.

           Recall that, in general, companies that issue shares for their retirement plan, rather

than purchase shares on the open market, are required to file an 11-k. This raises the

potential that the sample could be biased to firms that do not repurchase stock at all.

However, as shown in the final row of table 3b, roughly half of the firms in the sample

repurchased stock in 1998 (just evidently not in conjunction with their retirement plan).

The share repurchase yield (an estimate of the fraction of shares repurchased) for the

sample was 1.8 percent in 1998, similar to the yield for the S&P 1500.

           We also compare our sample of plans to those at publicly-traded firms as reported

on Form 5500 filed with the Department of Labor.5 In the aggregate, for our sample of

the largest plans at 667 companies in 1998, total plan assets were $274 billion,

representing about 40 percent of the $698 billion in plan assets at all publicly-traded

companies (table 3c). Total contributions by participant and company for our sample

totaled $15.5 billion, as compared with $49.2 billion for publicly-traded firms.

Estimates from the Department of Labor for 1998 for all US companies, public and

private, show $1.65 trillion in assets and $135 billion in contributions.

           For our sample of 667 companies in 1998, company stock in aggregate totaled

5
    Publicly-traded companies on the DOL Form 5500 data set were identified by whether they had a CUSIP,
and by matching EINs with those in Compustat.
                                                                                                             9

$102 billion, representing 37 percent of plan assets. Purchases of company stock as a

percent of total participant contributions are 24 percent. These averages are similar to

those in the samples analyzed by Benartzi (2001) and Sengmuller (2001).6 The

Department of Labor 5500 data indicate that $273 billion of $1.65 trillion of 401(k)-type

assets, or one-sixth, was held in company stock, likely because smaller, privately-held

firms do not offer company stock. The estimated share of defined contribution plan

assets held in company stock at all public firms is 39 percent, similar to the share for our

sample.



III. Empirical Analysis of Purchases of Company Stock

A. 401(k) Plan Design

           Table 4 summarizes features of the 401(k) plans that could affect the participants’

purchases of company stock. As suggested by Benartzi and Thaler (2001), one of the

most important features that guide employee contributions is the number of investment

alternatives. For our sample, the average number of investment options offered is 7.5,

with a 25th and 75th percentile range of 5 to 9. These figures are similar to the 170 plans

studied in Benartzi and Thaler (2001) that offered on average 6.8 investment options in

1996. By sample construction, company stock is one of those investment options. For

six percent of the firm-year observations, company stock was offered as an option in the

plan for the first time.

           A few companies have explicit guidelines regarding company stock purchases.


6
    Benartzi found that company stock represented 33 percent of assets, and Sengmuller found a ratio of 35
percent in 1998. Based on contributions, Benartzi finds that 24 percent of participant contributions went to
company stock and Sengmuller reports 24.5 percent in 1998.
                                                                                           10

For about 4 percent of the firm-year observations, there is a ceiling on how much of the

employee contribution can be made in company stock, ranging from 10 to 50 percent of

total contributions. Among plans with a maximum restriction, about two-fifths have a

ceiling of 50%, and an additional three-tenths have a ceiling of 25%. Less than one

percent of firms put a floor on purchases of company stock. In addition, about one

percent of firms provide an incentive to purchase company stock, through a discount or

larger employer match.

       Employers made contributions to the retirement plan in 94 percent of our firm-

year observations, similar to other studies that find that nearly all employers offer a

match (e.g., Holden and VanDerhei, 2001). In our sample, 48 percent of employers that

granted a match required that at least part of the match be in company stock, with nearly

two-fifths of the firms requiring that the entire amount of employer contributions be in

company stock. Only about 2 percent stipulate that some part of the employer match not

be invested in company stock.

       The remainder of this section examines how these features affect purchases of

company stock, starting with the most prominent features, the number of investment

options and restrictions on the employer match.

B. Previous literature and the effect of the number of investment alternatives

       This section tests whether the number of options offered in the 401(k) plan

influences investment in company stock. The principal hypotheses we examine are

diversification and familiarity. The fact that the participant already receives income from

the firm and has a substantial human capital investment in the firm a priori nearly rejects

the hypothesis that any company stock purchases could be consistent with the efficient
                                                                                           11

diversification outlined by Markowitz (1952), Sharpe (1964), and Lintner (1965). Given

their wealth already tied to the firm, efficient portfolio theory would suggest that

employees should invest minimal, if any, contributions to company stock to avoid ex ante

welfare costs due to the lack of portfolio diversification.

       Benartzi and Thaler (2001) provide evidence of naïve diversification behavior.

They find that the share of 401(k) assets held in equities is largely determined by the

number of equity-type investment options offered, consistent with participants following

a naive 1/n diversification rule, in which assets are divided equally among the n

investment options offered in the retirement savings plan. Goetzmann and Kumar (2001)

also argue that investors use naive diversification rules in their equity investment

accounts. Specifically, investors will hold numerous stocks but they fail to take into

account the correlations among the stocks they hold, and thus are under-diversified,

perhaps because of high costs of acquiring information to make more informed decisions.

       There is some evidence, however, suggesting that participants view company

stock as an asset separate from other equities. Benartzi and Thaler (2001) find that when

plans do not offer company stock as an option, the assets are split about equally between

equity and fixed-income securities; but, among plans that offer company stock,

participants do not reduce non-company equity securities – instead, company stock

accounts for 42 percent of assets, and the remaining 58 percent is split roughly evenly

between other equities and fixed income securities.

       Investing in company stock may be viewed differently from investing in other

equities for several reasons. The distinction could owe to pressures that a participant may

feel from the firm or colleagues to purchase stock and increase share ownership, or that
                                                                                                        12

the investment is considered to be less risky because of familiarity with the company.

Heath and Tversky (1991) and Langer (1975) present evidence that people suffer from an

“illusion of control” and behave as though familiar gambles are less risky than unfamiliar

gambles, even when they assign identical probabilities of success to the two gambles.

Heath and Tversky (1991) further conclude that this tendency to bet on the familiar

“might also help explain why investors are sometimes willing to forego the advantage of

diversification and concentrate on a small number of companies which they are

presumably familiar.”

           There is much evidence of investing in the familiar “home team,” perhaps

because investors perceive familiarity to imply less risk. Huberman (2001), using data on

the ownership of Regional Bell Operating Companies, finds that investors have a strong

tendency to invest in stocks with which they are geographically proximate and familiar.

The unwillingness of investors to diversify internationally - French and Poterba (1991) is

one of many studies to document the home country bias – is another classic example of

investing in the familiar. Coval and Moskowitz (1999) find that U.S. investment

managers exhibit a strong preference for locally headquartered firms in their portfolios.7

           In the context of a 401(k) plan, a preference for investing in the familiar would

translate into purchases of own company stock, which is likely the most familiar

investment option. Indeed, annual surveys by John Hancock Financial Services regularly

find that participants view company stock as the most familiar investment option in their

retirement plan. Given their familiarity with company stock, it is thus not too surprising

that workers tend to underestimate its risk. As figure 1 shows, participants surveyed by

    Investing in the familiar may also be driven by asymmetric information between local and nonlocal
investors, as Coval and Moskowitz suggest for U.S. investment managers.

Vanguard view company stock as safer than a diversified portfolio of stocks as well as

the stock of any other individual company. Further, Benartzi (2001) finds that investors

overestimate the likelihood that company stock will outperform the overall stock market.

       These results suggest that employees may view company stock in its own

category separate from other equities, and thus may not adopt the simple 1/n

diversification rule for purchases of company stock. If workers adopt the 1/n rule, then

the addition of investment options should reduce purchases of company stock. However,

if the purchase of company stock is driven by the familiarity hypothesis, then adding

more unfamiliar investment options will likely not affect company stock purchases very

much. Since the additional options will likely be less familiar to the employee than

company stock, the additional options will likely not siphon contributions away from

firm stock.

       Because we have annual data on plan contributions, we are able to test

implications of the naïve diversification and familiarity hypotheses. Findings by Benartzi

and Thaler (2001) are based on asset holdings, rather than new flows (i.e., contributions

into the plan). Using data on asset holdings could obscure the strength of the relationship

between options offered and allocation decisions. The allocation of assets may just

reflect differences in past returns since participants are slow to rebalance their portfolios

(Samuelson and Zeckhauser, 1988). Our data on flows to 401(k) plans permit us to

directly observe the underlying relationship between plan attributes and subsequent

investment decisions.

       The distribution of the dependent variable -- the fraction of participant
                                                                                                           14

contributions in company stock -- is shown in table 5.8 This variable represents the

fraction of total firm-wide employee contributions allocated to company stock. For our

sample, the average fraction of participant contributions invested in company stock is 19

percent (median 14 percent), with a standard deviation of 17 percent. In interpreting our

results, we often use this measure to represent the investment decision of the “average”

employee. Unlike the grant of employee stock options, which are highly skewed towards

upper management, nearly all employees are eligible to participate in 401(k) plans.

Moreover, contributions are more evenly distributed across the workforce, since tax-

deferred employee contributions are capped (e.g., the limit was $10,000 per employee in

1998), and there are limits relating to participation by highly compensated employees

relative to other employees so as to preserve the tax-exempt status of the plan.

           To determine the importance of the number of investment options, we first

tabulate the average fraction of participant contributions invested in company stock by

the number of investment options offered (table 6). As shown in more detail than in table

4, the average number of investment alternatives offered in our sample is 7.5, the median

is 7, and the 1st to 99th percentile range is 3 to 18. Since we have a panel data set,

multiple observations from the same firm over time are used in calculating the averages.

Thus, we allow for within-firm correlation when calculating the standard error, as we do

for all pooled regressions throughout the paper.

           We find a very striking and strong relationship between the number of investment

8
    This variable has been adjusted for the 92 observations in which company stock was available as an
investment option for only part of the year. For example, if company stock was only available for a quarter
of the year, then total employee contributions for the year will be divided by four when calculating the
share of contributions allocated to company stock. This adjustment is made to reflect that company stock
was a possible choice for only one fourth of the year.
                                                                                             15

options and the fraction of company stock purchases: The purchase of company stock

monotonically declines with the number of investment options offered. If the plan offers

two investment options (company stock and some other asset), the average fraction of

company stock purchased is 59 percent; if the plan offers three options, the fraction is 36

percent; if the plan offers four options, the fraction is 26 percent; and so on until the share

levels out at 13 percent, when plan offerings include 10 or more options. For the firms

that offer 2 through 6 options, we cannot reject that employees adopt a 1/n investment

strategy for company stock. We obtain a similar pattern of results when looking at the

median share of participant contributions allocated to company stock across the number

of investment options.

       We next run a regression of the fraction of employee contributions in company

stock on 1/n, for individual years of the sample and the full sample. We specify the

number of investment alternatives as 1/n, not n, because we would expect a nonlinear

relationship between the number of investment alternatives and allocations to company

stock. If the naïve diversification hypothesis is true, an additional option should reduce

contributions to company stock more if the plan initially had only three options than if it

had ten options. Indeed, a coefficient of one on the 1/n variable would suggest that

workers, on average, adopt a naïve diversification rule for company stock. In contrast,

the familiarity hypothesis would predict a coefficient of less than one, and likely close to

zero. Recall under this hypothesis, employees will tend to allocate contributions to

company stock because of its familiarity, and because additional options will likely be

less familiar to the employee, the additional options will likely not reduce contributions

to company stock.
                                                                                                            16

           Results are reported for the years 1993 to 1998 and the pooled sample from 1991-

2000 (table 7). As suggested by our earlier tabulations, 1/n is a very significant indicator

of employee purchases of company stock. For each year and the pooled sample, the

coefficients are close to one, and we cannot reject that the coefficient equals one for any

of the regressions.9 These estimates imply that when the typical plan offers 5 investment

options, for example, the expected share of participant contributions in company stock is

20 percent. We also find that 1/n by itself explains roughly 10 percent of the variation in

the dependent variable.10 A direct interpretation of these results is that plans can

substantially reduce the share of company stock purchases simply by increasing the

number of investment options. These results provide strong support for a naive

diversification heuristic.

           A possible objection to this interpretation is that the number of investment options

might reflect the demands of participants, and that the empirical associations we

document simply reflect that employees with preferences for many investment options

work for companies that offer 401(k) plans with that design. For example, firms with

less risk-averse workers that want to invest in company stock may not feel the need to

offer many other investment options. We would then observe a negative correlation

between the number of options and the investment in company stock, just as predicted by

the naïve diversification hypothesis, but the interpretation of the correlation would be

different.

9
    We obtain similar coefficient estimates, statistically indistinguishable from one, when we weight
observations by the number of firm employees and the total amount of employee contributions.
10
     We also note that once we control for the number of investment options offered, the estimated constant in
the regression is not statistically different from zero in most of the single-year regressions, and while
significant in the pooled regression, its value is fairly close to zero.
                                                                                             17

           To address this issue, we employ the panel nature of our data set to estimate a

fixed-effects regression, which allows us to characterize the change in employee

purchases of company stock to the change in the number of options available for a given

firm. As shown in the last row of table 7, the coefficient estimate on 1/n is .27 and

significant, suggesting that when the number of investment options increases from 5 to

10, participants on average do not fully adjust their purchases of company stock from 1/5

to 1/10 (20 percent to 10 percent), but only adjust one-quarter of the way. Thus, our

results suggest that participants change their allocations in accord with a naive 1/n

diversification approach, but a full adjustment is not immediate, consistent with

documented behavior of investor inertia.

           To explore this adjustment process further, we regress the change in the fraction

of employee contributions in company stock on the change in the number of options

offered. The regressions include 2,418 firm-year observations for which data on the

contributions are available for at least two consecutive years. Of these, 667 increased the

number of options offered during a one-year period.11 As shown in column 1 of table 8,

the estimated coefficient on the change in 1/n in the concurrent period is .18 and

significant, suggesting that some (but clearly far from all) participants immediately make

an adjustment to their share of contributions going to company stock when the number of

options increases (1/n declines). Columns 2 through 5 regress the cumulative change in

the share of contributions to company stock for two to five years following the initial

change in the number of options offered. Because only observations for which there

were no additional changes in the number of options were used, there is a substantial


11
     A small set of 21 plans decreased the number of offerings.
                                                                                                           18

reduction in the sample size as the period lengthens. We find that by three years after the

initial change, for example, the coefficient estimate climbs to .59, and by five years, the

coefficient is .87, not statistically different from one. The coefficient of .27 in the fixed

effect framework in Table 7 can be viewed as a weighted average of the coefficients in

Table 8, with a higher weight on the coefficients from the one-year after change and two-

year after change regressions.12 It is also worth pointing out that, after controlling for the

effect of the number of options on contribution allocation, there is no additional

difference in the change in company stock purchases between firms that increased

investment options compared to firms that did not change the number of options. This is

reflected by the insignificance of the “Did number of options stay the same?” dummy

variable.

           These findings could be consistent with two explanations. First, some

participants may simply adjust slowly to the new investment options: Only a fraction of

employees may adjust their contribution allocations each year, with some employees

taking up to 4-5 years after new options are added to reduce company stock purchases.

However, there is an alternative explanation that could possibly explain the results in

table 8. Under the alternative, individual participants never change the fraction of

contributions they allocate to company stock in response to new options, and the

estimated coefficients just reflect that as existing participants leave the firm, they are

replaced by new participants who follow the 1/n heuristic. For the table 8 results to

reflect the employee turnover hypothesis, firms on average would have to replace about


12
     Recall the average firm is in the sample 3.4 years, so if the firm changes the number of investment
options during those 3 years it will have one or two observations before the change and two or one
observations after the change.
                                                                                            19

20 percent of their workforce each year, and entirely replace their workforce in 5 years,

an assumption about employee turnover that would seem to be too rapid. For example,

using the Current Population Survey from 1994-2000, Fallick and Fleischman (2001)

estimate that 7 percent of private employees leave their job in a given year, with 5

percent of full-time workers turning over. Thus, these results appear to be more

consistent with a sluggish adjustment by individual employees to changes in the number

of options offered than to employee turnover.

       Recall that we observe only the investment decisions of the “average” worker,

and have no information on the distribution of investments across workers within the

firm. Our results suggest that adding more investment options to the plan reduces the

purchase of company stock on average, not that every worker follows the naïve

diversification heuristic. Thus, because the response to more options could differ across

workers, and we do not have information on asset purchases outside the 401(k), the

welfare implications of adding more options to 401(k) plans are difficult to assess.

       These findings are also consistent with studies that document that participant

behavior is strongly guided by inertia. Samuelson and Zeckhauser (1988) document that

participants are slow to alter existing investments in their retirement plans. Madrian and

Shea (2000) find that the savings behavior of participants in a 401(k) plan at a large

company changed substantially when the plan switched to automatic enrollment. In

particular, a substantial fraction of 401(k) participants under automatic enrollment stuck

with the default contribution rate and the default fund allocation. Choi, Laibson,

Madrian, and Metrick (2001) confirms these results when they expand the study to

include two other firms, and are able to track participant decisions for a longer period of
                                                                                           20

time following automatic enrollment.

C. Effect of Employer Match in Company Stock

       Another key plan feature that could affect the share of participant contributions to

company stock is whether any of the employer match is required to be in company stock.

Diversification theory would predict that a participant’s discretionary contributions to

company stock would decrease to offset a company’s match in stock, i.e., the employee

would act to “undo” the employer’s actions. Contrary to this prediction, Benartzi (2001)

finds that contributions are significantly higher when some of the employer contribution

is required to be in company stock. He finds that the mean allocation of employee

contributions to company stock is 29 percent when some of the employer match is

required to be in company stock, 11 percentage points higher than when the plan allows

the employee free choice to invest the employer match. Supplementing his data with

survey evidence, Benartzi argues that such behavior suggests that employees interpret

company stock matches as an endorsement, i.e., implicit investment advice offered by the

company. In one survey, Benartzi finds that 45 percent of participants would increase

their own allocation to the international stock fund if the employer were to introduce a

match that was all invested in an international stock fund. In another survey, Benartzi

finds that only 3 percent of participants that currently do not receive an employer match

would decrease their own allocation to equities if a match was offered and it was all

invested in a diversified stock fund. Madrian and Shea (2000) also attribute participant

behavior to stay in the default investment vehicle as accepting investment advice on the

part of the company.

       In our sample, 94 percent, or 3,201 firm-year observations included an employer
                                                                                          21

match. As shown in table 9, during 1991 to 2000, 48 percent of the firms required some

part of the match to be in company stock. Among plans with an employer match, the

average fraction of participant contributions in company stock is 15 percent if there is no

requirement that some be in company stock, while the average fraction of participant

contributions in company stock is 23 percent if there is some requirement.

       We estimate a regression of the fraction of participant contributions to company

stock on the requirement that some part of the employer match be invested in company

stock for each year and for the pooled sample to determine how this requirement affects

participant choice. The significant and positive coefficients indicate that employee

discretionary contributions in company stock are significantly higher when some of the

employer match is also in company stock. For the pooled sample, the estimates imply

that discretionary contributions are about nine percentage points higher, a substantial

effect given the sample average of 19 percent. These results are contrary to

diversification, which would predict a negative coefficient as employees offset the

employer match in company stock, but are consistent with the endorsement effect

proposed by Benartzi.

       Again, an objection to the endorsement interpretation is that employees who have

a preference for company stock may work for firms that offer company stock, and the

relationship we document merely reflects the underlying preference for company stock.

Other studies have documented the effects of an underlying strong preference for

company stock or equities, showing that those who hold a high proportion of equities in

pension savings also hold a high fraction of non-pension assets in equities (Bodie and

Crane (1997) and Weisbenner (1999)).
                                                                                             22

       To address this issue, we first use a fixed-effects approach, which focuses on

changes in employer match policy within a firm and thus controls for worker risk

preferences. As shown in the last row of table 9, the estimated coefficient on whether

some of the employer match is required to be in company stock is still positive and

marginally significant, although reduced in magnitude substantially. The key point from

the fixed-effect regression is that employees within a specific firm will not decrease, but

will boost slightly (by 1.6 percentage points), their own allocation to company stock

following a change in match policy to company stock.

       In a second test of changes in match policy on investment decisions, we look only

at firms that adjusted their match policy. We find that adjustments have not been very

frequent: there are only 31 cases in which the employer match went from total choice (all

cash) to some requirement for company stock, and only 33 cases in which the employer

switched from some requirement on company stock to total choice. In table 10, we

regress the cumulative changes for one year up to five years in discretionary

contributions in company stock on the initial change in the employer match, allowing for

different coefficients depending on whether the employer match was changed from total

choice to company stock requirement, or from company stock requirement to total

choice. Similar to the results in the fixed-effects regression, we find no evidence that

employees adjust their discretionary purchases of company stock to offset either the

increased or decreased company stock exposure caused by a change in match policy,

even over a period as long as five years after the change. If anything, there is a gradual

shift of employee contributions to company stock following a switch to a company stock

match, and a gradual movement away from company stock following a switch to total
                                                                                           23

choice (all the coefficient estimates are very imprecise given the small sample of firms

changing match policy).

       These results are more consistent with the endorsement hypothesis than

diversification. First, if participants were guided by diversification they would offset an

increased company stock match by reducing their own contributions. However, if they

view the switch to company stock as an endorsement by the company, they might not

make the offsetting changes. Thus, our result of zero or a slightly positive effect is

consistent with the endorsement hypothesis. Conversely, participants guided by

diversification would boost the share of own purchases of company stock to offset the

decrease in the company match in order to obtain the pre-change level of company stock

purchases. But since we observe zero or a slightly negative effect, it appears that

participants must have reduced their desired total allocation to company stock after the

change, again consistent with the endorsement hypothesis.

        Overall, we find no evidence that workers attempt to “undo” the presence of an

employer match in company stock. Indeed, we find cross-sectional evidence to the

contrary; workers in firms with a match all in company stock tend to put more of their

own contributions in company stock as well. This is consistent with the endorsement

hypothesis. We further find that employees do not change the share of own contributions

put in company stock to offset a change in the match policy of the firm. Our fixed-effects

analysis appears to support the hypothesis that an employer match in company stock is

interpreted as an endorsement by the company, that is, implicit investment advice to

purchase company stock, although inertia could also explain the result. In either case,

employees do little to offset a changed employer match policy. This result means that a
                                                                                             24

switch to a match in company stock will result in a large share of 401(k) assets held in

company stock.

D. Effects of other plan features

       We now expand the analysis to consider the importance of other plan features, as

well as firm performance and other firm-specific characteristics on discretionary

company stock purchases. The results of this analysis for the pooled sample 1991-2000

are in table 11. Other plan characteristics, displayed in the upper panel of table 11, are

the focus of this section. The effect of past firm performance and other firm

characteristics are discussed in sections E and F below.

       Not surprisingly, workers invest less in company stock if it is the first year that it

is being offered in the plan. This inertia effect is sizeable, as the coefficient estimate

suggests that the share of own contributions allocated to company stock is nine

percentage points less if it is the first year company stock is an option in the plan (recall

the unconditional average share is 19 percent).

       As mentioned earlier, a small subset of the plans restrict or encourage investment

in company stock. In particular, the plan may have upper or lower bounds on the amount

participants can put in company stock or provide a financial incentive, such as a discount

or larger match for company stock allocations. It is important to note that companies are

loath to provide any investment guidance to plan participants, most likely because if

firms provide investment guidance to employees, they could be held liable for any poor

investment results (Section 404 (c) of ERISA). Since investment advice is not offered,

plan participants may draw cues from plan features that either encourage or discourage

investment in company stock. Just as the endorsement hypothesis predicts that workers
                                                                                                           25

may view a match in company stock as a signal from the company that its shares are a

good investment, the endorsement hypothesis would also predict that the presence of any

restrictions on company stock purchases would be viewed as a signal that company

shares are not be a great investment.

           As shown in table 11, we find a significant and negative coefficient on the

dummy variable designating the presence of a limit on investment in company stock.

The estimated coefficients for the pooled sample (first two columns), suggest that for the

4 percent of the sample with an explicit limit on the share of employee contributions in

company stock, simply the presence of the limit leads to a reduction in the share by 7

percentage points, from a sample average of 19 percent. However, the amount of the

limit itself does not appear to be important, since the coefficient on the amount of the

limit is insignificant and close to zero. If the limit was binding for all employees, the

coefficient on the limit should be one, as an increase from a limit of 10 percent to 25

percent would increase contributions to company stock by 15 percentage points.

           Conversely, a handful of firms had a requirement that some portion of employee

contributions must be in company stock, with a typical requirement being 50 percent

(with a range of 25 to75 percent).13 The coefficient on the variable designating this floor

on the share of contributions is positive and significant, and suggests that the mere

presence of a floor increases employee contributions to company stock by about 17-19

percentage points, even after controlling for the actual amount of the minimum required

contribution to stock. As expected, we also find a greater share of company stock

purchased at the one percent of observations that provide some type of financial incentive

13
     Most of the plans with this floor are employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) that allow participant
choice, subject to the minimum required investment in company stock.
                                                                                           26

to buy company stock.

       These findings for variables representing a ceiling or a floor provide additional

evidence consistent with endorsement theory: The mere presence of a floor for company

stock purchases appears to be interpreted as implicit endorsement of the firm’s company

stock as a good investment advice, and appears to be followed by employees, and the

mere presence of a ceiling provides an endorsement or reminder to diversify one’s

portfolio, a warning that appears to be heeded.

       Consistent with the earlier bivariate results, whether the plan requires that the

match be in company stock is a significant predictor of the share of contributions in

company stock in the full specification as well. At the other extreme, a small number of

plans, about 2 percent, require a portion of the employer match to not be in company

stock. We find in the cross section that employees of firms that have such a restriction

invest about three percentage points less of employee contributions in company stock,

although the results are not statistically significant (p-value = .19). The effect of

introducing a restriction on workers ability to allocate match contributions to company

stock is more evident in the fixed-effect framework (third column of table 11). If a firm

changes match policy so that part of the match is required to be kept out of company

stock, the allocation of employee contributions to company stock falls a predicted 7.5

percentage points (p-value = .01). Thus, employees appear to take cues from any

introduction of a restriction on company stock investments in the match, and voluntarily

reduce their own, discretionary allocations to company stock as well.

       Most of the results outlined above in the pooled cross-section hold qualitatively in

the fixed-effects framework (third column of table 11) as well. The introduction of more
                                                                                            27

plan options reduces purchases of company stock, while adding incentives to purchase

company stock increases purchases. If match policy is changed so that part of the match

is required to be kept out of (kept in) company stock, the allocation of employee

contributions to company stock is predicted to fall (rise slightly). Since no firm in the

sample introduced, dropped, or changed the amount of the floor/minimum for the

allocation of employee contributions to company stock, the amount and indicator

variables for the floor were dropped from the fixed-effect regression (as was the presence

of a ceiling/maximum for the allocation of employee contributions to company stock).

         Overall, these results provide additional evidence consistent with endorsement

effects regarding match policy. The presence of a floor or ceiling on company stock

purchases affects purchases significantly, even after controlling for the amount of the

limit.

E. Additional effect of firm financial characteristics

         Benartzi (2001) and Sengmuller (2001) have documented that the share of

employee contributions in company stock is higher when previous stock price returns

have been larger. Benartzi (2001) argues that such behavior is consistent with a

representativeness heuristic (Tversky and Kahneman (1974) and Griffin and Tversky

(1992)), whereby investors overweight recent past returns in formulating predictions for

future returns, even when future returns are largely unpredictable. In other words,

workers may view recent past performance as representative of future performance of

their company’s stock. Consistent with this notion, numerous studies find that net

inflows to mutual funds are positively related to past performance (e.g, Patel, Zeckhauser,

and Hendricks (1991), Ippolito (1992), Chevalier and Ellison (1997), and Sirri and
                                                                                                           28

Tufano (1998)). Evidence from surveys of stock investors, replicated in Figures 2-5,

demonstrate that realized returns in the past twelve months are an important and

significant predictor of returns expected in the next twelve months, suggesting that

investors may project forward past growth rates.14

           The bottom two panels of table 11 present the regression coefficients for past

stock returns and the other firm characteristics. Like other studies, we generally find a

positive and significant coefficient on past stock returns. For the pooled cross-section

and the fixed-effect regressions, the coefficient estimates suggest only a 1.9 to 2.0

percentage point increase in the share of employee contributions allocated to company

stock following a doubling in stock price over the past year. This estimate is about one-

third the size of the effect Benartzi found for returns over the past year using a cross-

section of firms in 1993. The relationship between returns and subsequent company

stock purchases appears to have waned somewhat over time.15 Thus, past stock

performance is significant, but the overall effect on the share of contributions to company

stock is not that large.

           The coefficients on other financial variables are in general similar to those found

in previous studies. Employee purchases of company stock, as a share of total

Organization.
15
     Benartzi’s results implied a 6.0 percentage point increase in company stock allocations following a
doubling in stock price over the past year. This estimate was based on a cross-section of 140 firms in 1993
that were members of the S&P 500. When we focus just on the 1993 cross-sectional regression, the
coefficient suggests a 4.3 percentage point increase in the share of company stock purchases following a
doubling in price over the past year (more than double the effect estimated over our full sample). If we
further restrict the 1993 cross-section to the members of the S&P 500, the estimate rises to 5.2 percentage
points.
                                                                                           29

contributions, is higher at larger firms, at firms with higher market-to-book ratios, and at

firms with lower stock price volatility. Most importantly, the addition of these variables

does not alter the significance or estimated magnitude of the effects of the plan

characteristics, such as the number of investment options, which are the focus of the

study. The coefficient on 1/n, which was .87 in the bivariate specification of Table 7, is

essentially unchanged in the full specification that includes other plan and firm

characteristics. Once the number of investment options is included in the regression,

there is no time trend in the share of contributions going to company stock. The year

dummies are both individually and jointly insignificant.

F. More on firm performance and purchases of company stock

       We examine further the effect of past performance by including returns for two

holding periods, in particular for one year and five years. Benartzi (2001) found that

company stock purchases were more sensitive to long-term performance than to short-

term performance. The average past one-year return is 24 percent (median 19) and the

average cumulative five-year return is 154 percent (median 92). There is also substantial

variation in past performance because, in contrast to previous work on S&P 500 firms,

our sample contains some poor performers. Three-tenths of the firms had negative one-

year returns, and one-sixth had negative five-year returns.

       Table 12 presents regression results focusing on the relationship between

company stock purchases and past stock price performance measured over both one year

and five years. Because these purchases are retirement savings, employees may not react

to short-term stock price movements, but may be more apt to adjust contributions in

response to long-term firm performance. Also, if investors are subject to inertia,
                                                                                                             30

adjustments may not be immediate and extend beyond one year. We also split returns by

whether previous returns were positive or negative because participants may view gains

and losses differently, such as the tendency for investors to hold on to losers and sell

winners (Odean, 1998 and Odean, 1999). We also examine past performance relative to

the S&P 500 index in the third column.

           Our results show that the largest and most significant coefficient is on negative

returns in the previous five years, suggesting that participants tend to shy away from

long-term losers. In addition, participants appear to respond to firm performance

asymmetrically. That is, we find no change in the share of contributions going to

company stock following price run ups, but we find that employees pull back

contributions to company stock following long-term price declines. In particular,

coefficients from the full specification presented in column 2 of table 12 indicate that a

90 percent price decline over the past five years is associated with a decline in the share

of contributions allocated to company stock of 8 percentage points.16

           These results are counter to Sengmuller (2001) who finds a larger coefficient on

positive past returns than negative past returns. The difference likely owes to our larger

sample. Our sample suffers from no selection bias, and thus, on average, firms in our

sample likely had worse performance than firms in his sample, which were required to be

members of the S&P 500.



IV. What Determines Plan Design?

           Our results emphasize the importance of the features of the 401(k) savings plan in

16
     We also estimated quadratics of the past gains/losses to allow the coefficient on past performance to
increase with larger returns, but the quadratic terms were insignificant and small in magnitude.
                                                                                              31

determining the share of employee contributions allocated to company stock. Because

the features go far in explaining average levels and the cross-sectional variation in levels

of company stock purchases, it is important to understand how companies determine their

plan features. To some extent, we also want to evaluate whether plan features might

themselves reflect past firm performance, which would cloud the causality of the

relationship between contribution decisions and plan features.

A. Determinants of number of investment options offered

           First, we examine whether firm financial performance can explain any of the

variation in the number of investment options offered. As shown in table 13, we regress

the inverse of the number of investment options offered on firm characteristics and past

stock returns. Estimated coefficients indicate only one consistently significant variable:

firms offered more options in later years. In particular, the estimated coefficient for 2000

in the cross-section specification is -.17. Relative to 1991, the omitted year, the

coefficient implies that the number of options increases from roughly 3 (approximately

the inverse of .30) to 8 (approximately the inverse of .30-.17=.13). No doubt that the

increase in the number of option alternatives over time was associated with the

proliferation of different types of mutual funds offered over the past decade. For

example, the ICI reports that the total number of mutual funds rose from 3,405 in 1991 to

8,171 in 2000. In addition, fund types defined by investment objective (with at least 50

funds) rose from 19 categories in 1990 to 33 categories in 2000.17 Firm stock returns,

market-to-book, cash flow, and the standard deviation of stock returns appear to have no

effect on the number of investment options offered. Firm size, measured by the log of the

book value of assets, is significant in the pooled cross-section, but the estimated effect is

very small.

B. Determinants of employer match required to all be in company stock

           1. Effects of cash constraints, share ownership, and dividends

           Determinants of whether the employer match is required to all be in company

stock could be guided by two models. First, a firm that is cash-constrained may require

that the employer match be in company stock because the firm would be unable to match

in cash (i.e., allow investment choice). This model would predict that firms with less

cash flow will be more likely to offer a match in company stock. In this case, the

company match serves as a source of internal financing, as cash-constrained firms issue

shares in lieu of cash for the employees’ retirement fund.

           Alternatively, companies that have a large value in growth opportunities and

intangible assets may find it beneficial to increase share ownership of its employees, due

to the asymmetric information between insiders (employees) and outside shareholders

(Holmstrom and Milgrom (1987)). This model would predict that firms whose value is

comprised of intangible assets and growth opportunities, and hence more uncertainty

about true value, will be more likely to offer a match in company stock in order to

increase insider ownership. However, while increasing stock-based wealth of top

executives may be important to outside shareholders, the benefits of doing this for lower

level employees, whose effort will have less effect on stock price, is less clear.

           We estimate a regression for whether the firm requires the employer match to all

be in company stock (right panel of table 13).18 We find that indicators of firms that

     We estimate a linear regression to provide an easy-to-interpret estimate of the marginal effects of firm
                                                                                             33

might benefit from higher share ownership by employees are not important – estimated

coefficients on market-to-book and the standard deviation of stock returns, proxies for

firms with potential asymmetric information problems, are insignificant. The results also

suggest that firms do not require the employer match to be in company stock because of

low cash flow. In the cross-sectional regressions, results show, if anything, a positive

relationship between cash flow and employer match requirements in company stock. In

the fixed effects regression, the coefficient on cash flow is negative, but it is insignificant.

In addition, past stock price performance is not an important indicator of match policy.

While returns over the past five years are significant, a quadrupling of stock price over

the past five years would reduce the probability that the firm matches with only company

stock by only 2.7 percentage points (-.009*3.0), a small amount relative to the average of

39 percent.

         Thus, we find no evidence that firms offer a match in company stock to combat

informational asymmetries between insiders and outsiders, or to alleviate their financial

liquidity constraints. An alternative hypothesis is that companies offer the employer

match in company stock because there is a tax benefit from doing so. Firms that pay

dividends may have an incentive to match in company stock because, while dividends

paid on stock are not usually tax deductible, if firms contribute their employer match to a

leveraged employee stock ownership plan (ESOP), meaning the matching contributions

are all in company stock, dividends paid on that stock may be tax-deductible (Beatty,

1995, and Schultz and Francis, 2002). When an employer makes a contribution of stock

for an employee, the value of the stock contributed by the employer is tax-deductible in


characteristics on the choice of match policy. A Probit model yields very similar results.
                                                                                                           34

the year of the contribution, just as would a contribution in cash. However, all future

dividends paid on that stock are tax deductible as well, in effect a “double” deduction.

Because the value of the stock is the discounted stream of dividends, the dividends are

used as a tax deduction twice - originally when the value of the stock is deducted and

then again when the dividend is actually paid.

           We find, shown in table 14, that companies that require all of the company match

be in company stock were significantly more likely to pay dividends and had a higher

dividend yield in every year of the sample (shown for 1993-1998), and for the pooled

sample. When we add either a dummy variable for whether the firm pays dividends or

add the dividend yield to the regression to help explain whether companies require the

match to all be in company stock (table 15), we find a positive and significant coefficient

on the dividend variable.19 If the firm pays dividends, the increase in likelihood that the

employer match will be required to be all company stock is 10 percentage points (the

sample average is 39 percent). A one percentage point increase in the dividend yield is

associated with a 3 to 4 percentage point increase in the probability that a firm’s match is

all company stock.

           Thus, whether the firm pays dividends is a significant determinant of the

employer match in company stock. This link to dividends likely reflects that when the

match is in company stock, then the match contributions can be paid into a leveraged

ESOP. This is desirable, because then the subsequent dividends paid on the stock will be

considered compensation expense and thus will reduce a firm’s future taxes.


19
     We also estimated the regression including the return variables. Their inclusion reduces the sample size
by a quarter to 2294 observations. The coefficient on the pay dividends dummy is .094 (standard error
.049) and the variable on the dividend yield is 2.80 (standard error of 1.20).
                                                                                           35

       While firms may enjoy the tax benefit, this match policy is potentially costly to

employees. Because employees do not appear to offset company stock matches, the

match in company stock could lead to a significant concentration of 401(k) assets in

company stock, and thus a very risky retirement portfolio for employees. However, to

the extent that the company match is larger when it is all given in company stock, a

higher employer contribution may offset some of the costs of having a significant

concentration of retirement plan assets in company stock. Perhaps employers pass the tax

benefit to employees via more generous matching contributions.

       To assess whether firms that match only with company stock make larger

contributions, we compare the ratio of the amount of the match to the amount of

participant contributions for firms that require all of the match in company stock with

firms that do not (table 16). Our results indicate that when the match is all in company

stock, the mean match-to-participant contribution ratio is 46 percent (median 37 percent),

nearly identical as that for plans without the requirement, which have an average match-

to-participant ratio of 48 percent (median 36 percent). These results are confirmed when

we examine the size of the match the year before and the year after a change in match

policy (right panel of table 18). Thus, we do not find that the match is larger for

companies that match in company stock.

       2. Effects of market timing

       Market-timing behavior has been observed for grants of employee stock options

to top executives, as stock prices tend to rise following new grants (Yermack, 1997). A

natural question to ask is what is the stock price performance following a change in

match policy.
                                                                                                             36

           To test market timing in the context of match policy, we examine stock price

returns for one year and two years following changes in the company match policy –

from total choice to all in company stock and from all in company stock to total choice.

There are 19 firms in the sample that switch their match policy from offering a match all

required to be in company stock to offering a match with employee investment choice for

all of the match (or vice versa), note the exact date of the switch in the 11-k filing, and

have returns on CRSP for at least two years before and two years after the switch.20

While our sample size is small, because not many firms have changed their company

match policy, we find no evidence that firms timed the change of their match policy to

benefit their employees (tables 17a and 17b).

           Returns for companies that switch from choice to all stock show substantially

poor performance after the switch. The company stock underperforms the market (table

17b), as well as the stock’s own historical performance (table 17a) following the switch

of match policy to all stock. On the other hand, companies that switch match policy from

all stock to allowing choice subsequently enjoy large positive returns, both relative to the

market and to their own past performance. Again, caution should be exercised when

viewing these findings due to the small sample size. At a minimum, however, both of

these results run counter to the hypothesis that a firm may switch the match to all

company stock prior to the public revelation of good news (and the subsequent run up in

price) and allow employees to scale back their company stock purchases by eliminating a



20
     We identified 32 firms that switched match policy from offering a match all required to be in company
stock to offering a match with total employee investment choice (or vice versa). Five of these firms were
dropped because we could not identify the precise date of the switch in policy. An additional eight firms
were dropped due to an absence of return data for two years before and after the switch.
                                                                                           37

match all in company stock ahead of bad news (and the subsequent fall in price).



V. Summary

         We have examined the purchase of company stock in 401(k) plans using panel

data from 1991-2000 for 994 companies. This research examines features of the 401(k)

plan in addition to firm performance as factors determining the decision to purchase

company stock, and includes many more companies than previously studied. Our main

conclusion is that the characteristics of the 401(k) plan strongly influence investment

decisions by participants because they follow naïve diversification rules and view plan

features as implicit investment advice by the firm. Thus, differences in plan design can

help explain differences in the concentration of company stock in retirement plans across

firms.

         Our principal findings are these: First, the number of investment alternatives

offered by the plan is a very significant indicator of the share of contributions to company

stock. We find evidence consistent with investors following naive diversification rules,

and that the share of participant contributions allocated to company stock is substantially

lower in plans that offer more alternatives. We cannot reject the simple “1/n”

diversification rule for company stock in our cross-sectional analysis, indicating that

workers appear to put 1/n of their contributions in company stock, where “n” is the total

number of investment options. Following an increase in fund options within a firm,

employees appear to continue to adopt the “1/n” strategy. However, the full reduction in

the share of contributions allocated to company stock in response to an increase in

investment options takes about 4 to 5 years, likely due to inertia in investor behavior.
                                                                                          38

       Second, employees do not offset the employer’s match. Employees put a larger

share of their own contributions in company stock when the match is required to be in

company stock. In addition, a switch from allowing the employee to invest the match

without restriction to requiring that the match be all in company stock is not offset by the

employee investing less of his own contributions in company stock.

       Third, we present evidence that is consistent with endorsement effects.

Employees appear to interpret restrictions on asset allocation provided by the firm as

providing implicit investment advice regarding the purchase of company stock. In the

cross-section, the employees of firms that have a match in company stock put more of

their own contributions in company stock. The employees of firms that limit the share of

own contributions that can be put in company stock or require that part of the match not

be in company stock invest less of their own contributions in company stock – even after

controlling for the amount of the limit. These findings are consistent with Benartzi

(2001) and Madrian and Shea (2000) that found evidence that participants appear to

interpret the match and the default contribution allocation as implicit investment advice.

       Because the plan features are so important in determining the purchase and

holdings of company stock, we examine what determines the number of investment

options offered and the employer match policy. In terms of number of investment

options offered, our results suggest that firms have offered more options in recent years,

possibly because the proliferation of mutual funds has made it easier to offer many

alternatives. In terms of the employer match, we find no evidence that firms offer an

employer match all in company stock because they are cash constrained, and thus have

no other means of making a match. Rather, the only significant determinant of the
                                                                                            39

employer match in company stock is whether the firm pays dividends. This link to

dividends likely reflects that when the match is in company stock, then the match

contributions can be paid into a leveraged ESOP. This is desirable, because then the

subsequent dividends paid on the stock will be considered compensation expense and

thus will reduce a firm’s future taxes. We also test if firms switch to an employer match

in company stock ahead of good news, perhaps to benefit employees, but we find no

supporting evidence.

       These results have several implications for public policy. In response to Enron’s

collapse, there has been much concern expressed about the concentration of 401(k) assets

held in company stock. Given the naïve diversification strategies employees appear to

use, absent an explicit cap on company stock purchases or holdings, policy makers could

improve diversification by requiring firms that offer company stock to also offer a

minimum number of alternative investment funds. President Bush has recently proposed

that firms urge workers to diversify their retirement portfolio by including reminders in

the quarterly plan reports. Our results concerning the importance of endorsement effects

on purchases of company stock suggest that such a quarterly reminder could have an

effect on asset holdings. In addition, President Bush has proposed a partial privatization

of Social Security in which two percent of salary would be placed in a worker’s account

to be invested by the worker. The evidence in this paper and others that workers appear

to adopt naïve diversification strategies suggests that the number and type of investment

options the government chooses to offer will have an important effect on the ultimate

composition of the assets in workers’ accounts.

CS/T = employee contributions in company stock / total employee contributions.
1 / #options = 1 / total number of investment options offered.
“Did number of options stay the same?” is a dummy variable that will test whether, after controlling for the
effect of the number of options on contribution allocation, there is any additional difference in the change
in company stock investment between firms that did not change the number of options relative to those
firms that did.
Specifications (1) – (5) examine how the fraction of employee contributions invested in company stock
changes (∆ CS/T) in response to a change in the number of options during year t (∆ 1/funds). There are
2418 firm-year observations where data on the firm’s plan is available for the next year. Of these 2418
observations, 1730 had no change in the number of investment options offered, 667 increased the number
of options offered, and 21 decreased the number of funds available to employees.
To isolate the effect of a specific increase in investment options on contribution allocation decisions over
time, specifications (2) – (5) focus on firms that had no subsequent change in the number of investment
options after the initial change during time t. It also includes the firms that had no change in fund options,
even in year t. Thus, specification (5) measures how the fraction of contributions allocated to company
stock has changed over the next five years for firms that either made no change in fund options or the group
of firms that increased investment options (decrease in 1/funds) during year t, but had no further change in
the number of options after year t.

CS/T = employee contributions allocated in company stock / total employee contributions.
 “Did employer switch from no requirement to required company stock?” represents whether such a change
occurred from year t to t+1.
There are 2247 firm-year observations where data on the firm’s plan is available for the next year, and the
employer made contributions both years. Of these 2247 observations, 2183 had no change in the employer
match policy from this year to next year, 31 went from having no restrictions on how employer
contributions can be invested this year to requiring at least part to be in company stock next year, and the
remaining 33 switched from having a requirement that at least part of the employer contributions had to be
in company stock to having no restrictions on investment choices for employer contributions next year.
To isolate the effect of a specific change in the employer match policy on contribution allocation decisions
over time, specifications (2) – (5) focus on firms that had no subsequent change in the match policy after
the initial change during time t. It also includes the firms that had no change in fund options, even in year t.
Thus, specification (5) measures how the fraction of contributions allocated to company stock has changed
over the next five years for firms that either made no change in match policy or the group of firms that
changed match policy during year t, but had no further change in match policy after year t.

Stock gain over past year and stock gain over past 5 years equal the respective return over that period if the
return was positive, and are zero otherwise. Thus, these variables are either zero or positive.
Stock loss over past year and stock loss over past 5 years equal the respective return over that period if the
return was negative, and are zero otherwise. Thus, these variables are either zero or negative.
The stock return relative to the S&P 500 index is broken up into two variables to allow for differential
effects for firms that outperformed the S&P 500 versus those that underperformed the S&P 500.
“Other variables” include all the other explanatory variables included in the Table 11 regressions.
All regression estimation allows for heteroskedasticity. The standard error calculation in the pooled cross-
section regressions allows for correlation across observations of the same firm as well.

The match policy regressions are estimated using firm-year observations where the employer made
contributions to the plan.
All regression estimation allows for heteroskedasticity. The standard error calculation in the pooled cross-
section regressions allows for correlation across observations of the same firm as well.

The match policy regressions are estimated using firm-year observations where the employer made
contributions to the plan.
Regressions estimated over pooled data 1991-2000. All regression estimation allows for
heteroskedasticity. The standard error calculation in the pooled cross-section regressions allows for
correlation across observations of the same firm as well.
