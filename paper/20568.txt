                                            ABSTRACT

We propose and estimate a novel specification of the labor demand curve incorporating search frictions
and the role of entrepreneurs in new firm creation. Using city-industry variation over four decades,
we estimate the employment – wage elasticity to be -1 at the industry-city level and -0.3 at the city
level. We show that the difference between these estimates likely reflects the congestion externalities
predicted by the search literature. Also, holding wages constant, an increase in the local population
is associated with a proportional increase in employment. These results provide indirect information
about the elasticity of job creation to changes in profits.

      Introduction
      Policy makers interested in how wage costs affect employment decisions could be ex-
      cused for being confused by what the economics literature has to tell them. At one
      extreme, studies using variation in minimum wages and payroll taxes tend to find only
      small wage elasticities of employment demand (Blau and Kahn, 1999). On the other
      hand, studies of regional responses to labor supply shocks generally find small wage im-
      pacts and large employment changes, which is suggestive of very elastic labor demand
      (Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Krueger and Pischke, 1997).1 Further variation in estimates
      arises in the literature because different studies use different units of observation, time
      frames and identification strategies, often without a clear reference to theory to support
      their choice. Our goal in this paper is to propose and estimate a new specification for
      labor demand that is based on a comprehensive view of the labor market and that is
      capable of reconciling different findings in the literature.
          A natural starting place to look for answers regarding the wage elasticity of employ-
      ment is the micro literature on firm demand for labor (see, for example, Hamermesh
      (1993, Chapter 4)). The goal of this literature has traditionally been to estimate how the
      average firm responds to a change in wages, generally holding total output constant. It
      is a literature that is very close in spirit to the literature estimating production func-
      tions. Knowing the properties of a firm’s production functions, such as the extent of
      capital labor substitutability, is certainly interesting. However, it is unlikely to provide
      a complete assessment of how total labor demand within a market responds to a change
      in wages. For example, a production function perspective of labor demand will necessar-
      ily miss any adjustment on the extensive margin since entry and exist decisions of firms
      are excluded. Moreover, when discussing responses at the market level, it is not very
      interesting to keep the output produced by firms fixed.
          A firm perspective on labor demand may also differ from a market perspective be-
      cause of search and matching frictions. When adopting a firm perspective, a change in
      wage is viewed as affecting the firm’s employment decision, but this employment deci-
      sion is not allowed to have any external effects on the employment decisions made by
      other firms. However, in the presence of search and matching frictions, an increase in
      the employment of one firm has a direct externality effect on the employment decisions
      of other firms, even holding wages fixed, since it increases market tightness and thereby
      increases the cost of recruitment. Such a mechanism may imply a difference between
      the market response to a change in labor costs and the simple sum of isolated firm re-
      sponses. In summary, if one is interested in how labor demand in a market responds to
      wages, one must move away from a perspective focused at the individual firm level and
      instead adopt an approach that explicitly takes into account the many channels through
  1
    The two extremes are captured in the minimum wage literature on one end (where studies commonly find
either small positive or small negative elasticities) and the literature on city adjustments to shocks on the
other (where, for example, Card (1990a) finds virtually no wage response to the Mariel Boat-lift supply shock
in Miami).


                                                     1
       which changes in wages cost can effect employment decisions. Accordingly, our approach
       will be to derive an empirically tractable specification of the market demand for labor
       that takes into account several different margins of adjustment.2
           The labor demand specification we propose is built from micro-foundations and in-
       corporates four main determinants of employment. There is obviously a direct wage
       effect of the kind that is central to any study of labor demand. In our framework, this
       effect will capture adjustments on both the intensive and entry margin of firm decisions.
       Second, there is a labor market tightness effect aimed at capturing the congestion ex-
       ternalities emphasized in the search and matching literature.3 Third, we also include
       population size as a determinant of employment demand. From the perspective of the
       traditional labor demand literature, this is unconventional because one would typically
       expect population size to determine labor supply not labor demand. However, once one
       models the process of firm creation explicitly, and recognizes that entrepreneurs may
       be a limiting factor in job creation, it becomes necessary to include population size as
       a determinant of employment demand since it reflects the size of the pool of potential
       entrepreneurs. Finally, there are the effects of technological change that will appear in
       the error term of our specification.
           In the empirical section of the paper, we estimate our labor demand specification at
       both the industry-city level and at the aggregate city level using data from the 1970,
       1980, 1990 and 2000 US Censuses and the 2007 American Community Survey. Our
       approach is to treat the cities as observations on a set of local economies, allowing
       us to identify within-city general equilibrium effects that interest us. Since we look
       at changes in employment outcomes over 10-year periods, our focus will clearly be on
       medium-run adjustment, and, for this reason, our approach will downplay certain ad-
       justment costs that have been central to the dynamic labor demand literature that gen-
       erally focuses on much higher frequency decisions (Cooper, Haltiwanger, and Willis,
       2004; King and Thomas, 2006; Kramarz and Michaud, 2010, for example).
           As is common in all studies of demand or supply, the key difficulty is finding con-
       vincing data variation that allows consistent estimation of the causal impacts of the
       variables of interest. To this end, we rely on a set of instruments that are similar in
       spirit to that first proposed by Bartik (1991) to identify each of our key labor demand
       determinants. The instruments we build use developments at the national level to pre-
       dict local outcomes and rely on the identifying assumption that changes in productivity
       at the local level are independent of past levels of local productivity. We discuss the
       plausibility of this assumption, which is certainly questionable, and provide a very in-
       formative over-identification test. To identify wage effects, we build two instruments
       that are based on our earlier work on search models in a multi-sector context, which we
   2
     Our focus on medium run wage effects on employment differentiates our work from studies of regional
adjustment to aggregate labor demand changes (Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Bartik, 1993, 2009) which mainly
focus on unemployment dynamics.
   3
     In many environments this type of effect is unidentified. However, by exploiting data at the industry-city
level, we will show that we can identify such an effect.


                                                      2
      discuss in more detail below (Beaudry, Green, and Sand, 2012, hereafter BGS). To iden-
      tify the labor market tightness effect, we exploit the commonly used Bartik instrument.4
      Finally, to identify an effect of population size on labor demand, we use a variant of the
      commonly used ethnic enclave instrument from the immigration literature (which, we
      show, is also a Bartik-style instrument) along with instruments based on climate.
          Since our main focus in this paper is on consistently estimating the wage elasticity
      of labor demand, it is worth providing some extra detail on our identification strategy
      for these wage effects up front. In our earlier work (BGS) we argue that wage patterns
      in the US indicate that wages are at least partially the outcome of a bargaining process
      that takes place at the industry-city level. In that process, the outside option of workers
      is an important determinant of the wage. In BGS we point out that the outside option
      for workers in a particular industry-city cell is better if the industrial composition of
      employment in the city is weighted toward high-paying industries. That is a worker
      in, say, construction can bargain a better wage if the city he lives in includes a high
      paying steel mill instead of a lower paying textile mill, since one of his outside option
      is to move to the steel mill. BGS show how to build instruments for wage changes that
      are based on this insight.5 These instruments are of a similar form to the classic Bartik
      instrument in the sense that they rely on an assumption that productivity growth in
      a city is not related to the initial employment composition in the city. Since we can
      build more than one instrument based on this outside option insight, this allows us to
      use an over-identifying test to evaluate the plausibility of the underlying identification
      restrictions. We show that this test is quite strong and that it is passed easily in our
      data.
          The main empirical results of the paper are as follows. We find a statistically sig-
      nificant and economically meaningful negative trade-off between city-level employment
      rates and wages over 10 year periods. When looking at the industry level within a city,
      we find that a 1% increase in the wage in an industry-city cell leads to a decrease in the
      employment rate in that cell of approximately 1%. This result holds both when we look
      at all industries and when we look at only industries producing highly traded goods.
      When looking at the city level, we find that a 1% increase in the wages within all in-
  4
      This instrument was first presented by Bartik (1991) and has been used in much subsequent work (Bar-
tik, 1993; Blanchard and Katz, 1992; Bound and Holzer, 2000, for example). The Bartik instrument corre-
sponds to a prediction of employment growth in a city based on industrial growth rates at the national level
combined with start-of-period employment composition in the city.
    5
      The idea of obtaining identification using variation in workers’ outside options has precedents in the
literature examining union wage and employment contracts (e.g., Brown and Ashenfelter (1986); MaCurdy
and Pencavel (1986); Card (1990b)) as these papers exploit measures of alternative wages outside the specific
contract in their estimation. Card (1990b) finds that the real wage in manufacturing has a positive effect
on wage changes in the Canadian union contracts he studies, which echoes the mechanism underlying our
basic source of identification. In a similar spirit, MaCurdy and Pencavel (1986) obtain estimates of produc-
tion function parameters from data on wage and employment setting for typesetters when allowing for an
alternative wage to effect the efficient outcome through an impact on union preferences.

       dustries in a city leads to only a 0.3% decrease in the employment rate.6 We argue that
       the smaller effect at the city level compared to the industry level reflects the impact of
       search externalities. In particular, we interpret this later result as reflecting that when
       wages increase in all industries, this leads to a less tight labor market, thereby reducing
       search costs to firms. This fall in search costs partially compensates for the increase in
       wage costs, leading to a smaller fall in employment than would have happened if wages
       only increased in a worker’s own industry.7 Finally, we find that an increase in popu-
       lation holding wages constant leads to an approximately proportional increase in labor
       demand. 8 We interpret this finding as indicating that the number of entrepreneurs
       available to create jobs in a city moves proportionally with the size of the city. Moreover,
       we will argue that this population size result also indicates that local labor markets are
       unlikely to be significantly constrained by fixed physical factors such as land or capital
       when looking over a 10-year period.
           An important implication of our findings relates to identification of wage cost effects.
       In particular, our results imply that shifts in population caused by migration shocks
       cannot be used as instruments for the wage in labor demand specifications because pop-
       ulation size is a direct determinant of labor demand. Put a different way, what has been
       viewed in the literature as a way of tracing a wage-employment trade – off using immi-
       gration shocks is not a way of identifying the wage elasticity of labor demand that is of
       concern to most policy makers. In our view, the relevant wage elasticity of labor demand
       for many policy issues needs to be estimated holding population size constant.9
           The crux of our findings is found in the combination of a modest negative wage elas-
       ticity and the result that, keeping wages fixed, increases in labor supply increase em-
       ployment one-for-one. We believe that these findings are easiest to interpret in terms
       of models with explicit recognition of entrepreneurs. In particular, within our frame-
       work these results imply that 1) entrepreneurs face a span of control problem or at
   6
     In Hamermesh (1993), the main estimates he reports lie in a range near -0.3, which suggest a rather low
elasticity of substitution between capital and labor. While this elasticity is numerically very close to the one
we obtain here, it is not appropriate to compare them as they do not address the same question.
   7
     Note that our finding of smaller effects at the city versus the industry level suggests that any possible
positive demand linkages across industries in a city are dominated by the negative search externalities.
   8
     One implication from this is that specifications with the employment rate rather than the employment
level as the dependent variable are appropriate. Our reading of the existing labor demand literature is that
papers use either employment levels or employment rates without providing any direct rationale for their
decision.
   9
     It is interesting to think of this result in the context of the employment effects estimated in, for example,
Card (1990a)’s work on the effects of the Mariel Boatlift. Card shows that the sizeable inflow of Cuban
refugees into the Miami labor market had little effect on wages. In the context of our extended model, if the
inflow of migrants brings with it a proportional number of entrepreneurs then one should observe something
like a replication of the existing economy; that is, a one-for-one increase in employment with little change in
wages. However, according to our work, this should not be interpreted as implying a perfectly elastic labor
demand curve. It simply reflects the fact that holding wages constant, employment tends to increase with the
size of population.



                                                        4
least downward demand for their product and 2) that the elasticity of the supply of en-
trepreneurial talent to higher profits is far from perfectly elastic. Our estimates suggest
that both these mechanisms have to be present to explain the data. Overall, we view
our results as highly supportive of labor market models that emphasize the role of scarce
entrepreneurial talent in the job creating process.
   The remaining sections of the paper are structured as follows. In Section 1, we de-
rive our empirical specifications for labor demand. We begin deriving a labor demand
specification assuming that employers can readily hire workers at the going wage. We
then extend our approach to allow for search frictions and emphasize how greater tight-
ness in the labor market should negatively affect employment at the industry level. In
section 2, we discuss issues related to identification of parameters. In particular, we
present and justify the instrumental variable strategy we exploit for estimation. In sec-
tion 3, we discuss the data and our construction of variables. In section 4, we report our
main empirical results. In Section 5, we examine the robustness of our results to break-
downs by education and to incorporating slow adjustment of labor and wages. Section
6 contains a summary of the main empirical results and our interpretation of them. In
section 7, we provide concluding comments.



1      Deriving Labor demand
Our goal in this section is to derive an empirically tractable specification for the locus
describing the trade-off between wages and employment demand at the level of an in-
dustry or a whole economy. While it may seem natural to refer to that locus as a labor
demand curve (and we will describe it in those terms as we proceed), there is a sense
in which this terminology is misleading. In particular, the traditional labor demand lit-
erature has focused on identifying parameters of production functions that are relevant
for firm-level employment decisions. While our approach will include such elements, we
will also allow for effects of elements related to the entry process of firms and elements
related to search frictions, as both these can affect the policy relevant trade-off that is of
interest to us. As we will see, if those elements are relevant then they imply that what
we will estimate is an equilibrium locus that reflects features beyond what is captured
in the labor demand curve of any one firm.
    To begin this endeavor, it is helpful to abstract from search frictions and consider
the determination of firm employment and entry decisions in industry i in city c, taking
wages as given. To this end, consider an environment where the good produced in indus-
try i is traded on a national market at a given price pi , and where physical capital can
be rented out on the national market at rental price r. Each potential entrepreneur in
this market has access to a production function F i (ejic , Kic
                                                             j

                                                                        j
of workers employed by entrepreneur j in industry i in city c, Kic        is capital rented by the
entrepreneur, and θic is an exogenous productivity parameter capturing comparative ad-
vantage in the industry-city cell. We assume, for the moment, that there is only one type


                                                5
       of labor. We discuss how to extend the framework to take into account worker hetero-
       geneity in section 2.1. To ease presentation, we will assume that the production function
       takes the Cobb-Douglas form F i (ejic , Kic
                                                j
                                                   , θic ) = (ejic )α1 (Kic
                                                                         j α2
                                                                            ) θic , with 0 < α1 + α2 ≤ 1.
       We will point out, as we proceed, where restrictions imposed by the Cobb-Douglas form
       affect our conclusions and describe how they are extended by relaxing that assumption.
       If entrepreneur j decides to enter the market, optimization implies that the employment
       level at his firm will be given by
                                                          1−α2

                                         r
           The issue that interests us is how to go from this firm-level labor demand to aggre-
       gate labor demand in industry i in city c. The answer to this question depends on how
       we specify the firm’s entry process and whether we assume the presence of a span of
       control problem.10 If there is no span of control problem then going from firm demand
       to market demand is trivial since firm size is indeterminate and therefore the firm and
       the market are interchangeable. This is the traditional approach in the labor demand
       literature. Our approach, instead, will focus on the case where there is potentially a
       span of control problem. To this end, we adopt a rather flexible specification for firm
       entry in order to embed several of the specifications prevalent in the literature.
           Before looking at our general specification, we will discuss two extreme cases. At one
       extreme, we could follow the firm entry literature, such as in Hopenhayn (1992), and
       assume that there is an infinite supply of potential entrants, with each entrant needing
       to pay a common fixed cost upon entry. We see this situation as extreme since it leads
       to a labor demand curve that is perfectly elastic. This type of specification for labor
       demand is not one that we want to impose on the data since it pre-supposes the answer
       to the question of how wages affect employment. At another extreme is the assumption
       that the supply of entrepreneurs is fixed exogenously, say, at the number Nic . In this
       case, total employment demand in industry i in city c, which we will denote by Eic , is
       given by Eic = Nic · eic and can be expressed very simply in log form as:
                                                             

                                 ln Eic = α0i −                 ln wic + ic ,                 (1)

       where α0i = (1−α1 −α2 )−1 ·(ln pi − α2 ln r + (1 − α2 ) ln α1 + α2 ln α2 ) is an industry specific
       term which varies with pi , and ic = 1−α11 −α2 ln θic + ln Nic captures local productivity
       and entrepreneurial supply, where ln Nic is included in the error term because it is not
       observed in most datasets. One of the potential restrictive features we see with such a
       specification for labor demand is that it is not affected by population size. While it is
       common to assume that labor demand is not functionally related to population size, we
       want to argue that such an assumption is at least questionable and should be explored
       empirically. For example, Equation (1) suggests that if a city is the recipient of a mass
  10
    In the context of this production function, span of control problems are captured by assuming that there
are decreasing returns to scale at the firm level, that is, α1 + α2 < 1.


                                                              6
       migration then employment will not be affected unless the wage adjusts. This may
       be a correct way of describing the labor market, but it appears undesirable to us to
       impose such a restriction a priori. Instead, we believe that it is preferable to allow for
       the possibility that the mass of potential entrepreneurs increases with population size
       and, therefore, that an increase in population size may directly increase labor demand
       even at fixed wages. We can capture this possibility by assuming, instead of a fixed
       entrepreneur supply, that Nic is related to the local population size, Lc , by Nic = γ0i Lγc 1 ,
       where 0 < γ0i ≤ 1 and 0 ≤ γ1 . For now, we will assume that the entrepreneurs are drawn
       from the local population. Later we will relax this assumption to allow entrepreneurs to
       come from the national-level population.
           While we want to allow for the possibility that the set of potential entrepreneurs
       increases with population size, we do not want to force all potential entrepreneurs to
       produce regardless of prices. Accordingly, we include a non-trival entry decision by as-
       suming that each potential entrepreneur j faces a fixed cost, fj , of entering the market,
       where fj is drawn from the CDF, G(f ). The heterogeneity among entrepreneurs leads
       to a simple cut-off rule where only potential entrepreneurs with a fixed cost below some
       cut-off f ∗ will enter the market. To allow for simple analytic expressions, we further
       assume that G(f ) takes the form G(f ) = ( Γf )φ , where 0 ≤ φ and f ∈ [0, Γ].11 Under these
       two extensions we get the following specification for labor demand:

                                              1 − α2 + φα1
                             ln Eic = α0i −                ln wic + γ1 ln Lc + ic                  (2)
                                               1 − α1 − α2
       where α0i captures industry effects, such as the price of the good, that are common
                                  1+φ
       across cities, and ic = 1−α1 −α2
                                         ln θic .
           The first difference to recognize between equations (1) and (2) is that local popula-
       tion size now appears on the right had side of (2) with the coefficient γ1 . This reflects
       our assumption that the set of potential entrepreneurs may increase with population
       size. There are several reasons why we believe it is important to introduce the poten-
       tial role of population size in the determination of labor demand. First, it emphasizes
       that how wages adjust in response to a change in the population in a local labor mar-
       ket (e.g., due to an immigration shock) may reveal nothing about the wage elasticity of
       labor demand. In particular, note that the coefficient capturing the wage elasticity of
       labor demand in (2) can be very small and, nonetheless, this specification can still be
       consistent with an increase in population being met with a proportional increase in em-
       ployment at fixed wages. In contrast, in a more standard specification for labor demand,
       as in (1), one would expect an increase in population to decrease wages unless the labor
       demand curve is perfectly elastic. Second, by looking at how population growth affects
       employment holding wages fixed, one can obtain substantial information about the func-
       tioning of the labor market. For example, if one finds that population enters into this
       equation with a coefficient of 1 then one can infer that entrepreneurship is likely propor-
  11
   With this formulation of the distribution of the entry costs, the extreme case where there is only one
common fixed cost can captured in the limit when φ goes to infinity.


                                                       7
       tional to the population. In this latter case, it would be more appropriate to describe the
       wage-employment trade-off as one between wages and the employment rate as opposed
       to one between wages and the level of employment. Our empirical results do, in fact,
       support the view that the relevant labor market trade-off is between wages and employ-
       ment rates, as we find that employment appears to increase one-for-one with population,
       holding wages fixed. Note that while we will interpret such a pattern as supportive of
       models where entrepreneurship is an important limiting factor, there may exist other
       interpretations.12
            We next turn our focus to the coefficient on the wage in (2). This coefficient is always
       negative since it is given by − 1−α             2 +φα1
                                                   1−α1 −α2 . There are two scenarios under which this coeffi-
       cient equals minus infinity, i.e., where there is perfectly elastic demand. First, if there is
       no span of control problem, then 1 − α1 − α2 = 0 and the wage elasticity becomes infinite.
       Alternatively, if potential entrepreneurs all face the same cost of entry, Γ, then φ must
       equal infinity as there is a mass point in the function G(·). Importantly, for the wage
       elasticity to be less than infinite, neither of these conditions can hold. Hence, finding ev-
       idence of a less that infinite wage elasticity in this framework is evidence of both a span
       of control problem and that there is not an infinitely elastic supply of entrepreneurs
       waiting to take advantage of any profit opportunity.
            A more subtle issue in Equation (2) is the implicit restriction that the wage elastic-
       ity of labor demand should always be greater than 1 in absolute value. This feature is
       actually an artifact of the Cobb-Douglas structure and does not hold for more general
       production functions. For this reason, it should not be viewed as a relevant restric-
       tion. More importantly, we derived Equation (1) under the assumption that all goods
       in an industry are perfect substitutes. If, instead, we assume that goods from each en-
       trepreneur are a differentiated product then there is further reason, beyond the span
       of control problem, for a fall in wages to have a limited effect on employment demand
       within a firm. Since the extension of the above specification to the case where the out-
       puts of the different entrepreneurs are not perfect substitutes is rather straightforward,
       we omit it here. However, it should be noted that such an extension does change the in-
       terpretation of the coefficient on wages from one that is driven only by the span of control
       problem and firm entry decisions, to one that also takes into account the substitutability
       of products within the industry.
            Before extending our labor demand framework to include the possibility of search
       frictions, we want to briefly clarify how span of control problems differ from simply
       assuming the presence of a fixed factor. To this end, we augment our previous production
       function to include a fixed physical factor (which could be land, for example) such that
       F i (ejic , Kic
                    j     j
                       , Xic , θic ) = (ejic )α1 (Kic
                                                   j α2
                                                      ) (Xicj α3                                            j
                                                              ) θic , with 0 < α1 + α2 + α3 ≤ 1. The input Xic
  12
    The main data pattern that we find in our empirical analysis is one where the wage elasticity of labor
demand is very far from infinity. At the same, time employment responds proportionally to an increase in
population size at fixed wages. To explain such a pattern one needs a model with a limiting factor which is
proportional to population. Our belief is that entrepreneurial talent is the most likely candidate for such a
factor.


                                                         8
      represents the use of a local fixed factor X by entrepreneur j, with Xic representing
      the total amount of the fixed factor available in city c. Here we maintain our previous
      assumptions that Nic = γ0 Lγc 1 and that potential entrepreneurs face a fixed cost of entry
      equal to f drawn from G(f ) = ( Γf )φ .13 Under this extension, we obtain the following,
      slightly more general, specification for labor demand:

                                1 − α2 + φ(α1 + α3 )          γ1 (1 − α1 − α2 − α3 )
               ln Eic = α0i −                        ln wic +                        ln Lc + ic ,   (3)
                                 1 − α1 − α2 + α3 φ            1 − α1 − α2 + α3 φ
                                                                                   1+φ
      where α0i again captures common industry effects and now ic = 1−α1 −α         2 +α3 φ
                                                                                             (ln θic +
      α2 Xic ). Thus, the error term incorporates the city-industry productivity parameter, as
      before, and the local supply of the fixed factor.
          We see the introduction of a fixed physical factor in our set-up as having two inter-
      esting implications. First, with the presence of a fixed factor, the effect of population
      on labor demand is likely to be smaller than 1 even if γ1 = 1 , that is, even if en-
      trepreneurs are proportional to the population. This is intuitive as population growth
      will cause the fixed factor to become more constraining even in the presence of more
      entrepreneurs. Second, and most importantly, if we assume away the span of control
      problem (1 − α1 − α2 − α3 = 0) then even if γ1 > 0, population will not enter the labor
      demand specification. The presence of a fixed factor can justify why the wage elasticity
      of labor demand may be less than minus infinity. However, it cannot rationalize why an
      increase in population may be met with increased employment at fixed wages. To ra-
      tionalize this, while maintaining the feature that the wage elasticity of labor demand is
      less than infinite, one needs the presence of a limiting factor that grows with population.
      Entrepreneurs play that role in our framework.
          Up to now, we have derived the determinants of labor demand under the assumption
      that entrepreneurs are drawn from the local population. This allowed for a transparent
      and explicit discussion of individual-level entry decisions, and how those decisions affect
      the specification of labor demand. While this may appear as a very restrictive assump-
      tion, it turns out that Equation (3) can be derived under the alternative assumption
      that potential entrepreneurs are drawn from the national-level population, L, accord-
      ing to a rule of the form Nic = γ0i ( LLc )γ1 Lγ2 where 0 ≤ γ1 and 0 ≤ γ2 ; that is, we allow
      the local supply of potential entrepreneurs to increase with both the relative size of the
      local population and the size of the national population. In this alternative formula-
      tion, the national-level population is a common factor across cities and, therefore, can
      be incorporated into the constant term. This leaves only the size of the local population
      as an explicit regressor capturing entrepreneurial supply, and our main specification is
      unchanged. Such a formulation can be rationalized under the view that national-level
      entrepreneurs learn about local opportunities in proportion to the relative size of the
      specific locality. The case where entrepreneurial supply is not related to local popula-
      tion size is then captured by γ1 = 0.
13
     We are implicitly assuming here that the factor X can be traded freely across firms in the local market.

       1.1     Including search frictions
       In our derivation of Equations (2) and (3), we implicitly assumed that there were no
       search frictions in the labor market, and that firms wanting to hire could costlessly fill
       vacancies at the going wage. In this subsection, we extend the above labor demand
       framework to allow for the possibility of search frictions out of concern that omitting
       that possibility may imply a biased perspective on labor demand – especially regarding
       the trade-off between wages and employment demand. To introduce search frictions, it
       is convenient to assume that our entrepreneurial firms do not hire labor directly but
       instead buy an intermediate good, Zic , that is specific to the industry and produced
       locally with labor in a one-to-one fashion. The entrepreneurial firms producing the final
       good now take the prices of the intermediate good, which we denote by pzic , as given and
       behave as in the previous section in terms of deciding whether to produce and how much
       to buy of the different inputs if production takes place. The only difference is that firms
       buy Zic from intermediate good producers that face search frictions instead of hiring
       labor directly.
           In order to introduce search frictions, we need to extend to our analysis to a dynamic
       setting. Accordingly, we will assume that time is continuous and that all the costs facing
       entrepreneurs discussed previously now represent instantaneous costs for flow services.
       We assume the existence of a large set of intermediate good producers, each of which can
       decide whether to post a vacancy at any point in time; where a vacancy needs to be ded-
       icated toward producing the intermediate good for one specific industry. The flow cost of
       posting a vacancy for producing good Zi is denoted hic . When an intermediate good pro-
       ducer finds a worker, she begins production and obtains a flow return of pzic −wic . Workers
       are assumed to be hired from a common pool, regardless of which intermediate good they
       will eventually produce. Job vacancies and unemployed workers match according to a
       constant returns to scale matching function given by M (Lc − Ec , Vc ) = (Lc − Ec )ν Vc1−ν ,
       where Ec is total employment in the city and Vc is the number of vacancies. Given
       this matching function, the flow rate at which an intermediate good producer finds a
       worker is given by ( LcV−Ec
                                   c ν
                                    ) . Assuming that matches break up exogenously at rate δ,
       the steady state flow rate at which intermediate good firms find workers will be given

              Lc
       condition imposing that the value of a vacancy be zero implies the following simple ex-
       pression between pzic and wic :14

          In (4), we see that the price of the input Zic , which is the cost of a flow of labor services
  14
    To derive this relationship, we use the fact that the value of a filled job for an intermediate good producer,
which we can denote by J, must satisfy ρJ = pzic − wic + δ(W − J) where W is the value of a vacancy. We
                                                                             ν
combine this with the fact the W must satisfy ρW = −hic + [ 1δ ( E1c − 1)] 1−ν (W − J), and W = 0.
                                                                  Lc

       to the final producer of good i in city c, is equal to the wage paid by the intermediate good
       producer plus a term capturing the cost of search. If hic were equal to zero, there would
       be no search costs and therefore pzic would simply be equal to the wage. The importance
       of this search cost for the price of Zic depends on how firms discount the future, on
       the job destruction rate, and, most importantly, on the average time an intermediate
                                                                                       ν
                                                                                           1−ν

                                                                                          Lc
       this latter expression, it is important to note that time spent looking for a worker can
       be expressed as an increasing function of the employment rate in the city: the tighter
       is the labor market, the higher is the employment rate and the longer it takes to fill
       a vacancy. Hence, the cost of the labor service, Zic , will be greater in a tighter labor
       market, holding wages fixed. If we simplify matters further by assuming that the cost
       of posting a vacancy, hic , is proportional to the wage in the industry-city cell (that is,
       hic = hi · wic ), then we can use (4) and (3) to get the following generalized demand for
       labor relationship, which now includes a term that reflects search frictions:

                      1−α1 −α2 +α3 φ , β2 = 1−α1 −α2 +α3 φ , ic = 1−α1 −α2 +α3 φ (ln θic + α2 Xic ), and β0i
       again captures industry specific terms.
           Equation (5) provides, in our view, a simple but rich framework for exploring the
       trade-off between wages and employment demand. In particular, this specification de-
       parts from traditional labor demand specifications by embedding elements of both the
       search and firm entry with span of control literatures. As a result, our specification for
       labor demand includes a wage effect, a search cost effect and a population effect: the lat-
       ter two not being commonly included in traditional specifications of labor demand. Note
       that the coefficient on population, β2 , will equal 1 if γ1 = 1 and α3 = 0; that is, when
       entrepreneurs are proportional to the population and there is no fixed physical factor.
       This is an important special case and one that, we will see, appears to be supported
       by the data. It is relevant to recall that we used steady state conditions for the search
       process to derive this equation. Thus, (5) is most likely appropriate for studying more of
       a medium-run outcome, and this is what we will do in our empirical work.16
           In our empirical work, we will actually focus on a log-linear approximation of this
       equation so as to emphasize the first order effects of the aggregate employment rate, E            Lc ,
                                                                                                           c

     In the search literature, it is most common to use the ratio of vacancies to unemployed workers as the
measure of tightness. However, at the steady state, the unemployment to vacancy ratio can be written as
a simple function of the employment rate. In particular with the matching function in Cobb-Douglas form,
                 2−ν
L−E        (1− E

    Out of steady state, the link between prices pzict and wages given in (4) would be more complicated, as the
search cost could not be summarized by a function of the current employment rate.

       on the industry-specific employment rate,      Lc .   In particular, we will generally work with
       the equation in the form:
                                                                  Ec
                        ∆ ln Eic ≈ ∆β0i + β1 ∆ ln wic + β3 ∆ ln      + β2 ∆ ln Lc + ∆ic ,             (6)
                                                                  Lc
       where β1 and β2 are unchanged from before. The term β3 , which can be written as
       β3 = β1 Φ (where Φ > 0), reflects the log-linear effect of labor market tightness, as
       captured by the local employed rate, on the cost of filling a vacancy. We have written
       the equation in differences over time since this is the way we will estimate it in order to
       eliminate time invariant city-industry effects.17 In the data work, time periods will, for
       the most part, be 10 years apart.
          The important element in (5), relative to (3), is the presence of a negative feedback
       from the aggregate rate of employment to the rate of employment in one industry. This
       negative feedback, which reflects search externalities, may, at first pass, appear counter-
       intuitive since one might expect that cross-good demand linkages would imply a positive
       feedback. However, for goods traded on a national market, the demand effects in our
       formulation should be captured by the industry specific terms contained in β0i , implying
       that the local aggregate employment rate captures the effect of search frictions.


       1.2    Deriving a city level labor demand curve
       Equation (6) is our baseline specification labor demand curve at the industry-city level.
       It will be informative to derive a city-level labor demand curve from it. To this end, let
       us first define ηict as the fraction of employment in industry i in city c (i.e. ηict = PEict   ).
                                                                                                j Ejct
       Now consider aggregating Equation (6) using weights ηict , and using the approximation
       P                Eict       Ect
          i ηict−1 ∆ ln Lct ≈ ∆ ln Lct , in order to get

                      1 X                     β1 X                      β2 − β3            X         ∆ict
       ∆ ln Ect =          ηict−1 · ∆β0it +        ηict−1 · ∆ ln wict +         ∆ ln Lct +   ηict−1        .
                    1 − β3                  1 − β3                      1 − β3                      1 − β3
                            i                          i                                           i
                                                                                                       (7)

          This equation expresses the change in the employment rate within a city as being
                                                                        P
       negatively affected by the average wage change in the city ( i ηict−1 · ∆ ln wict ), and
       positively affected by the weighted sum of the β0it . Notice that β0it reflects a national-
       level effect associated with an industry. To express β0it as a function of observables, we
       average (7) across cities (using the weights C1 , where C is the number of cities). This
       gives:
        X 1                       X 1                  X 1                         X 1
            ∆ ln Eict = β0it + β1     ∆ ln wict + β3 ·     ∆ ln Ect + (β2 − β3 ) ·     ∆ ln Lct ,

                                                                                     C
                                                      P      1
       where we have used the assumption that              c C ∆ict   = 0 since ∆ict reflects changes in
       comparative advantage.
  17
    Differencing also eliminates the fixed factor component of the error term since it does not vary over time
by definition.

                                                      12
   The latter equation implies that β0it can be written as
                                  X 1                X 1
                         β0it =       ∆ ln Eict − ϕ2     ∆ ln wict + dt ,                      (8)

where dt is a year effect that is common across cities. The first two terms on the right
side of the above equation can be approximated as the growth of employment in industry
i at the national level, denoted ∆ ln Eit , and the growth of wages in industry i at the
national level, denoted ∆ ln wit . Thus, equation (8) indicates that the industry specific
intercept in (6) is approximately equal to the national level growth in employment in
the industry corrected for the average wage growth in the industry. Using (8), we can
write the job creation curve at the city level as
                    1      X                       β1     X             wict β2 − β3
∆ ln Ect = dt +          ·   ηict−1 · ∆ ln Eit +        ·   ηict−1 ∆ ln     +        ∆ ln Lct + ζ̃ct ,

     Equation (9) now expresses cross-city differences in employment changes as a func-
                                                                                    P
tion of three main components. The first is a general growth effect captured by i ηict−1 ·
∆ ln Eit , which reflects the notion that a city should have a better employment outcome
if it is initially concentrated in industries which are growing at the national level. Sec-
ond, we have a negative wage effect, which captures within-industry adjustments to a
change in the cost of labor. This is given by the term i ηict−1 ∆ ln wwict
                                                           P
                                                                          it
                                                                             , which is large
if a city experiences wage growth across industries that is higher on average than that
experienced nationally. Since β1 is negative, a high value of i ηict−1 ∆ ln wwict
                                                                P
                                                                                it
                                                                                   will result
in lower employment outcomes in the city. The third term corresponds to a population
growth effect. Finally, the error term reflects changes in the city’s comparative advan-
tage.
     A comparison of equations (9) and (6) reveals an important difference in the wage
coefficients in each. The coefficient on the city-industry specific wage change in equation
(6) is the direct effect of a wage change on the employment rate in an industry-city
cell holding the aggregate employment change in the city constant. This reflects the
response of firms in an industry if that industry is too small to have a substantial effect
on the overall equilibrium in the city. However, in general, we would expect that the
immediate effect of a wage change in i, as captured in β1 , would only be a first-round
response. The decrease in employment in i would imply a less tight overall labor market
in the city which would raise the value of a vacancy for entrepreneurs to an extent
captured by β3 . The resulting employment changes would then have further effects.
                                                                                          β1
The ultimate outcome of that process on total employment in the city is given by 1−β         3
                                                                                               ,
which is the coefficient on the aggregated wage change in (9). Given that β3 is predicted
to be negative, the total impact of the wage change at the city level will be smaller than
the direct, industry specific effect, reflecting the self-correcting nature of the search
externalities.

                                                13
      2     Identification
      In general, we would not expect OLS to provide consistent estimates of the coefficients
      in equation 6, as the error term consists of changes in city-industry comparative advan-
      tage (the θic terms). We expect changes in comparative advantage to be correlated with
      both changes in the wage in a given industry-city cell and with movements in the city
      level employment rate. If worker migration decisions are based only on wages and em-
      ployment rates then there may be no reason to expect a correlation between the change
      in the city size and the error term once we condition on wage and employment rate
      changes; that is, there would be no correlation if a productivity change is only of interest
      to workers to the extent it changes wages and the chance of getting a job. However,
      we allow for the possibility of a more direct connection, using instrumental variables
      related to each of the main right hand side variables.
           The main pillar of our instrumental variable strategy will be to follow and extend
      ideas first presented in Bartik (1993) and used in many subsequent studies.18 The idea
      in Bartik is to work within a regional setting to construct instruments of the form:
      P
         i ωict ∆Qit , where ωict are a set of weights specific to city c, and ∆Qit is a change in the
      variable Qi at the national level. In the specific case considered by Bartik, the weights
      are the beginning-of-period employment shares across industries within a city and ∆Qi
      is the growth rate in employment at the national level in industry i between t − 1 and
      t. The result is a prediction of the end-of-period city employment rate based on the idea
      that if a particular industry grows or declines at the national level, the main effects from
      that change will be felt most in the cities that have the highest initial concentration in
      that industry. Note that this particular Bartik instrument is actually the first variable
      on the right side of our Equation (9). Moreover, we can see from (9) that this instrument
      is potentially a good candidate for instrumenting the employment rate in Equation 6 as,
                                 P
      if β2 is close to 1, then i ηict−1 · ∆ ln Eit should be correlated with the change in the city
      level log employment rate. We will call that instrument, Z1ct .
           Given our reliance on Bartik-type instruments, it is important to clarify the condi-
      tions under which they are valid. We will specify those conditions for Z1ct , first, then set
      them out in more general terms. Recall that the error term in (6) is given by ∆ict and
      corresponds to changes in local (industry-city level) productivity. It seems reasonable to
      be concerned that this error term is correlated with changes in the employment rate in
      the city. Now consider the potential correlation of this error term with Z1ct . Since Z1ct
      varies across cities, we are concerned with the cross-city correlation between it and the
      error term, which we can write as,
                      X 1 X                         X          X 1
                            ηict−1 ∆ ln Eit ∆jct =   ∆ ln Eit     ηict−1 ∆jct .
                      c
                        C                                      c
                                                                 C
                              i                           i

      Taking the limit of the correlation as C goes to infinity implies that the instrument is

       asymptotically uncorrelated with the error term if

       It is intuitive (and straightforward to show) that ηict−1 is a function of the values of the
       jct−1 ’s. Thus, this latter condition can be written in terms of the ’s, in which form it is
       equivalent to the following condition holding for all c and i:
                                                 X 1
                                        plimC→∞        ict−1 ∆jct = 0                         (11)
                                                   c
                                                     C
       where ∆jct = (jct − jct−1 ). Thus, the validity of the instrument depends on a random
       walk-type assumption. This is clearly a stringent assumption, and we would like to be
       able to test it. This is possible if there is more than one instrument, allowing for over-
       identifying tests of the underlying assumptions. This is precisely how we will proceed.
       We will take as a maintained assumption that the driving forces in the model, given by
       the set of s, satisfy the conditions for Bartik-type instruments to be potentially valid.
       We will then propose a set of such instruments and test the over-identifying restrictions
       to see if such an assumption is reasonable.
           We view several of the features of this example as reflecting general characteristics
       of Bartik-type instruments; (1) the estimation is done in over-time differences, (2) the
       error term often is a function of differences in productivities, and (3) the weights (which
       we called ω’s earlier) are plausibly functions of the lagged productivity levels.19 From
       this, two lessons carry over to other implementations of Bartik-type instruments. First,
       validity of the instruments requires a random walk-type assumption, typically in terms
       of productivity processes. Second, the national-level change component of the Bartik
       instrument (the ∆Q) does not enter the asymptotic consistency condition. This is true
       because the validity of the instrument depends on cross-city correlations and the cross-
       city variation in the Bartik instruments comes from differences in the ωic vectors and not
       from ∆Qi , which takes a common value across cities. This means that, asymptotically,
       there is no reason to worry about how city-level changes aggregate to a national value
       for Q. It is important, though, that this is an asymptotic statement that is based on
       an assumption that as the number of cities goes to infinity, industries are spread across
       many of them (i.e., there is no industry that operates only in one, or a handful of cities,
       as the number of cities gets large).
           We now turn to discussing instruments of the Bartik form that are likely correlated
       with the change in wages. We have argued previously that labor supply shifters pro-
       vide dubious instruments for the wage since they may be correlated with shifts in the

    For example, in what is commonly called the Ethnic Enclave instrument used in examining the impacts
of immigration on a local economy, the concern is that immigrants move to the economy because of changes
in productivity (captured, at least partially, in the error term). The ω’s in that example correspond to the
proportion of immigrants from some source country that were located in a given city in an earlier period.
That distribution of immigrants is plausibly correlated with productivity in the city in the earlier period,
and the identifying assumption is that those earlier productivity levels are uncorrelated with the changes in
productivity in the sample period.

supply of entrepreneurs. Hence, we need to turn to other forces that may drive wage
changes. To this end, we draw on search and bargaining theory and exploit insights pre-
sented in BGS regarding the role of industrial composition in affecting workers’ outside
options and, through bargaining, wages. The idea in BGS is straightforward. Consider
two identical workers who meet with potential employers in the same industry but in
different cities. Upon meeting, the worker and employer can form a match and begin
production or they can continue to search. With search frictions, a match will produce a
bilateral monopoly, and workers and firms can bargain over the available match surplus
to determine the wage paid. For the worker, the value of continuing to search serves as
an outside option in the bargaining process. If there are frictions hindering perfect and
costless mobility across cities, the value of continued search will depend on local labor
market conditions. Within a local labor market, this value will depend, in part, on the
expected quality of other potential matches and the expected duration of search. In par-
ticular, BGS show that when workers can potentially meet with firms in any industry,
the value of workers’ outside options will depend on the industrial composition of cities.
Differences in local industrial composition will translate into differences in wages via
bargaining, even if the tightness of the labor markets are the same, since higher outside
options allow workers to capture more of the surplus. For example, workers in, say, the
chemical industry should be able to bargain a higher wage if they live in a city with
high-paying steel mills than if they live in a city where the steel mills are replaced with
low-paying textile mills. We exploit this idea to justify two instrumental variables that
will help to consistently estimate (6) and (9). The two instruments will be valid under
the same assumption as we stipulated for Z1ct .
    Within the context of a multi-sector search and bargaining model, BGS formalize the
idea that, within a given industry, outside options (and, hence, wages) will be higher
in cities with an industrial composition that is tilted toward higher-paying industries
because it increases the value of search for workers; that is, outside options are greater
in cities where the probability of meeting a high-wage industry is higher. Therefore,
                                                                      P
industry-city wages, wict , will tend to be higher in cities where j ηjct wjt are higher
(where wit represents wages in sector i at the national level and ηict is the relative size
                                                    P
of industry i at the city level, and, therefore, j ηjct wjt proxies the outside options of
workers). Notice that this is not a mechanical result since the ability of workers to
switch industries implies that it would arise even if we just focused on other industries
by dropping i when calculating the city average wage.
                                                    P
    It is useful to decompose the movements in j ηjc wj as follows:
                                                                               
             X                X                           X
           ∆     ηjct wjt =    ηjct−1 (wjt − wjt−1 ) +   wjt−1 (ηict − ηict−1 ) .  (12)
             j               j                              j

   Equation (12) indicates that for a worker in a particular city, outside options will
increase over time if employment in that city is concentrated in industries where wages
are increasing at the national level or if the worker is in a city where there is a shift in in-
dustrial composition toward relatively high-paying sectors. Importantly, BGS show that

                                              16
       workers value each source of change in the value of outside options equally; a worker
       bargaining a wage in given sector doesn’t care whether her outside options change be-
       cause of shifts in industrial structure or shifts in industry wages since all that matters
       is the expected wage in the city outside the current firm. In our empirical work, we use
       each component of shifts in outside options to form the basis of an instrument for wages
       in (6) and (9), exploiting the fact that each component relies on very different sources of
       variation.
           We construct our first wage instrument, which we will call Z2ct , based on the first
       term in (12):
                                            X
                                    Z2ct =      ηjct−1 (ln wjt − ln wjt−1 ).
                                                 j

       BGS show that this instrument is a good predictor of wage growth at the industry-
       city level and give a formal justification for its relevance based on the wage bargaining
       story discussed previously. Importantly, Z2ct varies across cities and obtains its varia-
       tion entirely from the ηict−1 ’s (the initial period local industrial composition). As in our
       discussion of Z1ct , the national-level wage changes are not relevant for our consistency
       considerations since they are common across cities. As such, Z2ct will be uncorrelated
       with the error terms in (6) and (9) (and, hence, will be a valid instrument) under the
       assumption given in (11), that the comparative advantage terms, ict , behave as random
       walks with changes independent of past levels.20
            The second instrument we propose for wages builds on the second term of (12),
       P
          j wjt−1 (ηict − ηict−1 ). This term would not be an appropriate instrument since its de-
       pendence on the current industrial structure as captured by the ηict ’s implies that it will
       not be orthogonal to the error terms in (6) or (9). Instead, consider the closely related
       variable given by:
                              X                                    X
                                                                                  ∗
                     Z3ct =       ln wit−1 · (η̂ict − ηict−1 ) =       ηict−1 · (git − 1) · ln wit−1 ,   (13)
                              i                                    i

               ∗ = P      1+∆ ln Eit
       where git                             . For the variable Z3ct , we have replaced the current indus-
                      j ηjct−1 (1+∆ ln Eit )
       trial composition term ηict with its predicted value base on ηict−1 and the national-level
       trend in employment patterns.21 As with Z1ct and Z2ct , the resulting variable’s cross-
       city variation stems from the ηict−1 ’s and the same random walk assumption is needed
       for consistency. Furthermore, it should have predictive power for industry-city wage
  20
     BGS presents a formal derivation of the form of the error term in the wage equation and prove that the
conditions listed here imply that these instruments are valid.
  21
     To create the predicted share term, we first predict the level of employment for industry i in city c in
period t as:
                                                                  
                                                              Eit
                                            Êict = Eict−1           .
                                                             Eit−1

Thus, we predict period t employment in industry i in city c using the employment in that industry-city cell in
period t − 1 multiplied by the national-level growth rate for the industry. We then use these predicted values
to construct predicted industry-specific employment shares, η̂ict = PÊict
                                                                       Ê
                                                                            , for the city in period t.
                                                                              i   ict

changes as it should capture the higher value of outside options for workers in a city
where we predict that the industrial composition is tilting toward higher-paying jobs.
    The availability of two instruments for wages raises the possibility of implementing
an over-identification test. Z2ct and Z3ct are both predicted to have an impact on city-
industry wages through channels related to workers’ outside options. But the channels
that each exploits are quite different – one related to shifts in industrial structure and
one to within industry wage movements. As discussed above, theory predicts that each
source of variation in outside options should have the same impact on wages since what
matters for workers’ bargaining positions is the change in the average wage in other
industries, regardless of whether that change stems from changes in industrial compo-
sition or the industrial wage premia. Likewise, since what matters for employers is the
bargained wage, variation in wages induced by either Z2ct and Z3ct should produce the
same employment response. Since Z2ct and Z3ct rely on different forms of variation but
are predicted to have the same employment impacts, this set-up lends itself naturally to
an over-identification test of the validity of our identification assumptions. Recall that
both Z2ct and Z3ct are valid under the same random-walk assumption, that the ηict−1 ’s
are uncorrelated with the ∆ic ’s in equations (6) and (9). If this assumption were vi-
olated, the offending correlations will be weighted differently by the two instruments
(with changes in national-level industrial wages in Z2ct and national-level employment
changes in Z3ct ). This would, in turn, imply that the two instruments should result in
quite different estimated coefficients if the key correlations do not equal zero. Thus, we
can test our identification assumption by testing that estimation of (6) and (9) using
either Z2ct or Z3ct produces similar results. We view this test as quite strong because
Z2ct and Z3ct work from quite different sources of variation; in fact, in our data their
correlation is only 0.18 after removing year effects.
    Recall that in Equation 6 we have three explanatory variables for employment (be-
sides the industries dummies). As we suspect all three of these variables to be poten-
tially correlated with the error term, we need at least three instruments to estimate
this equation. We have now proposed three instruments, so in principle we could move
to estimation. However, we choose to propose two more sets of instruments for two main
reasons. First, we want to have more instruments than variables in order to perform
over identification tests, as in the absence of credible over-identification tests, we could
not provide any evidence in support of the needed identification assumptions. Second,
with the current set of instruments, we are worried that we will not meet the rank con-
dition necessary for identification. In particular, since both instruments Z2ct and Z3ct
are aimed at isolating admissible variability in wages, while Z1ct is aimed mainly at
isolating variability in the city-level employment rate, it is plausible that this set of
instruments does not span the space necessary to isolate independent variation in all
three regressors. For this reason, we now propose two sets of instruments aimed at
helping isolate admissible variation in population growth.
    The first of these two instruments is again of the Bartik form, and will be referred
to it as Z4ct . The idea behind this instrument is to use historical patterns of interstate

                                            18
       migration to predict inflows and outflows of people to a city.22 For example, suppose a
       city has a large proportion of its population at the beginning of a period which is born
       out of state, young, female and black. We infer that such a city is likely attractive to
       young, black females. Our proposed instrument is based on the prediction that such a
       city will grow if the out-of-state population of young female black people grows. To be
       more precise, Z4ct is constructed as follows:
                                                   X
                                          Z4ct =       ωjct−1 (1 + gjst ),
                                                   j

       where ωjct−1 is the fraction of the population in city c at time t − 1 that is both born
       out of state and is in demographic group j; and gjst is the growth between t − 1 and t of
       the out-of-state population in demographic group j. We segmented the population into
       40 demographic groups based on indicators for female and black and age grouped into
       5-year bins, using only those born in the U.S..23 Note that one of the sources of variation
       for this instrument is the ageing of the baby boom, with this instrument predicting high
       population growth in cities where people of a given age group have tended to locate in
       the past as the baby boom moves through that age range.
           Since we would like to have more than one instrument aimed at isolating variation
       on population growth, we also propose a second set of such instruments. However, for
       this latter set, instead of building on the Bartik logic, we follow the Urban Economics
       literature and build instruments aimed at capturing effects of local amenities. It seems
       natural to assume that people move in part to gain access to local amenities that may be
       independent of productivity. However, most amenities not related to employment and
       wages are relatively constant over time, making them unhelpful as instruments in our
       difference specification. Nonetheless, measures of amenities can still be used as instru-
       ments in this case if the value of the amenity has changed over time. For example, if the
       value of living in a nice climate has increased over time then the level of an indicator
       variable corresponding to a city having a nice climate can be used as an instrumental
       variable for labor force growth.24 Building on this insight, we collected data from a
       number of sources to construct an instrument set consisting of average temperatures
       and precipitation for each city in our sample. Consistent with the idea that workers are
       increasingly drawn to cities by amenity factors, we find that indicators of mild climates
       are significant predictors of city labor force growth.25 The city level climate variables we
  22
      Reference here the immigrant enclave lit.
  23
      The weights ωjct−1 in this case do not sum to one.
   24
      This idea comes from Dahl (2002) who empirically tests a Roy (1951) model of self-selection of workers
across states. He finds that while migration patterns of workers are partially motivated by comparative
advantage, amenity differences across states also play a role in worker movements.
   25
      The validity of the climate instruments rests on the assumption that the relationship between city cli-
mate and city-industry job creation and cost advantages (the θict s) is constant over time. In this case, the
relationship is entirely captured in time-invariant city-specific effects that are differenced out of the estimat-
ing equation. This assumption may not be valid if the evolution of these advantages are related to long-term
climate conditions.

       extracted are from “Sperling’s Best Places to Live.”26 The variables we use are the aver-
       age daily high temperatures for July and January in degrees Fahrenheit, their squares
       and the number of sunny and rainy days.27


       2.1    Worker Heterogeneity
       As we have emphasized, our aim in this paper is to provide an estimate of how employ-
       ment decisions, on average, are affected by an across-the-board increase in the cost of
       labor. By its very nature, this question is about an aggregate labor market outcome.
       In the model developed so far workers are identical and so all parameters are “aggre-
       gate” by definition. However, in our data, workers are heterogeneous in many dimension
       including, among others, education and experience. We therefore need to address this
       heterogeneity in order to proceed appropriately. Depending on the assumptions that one
       makes, there are several ways to approach this issue.
           The first approach, which we use for our main set of results, is to treat individu-
       als as representing different bundles of efficiency units of work, where these bundles
       are treated as perfect substitutes in production. Therefore, in our baseline results we
       control for skill differences in wages via a rich regression adjustment and we correct for
       selection of workers across cities. This approach implicitly introduces an additional term
       in (6) which represents changes in average efficient units per worker. In our baseline
       specification we treat this extra term as a part of the error structure, while in the ro-
       bustness section we will show that our results are not sensitive to explicitly controlling
       for measures of efficiency units per capita at the local level. An alternative assumption
       is that labor markets are segregated along observable skill dimensions and that our
       model applies to homogeneous workers within these markets. Thus, we also perform
       our analysis separately by education group as a specification check.



       3     Data Description and Implementation Issues
       The data we use in this paper come from the U.S. decennial Censuses for the years
       1970 to 2000 and from the American Community Survey (ACS) for 2007. For the 1970
       Census data, we use both metro sample Forms 1 and 2 and adjust the weights for the
  26
     See http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/DataSource.aspx. Their data is compiled from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.
  27
     An alternative variable available from the same source is a ‘comfort’ index. The comfort index is a variable
created by “Sperling’s Best Places to Live” that uses afternoon temperature in the summer and local humidity
to create an index in which higher values reflect greater ”comfort”. Using this as an alternative instrument
gives similar results. We have also compiled climate data from an alternative source to use as a robustness
check. These data come from CityRating.com’s historical weather data, and include variables on average
annual temperature, number of extreme temperature days per year, humidity, and annual precipitation.

       fact that we combine two samples.28 We focus on individuals residing in one of our
       152 metropolitan areas at the time of the Census. Census definitions of metropolitan
       areas are not comparable over time. The definition of cities that we use in this paper
       attempts to maximize geographic consistency across Census years. Since most of our
       analysis takes place at the city-industry level, we also require a consistent definition of
       industry affiliation. Details on how we construct the industry and city definitions are
       left to Appendix A.
           As discussed earlier, our approach to dealing with worker heterogeneity is to control
       for observed characteristics in a regression context. Since most of our analysis takes
       place at the city-industry level, we use a common two-step procedure. Specifically, using
       a national sample of individuals, we run regressions separately by year of log weekly
       wages on a vector of individual characteristics and a full set of city-by-industry dummy
       variables.29 We then take the estimated coefficients on the city-by-industry dummies
       as our measure of city-industry average wages, eliminating all cells with fewer than 20
       observations.
           Our interpretation of the regression adjusted wage measure is that it represents the
       wage paid to workers for a fixed set of skills. However, since we only observe the wage of
       a worker in city k if that worker chooses to live and work in k, self-selection of workers
       across cities may imply that average city wages are correlated with unobserved worker
       characteristics such as ability. In this case, our wage measure will not only represent
       the wage paid per efficiency unit but will also reflect (unobservable) skill differences of
       workers across cities. To address this potential concern, when we estimate our wage
       equations we control for worker self-selection across cities with a procedure developed
       and implemented by Dahl (2002) in a closely related context.
           Dahl proposes a two-step procedure in which one first estimates various location
       choice probabilities for individuals, given their characteristics such as birth state. In
       the second step, flexible functions of the estimated probabilities are included in the
       wage equation to control for the non-random location choice of workers.30 The actual
       procedure that we use is an extension of Dahl’s approach to account for the fact we are
       concerned with cities rather than states, as in his paper, and that we also include in-
       dividuals who are foreign born. When we estimate the wage equations, the selection
       correction terms enter significantly, which suggests that there are selection effects. Our
  28
      Our data was extracted from IPUMS, see Ruggles, Alexander, Genadek, Goeken, and Schroeder, Matthew
B. Sobek (2010)
   29
      We take a flexible approach to specifying the first-stage regression. We include indicators for education
(4 categories), a quadratic in experience, interactions of the experience and education variables, a gender
dummy, black, hispanic and immigrant dummy variables, and the complete set of interactions of the gender,
race and immigrant dummies with all the education and experience variables.
   30
      Since the number of cities is large, adding the selection probability for each choice is not practical. There-
fore, Dahl (2002) suggests an index sufficiency assumption that allows for the inclusion of a smaller number
of selection terms, such as the first-best or observed choice and the retention probability. This is the approach
that we follow.



                                                        21
       results with or without the Dahl procedure are very similar. Nevertheless, all estimates
       presented below include the selection corrected wages.31
           Our Z2ct and Z3ct instruments are constructed as functions of the national-industrial
       wage premia and the proportion of workers in each industry in a city. We estimate the
       wage premia in a regression at the national level in which we control for the same set of
       individual characteristics described for our first-stage wage regression and also include
       a full set of industry dummy variables. This regression is estimated separately for each
       Census year. The coefficients on the industry dummy variables are what we use as the
       industry premia in constructing our instruments.
           The dependent variable in our analysis is the log change in industry-city-level em-
       ployment. We construct this variable by summing the number of individuals working in
       a particular industry. Our measure of Lc for a city is the city working-age population.32
       For most of our estimates, we use decadal differences within industry-city cells for each
       pair of decades in our data (1980-1970, 1990-1980, 2000-1990) plus the 2007-2000 differ-
       ence, pooling these together into one large dataset and including period specific industry
       dummies. In all the estimation results, we calculate standard errors allowing for clus-
       tering by city and year.33



       4    Estimates of Labor Demand: Basic Results
       In Table 1, we present estimates of our main equation of interest, (6). All the reported re-
       gressions include a full set of year-by-industry dummies. Column 1 reports OLS results.
       For the OLS results, both the coefficients on the wage and the city-level employment
       rate are positive and highly significant. This is the opposite of what our theory predicts
       for the coefficients in (6). However, the employment equation derived from the model im-
       plies that OLS estimation of this equation should not provide consistent estimates. The
       fact that productivity shocks, ∆ict , enter the employment equation’s error terms, and
       that wages are likely positively related to productivity, explains why the OLS regression
       coefficient on wages is positive.
           Columns 2-4 contain results associated with estimating (6) using different sets of
       instruments, where we treat all three variables as endogenous. In Column (2) we use all
       the instruments discussed in section 2, that is, we use as instruments Z1ct to Z4ct , plus
       our local climate variables. Since we have more than one endogenous variable, we use a
       test suggested by Angrist and Pichke (2009) to assess the strength of our instruments in
       a setting with multiple endogenous variables. These tests, reported in the bottom rows
       of Table 1, under the heading ‘AP p-val,’ indicate that a weak instrument problem is

     We cluster at the city-year level because this is the level of variation in our data. Clustering only by city
has little effect on the estimates of standard errors that we report.

unlikely to be present. For completeness, we also report conventional F -statistics in the
table. The F -statistics show that our instruments are particularly good at predicting
wage changes and population changes.
     The first aspect to note about the IV results, relative to OLS, is that now the coeffi-
cients on wages and the city-employment rate enter with the predicted negative sign. In
particular, the coefficient on wages is estimated to be -0.78, while the coefficient on the
employment rate is estimated to be -1.33. For population changes, we find a strongly
positive relationship, with a coefficient not significantly different from 1. To explore the
robustness of this last finding, we report results where we use, alternatively, either Z4ct
or the climate variables to help isolate admissible variation in population in Columns 3
and 4. Both instruments provide the same message; holding wages constant, an increase
in the labor force is associated with a close to proportional change in employment. Re-
call from Section 2 that a coefficient of population growth of 1 likely indicates that there
are no important fixed factors at the industry-city level beyond that associated with a
span of control problem. In columns 5 and 6 of Table 1, we follow up on this result by
imposing a coefficient of 1 on population growth. We implement this by using as our
dependent variable the employment rate in an industry-city cell instead of the level of
employment. Once we impose this restriction, we again see that the OLS estimates re-
main inconsistent with the theory since both the wage effect and the employment rate
effect are estimated to be positive. However, once we instrument this equation using
Z1ct , Z2ct and Z3ct , in column 6, we again find a significantly negative wage elasticity
(β1 ) which is now very close to -1.0. Moreover, we find evidence, as suggested by search
theory, of a negative congestion effect, with the effect of the local employment rate on
industry-level employment (β3 ) having a coefficient near -2.
     Since we are especially interested in the wage elasticity of labor demand, in Ta-
ble 2 we report the first-stage results for wages in order to provide support for our IV
approach. From Table 2, we see that our instruments Z1ct and Z2ct predict wages in-
dependently, with each exhibiting a strong positive relationship. Recall that that these
two instruments exploit very different data variation: in the data, we find that they are
only weakly correlated (with a correlation of 0.18 once time dummies removed). Hence,
they offer a good set-up for exploring over-identification restrictions. In particular, if
our identification assumptions are right then we should get very similar results for the
wage elasticity if we use either one of these instruments. This conjecture is confirmed
in Columns 6 and 7 of Table 1, where we see that the wage elasticity is close to -1 using
either set of instruments. The last row of Table 1 provides the p-value for the Hanson’s
J over-identification test, which can be interpreted as testing whether the regression
results using the two different sets of instruments give similar results. In column 8,
for example, the p-value for this test is 0.68, easily failing to reject. This indicates that
results estimated using either variation from Z2 or Z3 are not statistically different, and
is very supportive of the search theory discussed above. We view the fact that our IV
estimates are both changing the coefficients quite drastically compared to OLS results
and are stable across instrument sets, as strong support for our IV approach. In BGS,

                                             23
we show the same sort of over-identifying result for wage equations and provide a more
detailed interpretation. The other key prediction from the model is that an increase
in labor market tightness in a city (as represented by the city-level employment rate)
should negatively affect within industry-employment rates. Once we instrument, we do,
in fact, find evidence of this negative effect. This is a striking result since one may have
expected a positive relationship between these variables. In our opinion, it is rather
difficult to explain this later result without relying on search costs.
     We are now in a position to interpret the results in terms of their implications for
the wage elasticity of labor demand at the industry versus city level. First, consider
a wage increase in a particular industry, holding overall employment rates constant.
If the industry in question is not large enough to have a significant impact on overall
employment rates, the IV estimates in Table 1 imply a labor demand elasticity at the
industry level of about −1. What about wage increases for a city as a whole? Since all
industries will adjust employment downward in response to a general wage increase,
there will be feedback effects on overall employment rates. Allowing these equilibrium
effects to play out using our estimates of equation (6) implies a city-level labor demand
                β1
elasticity of 1−β  3
                     or of about −0.30. In other words, since β3 is predicted to be less than
zero in the presence of search frictions, overall wage increases in a locality have a built
in dampening effect on employment responses because they simultaneously increase the
availability of workers. In our model, this leads to reduced search costs for firms. Thus,
our framework suggests that the city-level labor demand curve should be less elastic
than the industry level demand curve by a factor of 1 − β3 .
     Recall that we can also obtain an estimate of the city-level demand elasticity through
direct estimation of the city-level specification (9). Estimates of (9) are presented in Ta-
ble 3, columns 1-4, with estimates where we use the employment rate as the dependent
variable in columns 5-8. All estimations in the table contain a full set of year dummies,
whose coefficients we suppress for brevity. Our IV estimates of the coefficient on log
                                                                       β1
changes in average city wages, which represents an estimate of 1−β        3
                                                                            , range from about
−0.26 to −0.31. The coefficients on labor force growth in the first four columns are ex-
tremely close to 1, regardless of the source of variation we use to isolate movements in
population. In the last four columns of the table, the wage elasticity obtained using Z2ct
and Z3ct are again nearly identical to each other, and the over-identification test again
fails to reject the null hypothesis associated with these being valid instruments. Thus, in
this city-level specification, the results continue to support our proposed framework for
studying labor demand. Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that the estimates of
the city-level demand elasticities using the aggregated data are almost identical to what
we just calculated using the estimated coefficients from the industry level specification
(6). Since estimation of (6) and (9) use very different levels of aggregation, and since
there is no mechanical reason the two specifications should provide the same results for
  β1
1−β3 , we view the similarity of the estimates of the city-level elasticity obtained from




                                             24
       the two different approaches as evidence supporting our framework.34 Finally, note that
       in Table 3, Z1ct has a positive and strongly statistically significant direct effect on the
       city-level employment rate, supporting the idea that it is a good instrument for that
       employment rate in the dis-aggregated equation estimation presented in Table 1.


       4.1    Breakdown between traded and non-traded goods
       In our model and interpretation of the data, we have assumed that all goods are traded
       across cities. This assumption allows us to treat the price of goods as being common
       across cities and, therefore, to fully capture their effects through time-varying industry
       effects. If there are goods produced that are not tradeable across cities, it will create a
       city-specific component in prices that will appear in the error term of our labor demand
       regressions. A simple way to get around this problem is to focus only on labor demand
       in tradeable goods sectors. To this end, we define tradeable and non-tradeable sectors
       using an approach from Jensen and Kletzer (2006). They argue that the share of em-
       ployment in tradeable goods should vary widely across regional entities (cities in our
       case) since different cities will concentrate in producing different goods which they can
       then trade. For non-tradeable goods, on the other hand, assuming that preferences are
       the same across cities, one should observe similar proportions of workers in their pro-
       duction across cities. We therefore rank industries by the variance of their employment
       shares across cities in the 1970 Census and label the industries in the top, middle and
       bottom third as high-, medium- and low-trade industries.
           In Table 4 and 5, we present estimates of Equation 6 carried out separately for the
       low-, medium- and high-trade industries. The difference between Table 4 and 5 is that
       the coefficient on population growth is constrained to be 1 in Table 5. The odd numbered
       columns of these two tables report OLS estimates, while the even number columns re-
       port IV estimates. The striking aspect one immediately notices from these two tables is
       the strong stability of our estimates across the different industry groupings. For exam-
       ple, the wage elasticity of labor demand varies only between -0.73 and -1.05 across the
       two tables for our IV estimations. If we focus on highly tradeable industries, we find an
       elasticity of -0.79 if we do not constrain the effect of population to be 1 (column 6 of Table
       4), while we obtain a coefficient of -0.88 when we do constrain this coefficient (column
       6 of Table 5). To push potential industry differences further, in Table 6 we report esti-
       mates of the wage elasticity of labor demand for seven common industry groupings. In
       the first column of this table we report OLS estimates of this elasticity and in the second
       column we report IV estimates. For these estimates we have constrained the coefficient
       of population growth to equal 1.35 The only industry in which we do not find a signif-
       icant negative wage elasticity is Agriculture, Mining and Construction. For the other
  34                                  β1
     Note that the OLS estimates of 1−β  3
                                           obtained from the city-level estimation is not close to that obtained
from the OLS estimates at the industry city equation. This supports the claim that there is no obvious
mechanical link forcing a similar result from the two estimates.
  35
     We have omitted the estimates on the city-level employment rate to save space.


                                                      25
       six industry groupings wage elasticities range between -0.73 and -1.28. The average of
       the IV estimates using the industry shares as weights, reported in the last row of the
       table, is -0.85. Hence, it appear reasonable to conclude that the wage elasticity of labor
       demand at the industry-city level is close to -1.



       5     Robustness
       In this section we explore the robustness of our results along two dimensions. In order
       to save space and provide more precise estimates of the wage elasticity, we report re-
       sults for specifications where we impose the effect of population growth on wage to be 1.
       Results where we do not impose this restriction are similar but less well defined.


       5.1    Breakdown by Education groups
       The model we developed in section 1 conceptually applies to workers of a single skill
       group. In section 2.1 we discussed how we address worker heterogeneity in our baseline
       results by adjusting wages in accord with treating individuals as bundles of efficiency
       units. In this section, we report results from estimating our labor demand curve sepa-
       rately by education group. The education groups we consider are those with high school
       education or less and those with some post secondary or more.36 When we perform this
       exercise, we are assuming that there are two completely segregated markets defined by
       education.37 The dependent variable in Table 7 is the change in log city-industry employ-
       ment for a particular education group. Similarly, wages and their instruments are con-
       structed separately by education group.38 In these equations, we have constrained the
       coefficient on population growth to equal one in order to favor more precise estimates.
       Columns 1-4 pertain to the low-education group and columns 5-8 to the high-education
       group. Inspection of the table reveals that the results for the high school educated group
       are very similar to those for the full sample. The results for the (smaller) college or more
       group are more erratic but also tend to imply a similar sized wage elasticity.


       5.2    Allowing for lagged wage effects
       In the derivation of our labor demand specification, we downplayed potential dynamic
       effects arising from adjustment costs as our goal was to derive a labor demand spec-
  36
     We have assessed the sensitivity of our results to finer breakdowns in education which typically resulted
in very imprecise estimates. Finer skill definitions dramatically reduce the number of city-industry cells to
work with, and results in sample size problems.
  37
     Empirical evidence suggests that workers within our education classes are perfect substitutes, but that
there is imperfect substitution of workers between the high- and low-education groups (Card, 2009). This
latter type of substitution is ruled out in this framework.
  38
     For example, Z2ct and Z3ct are constructed using city-industry shares and national wage premia that are
estimated with education specific samples.



                                                     26
       ification appropriate for long-differences aimed at capturing the main, low frequency
       determinants of employment. In this section we want to briefly explore whether this
       perspective may be biased due to the presence of dynamic effects that could extend over
       periods of more than 10 years. In particular, in our theoretical framework we did not
       allow for potential entrepreneurs/firms to move across localities in search of low-wage
       areas. Firms, for example, may have gradually adjusted from the higher wage North-
       eastern labor market to the lower wage south and west. If this type of adjustment is
       present and it operates at low frequencies then this could bias our results. To explore
       this possibility, we re-estimate our labor demand equation allowing for the initial level
       of wages to affect the change in employment. The rational for this extension is that
       the initial wage should capture incentives for entrepreneurs to move in low-wage cities.
       Since our measure of initial wages is likely affected by measurement error, we will also
       treat the initial wage level as an endogenous variable and add to our instrument set the
       level of wages ten years prior. It turns out that this instrument is an extremely strong
       predictor of initial wage levels as suggested by the F -statistics reported in Table 8.39 In
       addition, in Table 8, we have constrained the coefficient on population growth again to
       be 1. The first column of the table reports OLS estimates. Columns 2, 3 and 4 provide
       three different combinations for the instrument set.
           There are two observations that emerge from these regressions. First, the estimate
       of the wage elasticity of employment at the city level remains close to -1. Second, there
       is very little evidence suggesting that initial wage levels play an important part in de-
       termining subsequent changes in employment. Although this does not imply that other
       types of dynamic effects are not present, it does provide some support that our rather
       static specification of labor demand may be appropriate for studying change in employ-
       ment over decades.



       6      Summary and Interpretation of Empirical re-
       sults
       From our estimation of Equation 6 using data over four decades, we have found strong
       support for the following three patterns. First, we have found a significant and robust
       negative wage elasticity of labor demand. This wage elasticity is estimated to be close
       to -1 at the industry-city level and -0.3 at the city level. Second, we have found that,
       holding wages constant, an increase in the size of labor force is associated with an in-
       crease in employment in a proportion close to one-to-one. Finally, we have observed that
       tighter labor markets at the city level reduce industry-level employment.
           The issue we now want to discuss is how best to interpret these results. The finding
       we believe to be most interesting is the joint observation of a wage elasticity of labor
       demand far from infinity combined with an estimated elasticity of labor demand to pop-
39
     One drawback of using this additional instrument is that it forces us to drop the data for the 1970s.



                                                      27
       ulation close to 1. The model presented in section 2 suggests that one should infer from
       the latter observation on the effects of population that fixed inputs such as, for example,
       land, are unlikely to be placing important constraints on employment at the local level.
       This estimated population effect therefore also implies that the non-infinite wage elas-
       ticity of labor demand we estimate should not be interpreted as reflecting decreasing
       returns to scale due to some fixed physical factor. Recall from Equation 3 that, in the
       absence of a fixed physical factor, the wage elasticity of labor demand should be equal
       to infinity if there is either an infinite supply of potential entrepreneurs or if there is
       no span of control problem.40 Hence, observing a far from infinite wage elasticity of la-
       bor demand combined with a proportional effect of population on employment, implies
       that there is a limited supply of entrepreneurs willing to open shop in response to profit
       opportunities and that those entrepreneurs face span of control problems within their
       firms. We emphasize this finding because it is rather common in the macro-labor lit-
       erature to assume that the supply of entrepreneurs is infinitely elastic with respect to
       any profit opportunities, while our estimates suggest that this is likely an un-warranted
       assumption even when looking over rather long time spans.
           It is interesting to reconsider the wide range of available estimates of the elasticity
       of labor demand in light of these results. At one extreme, studies examining local la-
       bor market effects of migration related supply shocks tend to find large increases in the
       number of workers employed in the receiving labor market but little change in wages.
       This is what David Card found in his famous study of the 7% increase in the population
       of Miami generated by the Mariel boatlift. In a standard neoclassical framework, this
       could be interpreted as implying a nearly perfectly elastic labor demand curve. How-
       ever, we argue that the population inflow would likely bring with it more entrepreneurs
       and that this, alone, would imply an increase in employment. Importantly, in our very
       general specification the resulting wage and employment changes cannot be used to
       identify the effects of a wage change on employment at the level of the local labor mar-
       ket. Instead, one would need to focus directly on mechanisms for generating reliable
       variation in wage costs. This is the goal of the minimum wage literature, but one might
       be worried that the resulting estimates are specific to the low wage labor market. We,
       instead, make use of insights from the search and bargaining literature to obtain iden-
       tifying variation based on wage spillovers from changes in the industrial composition of
       a city. The resulting estimates indicate that the city-level labor demand curve is much
       less than perfectly elastic.
           The second insight we believe should be taken away from our estimates of labor de-
       mand is the relevance of search frictions. Allowing for such frictions in the estimation of
       labor demand curves has certainly not been the norm. However, our results suggest they
       are important. In particular, we saw from our estimates of industry-city level labor de-
       mand curves that, holding wages constant, employment at the industry level decreased
  40
    As noted previously, our approach does not allow us to differentiate evidence of decreasing return at the
firm level between a span of control problem or a limited demand for differentiated goods.



                                                     28
when employment at the city increased. Viewed through the lens of our framework, this
pattern also implies that the wage elasticity of labor demand at the city level should be
smaller than that at the industry level, which is precisely what we found when estimat-
ing the city-level demand curve. While there may exist other explanations for such a
pattern, search frictions offer a simple rationalization of the observed effects. In sum-
mary, our framework explains the rather small wage elasticity of labor demand that we
estimate at the city level as reflecting a combination of three factors: deceasing returns
to scale at the firm level, limited supply of new firms, and search externalities.



7    Conclusion
In this paper, we present an empirically tractable labor demand framework which incor-
porates several insights from the macro-labor literature. The data we use to evaluate
the framework involves city-industry level observations that span over a period of four
decades. Although our proposed labor demand framework is extremely parsimonious,
we find considerable empirical support for it in the sense that (i) estimates of the main
forces implied by the model are of the theoretically predicated sign and are statistically
significant, (ii) over-identifying restrictions implied by the theory are not rejected by our
data, and (iii) the results are robust and consistent across different levels of aggregation.
    Our main motivation for re-exploring the issue of labor demand was to shed light on
the question: how does a reduction in the labor costs borne by firms affect the employ-
ment prospects of individuals. As noted in the introduction, there remains considerable
debate over this quesiton. Some researchers infer that labor demand is very elastic
based on how economies react to migration flows while others infer that it is quite
inelastic based on, for example, the observed effects of minimum wage changes. Our
framework offers a reconciliation of these two views by separating out wage effects and
population growth effects. Looking at the data through the lens of our model, we found
there to be a significant negative effect of wages on employment, with an elasticity of
close to -1 at the industry level and an elasticity of -0.3 at the city level. We argue that
the lower elasticity at the city level is consistent with congestion externalities driven by
search frictions. We also find that, holding wages constant, an increase in population is
associated with a proportional increase in employment. We argue this latter pattern is
consistent with the view that potential job creators are a special scarce factor because it
is a scarce factor that is likely proportional to the population. An important insight we
draw from our analysis is the importance of allowing a role for scarce entrepreneurial
talent in the determination of labor demand.

                                       39
        A     Data
       The Census data was obtained with extractions done using the IPUMS system (see Rug-
       gles, Alexander, Genadek, Goeken, and Schroeder, Matthew B. Sobek (2010)). The files
       were the 1980 5% State (A Sample), 1990 State, 2000 5% Census PUMS, and the 2007
       American Community Survey. For 1970, Forms 1 and 2 were used for the Metro sample.
       The initial extraction includes all individuals aged 20 - 65 not living in group quarters.
       All calculations are made using the sample weights provided. For the 1970 data, we
       adjust the weights for the fact that we combine two samples. We focus on the log of
       weekly wages, calculated by dividing wage and salary income by annual weeks worked.
       We impute incomes for top coded values by multiplying the top code value in each year
       by 1.5. Since top codes vary by State in 1990 and 2000, we impose common top-code
       values of 140,000 in 1990 and 175,000 in 2000.
           A consistent measure of education is not available for these Census years. We use
       indicators based on the IPUMS recoded variable EDUCREC that computes comparable
       categories from the 1980 Census data on years of school completed and later Census
       years that report categorical schooling only. To calculate potential experience (age minus
       years of education minus six), we assign group mean years of education from Table 5 in
       Park (1994) to the categorical education values reported in the 1990 and 2000 Censuses.
           Census definitions of metropolitan areas are not comparable over time since, in gen-
       eral, the geographic areas covered by them increase over time and their definitions are
       updated to reflect this expansion. The definition of cities we use attempts to maximize
       geographic comparability over time and roughly correspond to 1990 definitions of MSAs
       provided by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.41 To create geographically con-
       sistent MSAs, we follow a procedure based largely on Deaton and Lubotsky (2003) which
       uses the geographical equivalency files for each year to assign individuals to MSAs or
       PMSAs based on FIPs state and PUMA codes (in the case of 1990 and 2000) and county
       group codes (for 1970 and 1980). Each MSA label we use is essentially defined by the
       PUMAs it spans in 1990. Once we have this information, the equivalency files dictate
       what counties to include in each city for the other years. Since the 1970 county group
       definitions are much courser than those in later years, the number of consistent cities
       we can create is dictated by the 1970 data. This process results in our having 152 MSAs
       that are consistent across all our sample years. Code for this exercise was generously
       provided by Ethan G. Lewis. Our definitions differ slightly from those in Deaton and
       Lubotsky (2003) in order to improve the 1970-1980-1990-2000 match.
           We use an industry coding that is consistent across Censuses and is based on the
       IPUMS recoded variable IND1950, which recodes census industry codes to the 1950
       definitions. This generates 144 consistent industries.42 We have also replicated our
       results using data only for the period 1980 to 2000, where we can use 1980 industry

       definitions to generate a larger number of consistent industry categories.43 We are also
       able to define more (231) consistent cities for that period.



        B     Selection Correction
       The approach we use to address the issue of selection on unobservables of workers
       across cities follows Dahl (2002). Dahl argues that, under a sufficiency assumption, the
       selection-related error mean term in the wage equation for individual i can be expressed
       as a flexible function of the probability that a person born in i’s state of birth actually
       chooses to live in city c in each Census year.44 Dahl’s approach is a two-step procedure
       that first requires estimates of the probability that i made the observed choice and then
       adds functions of these estimates into the wage equation to proxy for the error mean
       term. Dahl also presents a flexible method of estimating the migration probabilities
       that groups individuals based on observable characteristics and uses mean migration
       flows as the probability estimates. We closely follow Dahl’s procedure aside from several
       small changes to account for the fact that we use cities rather than states and to account
       for the location of foreign born workers.
           Dahl’s approach first groups observations based on whether they are ”stayers” or
       ”movers”. Dahl defines stayers as individuals that reside in their state of birth in the
       Census year. Since we use cities instead of states, we define stayers as those individuals
       that reside in a city that is at least partially located in individual’s state of birth in a
       given Census year. Movers are defined as individuals that reside in a city that is not
       located in that individual’s state of birth in a given Census year. We also retain foreign
       born workers, whereas Dahl drops them. For these workers, we essentially treat them
       as ”movers” and use their country of origin as their ”state of birth”.45 Within the groups
       defined as stayers, movers, and immigrants, we additionally divide observations based
       on gender, education (4 groups), age (5 groups), black, and hispanic indicators. Movers
       are further divided by state of birth. For stayers, we further divide the cells based on
       family characteristics.46 Immigrants are further divided into cells based on country of
       origin as described above.
  43
        The program used to convert 1990 codes to 1980 comparable codes is available at
http://www.trinity.edu/bhirsch/unionstats .         That site is maintained by Barry Hirsch, Trin-
ity University and David Macpherson, Florida State University.                      Code to convert 2000
industry codes into 1990 codes was provided by Chris Wheeler and can be found at
http://research.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/past/2006. See also a complete table of 2000-1990 in-
dustry crosswalks at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/indcswk2k.pdf
   44
      This sufficiency assumption essentially says that knowing the probability of an individual’s observed or
”first-best” choice is all that is relevant for determining the selection effect, and that the probabilities of
choices that were not made do not matter in the determination of ones wage in the city where they actually
locate.
   45
      We use the same country of origin groups as for the enclave instrument.
   46
      Specifically, we use single, married without children, and married with at least one child under the age
of 5.

                                                      41
           As in Dahl (2002), we estimate the relevant migration probabilities using the propor-
       tion of people within cells, defined above, who made the same move or stayed in their
       birth state. For each group, we calculate the probability that an individual made the
       observed choice and for movers, we follow Dahl in also calculating the retention prob-
       ability (i.e. the probability that individual i was born in a given state, and remained
       in a city situated at least partly in that state in general). For movers, the estimated
       probabilities that individuals are observed in city c in year t differ based on individuals’
       state of birth (and other observable characteristics). Thus, identification of the error
       mean term comes from the assumption that the state of birth does not affect the de-
       termination of individual wages, apart from through the selection term. For stayers,
       identification comes from differences in the probability of remaining in a city in ones
       birth state for individuals with different family circumstances. For immigrants, we as-
       sign the probability that an individual was observed in city c in a given Census year
       using the probabilities from immigrants with the same observable characteristics in the
       preceding Census year.47 This follows the type of ethnic enclave assumption used in
       several recent papers on immigration, essentially using variation based on the observa-
       tion that immigrants from a particular region tend to migrate to cities where there are
       already communities of people with their background.
           Having estimated the observed choice or ”first-best” choice of stayers, movers, and
       immigrants and the retention probability for movers, we can then proceed to the second
       step in adjusting for selection bias. To do this, we add functions of these estimated
       probabilities into the first stage individual-level regressions used to calculate regression
       adjusted average city-industry wages. For movers, we add a quadratic of the probability
       that an observationally similar individual was born in a given state and was observed in
       a given city and a quadratic of the probability that an observationally similar individual
       stayed in their birth state. For stayers, we add a quadratic of the probability that an
       individual remained in their state of birth. For immigrants, we add a quadratic of the
       probability that an similar individual was observed in a given city in the preceding
       Census year. Dahl allows the coefficients on these functions to differ by state, whereas
       we assume that they are the same across all cities.

     For cities in the 1980 Census not observed in the 1970 Census, we use the 1980 probabilities.
