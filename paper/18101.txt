                                             ABSTRACT

We examine the effects of introducing village elections on public goods expenditures, income distribution
and land use in rural China. We construct a large panel data set of village administrative records to
document the history of political reforms and economic policies for over two hundred villages. We
exploit the staggered timing of the introduction of village elections to find that elections significantly
increased public goods expenditure financed by villagers. In addition, we find that the introduction
of elections caused a moderate decline in income inequality and likely reduced corruption. The results
suggest that local officials are better controlled by local elections rather than by centrally managed
bureaucratic monitoring.

1     Introduction
The control of large bureaucracies, as the extensive literature on bureaucratic corruption shows, is

a difficult task.1 The lack of information and appropriate oversight often results in the misbehavior

of local officials.2 In autocratic countries, the control of local officials is further complicated by

the weakness of established channels to receive feedback from citizens.3 To address this agency

problem, several autocratic governments have introduced local elections in recent years.4 To date,

there is little systematic evidence on whether these reforms succeed in making local officials fulfill

their duties.

     China is the largest autocracy to try this institutional innovation. During the 1980s and 1990s

village-level elections were introduced to a rural population that numbers almost one billion, which

had never had any experience with elections before. In order to keep political control, the insti-

tutional changes implemented were limited. Historically, the village government was comprised

of two bodies that were appointed by the Communist Party: the Communist Party Branch and the

Village Committee. The reform put the Village Committee up for election and left the Party Branch

unchanged. The goal of this paper is to provide rigorous empirical analysis of the policy conse-

quences of this reform and, in the process, shed light on the effectiveness of elections in changing

incentives for local officials in an otherwise autocratic context.

     One of the most important responsibilities of village officials in rural China is the provision of

local public goods such as schooling, irrigation or village roads. The limitations of bureaucratic

monitoring meant that, before elections, there was widespread shirking among local officials. In

principle, elections can resolve this agency problem by giving local officials incentives to implement
    1A  classic example in this literature is Wilson (1989).
    2 For recent overviews of this literature, see Banerjee et al. (2012) and Olken and Pande (2012).
    3 Autocracies typically limit the rights to associate, freedom of expression and freedom of the press, which in demo-

cratic countries are important for the transmission of information on local scandals and demands. For instance, Besley
and Burgess (2002) show that a free press is important for government responsiveness.
    4 For example, local elections have occurred in Indonesia under Suharto (1968-1998), Brazil during the military dicta-

torship (1964-1985), and Mexico under the PRI (1929-2000). Recently, local elections were also introduced in Vietnam
in 1998, in Yemen in 2001, and in Saudi Arabia in 2005. For a literature review of the nascent political science research
on elections in dictatorships see Gandhi and Lust-Okar (2009) and Malesky and Schuler (2013) for an examination of the
Vietnam case.

policies that appeal to a majority in the constituency in order to obtain re-election.5 Village-level

expenditures on public goods are therefore our main focus in evaluating the effectiveness of the

introduction of elections.

    Our study faces two notable difficulties. The first is the lack of detailed data on political and

economic policies in rural China. For our main analysis, we construct the Village Democracy Survey

(VDS), a panel of over two hundred nearly representative villages from 29 provinces for the years

1982-2005. The survey documents the history of economic and governance policies, and contains

detailed economic data on public goods expenditure and the sources of funds. This is the longest and

broadest panel ever constructed to describe Chinese villages and is the first data to systematically

document the changes in the fiscal and political structure of village governments. In additional

exercises, we supplement the VDS with economic data from the the National Fixed-Point Survey

(NFS), which is collected yearly from the same villages as the VDS by the Ministry of Agriculture.

    The second difficulty lies in establishing the causal effect of the introduction of elections, which

were staggered in timing across villages. One concern is reverse causality as economic conditions

might affect the demand for elections. Another concern is joint determination, since both elections

and economic change could be the consequences of broader reforms of rural policies. To address

these concerns we take advantage of two features of the Chinese context. First, according to the

descriptive literature, the timing of the introduction of elections was mostly unrelated to village

characteristics. Second, electoral reforms were isolated to the village-level and were not accompa-

nied by changes in institutions or policies for upper-levels of government; nor did the reforms affect

the de jure powers of the village leaders. In the paper, we provide a large body of anecdotal and

quantitative evidence to support these two points.

    The main empirical analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we document that the timing of

elections across villages within provinces is uncorrelated with a large number of observable char-

acteristics at the village level, such as baseline public goods expenditure. This is consistent with

the anecdotal evidence which suggests that the timing of reforms was imposed top-down with little
   5 The  theoretical basis for this claim comes from the rich literature on political accountability. In broad terms, this
literature examines how elections induce politicians to provide more common interest policies such as more public goods.
See the discussion in Persson and Tabellini, (2000, chapter 1).



                                                            2
regard for village-specific characteristics. Second, we implement a difference-in-differences (DD)

strategy to estimate the causal effects of the introduction of elections: we compare outcomes before

and after the first election in each village, between villages that had already introduced elections

and those that have not. The baseline specification includes village fixed effects that control for all

time-invariant differences across villages, year fixed effects that control for all changes over time

that are similar across villages, as well as province-specific time trends to control for the economic

and cultural divergence across China during our period of study. These trends improve the precision

of our estimates, but do not affect the coefficients.

    As with any DD strategy, causal interpretation relies on the assumption that in the absence

of electoral reforms, the evolution of outcomes would be “parallel” across villages regardless of

when they implemented the first election. We support our assumption by documenting average

public goods expenditure before and after the first election and showing that there is very little

expenditure in any village prior to the introduction of elections, and therefore no pre-trend. At

the same time, the introduction of elections is accompanied by a dramatic rise in the level and

frequency of expenditures. We also show that our estimates are robust to controlling for pre-election

characteristics, the province-level decision to introduce village elections, which is the main source

of endogeneity, and a large number of other variables.

    Our results show that the introduction of elections increased total local government expenditure

on public goods by approximately 50%. The large percentage increase is consistent with the fact

that prior to the reforms, local public goods provision and expenditures were extremely low.6 The

per household increase in expenditure was 1.8% of the median household income. Because of

the infrequent and lumpy nature of public goods expenditure, it is also interesting to examine the

frequency of public goods investment. We find that elections increase the frequency of positive

expenditures by six percentage-points, which is over one-third of the sample mean. This suggests

that the newly introduced electoral accountability pushed officials to exert effort in providing public

goods, which had been neglected under the appointment regime.

    To better understand how the increase in public goods expenditures was reached, we investigate
  6 This   is noted in previous studies (Luo et al., 2007, 2010) and can be observed in our data. See Section 4.2.



                                                             3
the source of funds used to pay for village public goods and the amount of fees paid by households

to the local government. We find that the increase in public goods expenditure is entirely financed

by villagers, and that the introduction of elections increased the amount of local fees paid by all

households as a percentage of income by 0.3 to 0.5 percentage-points (the sample mean is approx-

imately two percentage-points). These results again suggest that elections made local government

more accountable to villagers, which increased the willingness of citizens to supply it with funds

(e.g., Fujiwara, 2011).7 Importantly, they contradict the traditional notion that elected governments

are less able to provide public goods because of short-term consumption demands of citizens.8

    The natural interpretation of our results is that elections made local governments more account-

able towards villagers. The key concern with this interpretation is that there might have been other

changes happening at the same time as the introduction of elections that would increase public

goods expenditures. We address this concern in several ways. First, we use the VDS to document

that elected village leaders had the power to make public goods investments and that this power

was not undermined when elections were introduced. Second, we show that the introduction of

elections had no effect on public goods expenditures financed by upper levels of government. Since

transfers are the most direct method for the upper government to increase local public goods, this

result strongly suggests that the introduction of elections was not confounded with other policies

that changed the priorities of upper-level government. Third, we examine the effect of the reform

on the characteristics of the newly elected officials versus those in positions that continue to be ap-

pointed. We find that the introduction of elections caused newly elected leaders to be younger and

more educated, but had no effect on the Communist Party Branch Party Secretary, who continued

to be appointed. All this supports the descriptive literature which documents that the introduction

of elections was not accompanied by any other changes in the Communist Party or rural policies.

Finally, as we discussed earlier, we subject these results to a large number of robustness checks.

    According to the literature on political accountability, elections generate outcomes aligned with

electorate preferences through two mechanisms: the presence of re-election incentives which lead
   7 For evidence that expanded democracy can increase public goods in the Brazilian context, see Fujiwara (2011),

which finds that an expansion of the enfranchisement increases public goods provision.
   8 For example, see the classic work of Huntington (1968) for a discussion of why democracy hinders the government’s

ability to raise taxes.


                                                          4
politicians to exert more effort, and the selection of better politicians (e.g., Besley and Case, 1995;

Dal-Bó and Rossi, 2011; Ferraz and Finan, 2011).9 We find evidence to suggest that both mecha-

nisms contributed to the effects of the introduction of rural elections in China.

    In addition to our main results on public goods, we also examine land use and household income

distribution. We find that the introduction of elections reduces the amount of land leased to enter-

prises and redistributes it back to households. Since the practice of leasing land to enterprises has

been linked to rent-seeking by local officials, this finding suggests that elections also helped curb

corruption. We also find that elections caused a moderate reduction in village income inequality by

reducing the incomes of the richest households, which is consistent with a systematic reduction in

pro-elite policies. Our data suggest that this change was achieved through a redistribution of pro-

ductive assets such as land and employment at village enterprises, which is probably a consequence

of the fact that village governments do not have the power to impose recurrent taxes and transfers.

    In sum, our results suggest that local elections in rural China have helped align village-level

policies with the interests of the majority by making local officials partially accountable to villagers.

This delegation of monitoring from centralized bureaucratic structures to citizens seems to constrain

local officials, even in a high state capacity autocratic context.

    This study makes several contributions. First, it is closely related to the growing number of

recent within-country studies that have focused on changes in various aspects of elections in poor

or middle income economies such as Argentina, Brazil and India (Beaman et al., 2009; Dal-Bó and

Rossi, 2011; Ferraz and Finan, 2011; Fujiwara, 2011).10 We differ from these studies in examining

a much starker institutional change: from no elections to elections. In addition, we do this in the

context of an autocracy, where the credibility of the reforms is necessarily limited by the need of

the regime to keep control.

    Second, since elections are an essential element of democracy, our results also speak to the
   9 For example, Besley and Case (1995), Dal-Bó and Rossi (2011) and Ferraz and Finan (2011) provide evidence for
the role of re-election incentives in the United States, Argentina and Brazil.
  10 Also, see Tyrefors and Pettersson-Lidbom (2014) for historical evidence from Sweden. These studies do not identify

the effects of introducing elections per se. An older working paper by Foster and Rosenzweig (2005) examines the effect
of the introduction of rural elections on public goods provision in India, but focuses on party competition mechanisms.
There is also a related literature examining the differences between elected and appointed officials (e.g., Besley and Coate,
2003; Lim, 2013; Martinez-Bravo, 2014).



                                                             5
broader literature on democracy and economic policy.11 The existing empirical evidence relating

democratic transition to public goods and redistribution, which mostly comes from cross-country

studies, is inconclusive (e.g., Acemoglu et al., 2013; Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006; Kudamatsu,

2012; Tavares and Wacziarg, 2001).12 Relative to cross-country comparisons, Chinese villages are

much more comparable with each other and the introduction of elections was not the result of social

turmoil and other confounding factors. Our focus on elections complements recent studies that

emphasize the importance of constraints on the executive in determining the effect of democracy on

economic outcomes (e.g. Besley and Persson, 2011).13

    Finally, our study adds to a small number of studies on the effects of village-level elections in

rural China (e.g., Luo et al., 2010; Shen and Yao, 2008; Zhang et al., 2004). These earlier works

inspired our study as they link village elections with changes in economic outcomes. However,

the fact that they only had data for a few non-representative provinces meant that they could not

estimate the average effect for China or adequately control for omitted variables.14 Our expanded

data significantly improves the rigor of the evidence by covering a nearly representative sample of

villages for a long time horizon. In addition, we examine a much larger set of new outcomes (e.g.,

land allocation, local fees, household income sources and leader characteristics), which enables us

to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the effect of elections and consider the generalizable

insights from the Chinese experience.
  11 For  instance see Acemoglu and Robinson (2001, 2006), Boix (2003), Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), Lizzeri and
Persico (2004), Besley and Kudamatsu (2008) who all relate democratization or extensions of the franchise to either in-
creased public goods provision or redistribution. Husted and Kenny (1997) and Miller (2008) provide empirical evidence
for increased welfare spending in the context of franchise extension in the United States.
   12 In the cross-section, democracy has been found to be positively associated with government size (Tavares and

Wacziarg, 2001), higher wages (Rodrik, 1999), lower inequality and higher human capital (e.g, Tavares and Wacziarg,
2001), and better health indicators (Besley and Kudamatsu, 2006; Kudamatsu, 2012). However, in a large study looking
at several socioeconomic policy dimensions, Gil et al. (2004) finds that democracy is associated with no difference in
the outcomes they examine. Using dynamic methods, Acemoglu et al. (2014) finds effects of democracy on subsequent
growth, but the effect on inequality is more nuanced in Acemoglu et al. (2013).
   13 Democracy is typically viewed as being comprised of two elements: the presence of elections to determine who will

be the executive authority and the presence of institutionalized constraints, such as an independent judiciary or media,
on what the executive authority can do. In the Chinese context, such constraints are absent both before and after the
introduction of electoral reforms. Therefore our paper isolates the effect of elections.
   14 For example, Shen and Yao (2008) examines the effect of elections on inequality using a panel of 48 villages in eight

provinces. Several studies have related elections to public goods. For example, Zhang et al. (2004) examines a panel of
sixty villages in one province; and Luo et al. (2010) examine over 2,000 villages in six provinces. Also, Gan et al. (2014)
uses the same sample as Shen and Yao (2008) to examine the relationship between elections and villager health shocks.




                                                            6
      Our finding that village leaders appointed by the Communist Party are less effective in pro-

viding public goods than those elected by villagers is consistent with Jia (2014), which finds that

connectedness between province-level and central government politicians (i.e., within the Party) is

associated with less effective pollution reduction. The cumulative evidence from studies of local

elections complement recent works by Jia and Nie (2013) and Lorentzen (2013) in understand-

ing why local outcomes typical to democracies are often tolerated or encouraged by the autocratic

Chinese government.15

      The extensive data collected in the VDS and the NFS variables used in our study, which will be

made public, will be helpful for future research on the political economy and development of China,

as the ICRISAT and REDS data have facilitated research of the Indian economy, and the Penn World

Tables have facilitated cross-country studies.

      This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the background. Section 3 presents

the conceptual framework and empirical strategy. Section 4 briefly describes the data. Section 5

presents the main results on public goods. Section 6 presents additional results on land use and

income. Section 7 concludes.


2      Background

2.1     Villages and Village Governance in Rural China

A majority of the rural population in China lives in villages, which are the lowest level of govern-

ment administration. Above the village government, there are the semi-equivalent levels of county

and township governments, the prefecture governments, the province governments, and ultimately,

the central government in Beijing. The main economic activity in villages is agriculture. The aver-

age village comprises approximately 400 households.

      Village governments were first organized by the communist government during the early 1950s,

with two groups of leaders in each village. First, there is the village committee. It typically consists

of three to five members and is led by the village chairman, henceforth VC. Second, there is the
   15 Jia and Nie (2013) studies the effect of political decentralization on coal mining accidents, and Lorentzen (2013)

studies the role of local protests.




                                                           7
Chinese Communist Party branch in the village. It is similar in size to the village committee and

is led by the village Party Secretary, henceforth PS. Before elections were introduced, all of these

positions were filled by appointment by the county government with input from the village Party

branch.

      One of the most important policies under the discretion of the village government is the provi-

sion of local public goods, such as irrigation, local roads and primary schools. Village leaders are

supposed to decide which public goods to provide and to raise funds from villagers to finance them.

Village governments do not have legal authority to impose any regular or recurring taxes. Instead,

to fund the activities of the village government, including public goods, they can raise revenues by

imposing ad hoc fees and levies, which we will henceforth refer to as local fees or local taxes for

simplicity.16

      The geographic size and social and economic diversity of China means that upper-level bureau-

crats encounter enormous difficulties monitoring the activities of local officials. As a consequence

of this informational asymmetry, local officials who shirked in providing public goods were typi-

cally able to maintain their positions.17 In response, villagers often resisted paying local fees, which

in turn starved local governments of funds and limited their ability to provide public goods (e.g., Oi

and Rozelle, 2000; Rozelle, 1994; Whiting, 1996). This negative feedback loop further complicated

the monitoring problem of the upper-level bureaucrats since they could not distinguish whether low

levels of public good provision were an outcome of corruption, lack of effort by the local officials,

the refusal of villagers to provide the necessary funds, or lack of demand from villagers.

2.2     Electoral Reforms

Motivation The first local elections were introduced in the early 1980s as collectives were being

dismantled. The difficulties in controlling local officials were paramount in the discussions leading

to the introduction of elections, as shown by this quote from the official debate.
   16 Additional responsibilities of the village government are land allocation, the management of village enterprises, the

maintenance of law and order, the collection of grain taxes on behalf of the central government and the implementation
of centrally mandated policies. For more discussion see Section 6.
   17 There is an abundance of examples of corrupt village officials who neglected public good provision (e.g. Brandt and

Turner, 2007, Kennedy et al., 2004, Oi and Rozelle, 2000, Rozelle, 1994; and Rozelle and Li, 1998).




                                                            8
       “Who supervises rural cadres? Can we supervise them? No, not even if we had 48

       hours a day....” – Peng Zhen, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, said at

       the chairmanship meeting of the Standing Committee of the Sixth NPC, April 6, 1987

       (O’Brien and Li, 1999).

Election proponents argued that village elections could fix the agency problems that were plagu-

ing local administration and generating discontent towards the regime at large. More specifically,

elections were expected to reduce the need for the central government to monitor local officials by

shifting monitoring responsibilities onto villagers. The idea was that making local officials account-

able to villagers would impose checks on the VC’s behavior and would also allow villagers to select

the most competent candidates.18

The Reform The initial introduction of elections changed the positions of all village committee

members from being appointed by the party-led county-level government to being elected by vil-

lagers. The main legal requirements were that: i) the number of candidates must exceed the number

of positions; ii) term lengths were to be three years; and iii) the winner must obtain 50% of votes

in the last round of voting.19 The village committee member who obtained the highest number of

votes in the last round automatically became the VC. All adult villagers had the right to vote and

could abstain from voting. The village Party Branch was unaffected by the reforms and remained

appointed by the upper-levels of government. There was no change either to the size of the village

committee or party branch (e.g., the number of positions).

    The law did not clarify the power relationship between the village committee and the Party

Branch, which remained ambiguous.20 Anecdotal evidence suggests that the power arrangements

between these two bodies were very heterogeneous across villages. Indeed, in many areas the Party

maintained control over villages by allowing the local Party branch to nominate the candidates.

For this reason, we refer to village leaders, which comprise both bodies, as the subject of village

decision-making. Rather than wholesale democratization, this reform is better understood as a

official introduction of local elections.

the Party.

marginal change intended to make the local government more accountable to villagers. Ultimately,

the main change of the reform was to give villagers the power to vote unsatisfactory VCs out of

office.

    In these elections, there are no political parties and no slates of candidates with common plat-

forms. Candidates are drawn from the village and are thus typically well-known by the villagers.

As a consequence, candidates typically run on well-understood issues and are probably selected for

qualities that have been long observed by their fellow villagers.21

    Elections typically occurred during the lunar Spring Festival, which usually takes place between

mid-January and mid-February each year.

Timing Innovative provincial governments began experimenting with elections in the early 1980s.

Elections were formally codified by the central government in the Organizational Law on Village

Committees (OLVC) in 1987. From this point onwards, all provinces were pushed to introduce

elections in all rural areas. A revision of the OLVC in 1998 required candidate nominations to be

open to all villagers.

    The decision to introduce elections at the province-level was the result of political pressure and

bargaining between the central government and the provincial leaders. However, implementation

within provinces was mainly imposed top-down by bureaucratic fiat. Each level of government

would pilot the reform in a few select villages, and the reform would be widely implemented once

the procedures and logistics were tested (O’Brien and Li, 1999).

    To understand the process and details of the reform, we conducted a large number of inter-

views with county- and province-level officials and conducted focus groups with village officials

and prominent citizens in over a dozen villages in four provinces during the summers of 2006 and

2007. All evidence points to the roll-out as having been mostly orthogonal to village characteris-

tics. This is consistent with the speed of roll-out within provinces. By all accounts, villages had

no discretion over the timing of introduction of elections, which is characteristic of reforms in rural

China.22
  21 There are very few accounts of actual electoral campaigning. In many cases, elections were set up with only a few

days’ notice (Unger, 2002: p. 221).
  22 In his detailed study of elections, Unger (2002, p. 222) writes that “These [elections] should not be interpreted




                                                         10
      The anecdotal evidence collected by us as well as that from qualitative studies only point to two

exceptions to the “quasi-random” timing of the within-province introduction of village elections.

First, the pilot villages used to test electoral procedures were obviously selected to introduce elec-

tions earlier. Second, there are a few accounts of elections being delayed in “problematic” villages

that had a history of non-compliance with unpopular central government policies (e.g., One Child

Policy or the permanent expropriation of village land by the upper-levels of government) or had

a large kinship clan that could dominate other villagers in a majoritarian regime.23 To examine

the quantitative importance of these factors for determining the timing of elections, we collected

data on the allowance of One Child Policy exemptions and the incidence of upper-government land

expropriations in the VDS. Later, we will examine the correlation between these variables and the

introduction of elections. Afterwards, in the robustness section, we control for them explicitly to

check that they do not confound our main results. Finally, we also check that our estimates are not

driven by pilot or straggler villages in each province.


3      Conceptual Framework

3.1     Accountability

The anecdotal evidence described above suggests that prior to the introduction of elections, local of-

ficials could benefit from asymmetric information by shirking in their efforts to provide and maintain

public goods. Elections were introduced in order to mitigate these agency frictions. Hence, if the

reforms were effective in making local officials at least partly accountable to villagers, we would ex-

pect the introduction of elections to increase public goods expenditure by the village government.24

Due to this increase in accountability, villagers should also be willing to contribute more funds to
as bottom-up initiatives by the villagers themselves; they are not in a position to play any precedent-setting part in
the initiation of new electoral reforms. There is a mistaken belief among some people outside China regarding this...
elections are quietly being instituted at levels above the village, engineered first in selected districts at a distance from
Beijing, through the connivance of the [central] Ministry of Civil Affairs and middle-ranking officials out in the regions”.
Unger (2002) also notes the general passivity of villages in implementing rural reforms such as land reforms and the
adoption of the Household Responsibility Reform earlier in the reform era.
   23 The role of kinship groups in elections has also been discussed by Han and O’Brien (2009) and Oi and Rozelle

(2000).
   24 The theoretical basis for this claim is the political agency literature in which voters express dissatisfaction with

observed outcomes by ousting incumbents in elections. Please see a brief discussion in Section 5.6.4.

the government, further improving the provision of public goods. The purpose of the rest of this

paper is to investigate the effect of the introduction of elections on public goods expenditure and the

mechanisms driving this effect.

3.2    Empirical Strategy

The empirical strategy used in our main analysis assumes that the introduction of elections was

quasi-random once province-specific time trends and village and year fixed effects are included.

Specifically, we use a differences-in-differences (DD) strategy, where we compare the evolution of

outcomes in villages that have had their first election to villages that have not yet implemented their

first election. Our baseline estimates control for village and year fixed effects. Village fixed effects

control for all time-invariant or slow-moving differences between villages, such as geographic char-

acteristics (e.g., hilliness or distance from a city) or culture. Year fixed effects control for changes

over time that affect all villages similarly (e.g., national policy changes, macroeconomic growth).

In addition, we add province-time trends, which control for the widening differences across regions

brought about by unequal economic growth during the long time horizon of our study. Since we be-

lieve that the timing of elections is endogenously determined at the province level, but quasi-random

within provinces, these trends have the additional advantage of capturing a significant amount of the

cross-province variation.25 The baseline specification also controls for the second wave of reforms

that opened the nomination of candidates to villagers. This allows us to control for potential hetero-

geneity in the effect of elections.26 The baseline equation that characterizes the effect of elections

is

                                   Yvpt = β E vpt + λ Ovpt + γ pt + δv + ρt + εvpt ,                                      (1)

where the policy outcome of village v in province p during calendar year t, Yvpt , is a function of:

a dummy variable, E vpt , that takes the value of one after the first election in village v has taken
   25 In the robustness section, we show that the magnitude of our estimates is similar, though less precisely estimated,

when we control for province-year fixed effects. We also provide several other checks to make sure that province-level
decisions do not drive our estimates.
   26 This improves the precision of our estimates, but does not affect the magnitude of estimated effects of the introduction

of elections. For brevity, we only report results where we control for the introduction of open nominations. Results
without these controls are very similar and are available upon request. Note that we do not control for other procedural
differences in elections because they are more likely to be endogenous.



                                                             12
place; a dummy variable, Ovpt , that takes the value of one after the first open nomination in village v

has taken place; province-year trends, γ pt; village fixed effects, δv ; and calendar-year fixed effects,

ρt . Since the timing of elections was largely decided at the province level, we cluster the standard

errors at the province-level. As we only have 29 provinces, we address the possibility of small

sample bias in the clustered standard errors by also presenting p-values derived from wild bootstraps

as recommended by Cameron et al. (2008).27 The main coefficient of interest is β . Following the

discussion in Section 3.1, we expect β to be positive if elections increased public goods expenditure.

      Interpreting β as the causal effect of introducing elections does not require us to assume that

election timing within provinces was random. Instead, it requires the weaker assumption that con-

ditional on the baseline controls, the introduction of elections is not correlated with time-varying

village characteristics that affect the outcomes of interest through channels other than elections. We

do not take this identification assumption as given and provide a large body of evidence supporting

its validity later in the paper. Before we present the main results, we present evidence that the timing

of elections within provinces was uncorrelated with a large number of village-level characteristics.

We will also use the data on public goods expenditure to document that there are no pre-trends

leading up to the first election, and that the rise in expenditure accompanies the introduction of

elections. After we present the main results, we conduct a large number of additional robustness

and sensitivity checks. In particular, we show that our estimates are similar when we control for

the timing of the first introduction of village elections in each province, which is the main source of

potential endogeneity.


4      Data

4.1      The VDS and NFS Surveys

The primary data used in this paper for elections and public goods expenditure are from the Village

Democracy Survey (VDS), a village-level survey conducted by the authors of this paper, where we

record the administrative data kept by village governments. The first wave, conducted in 2006,

records the history of electoral reforms, de facto leader power, public goods expenditures, the
    27 The   bootstraps are estimated using 999 repetitions.



                                                               13
sources of funds for public goods expenditures, and the enforcement of central government poli-

cies. For public goods, the accounting methods, the categories for expenditure, and the sources of

financing are all determined by the Ministry of Agriculture. The second wave, conducted in 2011,

records the names and characteristics of all village leaders since 1982. To ensure accuracy of the

historical data, the retrospective VDS relies on administrative records for each village when pos-

sible. When village records are not available, we rely on the recall of survey respondents, which

include all current and former living village leaders and elders (e.g., teachers) in each village. This

applies to very few of our variables and we will note them when relevant. The VDS forms a bal-

anced panel of 217 villages for the years 1982-2005. However, villages only begin to record public

goods data in 1986. Hence, our panel effectively covers the period 1986-2005. The main sample

used in our analysis comprises a balanced panel of 217 villages from 29 provinces.28

    The villages we survey are the same villages surveyed by the National Fixed-Point Survey

(NFS), a detailed village- and household-level economic survey collected and maintained by a re-

search center of the Ministry of Agriculture of China. It is collected each year beginning in 1986,

with the exception of 1992 and 1994 due to administrative issues.29 In the examination of mecha-

nisms, robustness checks and the additional exercises in Section 6, we also use data from the NFS.

We will describe these data as they become relevant.

    Our data have several advantages. First, to the best of our knowledge, the VDS data are the

most comprehensive data on village-level reforms ever constructed. They cover a period starting in

1982, when modern villages were defined after the Household Responsibility Reforms. In addition

to recording the history of electoral reforms, we also record the timing of other major rural reforms,

the occurrence of village mergers, and numerous other village-level characteristics. This allows

us to control for heterogeneity across villages more comprehensively than past studies, which is
  28 There  are 31 provinces in China at the end of our sample period. The two excluded provinces are Tibet and
Chongqing. Tibet is excluded because it is subject to different political and economic policies. Chongqing is a city-
municipality that is excluded because it did not achieve provincial status until 1997. The three other city-municipalities
with provincial status (Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin) are included in our data. Each contain a substantial rural population
(30% or higher). We will control for whether a village is a suburb of a city later in the section on robustness and show
that our results are not influenced by their inclusion.
   29 The NFS villages were chosen in 1986 to be nationally representative for rural China. Within each village, approxi-

mately 25% of households were randomly selected in 1986 and followed over time; new households were introduced over
time to maintain representativeness. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there is very little attrition and households
and villages are mainly added to adjust for gradual demographic changes.


                                                            14
particularly important given the natural diversity across China. The richness of the data also allows

us to provide a detailed analysis of the effect of elections on a range of outcomes and to assess the

mechanisms driving the main results.

      Second, the village administrative records that we surveyed in the VDS were collected contem-

poraneously. Hence, we avoid recall bias. Third, since the format of village records were mandated

by the Ministry of Agriculture, the data are easily comparable across villages. Finally, the panel

structure of the survey allows us to control for village fixed effects and province-year trends.

      The main drawback of our data is that relative to the period through which elections were rolled

out, the panel is short. This limits our ability to observe the long run effects of elections.

      All observations in the empirical analysis are at the village-year level. We will describe the

variables as they become relevant.

4.2     Descriptive Statistics

4.2.1    The Timing of Elections

Several pieces of descriptive evidence are consistent with the anecdotal evidence on the timing

of electoral reforms discussed in Section 2. First, the data show that there is substantial within-

province variation in the timing of the first election in each village. In a village-level cross-sectional

regression, when we regress the year of the first election on province fixed effects we find that the

R-squared is 0.33. Thus, approximately 67% of the variation in the timing of elections is within

province. This is important for our empirical strategy, which largely relies on this variation.

      Second, the timing of the rollout is consistent with rapid top-down implementation within

provinces and counties. Our data indicate that 16% of villages held their first elections prior to

the official introduction of elections by the county government, 66% held their first elections the

year that the county introduced elections, and 18% held their first election afterwards.30 Table 1

shows that the average village implemented its first election within the same year as the official in-
  30 Note that the timing of the official introduction of elections in each county is based on respondent recall. To maximize
accuracy, our surveyors only record a date if all respondents surveyed in a given village agree. If there is no consensus,
this variable is recorded as missing. Since provinces are large and respondents could not confidently recall the year of the
first election within a province, the date of province-level introduction is inferred as the year of the first election in each
province according to our survey.




                                                             15
troduction of elections in its county and five years after the first election in the same province. Since

the 29 provinces of our sample include approximately 2,885 counties and 623,669 rural villages (as

defined by the number of village governments, cunming weiyuanhui), these statistics imply that the

average county was able to introduce elections in 143 villages within one year.

    Third, the fact that a small number of villages implemented elections before and after the offi-

cial introduction in each county is consistent with the anecdotal evidence that each administrative

division typically piloted the reform before officially introducing it and also delayed elections in

a few villages. Hence, given our identification assumption, it is important to check that our base-

line estimates are not driven by the early movers or the stragglers, which we do in our robustness

exercises.

    In addition, we can provide direct evidence that the timing of the first election is uncorrelated

to most pre-reform village characteristics. Since we are interested in within-province variation, we

demean the year of the first election and village characteristics by province fixed effects. We then

estimate bivariate regressions of the residualized election timing on each of a large number of resid-

ualized village characteristics such as village size, proximity to an urban area, proxies for social and

economic structure, measures of the pre-existing level of public goods provision and other outcomes

of interest. We measure all these village characteristics in the first year that data are available.31 The

sample for this estimation is therefore a cross section of villages. For brevity, we present the results

for village demographic and physical characteristics, the main outcome variables of our regression

analysis, and the unpopular upper-government policies that we discussed in Section 2.32 Since it

is difficult to compare magnitudes across different regressors, Table 2 presents the standardized

coefficients for each regression. Only one of the correlates is statistically significant. Given the

large number of correlates that we examine (we examine over eighty additional insignificant socio-

economic correlates that are not presented in the paper for brevity), the significance of one correlate
  31 Most  variables reported by the NFS are available starting in 1986. Land variables are available starting in 1987.
Measures of the One Child Policy and upper-government land expropriation from the VDS are available starting in 1982.
The results are similar if we measure the latter two variables in 1986. The results are also similar if we measure all
variables as the average of the first two years for which they are available. These alternative results are available upon
request.
  32 See the Online Data Appendix for a description of the variables: upper-government land expropriation and One

Child Policy exemptions, which we collect in the VDS.

is not necessarily meaningful. Nevertheless, in the robustness exercises later in the paper, we will

control for this and other potentially confounding variables.

    The data also provide several pieces of descriptive evidence to suggest that elections were effec-

tively implemented. We find that 79% of elections had more candidates than positions, as the law

required. Most of the elections with too few candidates were the first elections in their villages, and

were all immediately followed by fresh elections in the subsequent year. This is consistent with the

view that opponents to the electoral reform were unable to fully derail the introduction of elections,

and with qualitative accounts of dissatisfied villagers demanding and obtaining recalls (O’Brien and

Li, 2006). Table 1 shows that, as legally required, elections occur every three years on average.33

Finally, and not reported in the table, we find that there was a 38% VC turnover rate for the first

election, which is more than twice as high as the average turnover rate in the sample (17%).

4.2.2    Trends in Public Goods Expenditures

Before presenting the regression results, we examine the raw data on public goods expenditures and

provide evidence for the parallel trends assumption. Villages record public goods expenditures as

the sum of expenditures on seven categories that are defined by the Ministry of Agriculture: irri-

gation, primary schools, sanitation, within-village roads, electricity, the environment (e.g., planting

trees), and “other”.34

    Our DD strategy assumes that in the absence of elections, the outcomes of villages that intro-

duced elections earlier would have evolved along parallel trends with the outcomes of villages that

introduced elections later. Since it is impossible to observe the counterfactual trend, we follow the

literature in conducting a pre-trend analysis. The presence of a trend in the years leading up to the

introduction of elections would suggest that late reformers evolved on different trends from early

reformers and cast doubt on our identification strategy.

    Our data allow us to separately examine expenditures according to the source of funds, which we

categorize into funds from village sources and from outside the village (mostly upper government
  33 Note that there is variation in this variable (the standard deviation is approximately one year), which mitigates the

concern that village records report elections as they are supposed to occur rather than when they actually occur.
  34 In addition to public goods expenditures, village government expenditures also cover other items such as salaries of

local cadres and expenditure on festivals and celebrations. In our data, public goods expenditures account for approxi-
mately 27% of total village government expenditures.


                                                           17
transfers). Since according to our discussion in Section 3.1, an increase in accountability should

only affect the amount of expenditures financed by villagers, we focus on this outcome first.

    To investigate the presence of pre-trends we would like to plot average expenditure in public

goods for each year before and after the first election. However, if we use the full sample of villages,

the patterns observed could suffer from a potential confounding factor: each year average comprises

a different set of villages. This is because elections were staggered in timing across villages. While

this is an advantage for our identification strategy in that it allows us to control for calendar time

effects, it also means that when we reorganize the data according to the number of years since the

first election, the interpretation of the figure may be confounded with composition effects.

    To address this, we restrict the sample to keep a constant set of villages. We do this for several

different windows since the villages in the sample change as we adjust the window. For brevity,

we present the figures for two windows for which we can observe a symmetric number of years

before and after the first election. Figure 1a plots average expenditures from two years before the

first election until two years after the first election (since elections have three year terms, this is

the end of the first term after the introduction of elections). Year 0 on the x-axis indicates the year

of the first election.35 Figure 1a shows that on average, villages make large investments one year

after the reform. Figure 1b extends the window to begin nine years prior to the first election until

nine years after the first election. This reduces the number of villages in the sample. However,

the pattern is similar to the pattern from the full sample. There is very little activity prior to the

introduction of elections and public goods expenditures increase beginning one year after the first

election. Expenditures are not made every year, and in between large expenditures, there are smaller

expenditures. The latter is consistent with the fact that several of the public goods in our data will

require large fixed costs to construct (e.g., irrigation, roads), and smaller expenditures in between

for maintenance.

    Three facts emerge clearly from these figures. First, there was very little activity in public goods

expenditures prior to the introduction of elections and the pre-reform level is close to zero. Second,

the level of expenditure and the amount of activity increased with the introduction of elections.
  35 Throughout  the paper, we report real values that are deflated using the official province-specific rural CPI. We use
the conversion rate of 7 RMB = 1 USD, which was the historical average for the period we study.


                                                           18
Finally, the lumpy nature of public goods expenditures translates into the noise observed after the

first election.

      These figures also illustrate the variation driving our empirical estimates. The main post-reform

estimate from equation (1) is essentially the difference in the average expenditures in the pre-reform

and post-reform periods shown in the figure (after controlling for village and year fixed effects, and

province trends).

      Figures 2a and 2b display average public good expenditure financed by the upper government

for the same restricted samples as Figures 1a and 1b. We see no increase after the introduction of

elections. This shows that only expenditures financed by villagers change as a result of elections

and supports the claim that the introduction of elections was not accompanied by other changes in

government policy.


5      Public Goods

5.1     Main Results

Table 3 presents the effect of elections on public expenditures from estimating equation (1). For all

estimates we report standard errors that are clustered at the province level in parentheses and wild

bootstrapped p-values in square brackets immediately below.

      Panel A presents the regression estimates where the dependent variable is total public goods

expenditure of the village. Before presenting the baseline equation, we first present estimates where

we control for only village and year fixed effects. Column (1) shows that the coefficient for the

post-first election dummy variable is 18.4. In column (2), we show that the effect on public goods

financed by villagers is similar in magnitude, 16.4. Both estimates are statistically significant at

the 10% level. The bootstrapped p-values indicate slightly less precisely estimated. In column (3),

we find that there is no effect on public goods financed by other sources. The coefficient is small

and statistically insignificant. The top row, which reports the means, shows that, consistent with the

anecdotal literature, village leaders are responsible for raising most of the funds required for village

public goods – approximately 70% of total funding for village public goods comes from village

sources.


                                                   19
    In Columns (4)-(6), we add province-year trends. The coefficients are similar, but the estimates

for all public goods and public goods financed by villagers are now significant at the 5% level. The

bootstrapped p-values are similarly precise. The increase in precision is likely to be due to the fact

that the province trends control for the significant social-economic divergence across regions during

the period of our study. This is our baseline specification. The estimate for public goods financed

by other sources (column 6) continues to be statistically indistinguishable from zero.

    For brevity, and to be conservative, we will refer to the bootstrapped p-values when discussing

statistical significance in the remainder of the paper.

    Column (4) in Table 3 shows that the introduction of elections increased total public goods ex-

penditures from all sources by approximately 153,110 RMB (22,044 USD). This is a large increase

relative to the sample mean of 138,100 RMB (21,873 USD), which is rather low due to the negli-

gible expenditures in the early years of the sample. To assess the magnitude another way, we can

compare it to the average increase in total public goods expenditure between the first and last years

of our sample (1986 and 2005). This was 483,499 RMB (69,071 USD). Thus, the introduction of

elections explains 32% of the total increase observed in the data. The result is consistent with our

hypothesis that elections changed the incentives of village leaders and led them to exert more effort

and be more responsive to villagers’ demands for more public goods.

    In Panel B, we examine an alternative dependent variable: a dummy variable which equals one

if any public goods expenditure is made in a year. This examination is motivated by Figure 1, which

suggests that the introduction of elections not only increased the level of expenditure, but also the

frequency of expenditure. Public goods expenditure data turns out to be very lumpy. Villages do not

make any public goods investments in most years. The means at the top of Panel B show that only in

about 22% of the village-year observations in our sample public investments are positive. Consistent

with the fact that most investments are funded by villagers, we see that village-financed investments

are made in seventeen percent of the sample, while upper government funded investments are made

in only seven percent of the sample.

    We focus our discussion of the results on frequency on the baseline specifications in columns

(4)-(6). Column (4) shows that the introduction of elections increased the probability that any


                                                  20
expenditure is made during a year by 5.7 percentage points. The estimate is statistically significant

at the 10% level. Column (5) shows that for expenditures financed by villagers, the introduction of

elections increased the probability by 6.3 percentage points. The estimate is statistically significant

at the 5% level. Column (6) shows that there is no effect on the frequency of expenditures financed

by other sources.

      These results show that elections increased both the level and frequency of public goods in-

vestments, and that the increase is driven by villager financing. The latter is important for three

reasons. First, it demonstrates that elections affect policy at the village level, since the responsive

funds are under the control of village leaders. Second, it contradicts the notion that “democrati-

cally” elected leaders cannot raise revenues for public goods in our context. Third, it contradicts the

alternative interpretation that the estimated effects of the introduction of elections are driven by an

increased willingness of the upper-government to fund local public goods, since direct transfers are

the most immediate policy tool that upper levels of governments would use to affect local public

good provision.

5.2     Alternative Measures

One may wonder whether the increase in total public goods expenditure (funded by villagers) is

driven by an increase in village population, or whether the large magnitude of the increase in total

expenditures is plausible. We investigate these two questions by examining expenditure per house-

hold and per worker as dependent variables. The NFS data do not record population. Instead, they

record the number of households and workers. Columns (2) and (3) of Table 4 show that the intro-

duction of elections increased expenditures by 180 RMB (25.7 USD) per household and 110 RMB

(15.7 USD) per worker. Both estimates are statistically significant at the 5% level.

      These results show that the increase in total expenditures due to elections was not entirely driven

by population increases. They also show that the magnitude of the increase is very plausible. Me-

dian household income in our sample is 10,126 RMB. The estimate in column (2) thus implies

that the increase in public goods expenditures is approximately 1.8% of household median income

(180/10126 = 0.018).



                                                    21
      Next, we examine the logs of expenditures and per capita (per household and per worker) expen-

ditures. The estimates are positive and statistically significant at the 5% level in columns (4)-(6).

Thus, our main result that the introduction of elections increase public goods expenditures is not

sensitive to the functional form.36

5.3     Interpreting the Magnitude

Note that the estimated levels in column (1) of Table 4 yields a coefficient that is about 170% of

the sample mean, while in column (4), we obtain an effect of 44 log-points, which is equal to

approximately 55%. This is consistent with the size of investments varying widely across villages

(for the 20% of observations that experience positive expenditures, the mean expenditure financed

by villagers is 570,776 RMB and the standard deviation is 2,846,690 RMB). Thus, one may be

concerned that the estimated average effect of elections on the level of investment might be driven

by outlier observations that make particularly large investments.

      To investigate this possibility, we omit observations where expenditures are within the top one

percent of the sample. Table 5 shows that this lowers mean expenditure from 94,560 RMB for the

full sample in column (1) to 23,860 RMB for the restricted sample in column (2). Not surprisingly,

the coefficients show that the extent to which elections increases the level of expenditure is also

lower in the restricted sample. The coefficient declines from 16.08 for the full sample to 1.121 for

the restricted sample. Both are statistically significant at the 5% level.

      One explanation for the change in the estimates is that the effect of elections is proportional. To

investigate this possibility, we examine log expenditure as the dependent variable. The estimates

in columns (3)-(4) for the full sample and restricted sample are 44 and 40 log-points respectively

(which correspond to an increase of 55% and 49%, respectively).37 These coefficients are very

similar in magnitude and both are statistically significant at the 5% level. The stability of these
  36 We   compute the log of total public goods as the log of total public goods + 0.1 in order to retain observations with
zero public good investments. Note that the increase in log total public goods expenditure in column (4) is much larger
in magnitude than the increase in log per household or log per worker expenditures in columns (5) and (6). This is most
likely due to the aging of the baby boom cohort (rural fertility during the 1950s-1970s was very high). Over the period
of our study, this will increase the number of working age adults as well as the number of households in each village (as
children grow up, marry, and move out of their parents’ homes). Note that because of policy restrictions, there is very
little permanent rural migration in rural China.
   37 Column (3) in Table 5 replicates Column (4) in Table 4, for ease of comparison.




                                                           22
coefficients suggests that the average effect of elections is best captured in proportional terms – i.e.,

elections increase public goods expenditures financed by villagers by approximately 50%.

      Another way to normalize the effect of elections is to report standardized coefficients. Columns

(1)-(2) show that the standardized coefficients are also stable across the different samples. They

show that a one standard deviation change in the timing of the first election causes approximately a

0.04 to 0.05 standard deviation change in public goods expenditures.

5.4     Dynamic Effect

In Table 6, we investigate whether the effect of elections persisted after their initial introduction by

estimating the level of public goods expenditures after the first term. Column (1) re-states the full

sample estimates for comparison purposes. Column (2) omits the year of the first election. Column

(3) additionally omits the year afterwards. Column (4) additionally omits two years after the first

election. Since elections terms are three years, column (4) effectively omits the entire first term

after the reform. The precision of the estimates declines as we reduce the sample size. However,

the estimate in column (4) is very similar to the full sample estimate in column (1) and we conclude

that the effects of the reform are not exclusive to the first election term.

      In columns (5)-(8), we repeat this exercise for the frequency of investments. As with the esti-

mates on levels, these coefficients are similar across sample restrictions. They are always significant

at the 10% level or higher.



5.5     Robustness

There are three main concerns for our empirical strategy. The first concern is that despite controlling

for province time trends, our baseline results are partly driven by cross-province variation in timing,

which is determined by provincial leaders for potentially endogenous reasons. We address this

issue in three ways. First, to control for the province-level timing of the decision to introduce

village elections, we add a dummy variable that indicates whether any village in a given province

has introduced elections (Table 7 column (2)). The results are similar to the baseline estimates,

which are displayed in column (1) for ease of comparison. Hence, our results are not an outcome


                                                   23
of province-level variation in the timing of the introduction of the reform, which is the main source

of endogeneity concerns. A second way of accounting for province-level factors is to introduce

province-year fixed effects instead of province-year trends. This allows the influence of province

characteristics to vary flexibly over time. Column (3) shows that this stringent set of controls reduces

the precision of our estimates. However, what is important is the fact that the coefficient is nearly

identical in magnitude as the baseline specification. Finally, we control for province-level variables

such as per capita GDP, per capita agricultural GDP, and per capita government expenditure in

public goods.38 In column (4), the coefficients with these controls are statistically similar to our

baseline.

    The second main concern is that our estimate could be driven by pilot or straggler villages in

the reform implementation (see Section 2), which may have been chosen endogenously. In column

(5), we repeat our estimate on a restricted sample where we drop pilot and straggler villages.39 The

estimate is similar to the baseline.

    The final concern is that there may be village-specific and time-varying determinants of the

introduction of elections that are not controlled for by the baseline controls and that affect the out-

comes of interest through channels other than elections. The strongest evidence against this concern

was shown earlier in Section 4.2. Recall that Table 2 showed that the timing of the introduction of

elections is uncorrelated with most observables features of the village. Furthermore, Figure 1 doc-

umented that there was no pre-trend in public goods expenditures and that the rise in public goods

expenditures occurs with the introduction of elections.

    Nevertheless, one may still be concerned that the timing of the introduction of elections is corre-

lated with pre-conditions that affect our outcomes of interest through channels other than elections.

We address this concern by directly controlling for the interaction term of the village characteristic

that was significantly correlated with the timing of the introduction of elections – the occurrence of

upper government land expropriation (see Table 2) – and the full vector of year fixed effects. Given
  38 These   data are reported by China Statistical Yearbooks.
  39 A pilot village is defined as a village that implemented elections more than two standard deviations before the average

timing of villages in the same province. A straggler village is defined as one that implemented elections more than two
standard deviations after the average timing of villages in the same province. If all of the villages in a province implement
elections in the same year, then that province will have no pilot or straggler villages.



                                                            24
the anecdotal evidence on the delay of elections for villages with a history of non-compliance to

unpopular central government policies, we also control for the interaction of whether there were

exemptions to the One Child Policy and year fixed effects. These characteristics are measured in

the first year that data are available (1982).40 The interaction with year fixed effects controls for the

influence of these variables over time in a fully flexible manner, and to some extent, it also controls

for the influences of all of its correlates over time. Column (6) of Table 7 shows that the coefficient

with these additional controls is very similar to our main estimates.

    We also consider the possibility that several other village-level factors could potentially con-

found the effect of elections on our outcomes of interest. These factors include whether a village

is a suburb of a city (a dummy variable for being in a suburb interacted with year fixed effects),

whether the Tax and Fee Reform had been implemented (a dummy variable which takes the value

of one if the reform has been introduced), and the level of village social capital (a proxy for social

capital interacted with year fixed effects). To proxy for the latter we follow Tsai’s (2007) work in

using the presence of a lineage group (i.e., an ancestral hall, family tree), village temple, or a large

kinship group to proxy for social capital.41 To maximize the statistical precision of our estimates,

we use the principal component of these three measures as our social capital proxy. Column (7)

shows that the resulting coefficient is similar to the baseline.

    In column (8), we re-estimate the baseline on a sample restricted to villages that never experi-

enced an administrative merger with another village since 1982. This addresses the possibility that

our main results are somehow confounded because the probability of having experienced a merger

is correlated with the timing of the electoral reform, and whether a village experiences a merger is

correlated with some factor that can affect our outcomes of interest. The coefficient is also similar

to the baseline.

Additional Sensitivity Checks We conduct many additional sensitivity checks that are not pre-

sented here for brevity.42 For example, we check that our estimates are not driven by selection
  40 Note that if we measure these policies in 1986, we obtain similar results. These alternative estimates are available

upon request.
  41 To measure the size of the kinship groups, the VDS recorded names from the village roster.
  42 They are available upon request.




                                                          25
within counties by instrumenting for the introduction of elections at the village level with the in-

troduction at the county level or with the introduction at the province level. We also control for

public goods expenditures in 1986 (the first year that data are available) interacted with year fixed

effects to control for the fact that villages with different levels of public goods in the base year may

evolve differently over time; or the average annual increase in public goods expenditures between

1986 and 1988 for each village interacted with year fixed effects to control for the fact that villages

with different trends in public goods in the base years can evolve differently over time. All of these

robustness exercises produce estimates that are similar in magnitude to our baseline results.

      The results in this section show that the baseline results are very robust and unlikely to be

confounded by other factors. They support the interpretation of the estimates as capturing the causal

effects of the introduction of village elections.

5.6     Mechanisms

In this section, we provide evidence on the policy mechanisms and theoretical channels through

which the introduction of elections increased expenditure on public goods.

5.6.1      Local Taxes

In addition to the village-level data used in the main analysis, we were able to obtain household

level data for a subsample of villages of the NFS survey. This subsample comprises 160 villages in

eighteen provinces. The observable characteristics of these villages do not differ significantly from

the full sample.43 The disaggregated expenditure data report the fees and levies paid by households.

Thus, we can use these data to examine whether the increase in public goods expenditure from

villagers was accompanied by an increase in the amount of fees and levies paid by households.44

      On average, households in the subsample pay 198 RMB per year in local fees, which is approx-

imately two percent of total household income.45 At the top of Table 8, we present mean household
  43 See Online Appendix Table A.3 for a comparison of observables.
  44 Unfortunately, the data only report the sum of local fees paid to the village and county governments and do not
distinguish payments to the village government. Therefore, interpreting the following results requires the assumption that
elections did not change the taxes paid to county governments. To the best of our knowledge, this was the case. The
main reform affecting local fees was the Tax and Fee Reform. The VDS documents the introduction of this reform which
occurred towards the very end of our sample. Controlling for the introduction of this reform has no effect on our results.
   45 According to our data, this amounts to 64% of the fees that households pay to levels of government above the

county (excluding the value of grain taxes). The largest proportion of taxes that agricultural households pay to the central


                                                            26
payments of local fees as a percentage of total household income – i.e., the fee rate – according

to households’ positions in the income distribution. Below that, we present the effect of the in-

troduction of elections on the fee rate. The coefficients for post first election are all positive and

statistically significant at the 10% level or higher. They are similar in magnitude for households

in different quintiles of the village income distribution. The results indicate that the introduction

of elections increased the amount of local fee rates by approximately 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points.

This is almost one-fourth of the sample mean rate of two percentage points.

    These results support the idea that local tax revenues increase when villagers feel the govern-

ment is more accountable. At the same time there is no evidence of progressivity in local fees.

Together with the low levels of collection, the lack of progressivity suggests that while local taxes

can be used to fund local public goods, they are not an important tool for income redistribution.

5.6.2   Signature Rights

To support our interpretation that elected VCs increased public goods expenditures to appease vot-

ers, we document that VCs had power to make public goods investments and that this power was

not undermined when elections were introduced. To do this, we document the “signature rights” of

VC and PS on several relevant policies. Village policy decisions are recorded in writing, and each

decision is approved with the signature of one or more officials. The VDS copied the village records

to document whether public goods expenditures by the village government were approved by the

VC, PS or both. The means in Table 9 show that 19% require only the VC’s signature for making

public goods expenditures, 66% require both the VC and PS, and 15% require only the PS’s signa-

ture. When we estimate equation (1) with these variables as dependent variables, we find that the

introduction of elections increased the VC’s unilateral power. In column (1), we see that the proba-

bility that only the VC’s signature was required increased by 4.2 percentage points. The coefficient

is statistically significant at the 10% level. At the same time, columns (2)-(3) show that elections re-

duced the probability that both signatures were required, and also reduced the probability that only

the PS’s signature was required. However, these estimates are not significant at conventional lev-
government is in the form of grain, which the government buys at a below-market price set by it. The value of this tax
payment is not included in the NFS category of taxes to the central government.



                                                         27
els. These results suggest that the local Communist Party branch did not circumvent the reform by

taking power away from the VC. If anything, the introduction of elections seems to have increased

the VC’s capacity to decide on relevant policies such as public goods, which is consistent with the

notion that elections gave VCs a democratic mandate.46

5.6.3    The effect of Elections on Leader Characteristics

Anecdotal and qualitative evidence suggest that the timing of electoral reforms did not coincide

with changes in the village Communist Party branch. Such simultaneous change would confound

our interpretation of the results as the consequence of increased accountability of the newly elected

leader in the village. We can substantiate the anecdotal evidence by comparing the effect of the

introduction of elections on the characteristics of the VCs, who were affected by the electoral re-

form, to those of the PS, who continued to be appointed by the Communist Party after elections

were introduced. If there is no change in the Communist Party, then PS turnover and characteristics

should not change with the introduction of elections. Table 10 Panel B shows the estimates from

regressing PS turnover rate, age and years of educational attainment on the baseline explanatory

variables. Elections have no effect on any of these outcomes. In contrast, Panel A shows that elec-

tions increased turnover rate, reduced age, and increased the years of educational attainment of the

VC. The estimates are significant at the 5% level or higher.

    The comparison of the results for VCs and PSs support the view that reforms were circumscribed

to the VC and is consistent with the anecdotal literature which emphasizes that the introduction of

village elections was not accompanied by other changes at higher levels of government.

5.6.4    Political Agency Channels

In the literature on political agency, citizens use elections to control politicians through two mech-

anisms.47 First, elections can help voters address moral hazard problems by rewarding good per-

formance with re-election – i.e., elections serve as means to provide the correct incentives to office
   46 We also document the signature powers over the management of village enterprises, the right to reimburse expendi-

tures from public funds, and land reallocation. The data show that VCs had de facto power over village policies that are
relevant to the outcomes we examine later in the paper (income, land, etc.).
   47 This literature is large, starting with the seminal contribution of Barro (1973). For textbook treatments, see Besley

(2006), and Persson and Tabellini (2000) .



                                                           28
holders. Second, voters can use elections to select the politicians that are more competent or whose

preferences are better aligned with citizens’ preferences. In this section, we explore whether these

forces are relevant in our context.

    We first recall the results discussed in the previous subsection (Table 10 Panel A). The finding

that the introduction of elections changed the characteristics of the average VC supports the notion

that villagers used elections to select a different type of leader from the type that was appointed prior

to the introduction of elections. This is consistent with the presence of the selection mechanism that

is highlighted in the theoretical literature.

    To investigate the presence of an increase in incentives, we examine whether the introduction of

elections had any effect in villages where there was no leader turnover in the first election – i.e., we

estimate the interaction effect of the introduction of elections and whether there was turnover for

the first election. The impact of elections in villages where there was no turnover isolates the effect

of re-election incentives, since the presence of the same official before and after elections rules out

the possibility that changes in policy are due to villagers having selected a better official.

    Table 11 presents the results. We introduce the interaction of the introduction of elections with

a dummy variable that equals one for villages where there is VC turnover in the first election. In this

specification, the effect of elections on villages that experienced no turnover (64% of the villages

in our sample) is captured by the uninteracted post-first-election coefficient. To address the fact

that the weights across villages change depending on how we transform the dependent variable, we

show the results for total public goods expenditures, per household public goods expenditures, and

the logs of each of these measures.

    For all of the outcomes examined, the sign of the uninteracted post-first-election dummy vari-

able is positive, and is similar or larger in magnitude as the average effect shown in Table 4. This

implies that the re-election incentives contributed to the average effect of introducing elections on

raising public goods expenditure. The estimates are statistically significant at the 10% or higher

level for total expenditures and expenditure per capita in columns (1) and (2). However, these re-

sults become insignificant when we estimate the standard errors using the wild-bootstrap method.

We also note that the magnitude and precision are sensitive to functional form.


                                                   29
      Together with our earlier finding that elections changed the characteristics of village leaders,

the results are suggestive that both selection and incentive effects were present in our context. Note

that we cannot use the interaction effects presented in Table 11 panel B to quantify the relative

contribution of the incentive and selection mechanisms due to the fact that whether there was VC

turnover in the first election is endogenous. For example, elections could cause leader turnover

where villagers do not have particularly high demand for public goods.


6      Additional Results
In this section, we investigate whether the introduction of elections affected rent seeking and pro-

elite bias in village policies, which should in principle decline if elections increased accountability.

We note that the evidence for rent-seeking is suggestive since we do not directly measure corruption,

and instead infer it from proxies; and that the results on income will use both the full sample of

villages as well as a subsample for which we have household-level data. For these reasons, we

interpret the results in this section as suggestive and supplementary to the main results for public

goods. For brevity, we only present the baseline results in the paper. We subject the results in

this section to a similar set of robustness checks as the public goods estimates. Please see Online

Appendix Tables A.2 and A.6.

6.1     Land Use

In addition to public goods, local officials are also responsible for the use and allocation of collec-

tively owned means of production. The most important asset is arable land, all of which is publicly

owned in China. Most land is allocated to households for farming in long-term contracts.48 A

fraction of land, no more than fifteen percent according to national law, may be retained under the

direct control of the village government so that it can make small adjustments to household alloca-

tions without implementing a large-scale reallocation for the entire village. During the 1980s and

1990s, land retained by the village government was often leased to highly profitable village enter-
  48 Rural households cannot sell their land rights in China and, during the period of our study, were also prohibited from

renting out their land. In most cases rural households were also restricted from hiring laborers because households that
did not farm their own land would lose land rights. See Jacoby et al. (2002) for a related study about tenure security in
rural China.




                                                           30
prises. However, villagers typically dislike this practice, because they suspect it is a source of rents

for the village leadership and its cronies.49

      The village leadership and other village elites likely captured most of the rents from running

village enterprises (only the top half of villagers shared any profits from enterprises). Therefore,

the introduction of elections may be expected to reduce the amount of land leased to enterprises

because voters wish to reduce pro-elite bias in village policies.

      Data for the use of village land is reported by the NFS for all villages for the years 1987-

2005 (excluding 1992 and 1994). The villages in our sample use approximately 96% of arable

land (approximately 51% of total village land) for household farming. Approximately 75% of the

remaining arable land is leased out to “enterprises”, a term which we use for firms run by collectives

or villagers. Since elections can only reduce the amount of land leased out to firms if such land

existed prior to the first election, we restrict our analysis to villages that ever used any arable land

for non-household farming prior to the introduction of the first election. This reduces the sample to

108 villages from 28 provinces.

      The estimates are displayed in column (1) of Table 12, where we use the same specification

as in equation (1). It shows that the introduction of elections reduced the amount of land that is

leased out to enterprises by approximately 57.7 mu (3.85 hectares), where the sample average is

approximately 108.5 mu (7.23 hectares). The estimate is statistically significant at the 10% level.

6.2     Income

If the introduction of elections caused a reduction in the pro-elite bias of policies under the discretion

of the village leadership, then we should find that it also caused income losses for elite households.

To examine this possibility, we look at the effect of elections on household income across the village

income distribution.

      We have data on total household income for households on the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 90th

percentiles of the within-village-year income distribution for the full sample of villages for 1986-

2005 (excluding 1992 and 1994). All income measures are deflated using a province-specific rural
   49 Consistent with this view, in a cross-sectional study Brandt and Turner (2007) find that redistributing collective land

to the direct control of villagers is positively correlated with re-election probabilities.



                                                            31
CPI. In the top row of Table 12, we present the mean household income for each group to illustrate

the extent of income inequality in villages. In our sample, the richest households (90th percentile)

typically earn twice as much as the median households (50th percentile), which earn about twice

as much as the 10th percentile households. There is substantial inequality within villages. This

can be the result of cronyism if the richest households are benefitting from their connections to the

village leadership. At the same time, it could also be a consequence of some households being

entrepreneurial and successful and thereby experiencing more rapid income growth during the early

reform era than less productive households. These two causes of inequality are, of course, not

mutually exclusive.

    To examine the effect of the introduction of elections on income distribution, we estimate the

baseline equation (1) with the household income of each percentile of the village income distribution

as the dependent variable. The coefficients in columns (2)-(6) of Table 12 are progressively more

negative and larger in magnitude for richer households, which is consistent with the introduction of

elections reducing incomes by larger amounts for richer households.

    In column (7), we examine the ratio of the median household income to the 90th percentile

household. The estimates show that elections increased the income of the median household relative

to the 90th percentile household by 1.7 percentage points. The estimate is statistically significant at

the 5% level. Relative to the mean income ratio of 0.53, the increase is moderate in magnitude.

    These results suggest that upon the introduction of elections, the village leadership changed

economic policies in such a way that the former economic elites were less favored. The relative

drops of income only affect the richest households, which is consistent with the interpretation that

they are a result of policy changes designed to please the majority of villagers.

    The welfare implications of this reduction in inequality are unclear and partly depend on the

origins of pre-reform inequality. Moreover, since we do not observe a significant increase in income

at any level of the income distribution, we cannot rule out the possibility that the changes due to the

introduction of elections increased economic inefficiencies. For instance, it is very much possible

that village enterprises were creating surplus, but the lack of benefits for the majority of villagers

coupled with lack of commitment on how to share the surplus might have led villagers to prefer


                                                  32
direct access to land.

6.3     Policies for Redistribution

In this section, we provide additional evidence on the means through which village leaders reduced

elites’ incomes. For this analysis, recall that village governments cannot impose recurrent taxes

and that the lack of progressivity on local fees suggests that taxes are not the main instrument for

redistribution.

      First we document that household income mostly comes from agriculture (67%); wages (15%),

which are mostly earned from employment with village enterprises; and village enterprise profits

(7%).50 The village government controls household access to land, which is the main input for

agriculture, and as we discussed earlier, also controls the management of village enterprises. Thus,

the data show that about 90% of average household income can be influenced by the village gov-

ernment. If the VC desires to engage in limited redistribution, he can reallocate land, salaried jobs

or dividend income across households.

      In Table 13, we present the estimates for the effect of the introduction of elections on each

source of income. For brevity, we focus on the median-to-top income ratios. Column (1) presents

the result for total income, which is comparable with the result for the full sample in Table 12 and

statistically significant at the 5% level. Columns (2)-(4) show that the introduction of elections had

similarly sized effects on each source of income; the ratios for agricultural income, wage income

and enterprise (profit sharing) income all increase by around two percentage points. The estimates

for agricultural and enterprise income are significant at the 5% level.51

      The results on land and income provide suggestive evidence that the introduction of elections

curbed rent-seeking and reduced income inequality by reducing the income of the richest house-

holds of the villages. The change in income inequality is moderate in magnitude and achieved
  50 See Online Appendix Table A.4 for a balance sheet for average household income and expenditure. Village enter-
prises were officially called different names at different stages of the early reform era due to regulatory changes regarding
the ownership of former collective assets. Hence, our category of income from village enterprises is the sum of all of
these types of incomes reported in the NFS (e.g., income from collectives, partnerships or cooperatives, and enterprise
dividends). Income from collectives and enterprise dividends make up over 97% of this category.
  51 Note that we also examine household farmland. The estimates for the median-to-top ratios of household farmland

are positive but statistically insignificant. The lack of precision is likely to be partially due to our inability to measure
land quality. For example, a household may prefer to have a small piece of fertile land over a large piece of poor quality
land.


                                                            33
through the manipulation of income streams that the village government can influence through its

control over land allocation and village enterprises. These results are consistent with the fact that

the village government could not impose recurrent taxes, which means that elected leaders could

not easily commit to ex-post income redistribution. Since productive assets might have originally

been allocated to productive households, this mode of redistribution may be one of the reasons why

we do not find that local elections in China increased income. We discuss other possible reasons in

the conclusion.


7    Conclusion
In order to better control local officials and prevent shirking, the Chinese government introduced

village-level elections starting in the 1980s. These reforms were partial as the local branch of the

Communist Party was not affected. In this paper, we examine whether the introduction of elections

in such an autocratic context can be successful in changing incentives of local officials. We find

that elections prompted local officials to dramatically increase expenditures in public goods. This

increase was financed almost entirely by funds raised directly from households. This suggests that

elections were successful in making local officials more accountable to villagers and that the latter

became more willing to fund the local government in return for more public goods provision. In

addition, we find some evidence on land use and income distribution to suggest that elections might

have also curbed rent-seeking and reduced the pro-elite bias in village policies.

    To interpret our results, it is important to note that the quantitative magnitudes of the empirical

estimates are specific to the context of our study. For example, the large positive effect of elections

on public goods is likely to be partly due to the severe under-provision of public goods in rural

areas during the early reform era. Similarly, the moderate size of the effect of the introduction of

elections on income inequality is likely to be due to the fact that village governments cannot impose

recurrent taxes. It is reasonable to speculate that if village leaders had access to the standard policies

for redistributing income, we might find much larger reductions of inequality from elections.

    At the same time, our qualitative results provide generalizable insights. The finding that local

elections improve public goods is consistent with the idea that elections are powerful tools for con-



                                                   34
trolling local officials. Our finding that electoral control can dominate bureaucratic control even

in China is striking given that this is a context long known for its efficient and entrenched bureau-

cracy. It is perhaps not surprising that several autocratic countries have introduced similar reforms

in recent years.

     To the extent that this institutional reform can be understood as a marginal increase in democ-

racy in rural China, our results are consistent with recent democratization theories that characterize

democracies as regimes that are likely to engage in redistribution (e.g. Acemoglu and Robinson,

2006) and to provide more public goods (e.g., Bueno de Mesquita et al., 2003).

     This study and the data it provides open several interesting avenues for future research. First,

we note that autocratic central governments are interested in maintaining political control. This

suggests that a partial introduction of representative institutions such as village elections might be an

unstable institutional equilibrium. While elections can improve citizen satisfaction with the regime

by improving local governance, they can also help villagers coordinate to resist unpopular policies

designed by upper-levels of government. We explore this in a companion paper, Martinez-Bravo et

al. (2011). Another important question regards the heterogeneous effects of elections, which can

potentially provide insights into the pre-conditions for successful representative institutions. For

example, in subsequent research, Padró i Miquel et al. (2014), we investigate the roles of social

fragmentation and social capital in determining the effects of elections on public goods. Finally, it

is important to understand when local elections are a step towards wider regime change versus when

they are used as an instrument of control by the central regime.               52

  52 This is related to the recent work of Cantoni et al. (2014), which investigates whether a reform in Chinese high school

political curricula led to long-run changes in political attitudes.

Notes: Standardized coefficients are presented in column (1). Each row corresponds to a different
bivariate regression estimated in a cross section of villages. The dependent variable is the year of the
1st election while the regressor of interest is defined by each row. The regressors of interest are
measured in the base year (defined as the first year that data are available for each variable). All
variables are demeaned by province fixed effects. *, **, and *** indicates statistical significance at
the 10%, 5% and 1% levels, respectively.

    presented in square brackets. The sample is a panel of 189 villages for the years 1982-
    2005. There are fewer villages than the full sample (217) because of missing data for
    village leaders. The number of observations vary across columns due to missing values in
    the dependent variable.

ONLINE APPENDIX

A    Data Appendix
The variables for upper-government land expropriation and One Child Policy exemptions are from

the VDS. To ensure truthful reporting, we ask the respondents to check the years in which the village

experienced any permanent loss of village land due to upper-government expropriation, and to check

the years in which any household in the village had a second or higher parity birth. Respondents’

answers are based on village records and rosters. In a companion paper, we check that changes in

expropriation correspond to changes in total village land (reported in the NFS) and changes in One

Child Policy exemptions correspond to the number of children age 7-13 seven years later (reported

in the NFS). The questionnaire for the VDS is available online at

http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nq3/NANCYS_Yale_Website

    Notes: All regressions control for the introduction of open nominations, province trends, village and year fixed effects, and the additional controls stated in
    the column headings. Standard errors, clustered at the province level, are presented in parentheses. Wild bootstrap p-values are presented in square brackets.
    The number of clusters are stated at the bottom of the table. The samples are village-level panels. Panel A is restricted to villages that ever leased land to
    enterprises prior to the first election and includes the years 1986-2004. The dependent variable is the amount of land leased out in year t+1 (i.e., a lead
    variable). Panel B includes all villages and the years 1986-2005. Additional sample exclusions are stated in column headings. Data from 1992 and 1994 are
    interpolated. The panels are not fully balanced because of missing values in the dependent variabes.

    Notes: All regressions control for the introduction of open nominations, province trends, village and year fixed effects, and the additional controls stated in the
    column headings. Standard errors, clustered at the province level, are presented in parentheses. Wild bootstrap p-values are presented in square brackets. The
    number of clusters are stated at the bottom of the table. The samples are village-level panels and include 160 villages for the years 1986-2005. Data for 1992 and
    1994 are interpolated. Additional sample exclusions are stated in column headings. The panels are not fully balanced because of missing values in the dependent
    variabes.
