                                         ABSTRACT

We construct representative firm-level longitudinal data for twenty-seven European countries
using financial statements from the Orbis global database, providing a “how-to” guide on the
construction. We validate our dataset by comparing its aggregate coverage to official statistics
and present three new facts. First, smaller firms (SMEs) account for the largest share of economic
activity. Second, industry concentration has increased among firms that report only consolidated
statements, but decreased overall. Third, the increased concentration is accounted for by foreign-
owned firms. Documenting these facts requires nationally representative data both in cross-
sectional and time-series dimensions.

1         Introduction

Research in macroeconomics, finance, and international economics based on firm-level data is
increasingly popular. The Orbis global database, from Bureau van Dijk (BvD)—a Moody’s
Analytics company—is the largest cross-country firm-level database encompassing firms’
financial statements and their production activity. It includes public and private firms’
balance sheets and income statements. The database also includes detailed information on
firms’ domestic and foreign owners and subsidiaries, which allows researchers to observe
global interconnections between the firms through ownership. The Orbis database is used
in many research papers, but data samples downloaded from this database are often not
nationally representative. In the online appendix,1 we provide detailed instructions on how
to download and organize data from Orbis, based on our multi-year experience in working
with this data source. Using these guidelines, we put together a representative dataset for
the EU countries plus Norway and present three new facts about firm activity.

        We validate our dataset by aggregating our micro data by country and comparing sum-
mary statistics on firm size distribution and presence of foreign companies to aggregate
official statistics. While our data is available for all sectors, the official data is available for a
subset of sectors making a consistent comparison for the aggregate economy difficult. There-
fore, we evaluate the representativeness of our data using two levels of aggregation. First, in
the online appendix, we show that our aggregated data by firm size for the manufacturing
sector is representative when compared to the firm-size distribution reported for this sector
in the (official) Structural Business Statistics (SBS) database from the Eurostat. Second, we
show the size distribution for the total economy, where the total economy is defined based
on an aggregation of overlapping sectors in our data and in the SBS data. For this level of
aggregation, our “aggregated” data covers more than 70 percent of total economic activity
and has firm-size distributions that match the official data. Thus, we feel confident in using
our data for all the sectors of a given country to document the firm-size distribution and not
only for the sectors provided in the official statistics.

        Using our dataset, we document three new facts about firm activity. First, using all the
    1
    The online appendix was originally circulated under the title “How to Construct Nationally Represen-
tative Firm Level Data from the ORBIS Global Database,” an NBER Working Paper No: 21558.



                                                   2
sectors of a given economy and defining small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) as firms
with 20–250 employees (consistent with the Eurostat definition), we find that SMEs account
for more than half of aggregate employment and gross output in most countries. Second,
the degree of industry concentration—defined as market shares of the largest firms—has
increased only for the subset of firms that solely file consolidated firm statements. Industry
concentration has decreased when we use the universe of all firms to calculate these measures,
regardless of the account type. Third, the observed increase in industry concentration in
the subset of firms that only report consolidated statements is due to foreign-owned firms.
Although foreign firms do not account for a large fraction of aggregate output in these
countries (at most 30 percent overall),2 a small number of the largest foreign firms can drive
trends in industry concentration.

       These facts will be missed when non-representative firm-level datasets are used. Recent
research has found that industry concentration, defined as the market shares of the top 4
or top 8 firms in a given 2-digit industry, has increased in the United States (Crouzet and
Eberly (2018)), but declined in Europe (Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017)). Bajgar et al.
(2019) challenged the findings of Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017) and argue that industry
concentration in Europe has increased once the role of business groups is taken into account
by considering consolidated company statements. In fact, they did not find any declining
trend. We suspect this is because their dataset is not fully representative across time,
because we can show both an increasing trend and a decreasing trend, depending on which
firm-accounts are used in the calculations. And the fact that SMEs account for half of gross
output brings attention to the need for including this group of companies when considering
macro questions in economics and finance.

       The Orbis database is attractive for international micro (firm)-level research because of its
large universe and cross-country comparability. The data is sourced from over 160 different
government and commercial information providers (see Table A.6.1 in Appendix A.6 for
a list of the BvD information providers). BvD organizes the data in a standard “global”
   2
    The average 30 percent share is obtained when we consider all countries from our sample that are also
covered by the official OECD statistics on the multinational activity. But there is extensive variation across
countries. For example, in Luxembourg foreign companies account for more than 50 percent of aggregate
output, while the same ratio in Germany or Italy is around 20 percent with UK and Spain taking about the
average values.



                                                      3
format to facilitate company comparisons. The financial and balance sheet information in
Orbis comes from business registers, governed by country-specific legal and administrative
filing requirements, and coverage of small firms and financial variables varies from country to
country due to different filing requirements with national business registers.3 Although most
countries oblige limited liability companies to register once they are formed, requirements in
terms of lower bounds on firm-size for reporting and in terms of what balance sheet items
to report varies across countries.

       There is a common misconception that firm-level financial data from national statistical
offices always have better coverage than Orbis. For countries where the laws require every
firm to file to the national business register, this is not the case because BvD uses the same
sources as the statistical offices. For countries where the law requires only large firms to
file financial statements, it might be the case that national statistical offices run different
administrative surveys with better coverage of small firms.

       For most European countries, reporting to the national business registers is mandatory,
however, it might still be the case that researchers will not get full coverage from their
Orbis download for a given country if they use a single vintage of the database or a direct
download from the Orbis web platform.4 In order to have consistent coverage of small and
large firms over time and by industry, one has to follow the approach we advocate and use
the historical vintages, download data vintage-by-vintage, and match the firm data over
time using unique firm identifiers. If a single vintage is used, firms will be missing in a
longitudinal sense since Orbis drops non-reporting firms from the database after a certain
period of time. In addition, some variables such as “value-added” and “intermediate inputs”
may be missing from some downloads, such as those from the commonly used Wharton
Research Data Services (WDRS), which does not systematically cover all variables. The
   3
     Appendix A.6 gives details on filing requirements by country.
   4
     Many researchers have found that the Orbis web browser interface displays a large number of unique firm
identifiers, but the actual financial or real variables, when downloaded, turn out to be missing, especially
going back in time. There are several reasons for this. First, there is a reporting lag in the BvD products
of roughly two years, meaning that a firm’s filing in 2017 will appear fully on the media issued/accessed
in 2019. Second, depending on the BvD product, certain companies are erased from the database if there
is no reporting done for some time, even if the firm continues operating (but not reporting). Third, there
is a download cap imposed by BvD on web interfaces and often this cap causes missing data rather than
termination of the download job. Fourth, BvD collection efforts have improved over time. In addition to
these technical considerations, certain cleaning and checking procedures have to be implemented.



                                                     4
industry classification may also be misleading because these classifications change over time
as firms expand or change their operations. Single-vintage data will often over-represent
larger firms and under-represent smaller firms due to survivorship bias. Some researchers
opt for re-weighing the data, using weights from national censuses in order to increase the
representativeness of small firms.5 If our guidelines are followed, there might be less of a
need to re-weigh the data to obtain nationally representative firm-level datasets.6

        We describe the methodology for preparing micro data based on Orbis in two self-
contained appendices. In particular, Appendices A.1 to A.4 describe the organization of
Orbis and our advice on data download strategies. Appendix A.5 describes how to put to-
gether the financial data in panel form, while Appendix B.1 explains the methodology used
to put together foreign ownership data in panel form.

        We proceed as follows. Section 2 documents our new facts and Section 3 concludes.



2         New Facts

2.1        Fact 1: Small firms account for most of the aggregate eco-
           nomic activity

Table 1 shows how much of gross output, as reported by Eurostat, is covered by the firms
in our dataset.7 We measure output by firm operating revenue. Each cell is the ratio of
the value of total output produced by “our” firms relative to the value of total output from
the official data. BvD provides firm-level information on gross output for all sectors of
each European country starting 1999,8 however official data from Eurostat SBS provides
    5
      See, for example, Bajgar et al. (2019).
    6
      Based on our guidelines, BvD has recently developed a new product, labeled the “Historical Product,”
which links several vintages/disks of the Orbis data through firm identifiers to obtain firm-level longitudinal
datasets for many countries, as we have done “manually.” Although this new product avoids many of the
issues involved by combining numerous vintages/disks, it requires a certain methodology to process the
historical data. We provide the guide and programs to process this historical data at http://econweb.umd.
edu/∼kalemli/orbis.html.
    7
      Appendix C.1 provides details on the official aggregate datasets we use for comparison purposes.
    8
      Data go further back in time in Orbis but the coverage is not good as the regulations for filing changed
in 1999 requiring all firms to file with the registries if they are located in a EU country.



                                                      5
information on gross output (turnover) for only a subset of sectors.9 For each country-year
cell, we report the ratio of our aggregated gross output values to official values across those
sectors for which the gross-output related variable is available in both datasets. Some ratios
will be missing for some country-years due to missing Eurostat data.

       As shown in Table 1, with some exceptions, our data account for more than 50 percent
of the aggregate output in all countries and close to 80-90 percent in most countries. In
some countries, notably Germany, the filing requirements have changed recently and hence
in recent vintages coverage has improved.

       Table 2 presents the size distribution based on gross output and employment in the
aggregate economy.10 The patterns do not vary much by year, so we randomly choose to
display the results for 2006. The table shows the fraction of economic activity accounted for
by firms belonging to each size class with separate countries in the columns. In Panel A, we
aggregate our firm-level data to relevant size bins based on gross output and employment.
This panel shows that most of the gross output and employment are accounted for by SMEs,
using the typical official definition of SMEs as firms with 20–250 employees.

       To make sure that our comparisons are “apples-to-apples,” we create a “hypothetical
aggregate” economy based on aggregating the sectors where official data by size class is
provided by Eurostat. We report the results in Table 2, Panel B. As can be seen, our
firm-level data match the official size distribution for this limited set of sectors well.


2.2       Fact 2: Industry concentration trends depend on the repre-
          sentativeness of the sample

Our second fact regards industry concentration and it illustrates the importance of using
nationally representative firm-level data in establishing stylized facts. Based on datasets
that cover different sets of firms, different papers find different results for European countries’
industry concentration trends. For example, Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017) find declining
industry concentration, whereas Bajgar et al. (2019) find increasing concentration using the
   9
     These sectors are listed in Table C.2.3 of Appendix C.1.
  10
     Table D.1.5 of Appendix D.1 shows the validation exercise done for the manufacturing sector, for which
official data on firm-size distribution is available.

same set of countries. We believe the firm-level datasets they use have unequal coverage
leading to different results.

       To illustrate the importance of using a representative dataset, we measure industry con-
centration using different sets of firms. We use the standard indicator in the literature; that
is, the market shares of the largest 4 or 8 firms within two-digit industries, by country.11
Choosing different types of financial statements—called “accounts” in Orbis—will lead to
different firms entering into the calculation of the industry concentration.

       Usually, the company-headquarters (or the parent) of a group report consolidated fi-
nancial statements (the headquarter together with all separate legal entities belonging to
the group, such as the affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.) and unconsolidated statements for the
headquarter only. All affiliates and subsidiaries can also report separate unconsolidated
statements. Therefore, for a given company, we might observe consolidated, unconsolidated,
or even both types of statements (referred to as the “accounts”), identified by a “consolida-
tion code”.12 Orbis assigns the company location (country, region, city) by the location of
its headquarter. The overwhelming majority of companies in Orbis report unconsolidated
accounts. However, a small number of large and very-large companies report consolidated
accounts. For example, in 2006, in our sample there are 92,878 companies in the manu-
facturing sector in Spain with unconsolidated accounts, 274 companies with consolidated
accounts, and just 147 companies reporting both. These counts for Italy are 111,200, 803,
  11
      We follow NACE level 1 and level 2 classifications to aggregate 4-digit industries to 1- and 2-digit
industry level data. See Table A.6.2 for NACE Revision 2, Level 2 Classification. Orbis assigns the company
to a unique “primary” industry by the largest portion of its revenue; some companies might have multiple
“secondary” codes (describing their additional activities). We use the primary code as the “sector” of a given
company.
   12
      The codes are C2, for the consolidated account of a company-headquarter of a group together with all
companies belonging to the group, where the company headquarter also reports the companion unconsol-
idated account (the headquarter only); C1, for the consolidated account of a group, where the company-
headquarter does not report the unconsolidated account; U2 for the unconsolidated account of a company
with the companion consolidated account; and U1 for the unconsolidated account of a company with no
consolidated account. In addition, Orbis contains companies with the accounts of type LF with limited
financial information (number of employees, turnover, shareholders’ funds (book equity), capital, or some of
these items), and NF with no financial items at all. By construction, the number of C2 accounts equals the
number of U2 accounts. In addition, there are entities with “no recent accounts” (NRF) or “no recent limited
financials” (NRLF), where “no recent” refers to last 3 years. By default, the Orbis media gives preference
to the consolidated accounts, which can be changed via the Search settings. See Figure D.3.1 of Appendix
D.3 for an example of how Orbis registers the multiple accounts of different types of Koç Holding Inc., the
largest business group in Turkey.

and 346; for Poland, 13,300, 163, and 131.

    Before constructing industry concentration measures, we categorize firms into two sam-
ples based on account type, available in Orbis. “Sample 1 ” comprises firms reporting only
one type of account (unconsolidated (U) or consolidated (C)) in a given financial year, and
“Sample 2 ” comprises firms reporting both unconsolidated and consolidated accounts in a
given financial year.

    We define three measures of industry concentration, using the operating revenue market
shares of the top 4 (hereafter, MS4) or top 8 (hereafter, MS8) firms in a given 2–digit industry
s2, country k, and year t relative to the population of all firms in the s2, k, t cell. For all
measures, the population of all firms used in the denominator of market shares is exactly
the same and includes the output reported by all firms from sample 1 and sample 2 after
consolidated accounts from sample 2 are excluded to avoid double counting.

    Our market shares MS4 and MS8 would differ only by the numerator, depending on
the firms selected and the account types. In the following notation, the first argument in
parenthesis defines the account type we use (U or C) and the second argument denotes the
sample of firms we aggregate from (sample 1 or sample 2 ), and we omit the subscript s2, k, t
for brevity:

   • MS4(U,1+2) is based on all unconsolidated accounts (U ), combining firms from sam-
      ple 1 and sample 2.13 The goal is to compute the most inclusive measure based on
      unconsolidated statements.

   • MS4(C,1) or MS4(C,1+2) is based on consolidated accounts (C), but using two alter-
      native definitions: i) using firms from sample 1 that report only consolidated accounts
      and ii) using all consolidated accounts reported by firms from sample 1 and sample 2.14
   13
      There is no double counting P  of firms because only unconsolidated accounts are used from sample 2.
Numerically, the MS4(U,1+2) =              yi/Y where firm set F includes top 4 firms reporting unconsolidated
                                       i∈F
accounts from sample 1 and sample 2 in a given s2, k, t cell, yi is firm-level revenue, and Y is aggregated
revenue of all firms in s2, k, t from sample 1 and sample 2 after consolidated accounts from sample 2 are
excluded. Market share of the top 8 firms is computed similarly.
   14
      Compared to the measure MS4(U,1+2), in MS4(C,1) the firm set F includes top 4 firms reporting
consolidated accounts from sample 1 in a given s2, k, t cell; and in MS4(C,1+2) the firm set F includes top 4
firms reporting consolidated accounts from sample 1 and sample 2 in a given s2, k, t cell. In the latter case,
there is no double counting of firms because only consolidated accounts are used from sample 2.



                                                     10
   • MS4(U,2) and MS4(C,2) always use the accounts from sample 2 and differ only by
         account type.15 With this measure, we compare the patterns between the account
         types in a sample covering exactly the same companies.

       Notice that by computing the concentration shares by country, we treat each economy
as a separate market. To present the overall trends in market concentration in Europe, we
aggregate our sector-country-year shares by computing the weighted averages applying the
GDP weights of the countries in the total sample.

       Figure 1 shows how the pattern of concentration in Europe changes depending on the
sample of companies and type of statements.16 In Panel A, we focus on unconsolidated
statements and plot market shares MS4(U,1+2) and MS8(U,1+2) of the top 4 and top 8
firms in the largest possible sample of companies reporting unconsolidated accounts, which
come from the combined sample 1 and sample 2. In Panel B, the green line presents the
pattern when we still use the unconsolidated accounts, but from a narrower sample 2 and
for the top 8 companies (the measure MS8(U,2)). Thus, the green lines in both panels differ
only in firm sample. It is clear that market concentration declines in Europe during this
period in both the manufacturing and services sectors.

       We recognize that a parent company and its subsidiaries might belong to several indus-
tries and countries and this distinction might be important for conclusions about industry
concentration, precisely because the largest firms in an industry are typically the parents
  15
     Compared with the measure MS4(U,1+2), the firm set F includes the top 4 firms from sample 2 in
a given s2, k, t cell, using their unconsolidated accounts in MS4(U,2) and their consolidated accounts in
MS4(C,2). There is no double counting of firms because the underlying measure is constructed separately
for a given account type.

     Our sample covers Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain,
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain,
and Sweden. We do not include Denmark, Ireland, Netherlands, and Lithuania for which our dataset
accounts for less than 50 percent of the aggregate. Bulgaria and Croatia are excluded as outliers. The
services industry covers all non-financial market services including “accommodation and food services,”
“information and communication,” “real estate activities,” “professional, scientific and technical activities,”
and “administrative and support services activities.” Our sample is, thus, an extended version of the sample
analyzed in Dottling et al. (2017), Gutiérrez and Philippon (2017), and Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018).
They use the BvD merged vintage dataset we provided, focusing on a benchmark “EU KLEMS” sample,
which consists of Austria, Belgium, Germany, Spain, Finland, France, Italy, and the Netherlands, and for
some comparisons Great Britain and Sweden. In addition, they exclude small firms and the following sectors:
utilities (KLEMS segments D35 to D39), financial firms (segments D64 to D66) and real estate (segment
D68), also segments D84 (public administration and defence; compulsory social security) and D99 (activities
of extraterritorial organizations and bodies).

Notes: The figure plots market concentration in the manufacturing industry and the services industry
for European countries. The services industry is defined as “non-financial market services,” including “ac-
commodation and food services,” “information and communication,” “real estate activities,” “professional,
scientific and technical activities,” and “administrative and support services activities.” We measure country-
sector-year market concentration by the market share of largest four or eight firms in terms of firm-level
operating revenue from our Orbis dataset in the given country-sector-year, relative to the overall country-
sector-year output. In all graphs, we plot “EU-weighted” average shares over the period 1999–2012, using a

acquisitions when acquisition of a large stand-alone company increases a given company’s
consolidated balance sheet dramatically, then the type of account is used in calculating
concentration might be important. Thus, in Figure 2 we plot the evolution of market con-

shares MS4(C,1+2) and MS8(C,1+2) of the top 4 and top 8 firms reporting consolidated
accounts from the largest pool of firms possible. These top firms are defined as having the
largest revenue among all consolidated accounts that come from the combined sample 1 and
sample 2. Regardless of statement type, we find declining concentration as in Gutiérrez and
Philippon (2017) and Gutiérrez and Philippon (2018). In Panel B, we plot market shares


                                                                                                        13
MS4(C,1) (the green line) and MS8(C,1) (the orange line) of the top 4 and top 8 firms that
report only consolidated accounts, selected from sample 1. In this panel, we find an increas-
ing trend for concentration, especially for manufacturing sector, replicating the results of
Bajgar et al. (2019).

       All our measures of concentration might be impacted by the fact that we do not cover
the universe of firms in any country, although we are close with most countries’ coverage
being around 70 percent. Nevertheless, in online Appendix D.4, we demonstrate that defining
market shares of the top firms vis-a-vis the entire economy does not change our results. To do
this, we use the industry-level aggregates reported in the OECD STructural ANalysis (OECD
STAN) database (available at http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=STAN08BIS)
as the denominators of our market shares.


2.3       Fact 3: Increasing industry concentration in Europe is due to
          the presence of foreign firms

In order to dig deeper and understand what drives the increasing concentration in Panel B
of Figure 2, especially for the manufacturing sector, in this section we separate foreign
and domestic top firms. The literature has shown that foreign companies/multinationals
are large and operate through a network of subsidiaries and affiliates in several countries
(e.g., Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2014)). We split the top 8 firms in each country-sector-year into
domestic firms and foreign firms and redefine concentration measure MS8(C,1) accordingly.17

       Figure 3 reports these concentration measures for top 8 firms, using firms who report
only consolidated accounts, drawn from sample 1. Unlike Figures 1 and 2, Figure 3 displays
the market shares as an index, relative to the value in 1999. It is clear that the patterns
of increasing concentration observed in Figure 2 are driven by foreign firms and the pattern
is starker for the manufacturing sector than for the services sector. These patterns are
  17
    That is, for example, in a given country-sector-year, among the largest 8 firms, if 2 firms are domestic
and 6 firms are foreign, the summation of the revenue in the numerator of MS8(C,1) is done for 2 domestic
firms, and 6 foreign firms, respectively. For any other combinations of foreign-domestic split, MS8(C,1) is
computed similarly. Therefore, the vertical summation of the resulting shares equals the values represented

Notes: The figure plots market concentration measures for the manufacturing industry and the services
industry. The services industry is defined as “non-financial market services,” including “accommodation
and food services,” “information and communication,” “real estate activities,” “professional, scientific and
technical activities,” and “administrative and support services activities.” We measure country-sector-year
market concentration by the market share of largest eight foreign (domestic) firms in terms of firm-level
operating revenue from our Orbis dataset in the given country-sector-year, relative to the overall country-
sector-year output. The output of the largest firms is determined from the subset of companies reporting
only consolidated financial statements, drawn from sample 1. In all graphs, we plot “EU-weighted” average
shares over the period 1999–2012, using a given country’s GDP weight in total sample, in the corresponding
year.



not biased by unrepresentative sets of foreign firms because our data is fully representative
also in terms of foreign firms. To validate our data along this dimension, we aggregate
the activity of the foreign firms in our panel to the country-year level and compare these
aggregated ownership numbers to the OECD data on the activities of foreign affiliates of
multinationals from the Activity of Multinational Enterprises (AMNE) and the Activities
of Foreign Affiliates (AFA) databases.18 Figure B.3.1 of Appendix B.3 graphically presents
  18
     AMNE (available on the OECD data portal https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AMNE
IN) covers 28 OECD host countries from 2008 onwards, although the coverage varies by country and over
time. We base our comparison on the manufacturing sector because the earlier OECD data, reported in the
AFA database, consistently covers manufacturing only (see http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=
AFA IN3). The OECD Foreign Affiliates Statistics (FATS) database gives detailed data on the activities of
foreign affiliates in the services sector, although, for a smaller sample of 25 OECD countries. OECD obtains
their data from the Eurostat that conducts annual surveys on the activities of foreign-controlled enterprises

this comparison. The figure demonstrates that our data capture very well the share of
multinational activity in total activity reported by the official statistics.19



3     Conclusion

We construct nationally representative firm-level longitudinal datasets for twenty-seven Eu-
ropean countries using firms’ financial accounts from the Orbis global database and provide
a road map as a “how-to” guide. We validate the data by comparing aggregates from our
constructed data to corresponding official aggregate data. We provide three new stylized
facts using our data. First, small and medium size firms (SMEs) account for more than
half of the aggregate economic activity in most countries. Second, the degree of industry
concentration—defined as the market shares of the largest firms—can be shown to have an
increasing and a decreasing trend depending on the type of financial accounts used to cal-
culate the concentration measures. An increasing trend is observed for a selected sample of
firms who report only consolidated accounts. Third, the increase in industry concentration
observed for consolidated accounts is due to foreign-owned firms. Although foreign-owned
firms do not account more than 30 percent of aggregate output, they are important drivers
of industry concentration trends.




and foreign affiliates abroad controlled by residents of the compiling country. Surveys are conducted, in
most cases, by the national statistical office or the central bank of each country. While the key variables in
the survey are common across countries, the target sample varies across countries. See Appendix B.2, for a
description of the issues considered to maximize comparability across samples.
  19
     Appendix B.3 provides these statistics country by country and other details of our validation exercise.
Our advice on how to download and clean the foreign firms data is described in detail in Appendix B.1.

A       Construction of the Dataset

A.1     Organization of Orbis and Amadeus Databases

This appendix explains the practical aspects of constructing the panel data of financial and
ownership information that is usable for research purposes based on Orbis and Amadeus
datasets provided by BvD Electronic Publishing. In the following pages, we describe what we
regard as the “best practice” for obtaining the most comprehensive financial- and ownership
datasets over time.


A.1.1    Accessing BvD Products

BvD’s two best known products for firm-level data are the global database Orbis and the
European database Amadeus. There are other products which are either country specific or
region specific (for example for the UK and for the Asia-Pacific region). All these products
cover listed and unlisted firms. Amadeus was the original flagship product of BvD with
many its features incorporated later on into Orbis database. In what follows, we will write
about Orbis and stress the unique features of Amadeus separately.

    A researcher can access Orbis and European Amadeus databases in three ways.

  1. BvD proprietary browser online (orbis.bvdinfo.com and amadeus.bvdinfo.com).

  2. BvD historic (CD/DVD-ROM, Blu-Ray) disks or a new related solution Orbis Histor-
      ical with the linked historical data (www.bvdinfo.com/en-us/bvd-for-your-business/
      academic described under “I need to research historical datasets and changes over
      time” QnA item). At the moment of writing of this paper, the Orbis Historical solu-
      tion is still in the developing stage. Therefore, we focus on the steps required to work
      with the separate historic disks.

  3. Through the Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) from the Wharton School at
      the University of Pennsylvania (Amadeus only).

    Each of the access methods has its benefits and costs for a researcher; the decision about


                                              19
which one is the most optimal depends on the research budget and the type of the data one
expects to work with.

       We refer to the information available from BvD disks as “vintages” of the BvD data. We
use the same term when we talk about the data retrieved from an online access to BvD or
WRDS at a given point of time. In each case, “vintage” will mean the release date of the
disk or the time of online access, respectively.

       Each product is split by the type of information provided. For example, Orbis contains
the “sections” Orbis Financials with firm financial information and Orbis Ownership with
ownership information. There are other sections in Orbis with valuable information such as
Auditors and Advisors, Board Members, Patents, etc.

       The users who obtain Amadeus through WRDS (Method 3) should be aware that the
internal organization of the whole database (Amadeus Financials and Amadeus Ownership)
consists of three non-overlapping files corresponding to three company size “tiers.” The tiers
are defined by BvD in terms of the size of company sales, operating revenue, and employment.
The thresholds of these variables for the companies to be classified by BvD as Very Large
& Large, Medium, or Small vary by country (e.g., companies in Eastern Europe may have
lower sales in order to be categorized as Very Large & Large). This matters when querying
and downloading the data with the SAS software available under the WRDS subscription.


A.1.2       Financial Module

The Orbis Financials sub-database includes detailed information about numerous balance
sheet items, profit and loss account items, and financial ratios over time as well as static
descriptive variables. The descriptive information includes, among other items, official na-
tional identification number, address (country, region, city, street), legal form, year of incor-
poration (entry), status of the company (active/liquidation/merger-acquisition), number of
employees, quoted/unquoted indicator, industry and activity codes (4 digit level) and, when
available, the description of the nature of the business in the local language and English.20
  20
    The default option is to download textual information, such as company names, in the original format.
We encountered problems with the encoding of non-Latin alphabets and non-standard national letters. The
user should choose the available option to show the textual information in the international alphabet rather
than the original alphabet before download.


                                                    20
       Historic (time-series) financial information can be downloaded from the web or from a
single disk by selecting several historical years, although there are several issues to be aware
of:

      • Download speed and cap issue. BvD platforms or disks are not designed for the purposes
         of academic research involving large amounts of data. Extracting large amounts of
         data from any BvD platform is in general slow and BvD puts a cap on the amount
         of information researchers can download both from disks and also from its own web-
         site. Most of the time this cap does not turn into a termination of the download job,
         but rather the downloaded files will have missing information. WRDS is the most
         user-friendly platform because the imbedded WRDS browser allows researchers to run
         optimized queries and compresses the data at the time of download; WRDS also allows
         the researcher to retrieve the data by running a SAS for UNIX code directly at their
         servers. However, WRDS covers only Amadeus, and Orbis and Amadeus do not overlap
         100 percent in terms of companies and variables even for a given European country
         (any country outside Europe will not be in Amadeus).21

      • Survivorship bias. Both Orbis and Amadeus contain historic financial data for a num-
         ber of years. However, the two databases follow somewhat different rules regarding the
         inclusion of companies and years. Amadeus provides at most the ten most recent re-
         porting years for the same company while Orbis de facto reports data for the five most
         recent reporting years at most. Amadeus will delete a company from the database if
         the company did not report anything in the last 5 years, while Orbis will keep this
         company as long as the company is active in the business register.

      • There is a reporting lag of about 2 years, on average, and there are differences in the
         coverage of particular variables depending on when the BvD product has been released.
         Hence, for the 2010 vintage, a company may not have the 2010 filings but the 2010
         filings will appear in the 2012 vintage. BvD’s data collection improves over time and
         hence this lag might vary by country and by data vintage.
  21
    For the same company in a given year, it is possible to have more non-missing variables in Orbis than
in Amadeus. It is also possible to obtain more firms for the same country and year in Orbis than Amadeus.
We have confirmed that both cases are widespread.



                                                   21
   • Issues with the presentation format. Certain variables, such as employment, will not
       be on the balance sheet, but rather in memorandum items.

   • Merging issues. BvD identifies each company by a unique company ID, which is de-
       signed to trace the same company across all BvD products. However, a researcher
       merging the time-series financial information coming from several BvD historic disks,
       or the online downloads done at various points of time, may encounter occasional BvD
       ID changes over time. The BvD ID number incorporates either the national ID num-
       ber or the ID provided by their information providers (IP). According to BvD, the ID
       numbers may change when the national ID numbers change in the official data sources
       or the BvD IPs decide to switch their ID numbers. The ID changes are related to
       changes of address, legal form, or M&A activity. In acquisitions, acquiring company
       will keep its ID and the target’s ID is blocked. BvD mentions that Spanish companies
       encounter a BvD ID change if they change legal form, while companies incorporated
       in Germany, Austria, or Italy in some cases see their BvD ID change if the company
       changes address.22 Finally, BvD itself can initiate the ID change when an entity is
       available on more than one product, or is provided by more than one IP, and BvD
       harmonizes the IDs across databases using a set of priority rules. As long as BvD does
       not know that a certain company is the same entity, it will have several different BvD
       ID numbers on Orbis . Because it is hard to keep track of all these idiosyncracies,
       the researcher should request the “correspondence table” of BvD IDs from their BvD
       representative. BvD ID changes can also be obtained by subscribing institutions via
       the dedicated BvD ID Change Lookup tool at idchanges.bvdinfo.com.


A.1.3     Ownership Module


Orbis Ownership sub-database contains information on each company’s equity ownership
structure: the names of owners, their respective ownership shares, the level of ownership
(direct or ultimate cross-ownership), their countries of origin. For each owner of every target
  22
    If a company moves from area 1 to area 2 and area 2 has a different office collecting the information,
the company will get a new national ID, thus the BvD ID number changes. If in area 2, the same office is
responsible for collecting information, the company keeps its national ID.



                                                   22
firm there is one observation (we refer to such a record as an “ownership link”). There are
two major issues of concern for the construction of time-series ownership information.

  • The vintage issue for ownership. BvD proprietary browser online and WRDS contain
      only the latest available ownership information. If one were to access ownership infor-
      mation through the browser, through a specific vintage disk of Amadeus or Orbis or
      through WRDS, ownership information will be static (“as of date”). The only option
      to reconstruct the historic (time-series) ownership information is by purchasing the
      historic Orbis disks from BvD. It is possible to retrieve the historic ownership infor-
      mation through the BvD browser access (Method 1) or historic disks (Method 2) for
      individual companies by revealing the company’s Standard report and then selecting
      “the Shareholders history - current, previous and archived data” option in the Owner-
      ship data menu. But this method is not practical if one is interested in large datasets.
      In addition, the extent of the survivorship bias through this method is not clear to us.

  • Merging issues. The same issue related to BvD ID changes emerges if one downloads
      ownership data from several vintages of Orbis. The issue is more acute because one
      needs to rely on annual vintages to track annual ownership changes.

      There is a separate BvD product that tracks all mergers and acquisitions, that is
      changes in ownership, at the transaction level over time (Zephyr). In principle, one
      can supplement the ownership stakes from Orbis Ownership with the transaction data
      from Zephyr, by adjusting the equity stakes reported in Orbis Ownership prior to
      transaction. The data we present in this paper incorporates such an adjustment.

   Next, we propose a detailed approach to constructing the most comprehensive financial
and ownership information for a representative set of firms over time.


A.2     Downloading from Orbis and Amadeus Databases

While Amadeus and Orbis have an impressive number of unique firm IDs, as many researchers
have discovered, a large number of those IDs contain only information on company name and
a few other variables. When a researcher requests some key variables, such as total assets,


                                             23
sales or employment, these turn out to be missing. As we detailed out above there are several
reasons for this. It is necessary to download data in a non-standard way to overcome these
problems. As we have explained in the previous chapter, there are three different ways to
access BvD data:

   1. Through BvD’s proprietary web platform available by the direct subscription.

   2. Through BvD’s historical vintages, available on historic CD-ROM disks (or harddrives/blue-
         ray disks).

   3. Through WRDS archives.

       The standard and the most commonly used method is Method 3. To avoid the pitfalls
mentioned above one must follow Method 2, however. Let us explain the advantages of
Method 2 over other methods and how one can maximize the coverage and representation
of small firms while recovering many financial variables by using Method 2.

       To maximize coverage (for European countries), a researcher must use both Orbis and
Amadeus and several vintages from both databases.23 The reason is that these databases
follow different rules regarding the inclusion of companies and years.24 Amadeus provides at
most 10 recent years of data for the same company while Orbis, de facto, only reports data
for up to 5 recent years, despite the possibility of choosing 10 years of data going back in
the Orbis software. The justification given to us by BvD was that the global Orbis database
contained much more information and the information included in a given vintage had to be
limited because of the media capacity. Moreover, Amadeus drops firms from the database if
they did not report anything during the last 5 years while Orbis keeps the information for
these companies as long as companies are still in the business register. This problem makes
it clear why Method 2 is superior to other methods. A company might file information with
BvD for the last time in year 2007. However, in the business registry, this company is still
active. Due to non-reporting in the last 5 years, in Amadeus-2013 vintage this company will
  23
     For countries outside Europe, the only option is Orbis. Our instructions below related to Orbis will
apply to other countries, such as the United States, in terms of maximizing coverage and representation.
  24
     One also needs to keep in mind that Amadeus, being a regional database, includes some Europe-specific
variables that the Orbis Global Standard Format may not contain. Plus some variables may be coded slightly
differently in the two databases; for example, the type of owner is textual in Amadeus while in Orbis this
variable contains standardized single-letter codes.

                                                   24
not be included, but the same company’s information for the period 2002–2007 will still be
reported in Orbis-2013 disk. In addition, because there is a reporting lag of financial data of
usually 2 years (it varies by country), the coverage of, for example, years 2007 and 2008 from
the 2009 Orbis disk (or an online download done in the year 2009) will be very poor. For this
purpose, again Method 2 will be better because recent database vintages will complement
earlier ones and, hence, one can get more firms for the years 2007 and 2008 from the 2010
vintage (or the 2010 WRDS download). It is also the case that information is updated over
time and some variables that were not available in early disks is made available in later
vintages.

   There are differences in coverage of certain variables across Orbis and Amadeus going
back in time. The reason for this might be a combination of the issues mentioned above, or
the fact that all the access methods will cap the amount of information one can download in
one run (the number of firms and the number of variables). This cap unfortunately translates
into missing observations in the resulting download instead of termination of the download
job. This issue can also be dealt with, if we use Method 2. To illustrate the problem,
consider a researcher who in April 2015 wants to obtain data on Spanish firms for the year
2006. The researcher goes to WRDS (Method 3) and downloads the data by choosing the
year 2006. Table A.1.1 presents the distribution by size category in 2006 of firms in Spain in
our data constructed based on the methodology we prescribe in this paper (RAW) and the
same size distribution based on the data downloaded from WRDS on April 2015 for the year
2006 for Spanish companies. Panel A uses employment to measure firm size distribution,
whereas Panel B uses wage bill. In Panel A, in column (1) we see that firms with less than 20
employees account for 25 percent of total employment, whereas firms who have between 20–
249 employees account for almost 50 percent and firms who have more than 250 employees
account for 26 percent of employment. Panel B delivers a similar size distribution. The
point we want to make is that if we use our data as shown in column (1), put together from
several vintages using Method 2 for download, or we use direct download from WRDS for
the year 2006, where we access WRDS on April 2015 as shown in column (2), we obtain a
similar size distribution.

   What is the problem then, if our data and a single shot download from WRDS delivers
the same data? The problem starts when the researcher wants to have full information on a

                                              25
certain set of variables. For example, if we want to calculate total factor productivity, then
we need to have the variables output, employment, capital stock and materials reported and,
hence, we need to go down to a subset of firms that report all these variables. When we do
that column (3), which is our data, performs very well and delivers a similar size distribution.
However, column (4), which is the direct download from WRDS as of April 2015, performs
clearly worse because there are practically no small firms reporting information on materials.
This is an artifact of the one-time download from WRDS. As we show in Table 2, the size
distribution based on our data for several countries (including the ones shown in Table A.1.1)
matches the official size distribution provided by Eurostat based on national censuses.

    In order to maximize the coverage of firms and variables by country over time, our
download strategy (Method 2) for financials makes use of several vintages of BvD products:
Orbis disk 2005, Orbis disk 2009, Orbis disk 2013, Amadeus online 2010 (from WRDS;
accessed in May), and Amadeus disk 2014. We chose these vintages to ensure a time overlap
to get around the reporting rules in Amadeus and Orbis.

    For ownership our download strategy is more involved because, as we explained, any

                                                    26
of the three access methods—browser access (Method 1 or 3), or the current vintage at
hand (Method 2)—would give access to the ownership information “as of date.” We use the
Method 2 download strategy, but construct the historic (time-series) ownership information
by purchasing the historic Orbis disks from BvD for every year. Because we prefer to record
the ownership information as of the end of each calendar year, we choose the Orbis disk
issued as closely as possible to the end of the desired year. For example, to obtain the
ownership as of end of 2010, we use the Orbis disk issued in January 2011, and so on (disks
are issued monthly but firms report yearly, though ownership can change within a year).
To take full advantage of slight differences in ownership data in Amadeus and Orbis , we
combine bi-annual vintages of Amadeus Ownership with annual vintages of Orbis Ownership.
These differences will be discussed in Section B.1.


A.3     Financial Reporting in BvD Databases

A.3.1    Time Stamp

Before downloading, one has to choose how to time stamp the year of financial data. One
option is the conventional “absolute years,” where the year of the financial accounts explicitly
refers to calendar years, 2006, 2007, and so on. An alternative is the so called “relative years,”
where the most recent year of non-missing financials (as available to the BvD) is referenced
as the “Latest Year” and the earlier observations are referenced as the Latest Year –1, Latest
Year –2, and so on.

   We advise to download financials via the “relative years” option. While it a priori seems
counter intuitive, the relative year option is superior to the absolute year option, because
of the reporting lag and the survivorship bias-issues detailed above. The distinction in the
date option is extremely important for the companies which report irregularly, with gaps
in their time series. For such companies, 5 relative years might cover a longer calendar
period than 5 years requested explicitly (recall that Orbis de facto reports only the most
recent 5 years of a given company, with a reporting lag of 1–2 years). For example, consider
a company reporting data for year 2007, and then again for each year between 2009 and
2012. Then, asking for the 5 latest absolute years 2008–2012 would leave us with just 4


                                               27
observations (2009–2012), while asking for 5 relative years would retain the 2007 value (the
2007 is referenced as “Latest Year –4” in this case). To obtain the correct assignment of
the relative years in terms of calendar years, we use the special BvD index variable (Closing
date, Latest Year; Closing date, Year –1 and so on).


A.3.2   Consolidation of Subsidiaries

For a given company, the BvD databases report one or more financial statements, whose
type is specified by the “Consolidation Code.” Most of the large companies with good cov-
erage report either consolidated accounts (the statement of a parent company integrating
the statements of its controlled subsidiaries) or unconsolidated accounts (the statement not
integrating the statements of the controlled entities). Some companies report both kinds of
accounts. Finally, there are entities with limited financial data, no recent financials (where
the last available accounts are more than 48 months old), and the combination of the two. In
most of these cases, only the number of employees and the operating revenue are available.
The type of account reported is related to country filing requirements for particular size or
legal type of companies, as detailed in Table A.6.1 (e.g., the non-independent branches (es-
tablishments) are often included in Orbis for the United States). To speed-up the process, we
download the data separately for non-limited financial accounts (which includes most com-
panies) and limited financials accounts. We download both consolidated and unconsolidated
accounts and, so far, use unconsolidated accounts in all of our applications. Any user can
choose which account to use by looking at the “U” or “C” letters at the end of the firm ID
(or by using the BvD consolidation code) for unconsolidated and consolidated statements,
respectively. Consolidated accounts will involve double counting when both consolidated
account of the parent (with all its subsidiaries) and the unconsolidated account of the parent
(without subsidiaries) are reported.


A.3.3   Units and Currency of Financials

Balance sheet financial variables are book values. Care should be exercised when choosing
how the financial data will be downloaded both in terms of the monetary units and currency.
By default, the formatted export from BvD disks will be in the units and currency in which

                                             28
a particular company originally filed its financials. This means that a given company may
report in thousands in some years and in millions in other years. To avoid spurious jumps in
the data, the best practice is to choose the units (units, thousands, millions) in the Formatted
Export Wizard explicitly, rather that use the default. In case the default was chosen, the
variable UNITS lists the units a given observation is recorded in (the values are textual in
Orbis and numeric powers of 10 in Amadeus ). In the latter case, the harmonization is
achieved by the transformation x = x ∗ 10UNITS . But note that the UNITS variable might
have errors in certain disks, as we have discovered and, therefore, the best practice is to force
the download to be in specific units (such as thousands) and not use the default.25

       We choose the data in the original currency filed by the company, which might be the
national currency of the country or sometimes a foreign currency. The currency of the given
account is available in the variable “Account published in currency.” It is tempting to use the
available BvD variable “Exchange Rate” in order to convert the data from all companies into
a single currency. We advise against using this variable, because different products use it for
different purposes. In the Orbis or Amadeus disks, once we choose to download the data in
“local currency” the values of the variable “Exchange Rate” are always set to 1. However, in
the Amadeus downloads from WRDS, this variable contains the actual exchange rate of the
currency of account against the U.S. dollar. Hence, in general, the variable “Exchange Rate”
does not contain the rate versus, say, the U.S. dollar (as was the case with WRDS Amadeus),
but has the exchange rate of the currency of an account in relation to the currency chosen
by the person downloading the data.


A.4        Data Selection and Exporting

Before discussing the merging and cleaning steps, we touch upon some other subtle issues in
the setup of the download process. The process starts from selecting the sample of companies
in a given BvD disk, typically by country.26 To overcome the download limits, large countries
  25
     By errors, we mean the cases when the value of the UNITS switches from, say, thousands to millions,
but the corresponding financial variables do not show the 1000x decrease in the order of magnitude. We
describe a filter we developed to check for these issues in Section A.5.2.
  26
     One must chose industrial companies from the start since there are also banks and insurance companies
in Orbis. “Type” variable helps this selection. In addition global format is what is available for private firms
whereas detailed format is available for listed firms.


                                                      29
may be downloaded by regions. An alternative is to use sectoral splits in a given country. The
software then displays the set of the selection criteria, combined by the “AND” expression,
and the resulting number of unique companies satisfying all the criteria. One can replace
the “AND” expression to adjust the selection criteria and/or display the list of companies.
Regardless of the variable used for splitting the large country data for separate downloads,
it is necessary to watch out for the cases when the variable used for splitting is not available
for a subset of companies. For that, one needs to select the criterion of the entire country
(such as “all companies in the U.S.”) and add the criterion where all regions or sectors are
explicitly listed, but precede the latter condition with the “NOT” expression (AND NOT
“companies in sectors A, B, C...”).27

       To download from the older disks (issued prior to January 2012 for Orbis or December
2010 for Amadeus) one has to navigate to the Formatted Export menu (File>Export>Formatted
Export To on the upper-left) in order to adjust the default list of variables; the user does not
need to display the list of companies after this. In the Formatted Export menu one can also
choose the time period of the data (absolute/relative years), currency, units of financials,
and then the export layout. See Section E.1 for illustration of this interface. An alternative,
“List Export” method is accessible from the list of companies. To adjust the default list
of variables and make other choices, one has to navigate to Options>List Format>New
Format menu. We do not discuss this method, because we did not see a clear advantage over
the Formatted Export method in older BvD disks. If anything, a potential disadvantage is
the increase in waiting time for the list of companies to be displayed before the download
can start.

       In newer disks (issued after January 2012 for Orbis or December 2010 for Amadeus),
which emulate the BvD online interface (Method 1), more download options are available
after the resulting number of unique companies satisfying the criteria is revealed. After
selecting the Formatted Export menu on the right, one now needs to further choose from the
Database export, Statistical export (not useful), or Custom export. The closest analog to the
Formatted Export interface in the older disks is the Custom Export where one can adjust the
variables, data time stamp (absolute/relative years), units, currency, and layout. Section E.2
  27
    This additional download can be ignored if the number of companies lost due to the missing splitting
variable is negligible.


                                                  30
shows the details of its interface. However, for unknown reasons the list of variables one can
choose from does not include all the variables available in Orbis .28 In particular, none
of the ownership data is available. A potential remedy is the Database Export (another
sub-heading of Formatted Export), specifically designed for downloading large amounts of
data according to BvD. For the interface of this method, see Section E.3. Database Export
lets one choose all the variables in Orbis, currency, and units. The download works much
faster than other methods, which is an advantage for large downloads such as ownership
data. In our experiments, we saw roughly a twofold time gain compared to other methods.
However, a serious drawback of the Database Export is the inability to download financials
with the option of “relative” years (it only downloads in terms of “absolute years”). For this
reason, we have to choose the Custom Export option as the only way to force the relative
years download. For ownership downloads the Database Export is acceptable because, as we
explained in Section A.2, the time dimension is irrelevant given the availability of ownership
data as a snapshot in a given release. A final option is the List Export, illustrated in
Section E.4. One can chose absolute and/or relative years and all of the variables under
the List Export option. Hence, this method works for both financial and ownership data
downloads. The only drawback of List Export is the extra time needed to first reveal the
list of companies before the download can commence.


A.5      Building Financial Panel Data

A.5.1     Vintage Raw Data

The following are the key steps we take in constructing the firm-level financial database. We
execute these steps for each vintage of the BvD database we use.


   1. Extract the data from Orbis with the 5 latest “relative years” in ASCII comma-
      separated value format,29 transform it to Stata using Statransfer, name and label the
      variables using the database codes and names. The data comes in Stata wide format
  28
     Because all the variables were available in older disks under Formatted Export, we believe the reason
they are not under Custom Export (which is a sub-heading of Formatted Export) is due to space limitations
in the newer disks due to the increase in the amount of information given more years.
  29
     For Amadeus data, we select 10 relative years for the reasons explained in Section A.2.


                                                   31
       with the rows consisting of unique records (lines) per company consisting of BvD ID
       and similar non-time varying data, the last available year per firm LASTYEAR; and the
       blocks of time-varying variables in the form X in the Latest Year, X in Latest Year
       –1, and so on, until X in the Latest Year –4. We rename the variables using internal
       BvD codes to become, correspondingly, X1, ..., X5.

   2. Delete the observations with just a name of company and no other information and
       the observations with missing BvD ID or BvD Account number (the main account
       identifier).

   3. Notice that at this stage the data does not have a harmonized time variable showing
       the precise calendar year of each data point. In order to reshape the data from Stata
       wide format to the convenient long format, we use the row number as the cross-section
       identifier and specify in Stata that the number following the stub X of the time-varying
       variables X1, ..., X5 has to be treated as the “fake” time identifier YEAR. The resulting
       YEAR variable is a mere marker of the observation per firm because it does not account
       for the possible gaps in reporting that we have discussed in Section A.3.1. There are
       also a lot of redundant empty observations because the -reshape- command creates a
       full panel and the observations in the periods when a given firm does not report the
       data will be empty.

   4. Use the variable “Account Closing Date” CLOSEDATE to correctly assign the calendar
       year. We re-construct the YEAR variable based on the following convention. If the
       closing date is after or on June 1st, the current year is assigned (if CLOSEDATE is 4th of
       August, 2003, the year is 2003). Otherwise, the previous year is assigned (if CLOSEDATE
       is 25th of May, 2003, the year is 2002).30,31
  30
      The raw data may contain duplicates in terms of ID-YEAR. These duplicates arise for two reasons: i) The
presence of both quarterly and annual reports. ii) Firms switching from presenting their end of accounting
year balance sheet information in one month to some other month (from December to May, for example). We
would like to keep the most recent reports for these companies. One way to handle duplicates is to retain the
data for the closing date closest conceptually to the end of year. An additional step to handle duplicates is
to use a flow variable with good coverage such as Operating Revenue to identify potential quarterly reports
(quarterly sales should be much lower than yearly sales). Then we drop duplicates whose revenue are less
than the maximum per firm-year. For example, in 2005 vintage, there are around 34 thousand duplicates
like that out of over 18 million observations. We eliminate a small number of remaining duplicates for which
we cannot know whether these remaining reports refer to annual or monthly data.
   31
      One might think that BvD correctly marks the lags in relative years taking into account the possible

                                                     32
   5. Create our main company identifier ID_NUMBER, which is a copy of the BvD ID number.
      The difference between the BvD account number and the BvD ID number is the single
      letter, U or C, in the end of the BvD account number, reflecting what account type the
      record represents (consolidated and unconsolidated). If the BvD account number is
      missing, we concatenate the BvD ID number with the first letter of non-missing BvD
      Consolidation Code, following the BvD convention for the BvD account numbers (U,
      C and nothing for limited financials accounts). We create the country code based on
      the first two letters of the ID_NUMBER which by BvD convention starts by a two-letter
      country code (BE for Belgium, US for the U.S., GB for the UK, and so on).

   6. All the financial variables are transformed from strings into numeric data type. In
      the vintages where we downloaded the data in the “original units,” we transform the
      variable UNITS from textual form to the integer power of ten to express all financials
      in the same units. We developed a filter to check for mistakes in the UNITS variables
      as explained below.

   7. Clean the raw vintage data.

         • Drop duplicates in terms of ID_NUMBER and YEAR.32
         • Drop observations with no financial information. We verified that these company-
            year points do not have an account closing date and are mostly missing observa-
            tions generated during the reshaping stage.
         • Drop observations for which country code created based on the BvD ID numbers
            does not correspond to BvD’s country ISO code.33
         • Drop observations with missing currency.
time gaps in financial data. As we discovered, this is not the case. Hence it is essential that one downloads
the CLOSEDATE variable, together with BvD ID number, BvD account number, and the last available year
variable.
   32
      These will have the same financial data but different industry codes. In Orbis the first observation per
duplicate represents the main industry, hence, we keep the main industry per company for companies that
had multiple industries reported.
   33
      As we mentioned, BvD IDs start from the 2-letter code corresponding to the company’s country. BvD
country ISO code is the same for all the companies in a given country. Hence, if a company has a different
country code, we interpret this as a mistake. This can also be a tax front. Note that these are not the
multinationals since the country code attached to BvD ID numbers reflect where the company operates.
If the company is part of a multinational, this will be reflected in the ownership variables not in the ID
numbers.

                                                     33
        • Drop observations with missing Account Closing Date.


A.5.2    Merging Vintages

At this stage each observation in each vintage is uniquely identified by the variables ID_NUMBER
and YEAR. The following steps are performed at each consecutive merge, with vintage
specifics highlighted.

  1. As explained in Section A.1.2, in some instances the unique company identifiers change
      over time which would affect the success of the merge. Before the merge, we replace the
      old IDs for the countries which had their ID changed over time with the most recent
      ones. We retain the old “legacy IDs” on the data.

      A slight complication emerges for IDs in former Yugoslavia, coming from earlier Orbis disks.
      The same companies “belong” to Yugoslavia in the early 2000s (country code and the
      first two letters of IDs are YU), then to Serbia-Montenegro (CS) in disks from the mid-
      2000s, then to, separately, Serbia (RS) and Montenegro (ME), or even Kosovo (KV).
      In the IDs of these companies only the letter part changes over years—the numeric
      part does not. Where it is possible, we assign YU and CS to RS and ME using the
      numeric part of IDs; where we do not know, we assume they are in RS. We do this
      after the replacement of IDs using the correspondence table, because some firms with
      ID from CS are present in that table and are already assigned to RS or ME.

  2. Before the merge, we harmonize the names of the variables across vintages and prod-
      ucts.

  3. Before the merge, we check the consistency of the Units of Financials variable (UNITS).
      Recall that at this stage the financial data is reported in various units of local cur-
      rency (units, thousands, etc.) for different companies and even for the same company
      over time. This is due to BvD non-harmonization across products. Downloading in
      “default” option for the units requires the researchers to use the UNITS variable to
      harmonize the units. Another way is to force the download to be in a particular unit
      such as units or thousands. We employ the following strategy to deal with this issue
      if the researcher downloads the data with the “default” option. For each company we

                                              34
       check if the moment of switch in units coincides with a “reasonable” move of total
       assets (can also do other financial variables); if not—we drop the entire firm. For the
       lower threshold of assets growth, we choose -99% because the 1000x decrease (due to
       a change in the UNITS variable) of otherwise unchanged assets is -99.9% growth. For
       the upper bound of assets growth, we choose 19,800% because the 1000x increase of
       otherwise unchanged assets is 99900% growth. If we allow the company to have a large
       (70 percent) drop in assets in the year when the units switch 1000x (x*0.3*1000), this
       is close to 19900% growth.34

       Then we calculate the actual growth of assets and verify if this growth lies outside
       of these thresholds in the years when UNITS change. We drop the entire company
       where the moment of switch in UNITS does not coincide with the reasonable move in
       assets.35 One can keep the companies which are marked by BvD as “inactive” because
       the assets of those firms can genuinely go down to (almost) zero.36

   4. Before the merge, we express all financial variables in harmonized units by the trans-
       formation x = x · 10UNITS , except in the 2013 Orbis vintage that is downloaded with
       the explicit “in units of local currency” option. The UNITS variable is then discarded.

   5. Before the merge, we create the textual identifier for the vintage to keep track of the
       vintage which contributes to a given observation after all merging steps are done.

   6. An additional methodological complication arises when we combine the 2013 Orbis vin-
       tage with earlier vintages. This is related to the change in sectoral classification in 2008
       from NACE Rev 1.1 to NACE Rev 2 by the Eurostat.37 In 2005 and 2009 Orbis vin-
       tages, the sector is identified by the “NACE Rev. 1.1, Core code (4 digits)” (NACECD);
       in 2010 WRDS Amadeus, 2013 Orbis, and 2014 Amadeus vintages it is already “Rev.
  34
     Recall that all the balance sheet values are book values for the non-listed firms.
  35
     As a result, we eliminate about 3% of observations in the 2005 and 2009 Orbis vintages; less than 1% in
the 2010 WRDS Amadeus vintage; and less than 0.5% in the 2014 Amadeus vintage.
  36
     The variable Status takes the values Dissolved, Dissolved (merger or take-over), In liquidation, Inactive
(no precision), Dissolved (liquidation), Dissolved (merger or take-over), Inactive (no precision), Bankruptcy,
Dissolved (bankruptcy), Dissolved (demerger) or some peculiar active types Active (default of payments),
Active (dormant), Unknown.
  37
     Table A.6.2 lists sectors classified by NACE Rev 2, Level 2. For space considerations we do not report
the 4-digit industry classification.



                                                     35
       2 Core code (4 digits)” (NACEREV2CCODE). Both codes are unique per company.38 We
       prefer to use the more recent NACE Rev. 2 classification in our data.

       We went through a detailed process of matching the industry classifications pre- and
       post-2008. We start from the official Eurostat correspondence table between NACE
       Rev 1.1 and NACE Rev 2. To supplement the official correspondence table in a way
       that we have a one-to-one match for every sector, we proceed as follows. Most often,
       multiple NACE Rev 2 codes correspond to a given NACE Rev 1.1 code. In the official
       correspondence tables, when multiple NACE Rev 2 codes are matched to a unique
       NACE Rev 1.1, they are sorted in the ascending order of the numeric NACE Rev
       2 code. The first code is the most closely related sector to the one in NACE Rev
       1.1 classification. We retain the first NACE Rev 2 code provided in the official table
       and discard the rest.39 This approach attains a good match for manufacturing sectors
       (codes 10 and higher in NACE Rev 1.1) but not as good a match for agricultural
       sectors (codes below 10 in NACE Rev 1.1). We manually match codes by reading the
       long descriptions of the codes. We do the same if there are sectors that are completely
       missing in the official correspondence tables. Our own correspondence table is available
       upon request.

       Before merging with the 2013 Orbis vintage we merge the earlier vintage data with
       our sector correspondence table. We keep the original sector classification from each
       vintage just in case.

   7. Care should be exercised when combining the disk data from Orbis with Amadeus down-
       loads from the WRDS (in our case, we used the 2010 download of Amadeus from the
       WRDS), mostly with respect to the harmonization of variable names. Here are some
       peculiarities which the users are advised to verify. i) As we explain above, the “Ex-
       change Rate” variable of WRDS should not be used. ii) In May 2010 WRDS Amadeus ,
       the label of the core sector variable NACECD states NACE Revision 1.1. but we dis-
  38
     There are numerous “secondary” codes in BvD. All of the above is for the “main” code. We also keep
the alternative unique industry codes such as SIC and NAICS.
  39
     For example, the NACE Rev 1.1. code 10.20: Mining and agglomeration of lignite is matched to three
NACE Rev 2 codes: 05.20: Mining of lignite; 09.90: Support activities for other mining and quarrying;
19.20: Manufacture of refined petroleum products. We retain the first line from the correspondence table
and matches “10.20: Mining and agglomeration of lignite” to “05.20: Mining of lignite.”



                                                  36
     covered from observing the values that it is in fact Revision 2. We verified this with
     WRDS, who in turn confirmed this by contacting BvD. For this reason, no sector corre-
     spondence table needs to be applied to this vintage. iii) In WRDS, the listed company
     identifier is a binary variable (“Quoted company” LISTED) while in Orbis it is textual
     having the values like “Delisted,” “Listed,” “Unlisted.” We add the textual variable to
     WRDS Amadeus vintage before merging with the other data.

  8. We use the values from the later vintages to supplement missing values. A non-missing
     value, however, will never be replaced with a missing. (In Stata language, we merge
     with update and replace options). Depending on the order of merge and the computing
     power (RAM) availability the users may merge all the vintages at once or, if the data
     gets big to fit the RAM, merge countries one-by-one and then append (stack) the
     country data.

  9. Check for duplicates by ID and YEAR and, in case of duplicates, retain only observations
     coming from the most recent vintage.


A.5.3   Cleaning Merged Data

After we merge the financial data from individual vintages, we perform some further data
harmonization and very mild cleaning for obvious data mistakes.


  1. Companies in several countries report financials in multiple currencies. We always re-
     tain the accounts in major currencies, such as, U.S. dollar, Euro, UK Pound, but delete
     the observations with missing or unreasonable currencies which probably are mistakes
     (for example South African Rand or Canadian dollar for European companies).

  2. We express the financial variables in real dollars 2005 base. To convert from the units
     of the nominal currency of accounts we i) convert the currency of accounts to the
     official currency of the country; ii) deflate the series by the national GDP deflator with
     the 2005 base from the World Bank; and iii) divide by the exchange rate of the official
     currency to the U.S. dollar in the year 2005. A number of complications arise at this
     stage.


                                             37
       Because companies in several countries report in multiple currencies in order to add
       the official exchange rate, we do not use the country code but the currency code.40 The
       problem with the World Bank data (or the IMF’s IFS data) is that the source does not
       report the ISO currency code even if the country changes the currency; we just observe
       a jump in the exchange rate. We obtain the Compustat Global exchange rates, which
       use currency ISO symbols (USD, GBP, etc.) as the main identifier of the existing and
       legacy currencies. We also supplement and harmonize the Compustat currency series
       rates with currencies actually observed in our data in particular country-years. In case
       the legacy currencies are missing in Compustat in some years (e.g., in the former Soviet
       Union, in Yugoslavia, etc.), we refer to the national central banks’ data.

       For the conversion step i), we need to make sure that the currency of financials for all
       firm-years is the “official” local currency as of today and not other currencies. This is
       important because we will use the deflator in the official local currency. In particular,
       we need to decide what official currency to use with the recent Eurozone members in
       conjunction with the GDP deflator data. In our sample, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia,
       and Malta are such countries; Latvia who adopted the euro on 1 January 2014 is
       still marked as having currency as Latvian Lats in our data. Consider Slovenia as an
       example. The country adopted the euro on 1 January 2007. In Slovenian data we
       observe the companies which report the data in single currency (Euro or Slovenian
       Tolar) in all years, pre- and post-2007. The note to the WB GDP deflator data for
       Slovenia says “A simple multiplier is used to convert the national currencies of EMU
       members to euros. The following irrevocable euro conversion rate entered into force
       on January 1, 2007: 1 euro = 239.64 Slovenian Tolar.” This implies that the deflator
       is effectively in Tolar (SIT) until 2007 because it is a ratio of year 2006 to year 2005
       (the base year in WB data) and both of these years are multiplied by the same number
       239.64 (the fixed parity rate). Hence, the official currency of Slovenia is considered to
       be SIT before 2007, and all financial data is recalculated to SIT before 2007. From
       2007 the deflator reflects the dynamics of local prices in Euros, and we express all the
  40
    As we explained in Section A.3, the BvD variable “Exchange Rate” is useless for conversion of the data
downloaded in the “original currency.” Users may choose to download the raw data in some other currency,
such as U.S. dollars, in which case the Exchange Rate might report the exchange rate to the currency of
accounts. We prefer to convert the data ourselves and not rely on the internal BvD data convertor.

 3. Drop company-years with missing information on total assets and operating revenue
    and sales and employment (simultaneously).

 4. Drop the entire company (all years) if total assets is negative in any year.

 5. Drop the entire company if employment (in persons) is negative in any year and com-
    panies with employment larger than that of Walmart (2 million) in any year.

 6. Drop the entire company if sales are negative in any year. Of note, we do not perform
    this filter in terms of Operating Revenue because this P&L account item is equal to
    sales + Other operating revenues + Stock variations. While sales cannot be negative,
    revenue can be negative if a company has a sizable financial loss (say, loss due to
    hedging, etc.). For countries, like Denmark, whose firms do not report sales but only
    operating revenue, we cannot use this filter.

 7. Drop the entire company when reporting in any year a value of employment per million
    of total assets larger than the 99.9 percentile of the distribution.

 8. Drop the entire company when reporting in any year a value of employment per million
    of sales larger than the 99.9 percentile of the distribution.

 9. Drop the entire company when reporting in any year a value of sales to total assets
    larger than the 99.9 percentile of the distribution.

10. Drop the entire company if Tangible Fixed Assets (such as buildings, machinery, etc.)
    is negative in any year.

11. For a given company ID year, we replace missing strings which are unlikely to change
    over time with values for this company for other years. We complement information on
    country, company name, city, region, postal code, legal form, and date of incorporation
    with lagged/lead values in the years where such info is present. This is reasonable
    because if a company changes the legal form it obtains a new BvD ID and will be
    treated as a new entity. If information is missing in all years, they remain missing.

B       Foreign Ownership

B.1     Building Foreign Investment Panel Data

B.1.1    Vintage Raw Data

The following are the key steps we take in constructing the firm-level ownership database.
In some respect, the process of preparing the raw vintage data is more straightforward
than that for the financials because each vintage corresponds to a single time observation.
However, compared to the financial data, the ownership data has more than two identifiers
(the company ID and year). In the case of ownership, the additional dimension comes from
the fact that each company could have multiple owners or subsidiaries.

    The raw ASCII data has rows consisting of non-time varying data and the blocks of
variables corresponding to the groups in Orbis Ownership database. They are company’s
shareholders, domestic ultimate owners (UOs), global UOs, and subsidiaries. In order to
have the data for a given country in one file, we download data using the Formatted Export
method in older disks and the List Export method in newer disks, as discussed in Section A.2.
Of note, we download some variables describing the company itself such as name, BvD ID,
size category, type of company, location information, core industry, and three key financials
(employment, total assets, and operating revenue) in the original currency of accounts and
in the last available year, together with Units and Currency Code in case we would need
these to identify the company better. The key identifier is still the company BvD ID.

    Assume a Company A has 2 shareholders, 1 global UO, and 3 subsidiaries. The data for
this company will have 3 observations (rows) in a given vintage, corresponding to the largest
number of observations across the groups in Orbis Ownership database:

     NAME*     BvD ID* Core      Shareholder Shareholder    GUO     GUO     Subsidiary   Subsidiary
                       Industry* Name        % Stake Direct Name    % Stake Name         % Stake

     Company A ZZ1234U 6123      Company B 70             Company B 100     Company C 100
     Company A ZZ1234U 6123      Mr. Smith 30                               Company D 90
     Company A ZZ1234U 6123                                                 Company E WO
    The variables marked with (*) are unique per company-vintage. Because we export the
data asking the disk to repeat each single item all these variables will be repeated for each


                                              45
company record in the raw downloads. The order of the non-unique variables corresponds
to the internal order in the Orbis Ownership or Amadeus Ownership databases.

   We execute the following steps for each vintage of the Orbis Ownership or Amadeus
Ownership database we use.

  1. We extract the data in ASCII comma-separated value format, transform it to Stata
     using Statransfer, name and label the variables following the database names.

  2. Delete observations with only a company name and no other information.

  3. Generate the YEAR variable for the year in which the ownership information is
     recorded in a given vintage of BvD product following our assumption that YEAR
     takes the value of one less the year when the Orbis disk was issued. Recall that we
     choose the vintages that are closest, but subsequent to that year. For example, the
     ownership data coming from the Orbis disk no. 27 issued in January 2011 is assigned
     to YEAR 2010, and so on.

  4. As in case of financial data, we create our main identifier ID_NUMBER, which is a copy
     of the BvD account number. It is a copy of the BvD ID number if the BvD account
     number is missing.

  5. To keep the file size manageable we split the data generating a separate file for a given
     country in a given year and the group of variables in Orbis Ownership database. As a
     result we have the following files per country-year.

       • In the file with the information about the company itself, we keep all the identifiers
          mentioned above, removing the duplicates in terms of all remaining variables and
          then removing duplicates by ID and Employment.
       • In the file with information on company shareholders, we keep ID, YEAR and
          all variables from this group, dropping observations with missing information on
          owners and then removing the duplicates in terms of all remaining variables.
       • We do the same in the file with separate information for company’s immediate
          shareholders, for its domestic ultimate owners, for its global ultimate owners, and
          for its subsidiaries.

                                             46
B.1.2   Merging and Cleaning Ownership Data

In this section, we illustrate how we create the country panels of company shareholder data;
that is, the information on the direct ownership of the equity rights for the universe of
companies covered in the Orbis Ownership data set. The preparation of other ownership
variables involves similar steps. We first describe how we prepare the company panels of
“direct ownership links;” that is, the data where the unit of observation is the company-
shareholder pairs in a given year. After that, we discuss how we build the company-year
level data where the links information is aggregated to the company level each year.


B.1.3   Data with Company Shareholder Links

Each of the following steps is performed for individual country ownership files coming either
from the Orbis Ownership or the Amadeus Ownership database.


  1. Combine (stack) all annual ownership data files for a given country. Recall that we
     have bi-annual vintages of Amadeus Ownership since 2000 and annual vintages of Orbis
     Ownership since 2005.

  2. Create the country code based on the first two letters of the ID_NUMBER, which by
     BvD convention should start from two-letter country code (BE for Belgium, US for the
     United States, GB for the UK and so on).

  3. Convert the character variables Percentage Owned Direct (ODIRECT) and Percentage
     Owned Total (OTOTAL) into numeric format, replacing some special character values
     they may take in the raw data. In particular, we replace percentage with a leading
     <,>, ± with the percentage after the symbol; eliminate possible % sign; replace spe-
     cial codes “WO” (wholly owned) with 100%, “MO” (majority owned) with 50.01%
     (because by the GAAP practice the majority ownership involves 50% plus one share
     but the smallest stakes reported by BvD are 0.01%), “CQP1” (50% plus 1 share) with
     50.01%, “NG” (negligible) with 0.01% (again, the smallest observed stake according
     to BvD), “-” (not significant) or “n.a.” (not available) with missing; “BR” (branch,
     Orbis Ownership only) with 100%; “JO” (jointly owned, Amadeus Ownership only)


                                             47
       with 50% (our exploration of such cases shows that there is always exactly two owners
       in case of the JO code). We keep the character versions of these variables.

   4. Implement company ID changes following the procedure described in Section A.5.2 for
       financial data, saving the legacy IDs on the dataset.

   5. To determine the total foreign ownership at the company level, we proceed as fol-
       lows. Whenever the variable Shareholder Country ISO code (OCOUNTRY in Amadeus or
       SHARCOUN in Orbis ) is different from the company own Country code we consider the
       link foreign. By default, we assume that the shareholder with missing country code or
       with SHARCOUN taking the values of “-” and “n.a.” is located in the same country as
       the given company as it is done in the literature.

   6. For Amadeus Ownership, we further improve the above simple rule by manual assign-
       ments by country, based on the variable Shareholder Name (ONAME). That variable
       contains some indication of whether the owner is foreign.41 We determine the unique
       values of ONAME and then manually replace the ownership links which have the missing
       OCOUNTRY. One can further try to compare the company country code to the first two
       letters of the available Shareholder BvDEP ID number (OID in Amadeus or SHARSIR
       in Orbis ), but not every shareholder has the BvD ID available. In addition, one can
       investigate the values of the variable Shareholder Type (the textual variable OTYPE in
       Amadeus or the standardized letter code SHARTYPE in Orbis), assuming that certain
       owner types are domestic (such as company employees or management, or the entries
       like “private individual(s)” or “unnamed private shareholders”, and so on) unless it is
       clear from the name they are foreign (for example, “foreign investors”).

   7. Combine shareholder information from our Amadeus Ownership and Orbis Ownership,
       making sure we do not have duplicates in overlapping years. In overlapping years, we
       establish which database has more recorded shareholders with non-missing direct own-
       ership stakes for a given company-year (non-missing variable Shareholder - Percentage
       of ownership, direct, SHARDPER and use the record with more data.42 In case of an ex-
  41
     We make this assignment mostly based on the parts of the names reflecting the legal type of the share-
holder. We compare that to what is typical for the company’s own country.
  42
     We encountered the case when the same observation (ownership links) got the value “-” in Amadeus


                                                    48
      act match, we use Orbis but retain the variable Shareholder NACE Rev. 2 Core Code
      (ONACE) and other useful information available only in Amadeus. Actual elimination
      of the duplicates is done later, because we use some information across two products
      in a given year to supplement the data.

   8. Supplement the missing textual information (Shareholder Type in textual form from
      Amadeus and 1-letter code from Orbis; Shareholder NACE Rev. 2 Core Code) using
      the unique shareholder IDs and shareholder names. Supplement missing Shareholder
      Type in textual form from Amadeus using non-missing 1-letter code from Orbis and
      vice versa.

   9. Because we first establish the foreign ownership link status at the individual vintage
      level, we can take advantage of the full panel and revise the foreign link status based
      on other years when this info is available for a given company ID. As above, using the
      unique shareholder IDs and shareholder names, we replace links ever found to be as
      foreign in at least one year as such in all the years.

 10. After all the information across products has been used, we delete the duplicated
      observations (all the links for a given company-year) from Orbis and Amadeus keeping
      the ones with the best coverage. We save the data files of direct ownership links for
      individual countries.


B.1.4    Direct Ownership Types

Once we have the shareholder links data for country-years, we can aggregate it in the variety
of ways because each link record has a number or variables describing not only the equity
stake held by a given (direct) investor but also investor’s location, type, or industry.

   For illustration, we will discuss our work to aggregate ownership stakes by foreign/domestic
status, further split by the type of the shareholder involved. In particular, this data can be
Ownership and the value of exactly 0% in Orbis Ownership. We think that in Amadeus Ownership , the
code “-” actually means “negligible” while it means “missing” in Orbis Ownership . Because we could
not confirm or refute this distinction, we recoded “-” as missing. Because the 0% stakes do not bear any
useful information, we treat the observations with Shareholder Percentage=0% as missing when counting
the shareholders with available ownership stake.



                                                  49
merged with the financials data panel, described in part A.5, also uniquely identified by the
company ID (IDNUMBER) and YEAR. Each of the following steps is performed over individual
country data files.


   1. We start from the ownership links data obtained as described in section B.1.3 and
       delete the link records which have no usable information.

   2. Identify foreign and domestic links, specific to the owners of a particular type. The
       exercise is similar to what we did to find foreign/domestic links, but here we use the
       information on whether a link is foreign or domestic and, in addition, take advantage
       of the information in the variable Shareholder Type (the textual variable OTYPE in
       Amadeus or the standardized letter code SHARTYPE in Orbis). Recall that in the codes
       preparing raw links data we supplemented the values of both variables with one another
       and across all the years. In particular we define the following indicators:

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Industrial Type, =1 if Foreign (Domestic) owner has
            the (textual) type Industrial company, Corporate, Self-owned, Branch, or types
            reflecting the individuals working for the company (such as, employees, person-
            nel, managers, directors, self-ownership) because these owners are likely to bring
            similar types of “expertise” as industrial owners for the majority of the companies
            in our financials database.43

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Financial Type, =1 if Foreign (Domestic) owner has
            the type Bank, Financial company, Insurance company, Other financial insti-
            tution, Mutual & Pension Fund/Nominee/Trust/Trustee, Foundation/Research
            Institute, Private Equity firms, Venture capital, Hedge funds.

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Government Type, =1 if Foreign (Domestic) owner
            has type Governments, State, Public authority.

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Individuals Type, =1 Foreign (Domestic) owner has
            the “individuals” type with known names. Besides single private individuals or
            families, this category includes shareholders designated by more than one named
  43
    Orbis has some companies in the financial intermediation and insurance sector. Our assumption is less
valid for such entities.

            individual or families (the entries like “Mr Gregory Edward Bailey & Mrs Mar-
            garet Ethel Bailey” or “Mme Bringaud et son fils”. The idea behind this is that
            they would probably exert their voting power alone or together.

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Other Types, =1 if Foreign (Domestic) owner has the
            aggregated types including unnamed individuals, the entries indicating that there
            are more than one private shareholders, collectively designated (for example, “In-
            dividual(s) or family(ies)”), unknown types of owners (“Unnamed private share-
            holders, aggregated”, Miscellaneous; Undefined company, Unknown, “n.a.”, NA),
            or simply missing owner type.

         • Owner is Public, =1 if the company is owned by numerous shareholders, collec-
            tively designated as “public.” The owner type “Public” is possible only for publicly
            quoted companies.44

   3. In addition we specify two sub-types of the owners of financial type:

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Active Financial Type, =1 if Foreign (Domestic) owner
            has the type Financial company, Insurance company, Other financial institution,
            Mutual & Pension Fund/Nominee/Trust/Trustee, Foundation/Stichting, Private
            Equity firms, Venture capital, Hedge funds.45

         • Foreign (Domestic) Owner-Passive Financial Type, =1 if Foreign (Domestic)
            owner has the type Bank.

   4. Once we identify the stakes held by the direct investors of certain type with the help
       of those dummies, we can generate the company-level foreign and domestic ownership
       variables out of the links data. We “collapse” data by summing up the stakes of the
       same owner type, separately domestic and foreign, by year and company ID. We also
       generate the simple count of number of owners, foreign owners as well as dummies
  44
     Notice, that for public companies BvD may report some owners of more specific types (banks, individuals,
industrial companies, etc.) with their corresponding stakes, as long as those stakes are known. We do not
assign the owners designated collectively as “Public” to either foreign or domestic type because we do not
know how the shareholder base is split.
  45
     Unfortunately, we cannot separate such arguably passive types of institutional investors as pension
funds from the combined type “Mutual & Pension Fund/Nominee/Trust/Trustee” or corresponding code
SHARTYPE=“E”.



                                                     51
       identifying all owner types at the company-year level. For convenience we also create
       the variable “Check 100 Ownership” which is the sum of all known ownership stakes.
       If this variable is less than 100, we have unassigned ownership percentages in certain
       company-years which we assign as domestic. After summation by collapse, the owner-
       ship stake percentages larger than 100% are possibly due to rounding and replacing of
       some special codes such as “NG” with 0.01%, or “WO” with 100%, or simply due to
       ownership data mistakes. Hence, we perform some cleaning steps.

   5. We round all the direct ownership percentages to the second digit after the decimal
       (to repeat, the smallest stake observed by Orbis is 0.01%).

   6. Remove duplicates in terms of ID_NUMBER and YEAR by retaining that of the two dupli-
       cates which has larger number of ownership observations, hoping that there is a bigger
       chance it provides useful data for percentages, etc.

   7. After this, we delete the observations with the ownership percentages larger than 103%
       and then replace the values “slightly more” than 100%, that is in (100, 103] range,
       with exactly 100%. At this stage, we have constructed an unbalanced country panel
       of company-level direct ownership data.

   8. The ownership panel is merged with financials panel by ID_NUMBER and YEAR.

   9. In the combined dataset, we fill in the missing ownership time series, regardless of the
       time coverage of financials. In particular, we supplement ownership data in missing
       years using previous or consecutive non-missing values (using Stata -carryforward-
       command) assuming the following: 1. We use the existing earliest value of ownership
       to carry forward until i) the new non-missing value is reached or ii) the end of the
       time-series is reached for that company. 2. For the missing initial years of ownership,
       we assume that it is the same as in the first observation of non-missing data.46

 10. After we filled in ownership data using lags and leads, we assign the companies with
       financial data but no ownership data to the category of companies with Domestic
       Industrial ownership.
  46
     We can keep track of the filled-in ownership data by using the “Check 100 Ownership” variable which
will be missing for filled-in observations.

B.2     OECD Official Data Sources

We compare our ownership panel to alternative source on inward and outward activities of
multinationals. The OECD provides data on the activities of foreign affiliates of multination-
als in OECD countries in the AMNE (Activity of Multinational Enterprises) database avail-
able on the OECD data portal https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AMNE IN.
The key variables presented are production, employment, value added, research and devel-
opment, labor compensation, and exports. The data is broken down by country of origin of
the ultimate owner (inward investment), location (outward investment), and main sector of
economic activity of the multinational company following the ISIC revision 4 sector classi-
fication. AMNE covers 28 OECD host countries from 2008 onwards, although the coverage
varies by country and over time.

   The historical data is available from two prior databases that use the ISIC revision 3
classification: AFA (Activities of Foreign Affiliates) and FATS (Foreign Affiliates Statistics).
The AFA database presents detailed data on the performance of foreign affiliates in the
manufacturing industry for 28 OECD countries. The FATS database gives detailed data
on the activities of foreign affiliates in the services sector for 25 OECD countries. These
databases can be accessed at http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=AFA IN3 and
https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=FATS IN3 SERV.

   The OECD databases consist of data reported to the OECD by Eurostat based on an-
nual surveys on the activities of foreign-controlled enterprises and foreign affiliates abroad
controlled by residents of the compiling country. Surveys are conducted, in most cases, by
the national statistical office or the central bank of each country. While the key variables in
the survey are common across countries, the target sample varies across countries. In order
to compare the BvD ownership data to the official OECD data, the following issues have to
be considered:

  • Both AMNE and Orbis report data at the firm level, while AFA-FATS, covering the
      pre-2008 period, report the “number of enterprises or establishments.” Therefore, in
      certain countries, the number of foreign affiliates is not comparable with Orbis data
      because establishments (plants) are not included in the BvD database. All other key
      variables refer to a firm in all data sets.

                                               53
• The notion of Foreign Affiliate is based on the concept of the “controlling interest.”
  According to AFA-FATS, a single institutional unit (another corporation, a household,
  or a government body) secures control over a corporation by owning more than half
  the voting shares or otherwise controlling more than half the shareholder voting power.
  However, the definition of controlling interest varies across countries. In most coun-
  tries, controlling interest is based on direct majority ownership (50%) while others
  (Hungary and the United States) also consider minority control (between 10% and
  50%). Moreover, some countries also include indirectly owned foreign affiliates. In
  Table B.2.1, we provide a summary of the characteristics of the AMNE database by
  country, whether indirect foreign control is considered, multiple owners and the main
  data source.

• In AMNE database, starting in 2008, the total economy is defined as sectors B–N at
  the ISIC revision 4. Prior to 2008, the total economy includes additional sectors.

• As shown in Table B.2.1, in the OECD databases, some countries do not sample all
  firms and the inclusion of firms in the surveys depends on certain economic thresholds.
  We always use all information available in Orbis, regardless of the firm size.

• In all cases, OECD aggregates the entire output of the entities designated as “foreign”
  and expresses them in national currency (Euro for Eurozone countries) or, additionally
  in the AFA database, as the ratio of the total manufacturing output in a given country.

                                          the OeNB (including a question on the ultimate parent company). The OeNB submits a list of all resident foreign-controlled enterprises
                                          to Statistics Austria. Next, Statistics Austria aligns this list of enterprises with the entries in the statistical business register, with a view
                                          to creating a dataset that matches the scope of the relevant annual structural business statistics.

                                          from the Institut National de la Statistique et des Études Économiques (INSEE) survey on financial ties (LiFi). From 1999, information
                                          from the Diane database (coedition Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Editions / Coface SCRL) has been added. The data for food industries
                                          come from the annual business survey from the SCEES, Ministry of Agriculture and these data have been included from 1999 onwards.

                                           primarily from administrative information such as VAT from HM Customs and Excise and PAYE from the Inland Revenue. The register
                                           holds a number of variables including information on the country of ownership for each group. It also holds information on which UK
                                           groups have foreign affiliates.The main source of information on these foreign links for the latest annual survey was a Dun and Bradstreet
                                           publication. This was supplemented with information from ONS surveys into acquisitions and mergers of companies. These surveys are
                                           conducted on a continuous basis,collecting information when a UK company acquires or disposes of a foreign company and similarly when
                                           a foreign company acquires or disposes of a UK company. Work is currently being undertaken to review the register sources used for the
                                           survey to ensure completeness. In particular, Dun and Bradstreet’s “WorldBase” information has been used to give a better estimate of the
                                           population of companies with foreign links. For both populations, in order to maximise the survey coverage of foreign direct investment
                                           assets, all groups in the top strata (containing the largest businesses) are sent questionnaires. However, in strata containing smaller
                                           businesses, only a proportion are selected. Additionally, the sample of smaller businesses is rotated to minimise burden on the respondents.

                                           institutional control. Thus, INE takes some steps to identify the foreign unit that actually exercises control over the affiliates in Portugal,

                                            and CIS information, has been completed by the addition of information from an external source (Dun & Bradstreet database), providing
                                            a better insight into the total share of foreign enterprises in the Netherlands. In addition, a redesign of the Social Statistical Database
                                            in that year has resulted in a better match of the key indicators on employment, via the unique enterprise identifier (BEID), with the
                                            concurrent economic indicators. These improvements mean that the locus of control can now be established for over 90 percent of the total
                                            population of enterprises (with registered jobs in the Social Statistical Database) in the Netherlands. A weighting procedure was developed

                                            SIFON register) and the balance of payments reporting are used. The Directorate of Taxes’ register of shareholders has been the main
                                            source for updating the SIFON register. The press and Internet etc. are also used to map new foreign-controlled enterprises in Norway,
                                            and to map the ultimate country of ownership.

B.3     Coverage of Foreign Ownership

Bearing all these caveats in mind, we proceed with the comparison of the data we compile
from Orbis-Amadeus to the data collected by the OECD in the AMNE, FAS, and FATS
databases. In our data comparison, we measure output by total turnover and we limit
ourselves to manufacturing because this 1-digit sector has been covered for the longest period
of time in the most OECD countries.

   For the OECD data, we take the multinational turnover data from the AFA and AMNE
databases, expressed in a single currency using the end-of-period exchange rates from Bloomberg,
divided by the total manufacturing turnover taken from the OECD STAN database.

   As said before, to stay as consistent as possible with the OECD data we identify the
companies in our Orbis-Amadeus database as foreign if 10 or more percent of their equity is
owned directly or, in case all direct owners are domestic over all years, ultimately by one or
several foreign entities. We compute the country’s foreign output share in our data as the
ratio of total output aggregated over all identified foreign firms to total output of all firms
in a given country.

   Table B.3.2 reports these ratios by country and year. We select all the OECD member-
states and Switzerland, but the Swiss data is not available in AMNE-AFA databases. We
present the countries by groups, including Eurozone and non-Eurozone member states as of
2012 (Estonia became a member in 2011). Averages are simple means of ratios in columns
over all years. As seen, some countries have short time series in the OECD database, either
because of data privacy issues (such as Belgium or Ireland) or due to their later inclusion in
the OECD (such as Hungary, Latvia, Slovenia, or Slovakia).

   To facilitate the comparison of averages, Table B.3.3 reports country average shares, the
average by two groups, and the overall average in a balanced sample of countries that report
the data to the OECD in every year over the 2003–2012 period.

   Both tables show that foreign activity makes up at most 40 percent of the total activity
on average. The averages mask a lot of cross-country heterogeneity, however. In many
larger European economies, the average share of foreign sales is much smaller than the
group averages, being around 20 percent in Germany, France, or Italy, or 30–40 percent


                                              58
in Spain, the UK, and Sweden. Interestingly, some advanced economies with well-known
MNCs, such as Denmark or Finland, have average shares of around 20 percent. In other
countries the average share is larger than the group averages; OFCs such as Luxembourg, and
emerging markets Czech Republic, Estonia, Slovak Republic, Hungary, and Poland all have
multinational sales amounting to more than half of total manufacturing sales. Table B.3.2
also makes it clear that OFCs, such as Ireland, Luxembourg, or the Netherlands display the
largest differences between our data and the OECD data. This is not surprising, because
our data exclude this type of financial FDI.

   Table B.3.1 shows the foreign affiliate turnover as a share of total turnover in total
economy (all sectors) for the firms covered by our data, both for non-Eurozone and Eurozone
countries. Each cell is the ratio of the value of total output produced by our firms, which
have at least 10 percent foreign ownership, relative to the value of total output produced
by all firms with non-missing data in Orbis in the corresponding year and country. Some
countries report data as early as the late 1980s, but the coverage in earlier years is poor.
To keep the sample consistent with the following exercise, comparing coverage of Orbis with
the OECD data, we limit ourselves to the 1999–2012 period.

   Table B.3.1 shows the variation in multinational activity over time and across countries.
In larger advanced economies, such as Germany, France, and Italy, the turnover share of
foreign owned firms is in the range of 15-25 percent (and less in some years). Some countries
have low shares below 10, as in Malta, Bosnia, and Belarus, while other have larger shares
close to or exceeding 40 percent, as in Belgium, Estonia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and
Slovakia. Generally, smaller economies and emerging markets in Eastern Europe have larger
multinational presence at around 30 percent or more. Some of these, such as Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Cyprus, and the Netherlands, are offshore financial centers (OFC), known for
large round-tripping of foreign investment or regulatory/tax regimes favoring multinational
affiliation. According to the recognized definition, OFC is a center which provides some or
all of the following services: low or zero taxation; moderate or light financial regulation;
banking secrecy and anonymity (Aykut et al., 2017).

   There is sizable time variation in foreign activity for some economies. In Iceland, turnover
designated as “foreign” jumped to 71 percent of total turnover in 2005 only to collapse to



                                               59
5 percent in 2009, after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) of 2008-09. Such volatility is
not common, although Cyprus displays a similar pattern. In general, however, more stable
economies with less questionable data quality have fairly stable shares of foreign activity
over time, resembling the time averages. In almost all economies, the multinational sales
share declined following the GFC from the peak in the mid-2000s. All in all, the patterns of
the foreign turnover across countries reassure the reliability of our data.

     Notes: The figure reports sales of foreign affiliates in the total economy as percentage of total sales as reported by Orbis database
     (long-dashed line with squares), sales of foreign affiliates in manufacturing as percentage of total manufacturing sales as reported
     by Orbis database (dashed line with circles) and the OECD’s AFA and AMNE database (solid line with diamonds). In every year,
     we first aggregate the sales of multinationals in monetary terms across all sample countries and divide by the total sales in these
     countries. With Orbis data we compute the multinational activity from the turnover of firms with 10 or more percent foreign
     ownership stake and divide by the total turnover across all Orbis firms (in the total economy and in the manufacturing sector,
     correspondingly) in our sample countries. Foreign multinational activity from the OECD data is the sum of the multinational
     turnover in manufacturing reported by the AFA and AMNE databases of the OECD divided by the total manufacturing turnover
     in these countries from the OECD STAN database. The sample is balanced with the data for all countries available in all
     years 2003-2012. The countries include the following Eurozone countries: Austria, Germany, Estonia, Finland, France, Italy,
     Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, and Spain and the following non-Eurozone countries Czech
     Republic, Denmark, the UK, Hungary, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Belgium, Ireland, Switzerland and Latvia are eliminated
     due to short or missing OECD data (see Table B.3.2)
C        Aggregate Comparison

C.1       Eurostat Data for Aggregate Economic Activity

Eurostat provides data on main economic indicators as well as some additional variables for
all EU member states, Norway, Switzerland, and some candidate and potential candidate
countries. The data is collected either by national statistical agencies via surveys or by
drawing on business registers and/or other administrative sources. Eurostat has multiple
sub-databases categorized according to different themes. To serve for our purpose, we focus
on the following two: Structural Business Statistics (SBS) and Business Demography (BD).
Both databases cover variables related to business demography, while their scope differs
in some aspects. So, before presenting the details on our comparison exercises, we firstly
describe basic characteristics of these two databases and then explain how we utilize them
in turn to compare the Eurostat data with our data obtained from Orbis-Amadeus.

      Starting in 1995, the SBS data provides information that describes the structure, con-
duct, and performance of economic activities at a very fine level of detail (several hundred
economic sectors).47 The SBS coverage was limited to Sections C to K of NACE Rev. 1.1
until 2007. Starting from the reference year 2008, the data is available for sectors B to N and
sub-sector S95 of NACE Rev. 2 classification. Some of these sectors, such as NACE Rev. 2
sector K and NACE Rev. 1.1. sector J are only partially covered with data for insurance
services, credit institutions, and pension funds but not all financial intermediation activities.

      The main variables in the SBS data are business demographic variables (e.g., number of
enterprises), “output related” variables (e.g., turnover, value added), “input related” vari-
ables such as labor input (e.g. employment, hours worked), goods and services input (e.g.,
total purchases), and capital input (e.g., material investments). This information is avail-
able for different size categories. Among all, we use “TOTAL,” “0-19 employees,” “20-249
employees,” and “250+ employees” for our purpose.

      In 1997, the BD data started to collect variables mostly related to the demography of
the business population.48 The BD data is not as detailed in terms of variables as SBS data,
 47
      See http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/cache/metadata/en/sbs esms.htm for a detailed description.

                                                    65
which enables it to cover a larger number of sectors. Starting with the reference year 2008,
the BD data covers NACE Rev. 2 sections B to N (excluding activities of holding companies,
K64.2). Data for sections P, Q, R and S are provided on a voluntary basis. NACE Rev. 1.1
was used up to the reference year 2007 covering the data for sections C to K (excluding
activities of holding companies-K74.15). Sectors M, N, and O were reported on a voluntary
basis and, therefore, not available for all countries.

   The main indicators of the BD data category include population of active enterprises,
number of enterprise births, number of enterprise survivals up to five year, number of en-
terprise deaths, related variables on employment, derived indicators such as birth rates,
death rates, survival rates and employment shares, and an additional set of indicators on
high-growth enterprises and “gazelles” (high-growth enterprises that are up to five years
old). This information is available for firms of different size and legal form. The three main
categories by size are All, Zero, 10+.

   As it is immediately seen, there are several differences between the BD data and the
SBS data, important for our purposes. The BD data counts only active enterprises. Unlike
the BD data, the SBS data counts both active and inactive companies. Moreover, the SBS
data provides the information for multiple firm size groups based on employment, whereas
the firm size categories are limited in the BD data. Another advantage of the SBS data
over the BD data is that the SBS data provides information on monetary values such as
turnover, wage bill, investment, etc., and all these variables are available for multiple firm
size categorizes. The BD data covers more sectors but contains less variables. In addition,
the BD data provides information separately for “Zero” firm size category that counts self-
employed workers. Having these differences in mind, if we do comparison based on number
of enterprises and employment for “Total” or “Zero” categories, we always use the BD data.
In case, we do comparison based on gross output, we always use the SBS data. For all other
cases where we do comparison for SMEs, we always use the SBS data. We cannot use the
BD data for comparisons based on employment for SMEs because, as mentioned above, the
BD data lacks employment information for SMEs. In what follows, we present the details of
the comparison of our data to statistics computed using Eurostat data.

C.2     Comparison of Orbis-Amadeus to Eurostat Data: Implemen-
        tation Details

There are structural differences between Orbis -Amadeus and Eurostat. Given this, we
follow some steps in order to make Eurostat data sets and our BvD data comparable before
conducting comparison exercises. The details on these steps are given in below:

  1. We identify Eurostat sectors based on NACE Rev. 2 classification because our Orbis-
      Amadeus data uses this classification (see step 6 in Section A.5.2). In order to do this,
      we go through the process of matching the industry classifications pre- and post-2008
      within each Eurostat data category. We first create a variable NACE1 in both Rev. 1.1.
      and Rev. 2 files. We then fill in the values of this variable by values of NACE Rev. 2
      codes based on our augmented BvD sector variable (NACEREV2CCODE) using the official
      NACE Rev. 2 Level 1 classification. For example, we replace NACE1 with C if it is
      coded as D in NACE Rev. 1.1. file. Then, we merge these two files by NACE1 for each
      country-year-company category (company category is based either on size and/or legal
      form). Thus, this common NACE1 variable in Orbis-Amadeus and Eurostat enables us
      to compare them based on any sector defined at NACE Rev. 2 Level 1 classification.

  2. We determine overlapping sectors across Orbis-Amadeus and Eurostat SBS data sets
      based on the NACE1 variable. While Orbis-Amadeus data, by construction, covers all
      sectors for a given country-year, Eurostat data provides information for the business
      economy with the exception of some sectors. Table C.2.2 lists the sectors with available
      information in Eurostat data sets. However, this list is differential based on the variable
      of interest. For example, the variable Turnover provided by Eurostat SBS data is not
      available for all sectors given in Table C.2.2. The availability of this variable differs
      across country-sector-year triplets, and this should be taken into account especially in
      total economy comparison exercises.

      To exemplify, Eurostat data sets provide information for the construction sector (NACE
      Rev. 2 sector F) between 1995–2012. However, according to Table C.2.3, Eurostat
      SBS data lacks information on gross-output for this sector in Belgium for the years
      2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. If we had disregarded such detail and had computed total


                                               67
  gross output over BvD Belgium firms for all overlapping sectors by just considering
  the correspondence given in Table C.2.2, we would have inflated the BvD aggregate
  for 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012. To put it differently, since BvD aggregates are used
  as numerators in the ratios we use to construct percentages, overlooking such details
  would produce artificial higher percentages. In order to avoid such mistakes, we instead
  follow the sector correspondence given in Table C.2.3, and construct the percentages
  accordingly. To be more exact, in case we compute the percentage based on gross
  output for Belgium in 2009, we aggregate gross-output over the sectors which have
  non-missing gross output in both Eurostat SBS and BvD data sets. We label those
  sectors with 1 in Table C.2.3.

3. As stated above, Eurostat SBS data provides information on economic activity (i.e.,
  gross-output and employment) for different size categories. Among all, we use “TO-
  TAL,” “0-19 employees,” “20-249 employees,” and “250+ employees” to compare size
  distribution for total economy and manufacturing sector. BvD provides firm-level in-
  formation on economic activity for all sectors of a given European country-size category
  in any year of interest, whereas Eurostat SBS data provides information on the corre-
  sponding measure in a given size category for selected sectors, which are labelled with
  1 in Table C.2.4. So, to make sure we do not create measurement error we construct a
  “hypothetical aggregate” economy based on aggregating the sectors where official data
  by size class is provided by the Eurostat. Doing this, we compare exact sectors, then
  compute the percentages in Table 2, accurately.

4. Eurostat BD data provides information on the main indicators for the categories of
  different firm size and legal form. Among the legal form categories, we are forced to use
  “Total” which refers to all firms with different legal forms assuming that BvD collects
  data from firms of all legal firms. We do not want to deal with legal firm issue since it
  is hard to identify the legal form information for each country in Orbis-Amadeus data
  given differential filing policy across countries (See Table A.6.1). Among the size cate-
  gories, we use “Total” and “Zero” to construct a new size category i.e. “AllminusZero”
  which refers to all firms excluding the self employed workers. This enables us to com-
  pare manufacturing employment of Orbis-Amadeus to that of Eurostat BD in the most


                                          68
       appropriate manner since BvD excludes self-employed workers by construction.

       Eurostat SBS data provides information only for different size categories. However, it
       doesn’t provide information under “Zero” size category, which forced us to use “Total”
       size category in all comparison exercises where Eurostat SBS data was used.

   5. In our comparison exercises, we use two main indicators to measure economic activity:
       employment and gross-output. Eurostat data provides multiple variables related to
       economic activity and the related variables are different in terms of definition. So, in
       order to precisely compare the coverage based on economic activity, we pick Eurostat
       variables that have close definitions with those of BvD data. To illustrate, in our com-
       parison exercises based on gross-output we use OPRE from BvD and V12110-Turnover
       from Eurostat SBS data. We express these financial variables in real dollars 2005 base
       using original values in Eurostat SBS data (see Step 2 in Chapter A.5.3). Additional
       correspondences as well as the variable definitions are given in Table C.2.1.

   6. In comparison exercises based on number of enterprises, we use either Eurostat SBS or
       Eurostat BD data. In case we used the BD data, we drop inactive companies checking
       the variable STATUS in our data because the BD data counts only active companies.49

   7. We construct two different samples using our BvD data and repeat our comparison
       exercised for each sample: Total Sample and TFP Sample. The Total Sample consists
       of firms that report data with positive values of the corresponding measure (i.e. em-
       ployment (EMPL) and gross output (OPRE)), whereas the TFP Sample consists of firms
       that report positive values on employment (EMPL) or wage bill (STAF), and tangible
       fixed assets (TFAS), gross output (OPRE), materials (MATE).

   8. For a given company, Orbis-Amadeus provides financial statements regarding different
       consolidation codes i.e. C1, C2, U1 and U2.50 Given this fact, we first drop C2 accounts
  49
      If a given BvD company is read as “Inactive,” “Dissolved,” “In liquidation,” and “Bankruptcy,” we count
it as inactive.
   50
      C1: account of a company-headquarter of a group, aggregating all companies belonging to the group
(affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.), where the company headquarter has no unconsolidated account, C2: account of
a company-headquarter of a group, aggregating all companies belonging to the group (affiliates, subsidiaries,
etc.) where the company headquarter also presents an unconsolidated account, U1: account of a company
with no consolidated account, and U2: account of a company with a consolidated account.



                                                     69
         to avoid double accounting in our comparison exercises. For some specific cases, we
         further drop C1 accounts. To illustrate, in cases where we use the Total Sample, we
         drop C1 accounts for all countries except Spain and Italy. In the cases where we use
         the TFP Sample, we drop C1 accounts for all countries except Spain, Italy, Cyprus,
         Denmark, the UK, Greece, Ireland, and Lithuania.

   9. As a final step, we want to make sure percentages in our comparison exercises are not
         inflated by outliers. So, we check distributions of the underlying economic activity
         measure within a given country-sector-year triplet and winsorize data if neccessary.51

       We put Table C.2.1 as a guide for readers to help them follow the tables related to our
comparison exercises.




  51
    For space considerations, the list of the winsorized country-sector-year triplets as well as details on the
amount of winsorizing (which varies between 0.01% and 0.5%) are not reported here. All these details are
available upon request.

Notes: Table C.2.1 presents the details of the comparison exercises. The sectors are compared based
on NACE Rev. 2 Level 1 Classification (NACE1). In Tables D.2.1–D.2.2, total economy in the reference
country-year corresponds to all common available sectors with Eurostat BD and SBS data, respectively.
The definitions of the variables are as follows: OPRE: Total operating revenues (Net sales + Other oper-
ating revenues+ Stock variations). The figures do not include VAT. Local differences may occur regarding
excises taxes and similar obligatory payments for specific market of tobacco and alcoholic beverage indus-
tries; EMPL: Total number of employees included in the company’s payroll, V16910: Number of persons
employed in the population of active enterprises in t, V13310: Personnel costs are defined as the total re-
muneration, in cash or in kind, payable by an employer to an employee (regular and temporary employees, as
well as home-workers) in return for work done by the latter during the reference period, V12110: Turnover
comprises the totals invoiced by the observation unit during the reference period, and this corresponds to the
total value of market sales of goods and services to third parties, V16110: Number of persons employed. In
BvD data, for the construction of the TFP sample, we also used the variables STAF, TFAS, and MATE.
STAF: All the employees costs of the company (including pension costs), TFAS: Book value of tangible
fixed assets i.e. plant, equipment and machinery, and MATE: Material Costs.

     Notes: Table C.2.2 presents sector coverage for the SBS data and the BD data, respectively. Sectors are defined according to NACE Rev. 2
     Level 1 classification. We label sector-period pairs with 1 if they report non-missing information in any data category, 0 otherwise. In the
     SBS data, sectors K and S are partially covered that the first provides information only for insurance services, credit institutions, and pension
     funds; the latter provides information only for repair of computers and personal and household goods (S95) starting from 2008. In the BD
     data, the information from sectors P, Q, R, and S are provided on a voluntary basis, and Sector K64.2 (activities of holding companies) is
     excluded.

     Notes: Table C.2.4 presents sector coverage of the Eurostat countries based on the SBS data. The SBS data provides information on
     economic activity by size class for only a subset of sectors in the economy. In this table, we label country-sector pairs with 1 if they provide
     non-missing information by size class in 2006 for the corresponding measure (gross output or employment), 0 otherwise. Sectors are defined
     according to NACE Rev. 2 Level 1 classification. We use this table as reference for total economy comparisons, presented in Table 2. The
     country codes reported are as follows: AT (Austria), BE (Belgium), BG (Bulgaria), CZ (Czech Republic), DE (Germany), DK (Denmark),
     EE (Estonia), ES (Spain), FI (Finland), FR (France), GB (United Kingdom), GR (Greece), HR (Croatia), HU (Hungary), IE (Ireland), IT
     (Italy), LT (Lithuania), LU (Luxembourg), LV (Latvia), NL (Netherlands), NO (Norway), PL (Poland), PT (Portugal), RO (Romania), SE
     (Sweden), SI (Slovenia), and SK (Slovakia).

D.1       Detailed Statistics for the Manufacturing Sector

Tables D.1.1 & D.1.4 show how much of the official gross output and employment data from
Eurostat we cover in our data for the manufacturing sector in the EU countries. We show
these tables in two different samples: the Total Sample and the TFP Sample. The Total
Sample consists of firms that report data for the variables employment (EMPL) or wage bill
(STAF) and gross-output (OPRE), and TFP sample consists of firms that in addition report
data on tangible fixed assets (TFAS) and materials (MATE) so that researchers can calculate
total factor productivity for these firms.

    The table clearly shows that the coverage improves over time for all countries until 2005
and is stable thereafter. In the case of Germany, on average, we observe worse coverage than
in other countries which is explained by the under-representation of small firms in Germany.
Only recently, EU harmonization laws made reporting by small firms compulsory also in
Germany. There are other countries (Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, if we were to use
employment, and also Latvia, Luxembourg, for the data needed for TFP calculation), with
problems similar to Germany, but overall we cover 70-80 percent of the real economy in man-
ufacturing in the bulk of European countries. Denmark and the UK perform worse in the
TFP sample, because firms do not report materials use in these countries. Missing percent-
ages appear in some country-years because there is no data available for the corresponding
measure in Eurostat for the manufacturing sector.

    Table D.1.5 reports the firm size distribution in the manufacturing sector. In the table,
each panel presents the share of economic activity (gross-output and employment) accounted
for by firms belonging in three size categories in a randomly picked year 2006. In each panel,
the first three rows report the measures from Orbis-Amadeus and the next three are the
corresponding numbers from Eurostat SBS data. Each column is a different country. Row
entries denote the fraction of total economic activity accounted for by firms belonging to each
size class. As for the total economy in terms of number of firms, we match well the official
statistics in terms of the size distribution of economic activity undertaken in manufacturing
sector.

     Notes: Table D.1.5 presents the share of economic activity (gross output and employment). We pick 2006. In each panel, the first three
     rows report the measures from Orbis-Amadeus for “Total Sample,” which consists of firms that report data with positive values of the
     corresponding measure, the next three rows are same numbers from Eurostat’s SBS data. Row entries denote the fraction of total economic
     activity accounted for by firms belonging to each size class. Each column is a different country. The country codes within these classifications
     are as follows: AT (Austria), BE (Belgium), BG (Bulgaria), CZ (Czech Republic), DE (Germany), DK (Denmark), EE (Estonia), ES (Spain),
     FI (Finland), FR (France), GB (United Kingdom), GR (Greece), HR (Croatia), HU (Hungary), IE (Ireland), IT (Italy), LT (Lithuania), LU
     (Luxembourg), LV (Latvia), NL (Netherlands), NO (Norway), PL (Poland), PT (Portugal), RO (Romania), SE (Sweden), SI (Slovenia), and
     SK (Slovakia). Row entries in Eurostat-SBS are empty due to missing output/employment data for size classifications of our interest.
D.2       Alternative Data Sets and Their Coverage

An alternative data set, CompNet, has recently been developed by the European Central
Bank (ECB), covering selected European countries. CompNet is a sector-level database
constructed by the ECB from similar sources as Orbis, working with the national central
banks. Although it is based on firm-level data taken from business registries, CompNet
reports aggregates by sector and country and does not provide the underlying firm-level
data set.

      Because there are no the firm-level data in CompNet, we cannot sum up the output of
firms ourselves. Consequently, the comparison below is based on the number of firms and
relative to the “best” (official) Eurostat data.

      Tables D.2.1–D.2.2 show these statistics. Table D.2.1 shows the firm coverage of CompNet
database and our database constructed from Orbis data relative to Eurostat, with respect to
the number of firms in each country-year. We define the total economy as the overlapping
sectors of our data with the Eurostat data. Each cell corresponds to the number of firms
in the total economy from the relevant data source, relative to the number of firms given
by Eurostat. Although this type of comparison is less informative, because many firms in
Eurostat have zero employment (self-employed), we show it in order to be able to compare our
data to the alternative sector-level database CompNet. Neither our database, nor CompNet,
includes self-employed and hence a comparison based solely on the number of firms might
be misleading. In spite of this caveat, our data captures the number of firms in the total
economy well.

      Table D.2.2 may be a more relevant comparison if one worries about “representativeness.”
The table shows the size and sector distribution of firms in CompNet and BvD, compared to
the Eurostat data.52 Each cell corresponds to the share of the indicated category’s number
of firms in the total economy from the relevant data source for the given country-year (%).
For example, in Belgium, 88.9 percent of firms have less than 10 employees in our data
and CompNet, whereas the official number from Eurostat is 96 percent. According to this
table, our number of firms in terms of employment are very close to what is reported by
Eurostat. In terms of sectors; based on our data for Belgium, 13.3 percent of the firms in
 52
      CompNet and Eurostat numbers come from Tables 6 and 7 of Force (2014).

    We pick these countries for comparison because only these countries’ statistics are reported in Tables
6 and 7 of Force (2014). Notice that Tables 6 and 7 of Force (2014) also report coverage numbers on
Amadeus/Orbis , but their numbers are clearly different from our numbers reported here, indicating worse
coverage. We suspect that this is an artifact of the way the Amadeus/Orbis data was put together by the
authors of the Force (2014). As we detail in the current paper, for the best coverage a certain procedure has
to be followed.

D.3     Treatment of Various Account Types

In our merged data set, multiple accounts of different types within a given financial year
are available for the same company (the same BvD ID Number). We tag those accounts
as “duplicate accounts.” The number of firm-year observations with duplicate accounts is
607,839, constituting 0.24% of total observations in our merged data set. Such duplicate
accounts arise for two reasons:

  1. A company reports two accounts with the same BvD ID Number and different consol-
      idation codes and the different values of financial and real variables for each consolida-
      tion code. The example is the company Ford Otosan Inc. shown in Figure D.3.1. This
      situation emerges because companies may switch the type of statements they report
      over time and when we combine different vintages of Orbis (and Amadeus) we might
      have such different accounts co-exist even in the same year.

  2. A company reports two accounts with the same BvD ID Number and different consoli-
      dation codes but the same values of financial and real variables for either consolidation
      code.

   Whenever we need a unique company-year observation we make the following choices.
For Case 1, we give preference to unconsolidated accounts to avoid double-counting.

   To guide us in resolving duplicates in Case 2, Figure D.3.2 presents distribution of du-
plicates by account type, each bar corresponding to the share of a given combination of two
different accounts appearing in the same financial year. The highest fraction of duplicate ac-
counts in the same year is the combination of LF&U (62.52%) followed by C1&U1 (32.24%).
Figure D.3.3 represents the distribution of accounts by the length of time series, within the
pairs from Figure D.3.2. Within each combination, the upper bar shows the proportion of
years when the first account has the longer time series, the middle bar shows the proportion
of years when the second account has the longer time series, and the lowest bar the frequency
when both accounts in the combination have the same number of years. For example, 32.24%
of duplicate accounts corresponds to firm-year observations with the combination of C1&U1
(Figure D.3.2). According to Figure D.3.3, within this pair, C1 have the longest time series
in 87.2% of cases, U1 accounts have the longest time series in 9.61% cases, and in 3.19 % of

                                              91
cases they have the same time series. To resolve the duplicates in Case 2, we either retain the
accounts reporting the longer time series for a given company, or keep the unconsolidated
account if it is reported the same number of years as the other available account type. We
also check consolidation codes of duplicate accounts registered in “Historical Product” and
verify the accuracy of this procedure.

Notes: The diagram illustrates an example of how the real activities of a headquarter and its subsidiaries
are registered in BvD data. BvD registers the given firm in the sector to which largest portion of its revenue
belongs to. The sector codes are classified according to NACE Revision 2, 4–digit Core Codes: 2910:
Manufacture of Motor Vehicles; 4930: Retail sale of automotive fuel in specialised stores; 4971: Wholesale
of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels and related products (4971); 0710: Mining of iron ores; 2751: Manufacture
of electronic domestic appliances; 2611: Manufacture of electronic components; 2825: Manufacture of non-
domestic cooling and ventilation equipment. The account types are as follows: C1–account of a company-
headquarter of a group, aggregating all companies belonging to the group (affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.), where
the company headquarter has no unconsolidated account; U1–account of a company with no consolidated
account. In this example, Ford Otosan Inc. reports both U1 and C1 accounts in our merged dataset because
these accounts come from different vintages, therefore we drop C1 account to avoid from double-counting.

Notes: The figure represents distribution of duplicates by account type. In the figure, each bar corresponds
to the share of a given combination of two different accounts appearing in the same financial year. BvD
reports firm-level accounts in five types: C1: account of a company-headquarter of a group, aggregating all
companies belonging to the group (affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.), where the company headquarter has no un-
consolidated account, C2: account of a company-headquarter of a group, aggregating all companies belonging
to the group (affiliates, subsidiaries, etc.) where the company headquarter also presents an unconsolidated
account, U1: account of a company with no consolidated account, and U2: account of a company with a
consolidated account. LF: accounts with financial information. For the firms with missing consolidation
code, we derive 1–letter consolidation codes from the BvD account number and fill consolidation codes with
either U or C.

D.4        Extra Material on Market Concentration

In this appendix we demonstrate that using the OECD STAN data to normalize the market
shares of the largest firms delivers the same pattern of concentration as when we normalize
by our Orbis data, provided we compute shares at 1-digit level as in the OECD STAN data
using a subset of sectors and countries covered in the OECD STAN data. There are at least
three differences from the baseline analysis based on solely our Orbis data as presented in
the main text.

       First, the OECD STAN data follows ISIC Revision 4 to disaggregate real variables at
2–digit and 1–digit industry levels. The OECD STAN data provides 2–digit industry level
for the entire economy, the list of countries with non-missing data is relatively limited tough.
The OECD STAN data lacks 2–digit industry level data for Bulgaria, Croatia, Estonia, Great
Britain, Greece, Latvia, Luxembourg, Poland, Portugal, Slovak Republic, and Spain, which
is not acceptable for our purposes. Therefore, we compare the market shares based on the
OECD STAN data and our Orbis data following 1–digit industry level; see Table D.4.1 for
the list of 1–digit industry codes.

       Second, even at 1–digit level, the OECD STAN data lacks information for Bulgaria and
Czech Republic, so we exclude them in the analysis.54

       Third, the OECD STAN data includes annual measures of output, value added and its
components, labour input, investment and capital stock. The OECD STAN data does not
report “Turnover,” which corresponds to actual operating revenues in the year. It reports
“Production” (Gross-Output) that represents the value of goods and/or services produced
in a year, whether sold or stocked. Hence it might be smaller than actual operating revenues
in a given period if all production is sold out with inventories from previous periods. In
constructing market shares based on the OECD STAN data, we make use of gross-output
instead of sales.

       Keeping these differences in mind, we compute country-sector-year output shares to rep-
resent industry concentration, that uses our Orbis data, but is defined at 1–digit level,
  54
    In our analysis, we focus on the sample of the OECD STAN countries that have non-missing information
on “Production” at 1–digit level. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, France,
Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Luxembourg, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovak
Republic, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.


                                                   95
comparable to the OECD STAN database. More specifically, we define measures of industry
concentration using the operating revenue market shares of the top 4 (hereafter, MS4) or
top 8 (hereafter, MS8) firms in a given 1–digit industry s1, country k, and year t relative
to the total sectoral output in the s1, k, t cell, which is reported by either our Orbis data
or the OECD STAN data. As explained in the main text, before constructing industry con-
centration measures, we categorize firms into two samples based on account type, available
in Orbis. “Sample 1 ” comprises firms reporting only one type of account (unconsolidated
(U) or consolidated (C)) in a given financial year, and “Sample 2 ” comprises firms reporting
both unconsolidated and consolidated accounts in a given financial year.

       In the following notation, the first argument in parenthesis defines the account type we
use and the second argument denotes the sample of firms we aggregate from, and we omit
the subscript s1, k, t for brevity:


   • MS4(C,1) is based on consolidated accounts (C), using firms from sample 1 that report
         only consolidated accounts. For this measure, the population of all firms is used in
         the denominator of market shares, so the denominator equals the aggregated output
         reported by all firms from sample 1 and sample 2 after consolidated accounts from
         sample 2 are excluded to avoid double counting.55

   • MS4(C,1)STAN is based on consolidated accounts (C), using firms from sample 1 that
         report only consolidated accounts. For this measure, sectoral gross output reported by
         the OECD STAN database is used in the denominator.56


       Figure D.4.1 reports the GDP-weighted average market concentration for manufacturing
and services using these measures. Upper row (Panel A1 and Panel A2) compares the shares
of top firms in the manufacturing sector, the bottom row (Panel B1 and Panel B2) depicts
the shares in the services sector. In each row, the diagram on the left is based on the

                                     P
      Numerically, the MS4(C,1) =          yi/Y where firm set F includes top 4 firms reporting consolidated
                                       i∈F
accounts from sample 1 in a given s1, k, t cell, yi is firm-level revenue, and Y is aggregated output of all
firms in s1, k, t from sample 1 and sample 2 after consolidated accounts from sample 2 are excluded. Market
share of the top 8 firms is computed similarly.

      Numerically, the MS4(C,1)       =          yi/Y STAN where firm set F includes top 4 firms reporting con-

solidated accounts from sample 1 in a given s1, k, t cell, yi is firm-level revenue, and Y STAN is gross output
of s1, k, t as reported by the OECD STAN database. Market share of the top 8 firms is computed similarly.

normalization by aggregated firm revenue from our Orbis data, and on the right is based on
the normalization by sectoral gross output from the OECD STAN data. Except for some
disagreement in initial year, the patterns are very similar that gives us comfort about the
quality of our data. Of note, the patterns which emerge when we aggregate to 1–digit sector
level are fully consistent with those reported in the main text, based on more granular 2–digit
sector shares. In particular, there is an increasing trend for concentration for manufacturing
sector.

Notes: The figure plots market concentration measures for the manufacturing industry and the services
industry. The services industry is defined as “non-financial market services,” including “accommodation
and food services,” “information and communication,” “real estate activities,” “professional, scientific and
technical activities,” and “administrative and support services activities.” We measure country-sector-year
market concentration by the market share of largest eight foreign (domestic) firms in terms of firm-level
operating revenue from our Orbis dataset in the given country-sector-year, relative to the overall country-
sector-year output. The output of the largest firms is determined from the subset of companies reporting
only consolidated financial statements, drawn from sample 1. Under “Orbis normalization”, the output
of the largest firms is normalized by aggregated firm revenue from our Orbis data, and under “STAN
normalization”, it is normalized by sectoral gross output from the OECD STAN data. In all graphs, we
plot “EU-weighted” average shares over the period 1999–2012, using a given country’s GDP weight in total
sample, in the corresponding year.
