Using more than 50,000 firm-years from 1988 to 2015, we show that the empirical relation
between a firm’s Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is systematically negative. When we
restrict our sample to larger firms as in the prior literature, our findings are consistent with the
literature, showing that there is an increasing and concave relation between q and managerial
ownership. We show that these seemingly contradictory results are explained by cumulative past
performance and liquidity. Better performing firms have more liquid equity, which enables
insiders to more easily sell shares after the IPO, and they also have a higher Tobin’s q.

1. Introduction

    A well-known result in empirical corporate finance is that firm value is positively correlated with

managerial ownership over some range of ownership and then, beyond that range, becomes negatively

correlated. Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988, MSV from hereon) is the first paper to document this

relation for a sample of Fortune 500 firms and is one of the most highly cited papers in corporate

finance. Subsequently, McConnell and Servaes (1990) show evidence supporting a concave relation for

a broader sample. Several theory papers model the tension between managerial ownership and

incentives and predict such a concave relation (e.g., Stulz (1988) or Harris and Raviv (1988)). Though

the subsequent literature generally finds that the relation between firm value and managerial ownership

is upward-sloping over some range (additional evidence is provided by, e.g., Holderness, Kroszner and

Sheehan (1999), McConnell, Servaes, and Lins (2008), or Li, Sun, and Yannelis (2017)), it has been

debated extensively whether the relation can be interpreted causally (see, for instance, Demsetz (1983),

Demsetz and Lehn (1985), Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999), Demsetz and Villalonga (2001),

Zhou (2001), and Coles, Lemmon, and Meschke (2012)).

    In this paper, we build the largest database of managerial ownership information ever used in the

literature. While the samples in existing studies are tilted towards large firms and have data for few

years, we have much broader coverage from 1988 to 2015 as we have data for more than 1,800 firms

(after excluding utilities, financial firms, and dual class firms) per year on average. With our sample,

we find strong and robust evidence that the relation between firm value and managerial ownership is

negative rather than positive and thus opposite to theoretical predictions and prior empirical findings.

Yet, when we restrict our sample to the subset of larger firms similar to the samples used by McConnell

and Servaes (1990) or MSV, we recover their findings of a positive relationship between value and

managerial ownership over some range of ownership.

    Our investigation of the consistently negative relation between firm value and managerial

ownership leads to a straightforward explanation. Managers own more shares at the IPO than they

typically want to own over time. As a result, they want to decrease their ownership, but face frictions in


                                                     1
doing so. If a firm’s stock is illiquid, it takes time to sell large stakes and doing so may be expensive.

Managers may not even be able to sell under conditions that are acceptable to them. As a consequence,

the level of managerial ownership of a firm depends on its past history. If the firm’s stock is highly

liquid quickly after the IPO, managers decrease their ownership so that the firm eventually has low

managerial ownership. The firms whose stock is liquid are typically successful firms, which mean firms

with a high Tobin’s q. Hence high q firms tend to have low managerial ownership. Conversely, firms

with high managerial ownership are firms whose stock has lacked liquidity. Such firms are firms that

have not been consistently successful, and therefore end up with high managerial ownership and low q.

With this theory, the relation between managerial ownership and Tobin’s q is the outcome of the past

history of the firm. This mechanism also explains why the results in the literature hold for highly liquid

large firms, but not for other firms: it is because frictions in the adjustment of managerial ownership are

not relevant for large liquid firms.

    Our theory predicts that the relation between managerial ownership and Tobin’s q depends on the

evolution of stock liquidity. Firms with a history of greater stock liquidity should not have a negative

relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership. We split the sample between firms that have

high past stock liquidity and firms that have low past stock liquidity. We find strong evidence that the

firms with high past liquidity have a relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership that is

consistent with McConnell and Servaes (1990), while firms with low past liquidity exhibit a strong

negative relation between firm value and managerial ownership. We use two different measures of

liquidity throughout. The first one is the measure of Amihud (2002) and the second one is the measure

developed by Fong, Holden and Trzcinka (2017) (FHT thereafter). The results for firms with a history

of low liquidity are very strong irrespective of the estimation method and irrespective of the liquidity

measure.

    A direct test of our theory that the relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership reflects

past history is to regress Tobin’s q on the change in managerial ownership since the IPO or first

available ownership observation. Our prediction is that firms whose managerial ownership fell more


                                                      2
have a higher Tobin’s q. These are successful firms whose managers were able to sell shares easily

because their stock had been liquid for a number of years. We find strong evidence that Tobin’s q is

positively related to the drop in managerial ownership since the IPO.

    With our theory, managerial ownership should be decreasing in past stock liquidity. We find strong

evidence that a firm’s current managerial ownership is a decreasing function of the number of years the

firm has had with high stock liquidity, which are years in which managers could have decreased their

ownership at lower cost. The evidence holds for both the Amihud and FHT liquidity measure.

    We go further towards a causal interpretation of the relation between managerial ownership and

liquidity by using two exogenous shocks that improved liquidity. Such shocks should lead to a decrease

in managerial ownership if our explanation for the negative relation is correct. We first use the major

Nasdaq reforms in the late 1990s as a shock to liquidity (see, for instance, Barclay et al. (1999)).

Although the NYSE and Amex were also impacted by some of these reforms, Nasdaq experienced a

greater improvement in execution costs (e.g., Bessembinder (1999)). We estimate a difference-in-

differences regression around the Nasdaq reforms to study the impact of liquidity on managerial

ownership and find clear evidence that managerial ownership decreases as a result of the shock to

liquidity. The introduction of decimalization, which affected large firms with small spreads but not

smaller listed companies, provides a second shock to liquidity (e.g., Bessembinder (2003), Furfine

(2003)).1 We again find that firms whose liquidity increased relatively more experienced greater drops

in their managerial ownership.

    Our explanation for the negative relation between managerial ownership and Tobin’s q is that

higher liquidity decreases managerial ownership and that some of the forces that lead to higher liquidity

increase Tobin’s q as well. 2 In particular, better operating performance generally improves both

liquidity and Tobin’s q. We find strong support for the hypothesis that a stock is more liquid if its

  The introduction of decimalization as a shock to liquidity has been used in a variety of corporate finance settings
(see, Fang, Noe and Tice (2009), Bharath, Jayaraman, and Nagar (2013), Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2013), Fang,
Tian, and Tice (2014) and Norli, Ostergaard, and Schindele (2015)).
2
  Fang, Noe, and Tice (2009) show that Tobin’s q is related to concurrent liquidity. We argue that it is not only
concurrent liquidity but also the entire history of liquidity that is important.
                                                           3
cumulative past performance is better. The results hold when performance is measured by sales growth

or ROA. We then show that Tobin’s q is also higher for firms with greater past performance. Overall,

our evidence suggests that theories of firm value and managerial ownership should take into account

frictions that impede adjustments in managerial ownership.

    The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we present our dataset. We show in Section 3 that the

relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is opposite for our whole sample from what

MSV or McConnell and Servaes (1990) found, but is similar to theirs for the subset of the largest

stocks. We also demonstrate that our main results are robust to a variety of different estimation

methods. In Section 4, we develop hypotheses, based on the impact of liquidity on managerial

ownership, which could explain the results uncovered in Section 3. We then show in Section 5 that the

relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership indeed depends on a firm’s liquidity history. In

Section 6, we find that Tobin’s q is strongly positively related to the drop in managerial ownership

since the IPO. In Section 7, we provide evidence that managerial ownership is negatively related to a

stock’s liquidity history. We then confirm in Section 8 that both liquidity and Tobin’s q increase with

past performance. We conclude in Section 9.



2. Data and summary statistics

    We start by describing how we construct our dataset of managerial ownership. Section 16(a) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires directors, executive officers, and persons who own more than

10% of a company’s common stock to file reports of their ownership and changes in ownership with

the SEC. Companies derive from these data a table with an annual snapshot of stock ownership

information of all directors and officers that they report in their proxy statements. The table includes

all vested stock as well as shares of common stock that can be acquired within 60 days of the reporting

date through options or vesting stock awards. Our data source is this director and officer ownership

table from corporate proxy statements. For simplicity, and to be consistent with the prior literature, we

use the term ‘managerial ownership’ for the vested (or soon vesting) equity ownership of officers and


                                                    4
directors. Our managerial ownership data definition is the same as the one used in, e.g., Himmelberg,

Hubbard, and Palia (1999), Holderness, Kroszner, and Sheehan (1999), Helwege, Pirinsky, and Stulz

(2007), or Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009). We then define in Section 2.2 our measures of firm value, past

liquidity and past performance. Lastly, we provide summary statistics for our panel in Section 2.3.



2.1. Ownership data

    We use data on managerial ownership from the 1988 to the 2016 proxy season. We start with the

data set used earlier in Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009), collected from Compact Disclosure for the period

1988-2003. For the period 2004-2016, we download and parse all proxy materials and information

statements from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) EDGAR (Electronic Data

Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system) website. 3 We identify patterns in the beneficial ownership

section disclosure that allow us to use regular expressions to capture the director and officer ownership

percentage. 4 We keep one filing per firm in each calendar year, which leaves us with 64,093 firm-year

observations over 2004-2016. Our primary source of data is the SEC’s form DEF 14A (definitive proxy

statement). Out of 74,249 DEF 14A forms parsed over 2004-2016, we are able to obtain the D&O

ownership percentage for 52,953 of them which corresponds to a 71% success rate. We obtain the

remaining 11,140 D&O ownership firm-year observations from proxy materials and information

statements other than form DEF 14A. Of these, 5,060 firm-year observations are from form PRE 14A

(preliminary proxy statement).

    Our algorithm is able to extract the D&O ownership percentages for approximately 3,900-5,200

unique firms each year. When we verify the accuracy of our data for a subsample for which

commercially available data (Corporate Library) exists, we find a correlation of 0.98 between our

ownership measure and the hand-collected measure of the Corporate Library, on a sample of

approximately 24,000 common observations. There are approximately 3,300 firm-year observations for

3
  We use the aggregate term “proxy statements” for a set of proxy materials and information statements that we
list and describe in the Appendix.
4
  We design a total of 66 non-redundant regular expressions. One example of a very common formulation is: “All
Executive Officers and Directors as a Group”.
                                                       5
which we have data on D&O ownership from the Corporate Library database, but for which we were

not able to extract information from SEC filings. Manual inspection suggests that non-standard

ownership reporting in proxy statements explains our inability to find these observations. We use the

Corporate Library observations to complete the time-series of D&O ownership data obtained from our

algorithm. We also apply our algorithm to SEC filings S-1 and S-1/A that allow us to extract pre-IPO

D&O ownership.

    As is common in the literature, we exclude dual class firms. We develop an algorithm for the

identification of dual class firms that we apply to companies' proxy statements. We identify 1,278 dual

class firms all of which we check by hand. We also crosscheck our list with the list of dual class firms

of Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010) for firms that our data sets have in common. A detailed

description of the parsing process and the dual class algorithm is provided in Appendix B.

    We then match our ownership data with stock return data from the Center for Research in Security

Prices (CRSP), and accounting data from Standard and Poor’s Compustat database. The managerial

ownership data are matched with Compustat data as of the closest fiscal-year-end date prior to the

proxy date. For determining the total number of shares outstanding from CRSP, we follow past studies

(e.g., Helwege, Pirinsky, and Stulz (2007) and Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009)) and use shares

outstanding in the month prior to the proxy date. We verify that the rule captures the most common lag

between record date and proxy date by developing an algorithm that extracts the record date from proxy

statements. The results of the (unreported) analysis warrant the use of our approach. We require firms

to have total assets greater than zero and to have a non-missing Central Index Key (CIK) identifier. We

remove utilities and financial firms, and eliminate observations with missing Compustat and CRSP

data. We also match the data to Jay Ritter's IPO database using CRSP's PERMNO identifier. Finally,

we merge the data with the Fama-French 49 industry classification obtained from Kenneth French’s

website. Our final sample contains 56,903 firm-year observations for 8,049 unique firms over fiscal

years 1988-2015. Of the final 56,903 firm-year observations, 31,249 observations are from the data set




                                                    6
used earlier in Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009); 11,445 are from our algorithm; 13,131 are common to our

algorithm and the Corporate Library data; and 1,078 are uniquely from Corporate Library.



2.2. Firm value, past liquidity, and past performance variables

    We use Tobin’s q as a proxy for firm value. We follow Kaplan and Zingales (1997) and define

Tobin’s q as the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of assets, where the market value

of assets is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets and the market value of common stock less

the book value of common stock and deferred taxes. In the q regressions, we include the control

variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard and Palia (1999). Their controls are designed to capture cross-

sectional differences in the most important firm characteristics and also differences in growth options.

We include the ratio of R&D to sales, the ratio of capital expenditures to assets, and the ratio of

advertising to sales to control for growth opportunities.

    We consider two proxies for liquidity: (1) Amihud’s (2002) measure, and (2) Fong, Holden, and

Trzcinka’s (2017) FHT measure. Amihud’s (2002) illiquidity measure is calculated for each stock 𝑖𝑖 in

year 𝑦𝑦 from daily data. It is defined as

                                                  1      𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖   |𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 |
                             Amihud𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 =               ∑𝑡𝑡=1                ,                                 (1)
                                                 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖         𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖


where 𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the number of days for which data are available for stock 𝑖𝑖 in year 𝑦𝑦, 𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the return on

stock 𝑖𝑖 on day 𝑡𝑡, and 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝐷𝐷𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the respective daily dollar volume. Fong, Holden, and Trzcinka’s

(2017) illiquidity measure is calculated for each stock 𝑖𝑖 in year 𝑦𝑦 from daily data. It is defined as

                                                          1+𝑧𝑧
                             FHT𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 2𝜎𝜎𝑁𝑁 −1 �              �,                                              (2)
                                                           2

where 𝜎𝜎 is the return volatility, 𝑁𝑁 −1 () is the inverse function of the cumulative normal distribution, and

𝑧𝑧 is the empirically observed frequency of a zero return day. The empirically observed frequency of a

                                  𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍
zero return is computed as 𝑧𝑧 =          ,   where 𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍𝑍 is the number of zero returns days, and 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 is the total
                                   𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇

number of trading days (zero and non-zero returns days) in a given stock-year.




                                                                     7
    To identify firms that exhibit high (respectively low) liquidity, we classify stocks each year based

on our two proxies for liquidity. Because both measures reflect illiquidity, high values for the Amihud

and FHT measures correspond to low liquidity levels. Hence, for any given year, the liquidity of a

given stock is categorized as “high” if the value is in the bottom quartile of the respective illiquidity

measure relative to the entire CRSP universe of firms. We then compute how many years each firm has

experienced in a high liquidity state. Our ownership sample starts in 1988 but to compute these

measures of past liquidity, we go as far back as 1963, the start year of the daily CRSP file. 5 We

normalize the number of years in a high liquidity state by the number of years in CRSP. We create

liquidity subsamples by splitting the entire sample into quartiles based on the distribution of the

normalized measure of past liquidity across all years and firms. Firm-year observations are in the “high

liquidity” sample if they are in the top quartile of the normalized liquidity distribution, and firm-year

observations are in the “low liquidity” sample if the firm-year observation is in the bottom quartile of

the normalized liquidity distribution.

    We follow the same procedure for our measures of past performance. To identify firms that exhibit

good performance relative to the market as a whole, we classify stocks each year based on two

operating performance measures. Our main performance measure is sales growth, but we also report

results using return on assets (ROA). A given firm-year observation is categorized as “high

performance” if the value is in the top quartile relative to the entire CRSP-Compustat universe of firms

in a given year. We then count how many years each firm has experienced in a high performance state.

We again start the accumulation in 1963. We create a normalized measure of performance history by

dividing the number of years in a performance state by the number of years in the CRSP-Compustat

universe.

  The measure will be truncated for firms that have been listed earlier than 1963 and have been ranked in the
respective liquidity category. General Electric (GE) is an example of such a firm.

2.3. Summary statistics

    Table 1 provides summary statistics for the key variables used in the study. From 1988 to 2015, the

sample has at least 1,500 non-financial, non-utility, non-dual class firms each year. Overall, we have

managerial ownership data for more than 56,000 firm-years. The number of firms with complete

managerial ownership increases until the end of the 1990s/early 2000s and then declines until the end

of the sample. The pattern for the number of firms with complete managerial ownership data

corresponds to the trends in the overall number of listed firms in the United States documented by

Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz (2017). The average of managerial ownership across the early years (until

2002) is fairly stable over time at around 23% although the median ownership declines. After 2002,

average and median managerial ownership start to significantly decline. Figure 1, which displays the

mean and median managerial ownership, shows the decline separately for Nasdaq and for NYSE and

Amex firms. The decline is larger for Nasdaq firms, but both lines decrease substantially during the

sample. It is not clear though whether the decline in ownership is driven by trends in managerial

ownership or a change in the composition of listed firms. For example, Kahle and Stulz (2017) show

that during the last two decades, listed firms have become larger and older, and large and old firms

have on average lower managerial ownership.

    The average age of firms in the comprehensive sample of US firms of Kahle and Stulz (2017) is

12.2 years in 1995 and 18.4 years in 2015. The corresponding numbers in our sample are 13.8 years in

1995 and 19.2 years in 2015, suggesting that we collected data for a representative sample of U.S.

publicly listed firms. The average age of more than ten years since initial listing in our sample

guarantees that we have a large cross-sectional and time-series variation in the liquidity history which

we can exploit later. There are no obvious time trends in Tobin’s q, with a full sample average of 1.9

and median of 1.45.

    Table 1 also shows time-series statistics for the illiquidity measures. Both measures significantly

decline (i.e., liquidity increases) during our sample period. The correlation of the liquidity measures is

0.72, indicating that they capture some of the same components of liquidity. Since the fraction of days


                                                     9
with no trading plays a prominent role in the FHT measure, it is not surprising that this measure falls

sharply with decimalization of quotes across US exchanges in 2001. The impact of the financial crisis

of 2007/2009 on the liquidity measures is evident from Table 1 as well: illiquidity spiked during the

financial crisis.



3. Tobin’s q and managerial ownership: evidence from 1988 to 2015

    In this section, we document the correlation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership for our

sample and for a subset of large firms that maps closely the data examined by prior studies. We will be

agnostic about the ‘correct’ specification of this relation and show results for a simple linear

specification, a piecewise linear specification using the breakpoints of MSV, and the quadratic

specification of McConnell and Servaes (1990). 6



3.1. Empirical methodology

    It is problematic to estimate OLS pooled time-series and cross-sectional q regressions without

properly adjusting standard errors, because with q as the dependent variable, observations and error

terms are likely to be correlated both across years and across firms. Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010)

point out that in a cross-sectional regression of firm-level returns on exogenous characteristics, the error

terms are correlated, and since the numerator of q contains the market value of equity, q regressions

will also have some unknown cross-sectional dependence. Fama and MacBeth (1973) (FM) suggest to

handle such an unknown cross-sectional correlation structure by estimating a separate regression for

each cross-section, and then performing inference on the time-series mean and standard deviation of the

cross-sectional coefficients. The FM procedure was however developed to account for the correlation

between observations on different firms in the same year, not to account for the correlation between

observations on the same firm in different years (Petersen (2009)). To apply the FM procedure

6
 Researchers have pointed out that the breakpoints in MSV are to a certain extent arbitrary (Demsetz and
Villalonga (2001). The quadratic specification of McConnell and Servaes (1990) has been criticized because
ownership and ownership squared are highly correlated and collinearity may become an issue. Hence, we also
estimate a simple linear specification.
                                                       10
correctly, we must therefore adjust for time-series dependence in the estimated cross-sectional

coefficients. To do so, we estimate a first-order autoregressive model for each coefficient and then use

the estimated autoregression coefficients to adjust the FM standard errors (e.g., Fama and French

(2002) or Graham, Lemmon and Schallheim (1998)). 7

    Thompson (2011) and Petersen (2009) show, as an alternative, how one can compute standard

errors that allow for arbitrary correlations of error terms both between firms (within each cross-section)

and over time (for each firm). Thompson (2011) argues that double clustering is likely to be most

helpful in data sets with the following characteristics: the regression errors include significant firm and

time components, the regressors themselves include significant firm and time components, and the

number of firms and time periods is not too different. In our setting, regression errors likely include

significant time and firm components, regressors vary probably more by firm than by time, but we have

also far more firms than time periods. Petersen (2009) suggests that for datasets like ours, with a large

cross-section but a small number of observations per firm (only seven on average), having time

dummies and clustering by firm will yield almost identical results to double clustering. In robustness

tests, we confirm that double clustering makes little difference in our sample. We therefore include time

dummies and cluster standard errors by firm but not by time throughout our main specifications.



3.2. Results

    Table 2 shows the association between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership for our sample. Panel

A shows adjusted Fama-Macbeth regression results while Panel B features results from time-series /

cross-sectional OLS regressions.

    The first three columns of Panel A show the results for our entire sample of firms. In the linear

specification of Column 1, the effect of managerial ownership is persistently negative: The lower the

managerial ownership, the higher is firm value. The coefficient of -0.30 can be interpreted as follows:

7
  Petersen (2009) explains that these adjusted Fama-MacBeth standard errors do best when the firm effect dies off
fast enough and the researcher has a sufficient number of time periods per firm. In our sample, we have a long
time-series of annual coefficents (28 years); we do not have good empirical or theoretical predictions about how
quickly the firm effect decays.
                                                        11
an interquartile decrease in managerial ownership (from 0.30 to 0.04) is associated with an increase in

Tobin’s q of 0.078, or 4% relative to average q. The sign of the coefficient is thus opposite of what the

literature has persistently found and what agency theory would suggest (e.g., Jensen and Meckling

(1976)).

    Column 2 shows the coefficients of the piecewise linear specification of Morck, Shleifer, and

Vishny (1988). Here, we find that none of the managerial ownership coefficients is statistically

significantly positive, and that the coefficients on the managerial ownership interval between 0 and 5%

and from 5% to 25% are statistically significantly negative. The coefficient estimate of -1.74 (-0.73)

implies that moving from 5% managerial ownership to 0% (25% to 5%) ownership would increase firm

value by about 0.09 (0.15) units of Tobin’s q. We again find the somewhat surprising result of a robust

negative relation between firm value and managerial ownership. Finally, Column 3 shows the results of

the quadratic specification of McConnell and Servaes (1990). The coefficients on managerial

ownership and ownership squared are opposite to what the literature has documented (e.g. McConnell

and Servaes (1990); Holderness, Krozner, and Sheehan (1999)). The coefficient on managerial

ownership is negative and strongly significant, and the coefficient on managerial ownership squared is

positive and significant. The breakpoint implied by these coefficients is approximately 45.6%, and

given that the 90th percentile of managerial ownership is at 50%, the relation between firm value and

managerial ownership is downward sloping over most of the range of managerial ownership observed

in our data. Figure 2 draws the relation between q and managerial ownership implied by the estimates

of Columns 1 to 3. Figure 2 shows that for our sample that is much closer to a representative sample of

US public firms, the relation between firm value and managerial ownership is different from the

findings of the existing literature, no matter how we specify the relation between value and managerial

ownership.

    Columns 4 to 6 re-estimate the three specifications for the largest 500 firms by sales. MSV used the

Fortune 500 firms in their study. At the time, financial firms were markedly less important in the

Fortune 500 than they are now. Since we drop financial firms as well as dual-class firms from our


                                                    12
sample, a sample focused on the Fortune 500 firms has half the observations than a sample using the

500 largest firms by sales.      Not surprisingly, therefore, when we use the Fortune 500 firms (not

reported), most of our estimates are insignificant. In contrast, when we use the largest 500 firms, we

find results that are strongly consistent with the results in the earlier literature, namely that q increases

with managerial ownership for low values of managerial ownership and falls with high values of

managerial ownership. Column 4 shows that the coefficient on managerial ownership in the linear

specification is negative but statistically indistinguishable from zero. The piecewise linear specification

in Column 5 has positive and statistically significant coefficients for the managerial ownership ranges

from 0 to 5% and from 5% to 25%, and a negative and statistically significant coefficient for

managerial ownership over 25%. Finally, with the quadratic specification, q increases significantly with

managerial ownership and falls significantly with the square of managerial ownership. The breakpoint

implied by the quadratic specification is approximately 25% so that for managerial ownership levels

larger than 25%, further increases in managerial ownership are associated with decreases in firm value.

Figure 3 displays the implied relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership based on the

coefficient estimates for 500 largest firms from Table 2. The figure conforms to the finding in the

literature of a curvilinear relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership.

    Panel B shows results from OLS regressions. The coefficients are of similar magnitude and the

economic interpretation is very similar to the results of Panel A for all firms and for the largest 500

firms, but statistical significance is weaker for the largest 500 firms.



3.3. Robustness

    Table 3 contains additional regressions to support the main conclusion from our analysis in Table 2

that Tobin’s q correlates negatively with managerial ownership for a large sample of firms. In Column

1, we reproduce the results from Table 2, Panel B, Column 3 for ease of comparison. In Column 2, we

cluster standard errors by firm and year and show that double-clustering makes almost no difference in

our sample, in line with the prediction of Petersen (2009). In Column 3, we add industry x time fixed


                                                      13
effects to the regression in Column 1 and show that allowing industry effects to vary by year has

virtually no impact on our conclusions.

    Researchers have argued that empirical estimates of q are noisy measures of the true q (e.g.,

Erickson and Whited (2006), Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2009), Peters and Taylor (2017)). Of

particular concern is the denominator of q as calculated by Kaplan and Zingales (1997). Research and

development, brand management, and human capital are reflected in the market value of a firm’s

capital, but generally not in its book value. 8 The noise will increase standard errors, but will, under the

assumption of the measurement error of q being uncorrelated with the independent variables, not bias

coefficients. The problem can be alleviated by using robust estimation methods or transformations of q.

Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010) suggest estimating Tobin’s q regressions as median regressions, or

using a log transformation or -1/q transformation. Column 4 shows the results when we estimate a

median regression in which the sum of absolute and not squared residuals is minimized, and Column 5

shows results from a regression in which the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of Tobin’s q.

Both specifications confirm our prior result of a counter-intuitive U-shaped relation between q and

managerial ownership for the entire sample, with breakpoints that are well above 50%. The result is

quantitatively and qualitatively similar when we use the -1/q transformation (not reported).

    Bartlett and Partnoy (2018) question Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick’s (2010) independence

assumption between measurement error of q and independent variables. In that case, coefficient

estimates would be biased due to the measurement error in the dependent variable. They advocate using

the ‘total q’ measure of Peters and Taylor (2017) instead of a simple measure that scales market value

of assets by total assets. Peters and Taylor (2017) develop a proxy for Tobin’s q that accounts for

intangible capital in the denominator. In Column 6, we estimate a specification with their proxy for

Tobin’s q. Our results are qualitatively similar but have weaker statistical significance: Tobin’s q is

significantly negatively related to managerial ownership, and the coefficient of managerial ownership


8
 As Bartlett and Partnoy (2018) and Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick (2010) point out, a firm’s expenditures to
develop knowledge, intellectual property, or software are generally expensed as research and development but are
not capitalized on the balance sheet (except in the form of goodwill after acquisitions).
                                                        14
squared is positive but statistically insignificant. We also estimate a linear specification with Peters and

Taylor’s (2017) Tobin’s q proxy (Column 7), because the breakpoint implied in the quadratic

specification is large and almost outside the range of observed ownership (77.5%). The coefficient on

managerial ownership in the linear specification in Column (7) is strongly statistically significant and

negative.

    Finally, in unreported regressions, we estimate regressions with quadratic specifications for four

different subperiods of seven years each. The evidence shows that the result of a U-shaped relationship

between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is very robust in the data since 1995.

    In summary, Tables 2 and 3 document a robust U-shaped relation between Tobin’s q and

managerial ownership for a large sample of US publicly listed firms. The breakpoints are such that the

relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is negative for almost the entire observed

spectrum of ownership. The remainder of the paper seeks to explain this surprising finding.



4. A potential explanation for the U-shaped relation between Tobin’s q and managerial

    ownership

    Helwege, Pirinsky, and Stulz (2007) develop and find support for a lifecycle theory of managerial

ownership. When the firm is private, insiders have no choice but to own most of the equity since the

equity cannot be widely held. Hence, a firm starts its public life with high managerial ownership.

Eventually, many firms in the US have diffused ownership (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer

(1999)). As the firm goes public, managerial ownership falls as new shares are sold to outsiders and, in

most cases, shares held by insiders are sold to outsiders as well. After the IPO, insiders generally want

to decrease their stake further over time for diversification purposes. Further, if the firm is successful

and has to raise funds, insiders are unlikely to be able to keep their proportional ownership as it would

require them to invest more in the firm. However, insiders find it expensive to sell shares if the market




                                                     15
for the shares is illiquid. 9 Managers may not even be able to sell under conditions that are acceptable to

them. In contrast, if the firm’s stock becomes highly liquid after the IPO, managers can decrease their

ownership so that the firm eventually has low managerial ownership. It follows that the cumulative

history of past liquidity should have first-order consequences for managerial ownership.

    Liquidity tends to be higher for firms that are larger, more mature, better performing, have less

volatility, fewer information asymmetries, and more analyst following (Holden, Jacobsen, and

Subrahmanyam (2013); Roulstone (2003)). Another way to put this is that liquidity is better for firms

that have made it – firms that analysts and institutional investors are interested in, and that have become

large and successful. Firms that have struggled consistently are more likely to remain illiquid. Such

firms have a low q and their illiquidity implies that insiders will typically have not succeeded in

reducing their holdings on attractive terms.

    Liquidity is correlated with firm characteristics that heighten concerns of outside shareholders

regarding moral hazard and adverse selection on the part of insiders. Adverse selection concerns arise

because insiders are better informed than potential investors, so that there is a risk that investors buy

shares that are worth less than they think and insiders know that (see, e.g., Chemmanur and Fulghieri

(1999)). Moral hazard concerns arise because insiders’ incentives are to maximize their welfare even if

it is at the expense of outside investors (e.g., Jensen and Meckling (1976)). As firms become more

established and develop a history of good performance (Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales (1998)), these

concerns become less important. A consequence of a decrease in these concerns is that the stock

becomes more liquid and insiders can sell more shares.

    We link the lifecycle theory of managerial ownership to measures of performance and liquidity and

demonstrate that it is important to control for past liquidity and performance when trying to understand

the relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership. Firms whose stock is liquid are typically

successful firms, which means firms with a high Tobin’s q. Because liquidity drives decreases in

ownership, high Tobin’s q firms tend to have low managerial ownership. Similarly, firms with high

9
 With this view, an increase in managerial ownership is also more informative about firm value than a decrease
as shown in Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009).
                                                        16
managerial ownership are firms whose stock has lacked liquidity. Such firms have typically not been

consistently successful, and therefore have high managerial ownership and low q. With this theory, the

relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is an outcome of the past history of the firm and

several testable hypotheses can be derived from it:

    H1: The negative relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is concentrated in firms

with a history of stock illiquidity.

    We first test H1 by splitting the sample between firms that have high past stock liquidity and firms

that have low past stock liquidity and estimate Tobin’s q – managerial ownership regressions for each

of those subsamples.

    A more direct test of our theory that the relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership

reflects past history is simply to regress Tobin’s q on the change in managerial ownership since the IPO

or first available managerial ownership observation. If the change in managerial ownership is large, we

expect the value of the firm to be high because the firm has performed well enough to create a liquid

market for its stock for a number of years. Our prediction is that

    H2: Firms whose managerial ownership fell more since the IPO / initial sample observation have a

higher Tobin’s q.

    An important component of our theory is that managerial ownership should be decreasing in past

cumulative stock liquidity. We test:

    H3: If a firm had more years of high liquidity in the past, its current managerial ownership should

be lower.

    Finally, we examine whether the history of past performance influences both liquidity and firm

value:

    H4a: Firms that performed more often in the top quartile of firms during their lives have more

liquid stocks today.

    H4b: Firms that performed more often in the top quartile of firms during their lives have higher

(forward looking) firm value today.


                                                      17
5. Liquidity history and the Tobin’s q - managerial ownership relationship

    In this section, we test our first hypothesis, namely that the relation between Tobin’s q and

managerial ownership depends on the liquidity history of the firm. Table 4 conditions on the liquidity

history before estimating the Tobin’s q – managerial ownership regressions. We estimate Tobin’s q –

managerial ownership regressions on the subset of firms with the highest and lowest past liquidity,

where our liquidity measures are constructed from a firm’s entire liquidity history. Columns labeled

“high liquidity” include observations if the firm-year observation is in the top quartile of the normalized

liquidity distribution, and columns labeled “low liquidity” include observations if the firm-year

observation is in the bottom quartile of the normalized liquidity distribution. Columns 1 to 4 show

Fama-MacBeth regression results, and Columns 5 to 8 show OLS regression results. It is evident from

both sets of regressions that the relation between Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is dramatically

different depending on the liquidity history. For firms with a history of low liquidity, the correlation

between q and managerial ownership is consistently negative, no matter whether we use adjusted Fama-

MacBeth standard errors or clustered standard errors or whether we use the Amihud or FHT liquidity

measures (Columns 3 and 4; Columns 7 and 8). For the high liquidity sample, the relationship looks

completely different. There is no evidence of a negative relation between Tobin’s q and managerial

ownership in Columns 1 and 2 or Columns 5 and 6. The results using the Amihud liquidity history

(Column 1) show the familiar hump-shaped relationship.

    Overall, these results provide strong support for our first hypothesis and confirm that firms with a

poor liquidity history have a fundamentally different relation between Tobin’s q and managerial

ownership than firms with a good liquidity history.



6. Tobin’s q and decreases in managerial ownership since IPO / first appearance in data

    We now test our second hypothesis: Firms whose managerial ownership fell more since the IPO /

initial sample observation have a higher Tobin’s q. Table 5 shows results. The table reports estimates of

OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on the difference between initial managerial ownership and managerial


                                                      18
ownership in period t-1. The difference, which we call the ownership wedge, measures how much the

ownership share of insiders fell since the IPO (Column 4) or since the company first appeared in the

sample. The regressions include industry- and year-fixed effects. The first column shows results for the

entire sample and demonstrates that the ownership wedge has a large and statistically significant

correlation with Tobin’s q. The more managerial ownership decreased since the firm initially appeared

in the sample, the higher is Tobin’s q. These results hold for both young firms, which have been listed

for fewer than 10 years, and more mature firms (listed for more than 10 years).

    In Column 4, we only analyze firms that had their initial public offering during our time period and

for which we have a complete history of managerial ownership. We observe the same positive

association between Tobin’s q and the ownership wedge - the more ownership fell after the IPO to

period t-1, the higher firm value in year t.

    The economic magnitude in Columns 1 to 3 can be gauged as follows. A decrease of managerial

ownership from 30% to 10% is associated with an increase in Tobin’s q by approximately 4%. The

effect for IPO firms is about twice as large. Taken at face value, these results run counter to decades of

agency research: Reducing managerial ownership and thus the alignment of incentives between

managers and shareholders is associated with increases in firm value. Instead, we argue, and will show

in the next sections, that a more plausible interpretation of the result is that liquidity and performance

drive both Tobin’s q and managerial ownership.



7. Managerial ownership and liquidity

    We now turn to hypothesis 3 that managerial ownership is lower for firms with more past liquidity.

In this Section, we use both panel data evidence on our entire sample to show that there is a robust

relation between the liquidity history of firms and decreases in managerial ownership (Section 7.1) and

a more focused approach that permits us to make progress towards a causal interpretation, but for which

the external validity is more limited (Section 7.2). In that section, we focus on two events that led to




                                                    19
exogenous changes in liquidity to show that increases in liquidity indeed cause decreases in managerial

ownership.


7.1. Managerial ownership and past stock liquidity

    Table 6 shows regression results from regressions of managerial ownership on the liquidity history

of sample firms. The key dependent variable is the fraction of years that a company spent in the high

liquidity bracket, where high liquidity means top quartile of the annual liquidity distribution. We use

both the Amihud measure of liquidity (Columns 1 through 4) and the FHT measure (Columns 5

through 8). Uneven columns show results using the adjusted Fama-MacBeth methodology, and even

columns show OLS regressions with clustered standard errors. We choose the same control variables as

Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) in their “determinants of managerial ownership” regressions.

    The table shows a remarkable asymmetry. Firms with a history of high liquidity have statistically

significantly lower managerial ownership, independent of the liquidity measure or the estimation

method. The economic significance is large: Firms that were every year in the top liquidity quartile

have managerial ownership levels between 10.7% (Column 5) and 12.5% (Column 1) lower than firms

that never had a year in the top liquidity quartile. Firms with a history of low liquidity have much

higher managerial ownership, across all measures and econometric methods. The economic effect is

even larger: Firms that were every year of their history in the bottom liquidity quartile have between

11.2% and 19.2% more managerial ownership than firms that never had a year in the bottom liquidity

quartile.

    We followed Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) in the choice of control variables to make

our results comparable to the literature, and to reduce concerns related to data mining. However,

several variables have been shown by the subsequent literature to affect managerial ownership. In

unreported regressions, we therefore also include the natural log of market value of equity instead of

log of sales as a control for size, since we know that past stock market performance is a driver of

decreases in ownership (e.g., Jenter (2005) or Fahlenbrach and Stulz (2009)). Indeed, we find that the

log of market value has a strongly statistically negative effect on managerial ownership, which is
                                                     20
persistent across all specifications. Importantly, the coefficients for liquidity are quantitatively and

qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 6. In an additional unreported robustness regression, we

control for the natural logarithm of the age of the firm because younger firms have higher managerial

ownership (e.g., Helwege, Pirinsky, and Stulz (2007)) and managerial ownership decreases more

quickly for younger firms. Indeed, firm age has a strongly significantly negative effect on managerial

ownership. Yet, including firm age does not change the conclusions we draw from Table 6 with respect

to the liquidity history. The coefficients on the liquidity history variables stay economically similar and

remain statistically strongly significant.



7.2. Towards a causal interpretation of increases in liquidity to decreases in managerial ownership

    We now exploit two changes in capital markets that affected liquidity but had no obvious effect on

managerial ownership except through their indirect impact via liquidity. In Section 7.2.1, we use

changes to the market structure on Nasdaq in 1997, and in Section 7.2.2, we use the introduction of

decimalization on the main US stock exchanges in 2001.



7.2.1. Nasdaq market reforms

    Several papers have argued that competition on Nasdaq in the 1990s was weaker due to structural

differences or possibly tacit collusion compared to NYSE or Amex (e.g., Christie and Schultz (1994),

Godek (1996), or Huang and Stoll (1996)). As a reaction, the Securities and Exchange Commission

(SEC) imposed multiple changes to the rules governing trading on Nasdaq in 1997. Bessembinder

(1999) shows that the difference in trading execution costs between NASDAQ and NYSE/AMEX listed

firms is smaller post-reform. In a difference-in-differences setting, we study whether increased stock

liquidity brought about by the Nasdaq market reforms of 1997 led to a drop in managerial ownership in

Nasdaq-listed firms compared to NYSE- and Amex-listed firms.

    A detailed description of these rules (Nasdaq market reforms of 1997 from hereon) can be found,

for instance, in Barclay et al. (1999) or Weston (2000). The SEC’s new order-handling rules, which


                                                     21
were implemented in multiple phases starting in January 20, 1997 and ending in October 13, 1997,

constituted a substantial part of the reform. The year of implementation of the Nasdaq market reforms

also coincides with the year of implementation of the Sixteenths Minimum Increment Rule, which

reduced the quotation increments from eighths to sixteenths. The Sixteenths Minimum Increment Rule

was implemented within a very short time frame on all stock exchanges and therefore affects all firms

in our sample. Based on the rules’ implementation schedule provided in, for instance, He (2013), we

find it difficult to determine which of the rules caused the largest liquidity improvement and we

therefore set the year 1997 to be the treatment year. 10

     In our analysis, we follow the diff-in-diff methodology implemented by Barrot (2016). We use a

seven-year window centered on the trading reform event. We control for firms’ initial characteristics in

1994, three years prior to the reform. The control variables include the log of assets, book leverage,

inverse stock price, sales growth, systematic risk, dividend yield, past returns, return volatility, and a

dummy variable indicating whether a firm belongs to the S&P 500 index. We estimate the following

difference-in-differences specification:

       Ownership𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛼𝛼1 + 𝛼𝛼2 Post × Treated𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼3 Post × 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 + 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 + 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡                    (3)

where Ownership𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is the managerial ownership in year 𝑡𝑡 for firm 𝑖𝑖, Post is a dummy variable set to

one in 1997 and the years following the implementation of the reform and zero otherwise, Treated𝑖𝑖 is

an indicator variable indicating whether firm 𝑖𝑖 belongs to the treatment or the control group, 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 is a

vector of firm-level control variables, 𝜂𝜂𝑡𝑡 and 𝛿𝛿𝑖𝑖 are year- and firm-fixed effects, respectively, and 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡 is

an error term. 11

     Table 7 presents the results. Column 1 shows that Nasdaq firms had approximately 1.5% lower

managerial ownership in the three years after the Nasdaq market reforms than firms listed on the other

exchanges. Because Nasdaq-listed firms and other firms may have different characteristics that could

have an impact on managerial ownership, we include interactions of initial characteristics with the post-

10
  Amex, NYSE, and Nasdaq adopted the reform on May 7, 1997, June 24, 1997, and June 2, 1997, respectively.
11
  The direct effects of Treated𝑖𝑖 and Post are subsumed by the firm- and year-fixed effects and hence are not
shown in Equation (3).
                                                         22
reform indicator variable in Column 2 of the table. Including these characteristics reduces the number

of observations and thus the statistical significance of the effect is reduced to a 5% significance level.

The economic effect remains large and is virtually unchanged at -1.4%. Finally, Column 4 examines

the effect on the treated companies in the three years surrounding the reform. We find that,

reassuringly, there is no reaction of ownership in the year prior to the reform. Firms react to the reform

in the year after it was passed.



7.2.2. Decimalization

    We now use the shift from a fractional pricing system to the decimal pricing system as an

exogenous shock to stock liquidity, in a similar setup as the one used in the previous section. Prior to its

full implementation in April 2001, the U.S. equity markets used fractions as pricing increments with

$1/16 being the minimum tick size. We study decimalization on three major stock exchanges: NYSE,

Amex, and Nasdaq. The exchanges opted for a phased-in approach that led to several different event

dates depending on the stocks’ inclusion in the pilot programs. To ensure that we use the correct event

date in our analysis, we collect the names and tickers of the Amex, NYSE and Nasdaq stocks that were

part of the decimal pilot programs from newspaper articles and press releases during the period. On

August 28, 2000, decimal pricing began in six NYSE-listed stocks with seven associated securities and

six Amex-listed stocks with an identical number of associated securities. On September 25, 2000,

decimal pricing expanded to 52 NYSE-listed companies with 57 associated securities and 38 Amex-

listed companies with 46 associated securities. On Dec 4, 2000, NYSE further expanded the pilot list

with an additional 94 securities. On January 29, 2001, all remaining non-pilot securities listed on the

NYSE and Amex were converted to decimals. On Nasdaq, stocks were phased into decimal pricing in

pilot programs during the first quarter of 2001. The initial decimal pilot program on Nasdaq began on

March 12, 2001 and consisted of 15 securities. It was followed by a second pilot containing 177 listed

companies with 199 associated securities on March 26, 2001. The remaining non-pilot Nasdaq

securities underwent decimalization on April 9, 2001. We match the securities’ tickers to CRSP

company names for all pilot securities. 12

       We wish to study whether increased stock liquidity brought about by the change of the minimum

price increment led to a bigger drop in managerial ownership in firms with a larger increase in liquidity

than those with a smaller increase in liquidity. To do so, we need to assign stocks to treatment and

control groups. Based on the findings of Bessembinder (2003), Furfine (2003) and Chakravarty, Wood,

and van Hess (2004) who show that the largest percentage reductions in average quoted spreads before

and after decimalization are for more actively traded large capitalization stocks, we sort firms into

terciles based on their market capitalization in 1998, the first year of the pre-decimalization period in

our sample. We assign companies in the top (bottom) market capitalization tercile to the treatment

(control) group, and again use a seven-year window centered on the decimalization event. 13 We control

for firms’ initial characteristics in 1998, three years prior to the reform. We define the Post indicator

variable to be equal to one in the second month following the implementation of the reform and zero

otherwise. We introduce the lag of one month to allow for some time between the decimalization and

the record date. Because of the phased-in approach, the Post indicator variable differs across stocks and

exchanges.

       Table 8 shows results. We do not observe a drop in managerial ownership in all years post reform

(Column 1). However, we see from Column 2 that managerial ownership of treated firms drops by a

meaningful 1.4% in the year of decimalization. We also observe a drop in managerial ownership in the

period t+1 which is likely driven by the fact that 63.9% of our firm-year observations have a record

date in the months of January to March and thus that there was very little time for managerial

ownership to respond to the increases in liquidity in year t. In Columns 3 and 4, we repeat the analysis

with an alternative sample. During the decimalization period, there were many young IPO firms with

high ownership that did poorly and eventually disappeared in the post-internet bubble period, and we

want to reduce concerns that these firms drive our results. We hence implement a filter and only use

firms with a market capitalization of more than $100 million before we calculate terciles, and re-

estimate our regressions. Columns 3 and 4 show results that are similar to those using all firms. We do

not observe a drop in managerial ownership across all post-reform years, but managerial ownership

drops in year t and year t+1 thus providing supporting evidence that increased liquidity leads to lower

managerial ownership.



8. Cumulative past performance, liquidity and Tobin’s q

    We now test the final hypotheses 4a and 4b, that cumulative past performance can explain both

current liquidity and current Tobin’s q. To that end, we use the measures of cumulative performance

based on sales growth and ROA defined in Section 2. A given firm-year observation is categorized as

high performance (low performance) if the value is in the top (bottom) quartile relative to the entire

CRSP-Compustat universe of firms in a given year. We then create a normalized measure of

performance history by counting how many years each firm has experienced in a high performance

state and dividing by the number of years of firm-year observations. Section 8.1 examines the effect of

cumulative past performance on liquidity, and Section 8.2 measures its effect on Tobin’s q.



8.1. Cumulative past performance and liquidity

    Table 9, Panel A shows results when we use sales growth as a performance measure, and Panel B

shows results when we use ROA. The dependent variable in Columns 1 to 4 is the Amihud measure of

illiquidity, and the dependent variable in Columns 5 through 8 is the FHT measure. Recall that an

increase in both measures means less liquidity or, alternatively, more illiquidity. The even columns

show results for OLS regressions, and the uneven columns show results for adjusted Fama-MacBeth

regressions.

    We learn from Columns 1 and 2 of Panels A and B that high cumulative past performance has large

and important effects on liquidity. A company that had high past performance is much more liquid

according to the Amihud measure. The economic effect is large, and larger for the sales growth


                                                   25
measure than the ROA measure. In Panel A, a one standard deviation increase in the normalized high

sales growth measure is associated with a 0.132 standard deviation decrease in Amihud illiquidity. In

Panel B, a one standard deviation increase in the normalized ROA measure is associated with a 0.041

standard deviation decrease in Amihud illiquidity. We learn from the control variables that larger firms

and firms with high past stock returns all have higher liquidity. We find similarly strong effects of

cumulative past performance for the FHT measure. The more years a company spent among the top

quartile performers, the higher is its liquidity today. The economic magnitude is similar. For example,

in Column 6 of Panel A, a one standard deviation increase in the normalized high sales growth variable

is associated with a 0.072 decrease in standard deviation for the FHT illiquidity measure.

    We also estimate regressions with the normalized cumulative poor performance metric. In Panel A,

we find very symmetric effects. Companies that suffered from persistently low sales growth in the past

have higher illiquidity today, with large economic magnitudes. The effects are present for both of our

measures of illiquidity. In Panel B, we observe an asymmetry. Columns 3 and 4 suggest that companies

that have a history of poor ROA actually have less illiquid stocks than other companies. Because the

result is somewhat counterintuitive, we explore it further. First, when we just estimate a regression of

illiquidity on the normalized low performance years, we find a very strong and positive coefficient.

Second, poor cumulative past performance is highly correlated with the inverse price and leverage,

which raises the issue of collinearity. Regarding the FHT measure and normalized low ROA, the effect

is inconclusive.

    Finally, the positive relation between high past performance and liquidity is very robust. In

unreported robustness tests, we also use the logarithm of market value of equity instead of the

logarithm of total assets to control for the size of the company. The conclusions regarding our central

hypothesis are unchanged: firms with cumulative good past performance have higher liquidity today.

Similarly, controlling for the age of the company (logarithm of years since first listing) does not change

our conclusion that cumulative past performance improves liquidity.




                                                    26
     Overall, we learn from Table 9 that high cumulative past performance measured either by sales

growth or ROA has economically large effects on current liquidity.



8.2. Cumulative past performance and Tobin’s q

     We have shown so far that firms with higher past sales growth have higher liquidity, and that firms

with higher liquidity have lower managerial ownership. We now estimate a regression of Tobin’s q on

characteristics that include cumulative past sales growth to test hypothesis 4b. Hypothesis 4b predicts

that firms with more years of high sales growth have higher Tobin’s q. Table 10 includes the

normalized sales growth measure of high cumulative past performance in the Tobin’s q regressions. All

regressions include the same Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) controls as Table 2 but we do not

report them for brevity.

     Table 10, Panel A shows the adjusted Fama-MacBeth regressions. Panel B shows the panel

regressions. We report specifications for all firms and for the 500 largest firms. Across both

specifications, we observe a strong, positive effect of normalized past high sales growth on Tobin’s q.

The effects are larger for all firms; a one standard deviation increase in normalized high sales growth is

associated with an increase in Tobin’s q of 0.157 (Column 1 of Panel A). For the 500 largest sample

firms, we find that a one standard deviation increase in normalized high sales growth is associated with

an increase in Tobin’s q of 0.090 (Column 2 of Panel A). The results of Panel B for the panel

regressions are very similar in magnitude and significance. Overall, past operating performance is

strongly associated with current Tobin’s q.14



9. Conclusion

     The hump-shaped relation between firm value and managerial ownership has drawn considerable

attention in the corporate finance literature. In this paper, we show that the concave relation between

Tobin’s q and managerial ownership documented in the literature does not hold for larger samples that

14
  In unreported additional regressions, we show that using ROA instead of sales growth leads to qualitatively and
quantitatively similar conclusions.
                                                        27
include a greater number of smaller firms. For our large dataset, the relation between Tobin’s q and

managerial ownership is reliably negative. However, for the subset of the largest firms, our estimates

are similar to those found in Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny (1988) and McConnell and Servaes (1990)

even though our sample period does not overlap with the years studied in these earlier papers.

    We show that these seemingly contradictory results can be reconciled by taking the frictions caused

by stock illiquidity seriously. It is expensive for insiders to adjust their holdings in firms whose shares

trade in an illiquid market. These frictions are unimportant for the largest firms, but they become a first-

order consideration for small firms. In illiquid firms, insiders typically hold more shares than they

would like because it is costly for them to reduce their stake without incurring a significant price

impact. It follows that managerial ownership is higher in illiquid firms. Furthermore, we show that

illiquid firms are more likely to be firms with poor past performance, and poor past performance is

strongly associated with a low Tobin’s q. Consequently, illiquid firms are more likely to be low Tobin’s

q firms with high managerial ownership. For these illiquid firms, the negative relationship between

Tobin’s q and high managerial ownership reflects information about the past, not the future.

    Overall, we find support for the predictions associated with the view that the relation between

Tobin’s q and managerial ownership is affected by frictions that affect the cost of trading. It is only for

firms where frictions have been unimportant in past years that the observed relationship between firm

value and managerial ownership is positive and concave. Our evidence suggests that frictions that

impede adjustments in managerial ownership have to be taken seriously in theories of firm value and

managerial ownership.

Appendix B
    Appendix B is organized as follows. In Section B.1, we describe the parsing algorithm used to

construct our data set. Our algorithm designed to identify dual class firms is described in Section B.2. In

Section B.3, we describe the algorithm that extracts the record date from documents we parse.



B.1. Description of the managerial ownership algorithm

    For the period 2004-2016, we download and parse all proxy and information statements from the U.S.

Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and

Retrieval system) website. We identify patterns in the beneficial ownership section disclosure that allow

us to use regular expressions to capture the director and officer (D&O) ownership percentage. In Table

B.1, we provide a description of the 23 different filings that we parse. Every company registered under

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is required to file its proxy statement with the SEC

prior to an annual or special shareholder meeting. The filing that represents the most common source of

ownership information in our final sample (accounting for 88.54% of firm-year observations resulting

from our algorithm) is the final proxy statement abbreviated as “Form DEF 14A”. “DEF” stands for

“definitive” and “14A” refers to the fact that proxy statements are filed pursuant to Section 14(a) of the

Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In Table B.2, we provide absolute and relative frequencies of the

above-mentioned filings to illustrate their representation in our sample. In cases where management does

not solicit proxies in connection with an annual or special shareholder meeting, a company may satisfy

the Section 14 requirements by filing an information statement with the SEC and mailing it to

shareholders (“Form DEF 14C”). Schedule 14C thus serves to inform shareholders of an approval already

obtained and corporate actions that are imminent. We therefore parse information statements as well.

    We first look for patterns in the D&O ownership disclosure in proxy and information statements and

recognize that the most common formulation that occurs in the beneficial ownership table is a variation of

“All directors and officers as a group” followed by the total number of shares and the overall percentage

owned by the company’s insiders. We first require our algorithm to find the beneficial ownership section

                                                    38
in each filing. We specify the most common names under which the section occurs such as “Beneficial

ownership”, “Amount and nature of beneficial ownership”, “Stock ownership”, “Common stock

ownership”, “Ownership of securities”, “Security ownership of management”, “Total shares”, etc. Below,

we provide a simplified example of a beneficial ownership table.

Since the disclosure is not standardized, we account for as many variations of the D&O ownership

disclosure as possible. We design a total of 66 non-redundant regular expressions many of which are

aimed to address the most common special cases. We discuss and illustrate some of them in the

following.

    1.   We account for typos, capitalized words, additional words, simplifications, and many other

         versions of the key formulation.

   officers and other executive officers of the Company as a group”, “All directors and executives”,

   “All of our Directors and Officers as a Group of seven (7) persons”, “Total as a group”, etc.



2. Whenever directors and officers together as group own less than one percent of the outstanding

   stock, the ownership percentage is often substituted by a footnote. In such cases, we directly set

   the ownership to be zero percent if we cannot extract the number of shares held by directors and

   officers.

3. We also adjust the algorithm to deal with D&O ownership percentages without leading zeros or

   with additional text.

4. For companies that do not report the final ownership percentage, we collect the number of shares

   owned by directors and officers which we divide by the number of shares outstanding as of the

   record date to arrive at the D&O ownership in percentage terms.

5. We adapt our algorithm for cases in which the 5% stockholders section is combined with the

   director and executive officer section in one table, such as in the example presented below. We

   direct the algorithm to skip the “All 5% stockholders as a group” line and to proceed to the next

   occurrence of the regular expression in the table.

                                                                                      Shares          Percentage

6. We similarly adapt our algorithm to skip sections that could be misclassified as beneficial

   ownership sections, but contain information about option grants instead. In the example below,

   the weighted average exercise price could be mistaken for D&O ownership percentage if the



                                                    41
         algorithm was designed to look for numbers following the “as a group” keyword without any

         refinements. Therefore, we always screen the beneficial ownership table identified by the

         algorithm for words such as “grant date”, ”exercise price” or “expiration date” or “options

B.2. Description of the dual class algorithm


    To identify firms with a dual class structure, we look for patterns in proxy materials and information

statements. We look for terms such as “Class A Common and Class B Common”, “Class A Common

Stock and Common Stock”, “Class A Common Shares and Common Voting Shares”, and several other

terms indicative of a firm’s dual class status. We design regular expressions in Python such as:



    rgx = '(C|c)lass\s{0,3}A\s{0,3}(C|c)ommon\s{0,3}(S|s)hares\s{0,3}and\s{0,3}(C|c)ommon

    \s{0,3}(V|v)oting\s{0,3}(S|s)hares' .



    To avoid false matches, we require regular expressions to be matched at least five times across the

whole document outside of footnotes. The reason for this restriction is to avoid false matches in cases

where the proxy statement describes insider’s holding in an affiliated company that itself has a dual class

structure. We also make use of the voting structure. We include regular expressions based on the most

common voting structure 1:10, but we also account for other voting rights proportions. An example of a

regular expression follows below.



    rgx = '(one tenth|Two|Three|Four|Five|Six|Seven|Eight|Nine|Ten|Eleven|Twelve|Thirteen|Fourteen|

    Fifteen|Sixteen|Seventeen|Eighteen|Nineteen|Twenty|Thirty|Forty|Fifty|Sixty|Seventy|Eighty|Ninety|t

    wo|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten|eleven|twelve|thirteen|fourteen|fifteen|sixteen|seventeen|ei

    ghteen|nineteen|twenty|thirty|forty|fifty|sixty|seventy|eighty|ninety)\s{0,3}(\(\d+\))?\s{0,3}(of\s{0,3}a\

    s{0,3})?(V|v)ote(s)?.{0,500}(O|o)ne\s{0,3}(\(\d+\))?\s{0,3}(V|v)ote(s)?'



    We also come across a handful of firms that specify voting as a decimal number such as “0.08 vote

per share” and account for this possibility in our set of final regular expressions.



                                                      43
    rgx = '(((\d{1,2}\.)(\d+))|(\d{1,2}\s{0,2}))\s{0,3}(V|v)ote(s)?'



Our final algorithm contains five distinct groups of regular expressions.



B.3. Description of the record date algorithm

    We develop an algorithm able to extract the record date from companies’ proxy materials and

information statements, because the record date is not available from standard databases. We use a total of

12 regular expressions and below, we present one of them as an example.



    rgx = 'as of the record date,\s{0,2}(January|February|March|April|May|June|July|August|

    September|October|November|December)\s{0,2}\d+\s{0,2}(,)?\s{0,2}\d{4}' .

Table 1: Summary statistics by calendar year

The table reports the annual means and medians of the key variables used in the study. Tobin’s q is
defined as the ratio of the market value of assets to the book value of the assets, where the market value
is calculated as the sum of the book value of assets and the market value of common stock less the book
value of common stock and deferred taxes. Managerial ownership is defined as the sum of director and
officer ownership stakes as reported in the proxy material of corporations. The Amihud and FHT
illiquidity measures are defined in Section 2. Age is equal to the number of years a firm is in the CRSP
database. N is the number of observations.

Table 2: Firm value (Tobin’s q) and managerial ownership

The table reports estimates of adjusted Fama-MacBeth and OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on managerial
ownership and additional control variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) over the
period 1988-2015. Piecewise linear ordinary least squares regressions use the breakpoints of Morck,
Schleifer, and Vishny (1988). All specifications include Fama-French 49 industry indicators and year
fixed effects. Panel A shows results from adjusted Fama-MacBeth regressions, and Panel B shows results
from OLS regressions. The t-statistics in Panel B (reported in parentheses) are computed using standard
errors robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. ***, **, and * indicate statistical
significance of the underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 3: Firm value (Tobin’s q) and managerial ownership – additional results
The table reports estimates of OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on managerial ownership and additional
control variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) over the period 1988-2015. The first
column reproduces results of the baseline specification in Table 2, Panel A, Column 3. The baseline
specification includes industry and year fixed effects, and standard errors robust to both clustering at the
firm level and heteroscedasticity. In comparison to the first column, the standard errors in Column 2 are
clustered by firm and year. In Column 3, year- and industry fixed effects are replaced by industry x year
fixed effects. Column 4 shows the results of a median regression, and Column 5 reports the results of an
estimation in which the dependent variable is the natural logarithm of Tobin’s q. Columns 6 and 7 show
the results of estimation in which the dependent variable is the Total q defined as in Peters and Taylor
(2017). The t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the
underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 4: Firm value (Tobin’s q) and managerial ownership conditioning on past liquidity
The table reports estimates of adjusted Fama-MacBeth and OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on managerial
ownership, its squared term and additional control variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia
(1999) over the period 1988-2015 when conditioning on liquidity history. All specifications include
Fama-French 49 industry indicators. The panel regressions include year fixed effects and standard errors
robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. The t-statistics are reported in
parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 5: The effect of the ownership wedge on Tobin’s q

The table reports estimates of OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on the ownership wedge and additional
control variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999). The ownership wedge in Columns 1-3
is defined as the difference between initial managerial ownership (first ownership observation for a firm)
and the managerial ownership lagged by one period. The ownership wedge in columns 7 and 8 is defined
as the difference between initial managerial ownership (ownership observation reported in the year of an
IPO) and the managerial ownership lagged by one period. In both cases, a positive value for the wedge
corresponds to a decrease in managerial ownership over time. The regressions include industry and year
fixed effects and standard errors robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. The t-
statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying
coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 6: Managerial ownership and past stock liquidity

The table reports estimates of adjusted Fama-MacBeth and OLS regressions of managerial ownership on
measures of past stock liquidity over the period 1988-2015. The dependent variable is the managerial
ownership percentage. It is regressed against a measure of past liquidity (Amihud and FHT measure) and
additional control variables used by Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999). All specifications include
Fama-French 49 industry indicators. The panel regressions include year fixed effects and standard errors
robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. The t-statistics are reported in
parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% levels, respectively.

on managerial ownership. Post is an indicator variable equal to one for the years 1997-2000 and zero
otherwise. Treated is an indicator variable equal to one if the firm is listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.
The control group is composed of firms listed on the NYSE or the Amex stock exchange. Initial control
variables are measured in 1994 and include the logarithm of book value of assets, book leverage, sales
growth, inverse stock price, systematic risk, dividend yield, past returns, return volatility, and an indicator
variable equal to one if the firm is in the S&P 500. All specifications include firm- and year fixed effects.
The t-statistics (reported in parentheses) are computed using standard errors robust to both clustering at
the firm level and heteroscedasticity. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying
coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 8: Effect of decimalization on managerial ownership

The table presents difference-in-differences estimates of the effect of the decimalization (2001) mandated
by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) on managerial ownership. Post is an indicator variable
equal to one in the three years following decimalization and zero otherwise. Treated is an indicator
variable equal to one if the firm belongs to the highest tercile of firms when sorted by market
capitalization in 1998. The control group is composed of firms belonging to the lowest tercile of firms
when sorted by market capitalization in 1998. Initial control variables are measured in 1998 and include
the logarithm of book value of assets, book leverage, sales growth, inverse stock price, systematic risk,
dividend yield, past returns, return volatility, and an indicator variable equal to one if the firm is in the
S&P 500. Columns 1 and 2 show results for all firms. Columns 3 and 4 restrict the sample to firms with a
market capitalization of at least $100 million before the terciles are calculated. All specifications include
firm and year fixed effects. The t-statistics (reported in parentheses) are computed using standard errors
robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. ***, **, and * indicate statistical
significance of the underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 9: Liquidity and cumulative past performance
The table provides estimates of adjusted Fama-MacBeth and OLS regressions of stock liquidity on
cumulative past performance proxied by sales growth in Panel A (ROA in Panel B) over the period 1988-
2015. The respective liquidity measure is regressed against normalized number of years in a high
performance state and additional control variables which include the logarithm of book value of assets,
book leverage, inverse stock price, past returns, return volatility, and a dummy variable identifying firms
listed on the Nasdaq. Except for the Nasdaq indicator, control variables are lagged by one year. The
number of years in a high performance state is determined as the sum of the years a firm’s performance is
ranked in the top quartile in the CRSP-Compustat universe since 1963. All specifications include Fama-
French 49 industry indicators. The panel regressions include year fixed effects and standard errors robust
to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. The t-statistics are reported in parentheses. ***,
**, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels,
respectively.

Table 10: Firm value (Tobin’s q) and past performance
The table reports estimates of adjusted Fama-MacBeth and OLS regressions of Tobin’s q on the
normalized number of years of high past performance and additional control variables used by
Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999) (HHP control variables) over the period 1988-2015. The measure
of normalized cumulative past performance is based on sales growth. Column 1 contains the estimates of
the specification for the full sample. Column 2 contains the estimates of the specification for the
subsample of the top 500 firms when ranked by sales. Panel A shows results from adjusted Fama-
MacBeth regressions, while Panel B shows results from time-series and cross-sectional panel regressions.
All specifications include Fama-French 49 industry indicators. The panel regressions include year fixed
effects and standard errors robust to both clustering at the firm level and heteroscedasticity. The t-
statistics are reported in parentheses. ***, **, and * indicate statistical significance of the underlying
coefficient at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
