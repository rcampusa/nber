Introduction:

        One of the most debated problems in Europe today is the definition of

the strategy for achieving monetary integration.    The European Monetary

System (EIS) was established as an intermediate step toward such

unification. The EMS has produced increasing stability in exchange rates,

but this success has been facilitated by the existence of widespread

                                                               The process
capital controls that have discouraged speculative activities.

of financial liberalization which is now in progress,   while certainly

beneficial in other respects,    could seriously undermine the solidity of the

EMS.     One of the main reasons for concern is the uneven status of the


government finances of the member countries.     Exchange rate systems like
                                                                       that
the EMS impose monetary discipline that may be too tight for countries

are struggling with large public deficits.

        The close link between budget decisions and the exchange rate is

analyzed in Grilli (1988).     There it is shown that the financing of

                                                                  rate and
government expenditures may be incompatible with a fixed exchange
                                                                            of
that,    historically, this incompatibility has been one of the main causes

exchange rate crises.     According to this point of view, inflation is an

essential element of an optimal taxation program.     Therefore, waiving the

                                                                  a fixed
discretionary power over money supply decisions    (as implied by

                                                              the
exchange rate system) without, at the same time, surrendering

sovereignty over fiscal policies,    may not be a credible arrangement.

Similar concerns have been expressed by others, e.g. Dornbusch (1987) and

Giavazzi (1987).     Dornbusch (1987) suggests that, given the probable

existance of large discrepancies in seigniorage needs among the European

countries, a more realistic exchange rate arrangement would be a crawling
                                                                          2




peg.     In this system, the rates of depreciation would be set to meet

national budgetary requirements.

        Vhether or not these are critical considerations is ultimately an

empirical issue.      In particular,    it is important to establish whether

revenue needs have indeed affected the way in which inflation has been

determined in the past, and if they are likely to be important in the

future,

        In order to address these issues, we first present a simple theory of

seigniorage and income taxation,       which is related to pioneering work by

Phelps (1973), and which has been recently revived by lankiw (1987),

Poterba and Kotemberg (1987) and Grilli (1988), among others.            Ve derive

the time series properties of seigniorage and income taxes.            It is shown

that,    if the government behaves optimally,      the tax rate and the rate of

inflation should be martingale processes. Futhermore,          the tax rate and the

inflation rate should be cointegrated.          Ye test these implications for ten

European countries     (Belgium,   Denmark,   France, Germany, Greece,   Ireland,

Italy, Netherlands, Spain, and U.K.).

        Next, we analyze the effects of three important      elements on the

results.      First, we investigate the consequences of the development of

financial markets on the demand for monetary base.          Second,   we study the

constraint imposed on seigniorage policies by the existence of a fixed

(semi-fixed)    exchange rate system.     Finally,   in order to evaluate the

potential future needs for revenues in general, and seigniorage in

particular,    we analyze the government budget situation of the ten countries

by formally testing for their long run solvency.

2.    A Common Argument for Uncommon Currencies:   The Inflation Tax'



2.1    A Simple Closed Economy lodel of Optimal Seigniorage

       For an exchange rate system to be reasonably stable it is necessary

that the inflation rates of the participating countries do not diverge in

the long run.    Therefore, it is important to understand the criteria

according to which monetary growth is determined in the various countries,

and if they imply converging rates of inflation.     Table 1 presents the

                                                         1950 for the ten
average rates of inflation in selected sub-periods since

European countries.    The average rate of inflation has increased in all of

the countries after the collapse of the Bretton- Woods system.    In the

period of flexible exchange rates between 1971 and 1978 the rate of

inflation has been, on average, highest.    While in the Eighties the rate of

inflation has been, on average, lower than in the Seventies, the

cross-country variance has been the highest. Why is inflation diverging

across the countries, and is this pattern likely to continue?

       There are several ways of modelling the process that generates

inflation. In the most popular models the authorities, following a

Phillips curve inspired policy, try to use inflation for stabilization

purposes.    lore recently, game theoretic applications of this idea,

initiated   by Barro and Gordon (1983), have pointed out that, if the

authorities cannot credibly commit to time inconsistent policies, the

                                                           rates of inflation.
equilibrium will be characterized by high (sub-optimal)

Since the equilibrium inflation rate depends on the particular structure of

the economy and on the objective function of the authorities, this approach

could potentially explain cross-country differences in inflation.
                                                                         4




     A different but not necessarily alternative approach investigates the

potential connection between inflation and government financing decisions.

This way of looking at the problem, while not novel, has recently received

renewed attention, perhaps because budgetary problems have become the

central issue in the policy debate.        According to this approach,   the proper

way of looking at inflation is from a public finance point of view.          Money

creation is a source of revenues (seigniorage)       for the government.     One

important reason for inflating the economy (the most important according to

this approach), is to finance the primary deficit.        To understand inflation

we have to analyze the behavior of budget variables,       like expenditure and

other sources of revenues (taxes).        Table 2 presents the average government

expenditure-output ratios for selected periods.        As was the case for

inflation,    expenditure has increased on average in all of the countries

after 1970.    Also,   in the Eighties,   both the average expenditure-output

ratio and its cross country variance has been higher than in the Seventies.

These figures seem to be compatible with a public finance-oriented

explanation of inflation.      In order to construct a more formal way of

testing the validity of this theory, we present a simple benchmark model,

close in spirit to the work on optimal inflation tax by Phelps (1973), and

which has been recently used by lankiw (1987) and Grilli (1988).

     The basic structure of the model is straight forward.        The

government's problem is to choose the optimal mix of distortionary taxes

and deficit to finance an exogenous and stochastic stream of expenditure.

Formally, the problem can be expressed as:

which model the potential welfare loss associated with income taxation and

inflation,    respectively. The costs of income taxation are associated with

its distortionary effects on labor supply and with the administrative costs

of collection.         The costs of raising seigniorage are related to the

distortionary effects of inflation.                These potentially involve both

reductions in desired cash holdings (and the consequent negative effects

transactions)      and unwelcome redistributive effects.2             It is assumed that

discounted value of the distortions introduced by taxation.                   This type of

model produces the tax smoothing             result obtained by Barro (1979).         Taxes

(both income tax and inflation)           are set on the basis of permanent

government expenditure, with temporary deviations from this level being

financed by issuing debt.

      Even if not evident from the way we formulated the problem, the

optimal policy implied by P-i may not be time consistent. As originally

pointed out by Calvo (1978), the difficulty arises because inflation may be

distortionary ex-ante, but not ex-post.                 This will be the case, for

example, if the only costs associated with inflation are its negative
                                                                             6




effects on (forward looking) money demand.              Fix-post, i.e. after individuals

made their decisions about their cash holdings, the monetary authorities

may deviate from the "ex-ante optimal" rate of inflation, thus increasing

seigniorage without inducing a reduction in cash holdings.               In the rest of

this paper we will be discussing the properties of the optimal policy,

without explicitly addressing time consistency issues.              This

simplification,          however, is not crucial to the analysis. First, for some

of the countries under consideration, credibility of the monetary

authorities is not a serious issue.              Second, as it has been recently shown

by Persson, Persson and Svensson (1987), there exist very simple schemes

that may resolve the basic time inconsistency problem for this class of

models.      Third, and most important,         Poterba and Rotemberg (1987) have shown

that,    if the costs of inflation also involve ex-post components (as in the

case of redistribution effects),              the time consistent solution has basically

the same time series properties as the one we will be discussing below.

        If we make the simplifying assumption that the two cost functions are

quadratic in Tt and               S,   i.e.

the first order conditions of P-i imply:




                    =                                                        (2.3)

The first implication of the theory is that income tax revenues and

seigniorage should be martingale processes,                  independently of the process

generating government expenditure. This is, of course, a result analogous

to the random walk property of consumption derived by Hall (1978).                         Notice

that the first order conditions imply a linear relationship between

seigniorage and tax revenues:


              b
          =
              2
              1T                                                                       (2.5)




quite intuitively,             the relative importance of seigniorage in an optimal

taxation package depends positively on the cost of using income taxes (b1)

and negatively on the cost of using monetization (b2).

     The model also produces a positive relationship between revenues and

                          By taking the expectation operator,                 across the budget
expenditures.                                                            E,

assumption that              G   is a random walk, we obtain:




             =                     +    r
        Tt

                                                                                             (2.8)

             =                     +    r                                                    (2.9)
                 b+b2        [G              Bti]


Taxes and seigniorage are constant proportions of expenditure inclusive of

interest payments.                If we introduce an additive random error in the

theoretically exact relationships (2.5), the stochastic implication of this

                                                                          with the constant of
theory is that           S    and
                                       Tt
                                            must be cointegrated,

integration being a measure of the relative cost of income tax and

seigniorage.           A similar argument holds for the expressions (2.8) and (2.9)

which imply that taxes and seigniorage must be cointegrated with government

expenditure (inclusive of interest payments). Notice that, in this special

         since all shocks to                      are perceived to be permanent, the fiscal
case,                                         G
authorities will never issue any new debt.                          However, the properties derived

above do not depend on the assumption that                          G    is a random walk.       Government

expenditure may follow a more general non-stationary process of the form:



             =           +
                             jO
                                                                                          9




and the same cointegration property would still                  hold.          In this (more

general)    case, government debt will have a role.

     It can be argued that a more appealing way to model the distortionary

effect of taxation and the choice of policy instruments                            is not in terms of

total income tax and seigniorage,              but in terms of the income tax rate and

the rate of inflation. This can be done by properly respecifying the

model.     For example,        assume that the cost functions have the form:




     c1(T)
                 =
                     (a1
                           +
                               b

                               2   r)   t                                                  (2.10)



                               b

        c2(St)
                 =
                     (a2
                           +
                                   r)   Yt                                                 (2.11)




where       is the (average)            income tax rate and          is the inflation rate.

     We can reformulate P-i as:




     P-2                                         b1                  +         +
                      Et                                                 [a2



             s.t.                                +               =
                                                     Tt+jmt+j}


where mt are real cash balances and we have used                               as a measure of
                                                                     rm
seigniorage.4        If we assume that money demand is a constant fraction of

output:          =         we obtain:
            mt       my


           = b1m                                                                           (2.12)
             b___     r

This model, therefore, predicts that                 and          must be cointegrated. Also,
                                                 r
it is approximately true that:


                    b       G     +rBtl
          =
     rt                                                                           (2.13)

              b1m2+b2



The tax rate and the rate of inflation should be cointegrated with

government expenditure (inclusive of interest payments)                   expressed as a

fraction of output.              Note, also, the effect of the velocity of money on

seigniorage and income taxation.             Countries with low velocity (high m) will

find it optimal to have a relatively high rate of inflation.

     As pointed out by lankiw (1987), allowing for the velocity to be a

function of inflation would not change the basic results. In particular,

the positive correlation between seigniorage and taxes would still be

present. Suppose, for example, that                  =                     Then, fron   the

2.2   Empirical Evidence



Results from Previous Analysis

      The insight that, in an environment like the one described above, the

inflation rate and the tax rate should be positively correlated, is the

basic idea behind recent analyses by lankiw (1987), and Poterba and


Rotemberg (1987).   lankiw (1987) argues that the theory of optimal

                                                                    nominal
seigniorage performs reasonably well in explaining the behaviour of

interest rates and inflation in the postwar United States.    His conclusion

is based on the finding that the inflation rate (and the nominal interest

                                                                 and that
rate) and the average tax rate are indeed positively correlated,

the regression coefficients are significant,    on the basis of the standard

T-statistics. Poterba and Rotemberg (1987), on the other hand, raise some

doubts about the generality of the theory.     They extend lankiw's analysis

to Japan, Germany, France and the U.K., and they find that a significant

positive correlation is present only in the Japanese data.

      A fundamental problem with both analyses is that they do not take into

consideration the full range of empirical implications of the theory.     They

look only for a positive correlation between inflation and tax rate,but

they do not inquire about their unit root and cointegration properties.

tore importantly, the very nature of these properties,    i.e. the fact that


inflation   and taxes should have a unit root, may invalidate the kind of

tests used in those papers.    It is well known, in fact, that standard

regression techniques cannot be used in presence of non-stationary

variables. In general, the standard T-statistics do not have a limiting

distribution and cannot be used to test the significance of regression

coefficients.    In this case, the proper approach is to test for the
                                                                    12




existence of cointegration aaong the non-stationary variables. We refer

the reader to Engle and Grenger (1987) for a discussion of the topic.

     Our empirical analysis proceeds in two steps.      First, we test whether

the various measures of seigniorage and income taxes have a unit root,      a

necessary condition if a country is behaving according to the simple theory

outlined above.     Second,   we test for the existence of cointegration among

revenue variables and between revenues and expenditures.      All the data are

drawn from the International lonetary Fund International Financial

Statistics,    and are all in logarithms.   The sample size varies across

countries, and it is the longest possible in the period 1948- 1986.

Consequently, it varies from a maximum of 38 observations (for Ireland and

the U.K.) to a minimum of 22 (for Spain).      For all the other countries it

is between 30 and 35 observations. Expenditure and revenue data have been

expressed in real terms using the GDP deflator of the respective country.

In the Appendix we provide a more detailed description of the data sources.



Unit Root Tests

     We conducted a variety of unit root tests, including tests proposed by

Dickey and Fuller (1979), Dickey and Fuller (1983), Phillips (1987) and

Phillips and Perron (1987).      Since the results of the different tests were

very similar, we report only the Za (Phillips (1987), the
                                                              Z and
(Phillips   and Perron (1987)) tests, which are presented in Table 3, Table 4

and Table 5.    The basic difference between the three tests is that the

test is designed for a pure autoregressive process, the        for an

autoregressive process with a drift, and Z. for an autoregressive process

with a drift and time trend.      The exact form of the null hypotheses and of

the alternatives for these tests are given at the bottom of the tables.
                                                                        13




        Table 3 tests for the existence of a unit root in the total tax

revenues and average tax rate series.         The results of the same test for the

total government expenditure and the expenditure/GDP ratio        (g)   series,   are


reported in Table 5.       Not surprisingly, for all the countries both    and
                                                                        Gt
   are non-stationary in the sample periods.        For Greece, the existence of

a unit root in Gt is rejected against the alternative of a linear time

trend at a more than 97.5% confidence level.        The same general

non- stationarity is true for    and            A notable exception is the U.K.,
                              Tt         r.
for which the average tax rate appears to be stationary.

        Table 4 presents the same battery of tests for total seigniorage, and

inflation.     The unit root hypothesis for        is never rejected when the

alternative is a pure autoregressive process. The rejection is instead

possible at the    997.   confidence level for Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands

when the althernative includes a drift, or a drift and a time trend.            At a

lower confidence level, rejection is also possible for Germany, which, in a

sense, confirms the result by Poterba and Rotemberg (1987).         Similar

results hold for St:       rejection of non-stationarity is possible for

Denmark, Ireland, Italy and the Netherlands.

        Summarizing, as far as seigniorage is concerned,     the evidence is

somehow mixed.     Specifically,   Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, and possibly

Germany and Denmark, may not be satisfying the unit root condition.           The

unit root implication for the income tax rate receive wider support:            only

the U.K. may be violating this condition.        Finally, the assumption of unit

root processes for government spending, made to derive the cointegration

property between revenues and expenditure, is strongly supported by the

data.
                                                                   14




Cointezration     Tests

     In this section we test for the existence of cointegration between

siegniorage (inflation) and expenditures, and seigniorage (inflation) and

taxes.      Given the results of the unit root tests, including Denmark,

Ireland, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands    in the analysis may not be

appropriate. However, it is interesting to know whether the inflation rate

and the tax rate have moved in the same direction,     even if this finding may

not be considered evidence that seigniorage    was used in an efficient way.

In fact, even if taxes are globally set at suboptimal levels,     it could be

the case that the relative weights of the different tax instruments are

still choosen according to the above theory.      For example, if a government

decides, (for reasons exogenous to our model) to set the taxes at levels

lower than what would be necessary to satisfy its budget constraint,       the

inflation rate and the income tax rate could be displaying a stationary

behavior.     Nonetheless, if it is using inflation for revenue purposes,   it

may still find it desirable to move the inflation rate and tax rate

together.     loreover, the unit root tests used above, as well as the

cointegration tests that we will be using below, are all asymptotic tests.

Therefore,    given the small sample size, the margin of error may be bigger

than the one based on asymptotic distributions.

     In Table 6 we present the results of regressing total seigniorage on

total taxes, and total seigniorage on total government expenditure

(inclusive of interest payments).     Table 7 presents analogous results based

on the inflation rate, the tax rate and the expenditure rate.     Finally,

Table S reports the results of regressing total taxes on total expenditure,

and the tax rate on the expenditure rate.     Following the suggestion by

Engle and Granger (1987), the cointegration tests are based on the
                                                                     15




Augmented Dickey-Fuller test (ADF).     The critical values of the ADF test

are based on Phillips and Ouliaris (1987), where they derive the asymptotic

distribution of the test for a different number of right-hand variables.

        Notice first, that the positive correlations between seigniorage and

taxes, seigniorage and expenditure, and taxes and expenditure are present

for all the ten countries. Also, on the basis of the standard

I-   statistics, these correlations are very significant. The same is true

for the correlations between inflation rate, tax rate, and expenditure
                                                                          when
rate.     However, we should be cautious in interpreting these statistics

non-stationary variables are involved.     Even if these variables moved in

the same direction in the post World War II period, the ADF test rejects

the hypothesis of cointegration for several of the countries.

        On the basis of these tests, we can divide the ten countries      into two

groups.     The countries composing the first group, (Belgium, Denmark, the
                                                                        in
Netherlands, Spain and the U.K.), do not show evidence of cointegration

any of the regressions. However,     the second group, (France, Germany,

                                                                             Given
Greece, Ireland and Italy), provides partial support to the theory.

that the regression residuals    for the countries for this second group are

stationary,    we can be more confident about the meaningfulness of the

relationships among revenue variables and between revenue and expenditure

variables. It is possible, however, that the stationarity of the residual

of the seigniorage regressions for Ireland, Italy or Germany, is simply a

consequence of the fact that the dependent variable is, indeed, stationary.

        The evidence in this second group, even if more favorable,     is not

                                                         between taxes and
homogeneous. In general, the hypothesis of cointegration

expenditure receives less support than the cointegration between
                                                          have not been
seigniorage and expenditure. The result that income taxes
                                                                     16




cointegrated with expenditure is a surprising and worrying result.         It can

be argued, in fact, that inflation has been used for purposes other than

seigniorage, and this is responsible for the lack of cointegration with

expenditure. This argument,      however,   is much less convincing in the case

of other sources of revenue.     The lack of this long run relationship

between expenditure and taxes raises the question of whether the current

budget policies are compatible with long run government solvency.         Ye will

investigate this problem later on in the paper.       Another characteristic

that emerges from the analysis is that the regressions based on total

seigniorage receive more support than ones based on the rate of inflation.

This is particularly true for Greece and Italy.

        Once again, the empirical evidence is mixed.    For some countries,

seigniorage has been an important revenue instrument,      while, for others,

there was no consistent inflation tax policy.       These results are a cause

for concern because they indicate that there exists a lack of homogeneity

in the role of monetary policies among       European countries.   This is a

potential source of conflict,    especially in forming a common exchange rate

policy.

        These conclusions are based on a simple benchmark model.    In the

following section we point out the most important simplifications and

discuss the possible implications of these hypotheses.



3.     Extensions of the Model



3.1.    Variability in Velocity and in the Cost Functions

        The above analysis assumed, in common with lankiw (1987), that

velocity is fixed over time.     Changes in velocity, however, might affect
                                                                   17




the desirability of seigniorage as a source of revenue. In general, in

fact, it is optimal to have a higher level of seigniorage in periods of low

velocity.    Ignoring these movements in velocity may introduce bias in the

estimates. For example, increases     in seigniorage induced by increases     in

                                                                         in
expenditure might have been offset by decreases induced by increases

velocity.    In equation (2.12), for example, this is equivalent to a

decrease in m.

     As Table 9 shows, important changes in velocity occurred during the

period under investigation. Two distinct patterns emerge.       A first group

of countries (Belgium,    Denmark, France, the Netherlands and the U.K.) has

experienced a pronounced decrease in the ratios of monetary base to output.

We believe that this tendency is the consequence of the innovations in the

financial markets that greatly reduced the use of monetary base in

transactions in the last 30 years.     The other group, (composed of Germany,

                                                                   trend.
Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain), does not show the same negative

                                                             a positive trend.
On the contrary,    Spain and Greece exhibit, if anything,

     What is interesting is the almost identical composition of these two

groups and the groups based on the cointegration results. With the

exception of France, the countries that experienced a strong positive trend

in velocity are also the ones for which the cointegration properties are

absent.     Similarly, the countries for which the evidence of cointegration

was stronger,    are also the ones (with the exception of Spain) in which the

ratio of monetary base and output remained relatively high.

     It is likely that the increase in velocity has induced a shift in the

seigniorage policies of those countries,    with inflation tax losing much of

its importance.     In addition to the recent developments in the financial

markets, other factors contributed to the diverse behavior of velocity
                                                                    18




among the European countries.     Giavazzi (1987) suggests that government

policies,    by altering the reserve requirements of the commercial banks, had

a major impact on the demand for monetary base.       In fact, Greece, Spain,

Italy and Germany are the countries that, in 1986, had the highest

reserves-to-deposit ratio.6     These differences in reserve requirements are


possible,    at the moment, because of the existence of capital controls which

reduce the international competition among commercial banks.       The

unifications of the European capital markets, however, will require the

harmonization of these regulations.       At that point, the use of seigniorage

will be greatly compromised. Another strong hypothesis that is used to

obtain the relationship between seigniorage and taxes like (2.5) or (2.12),

is that the cost functions c1(.) and c2(.) have been assumed to be constant

over time.     Vhile it is difficult to model the way in which these cost

functions may have changed, we cannot rule out this possibility. By

                                                           of income
inducing shifts between the use of seigniorage and the use

taxation,    the occurrence of changes in the relative costs of the two tax

instruments tends to reduce the significance of the (positive)      relationship

linking them.     loreover, if the process driving the relative cost (e.g.

        in equation (2.5)) has a unit root, then by estimating it with a
b1/b2
constant we will be introducing a non-stationary component in the residual.

This will lead to a failure to detect cointegration between seigniorage and

income tax revenues. A similar argument applies to equation (2.12) with

the addition that velocity    (1/rn)   might also have been a unit root process.



3.2.    Seigniorage vs. Fixed Exchange Rates

       In our basic model, we implicitly assumed that the monetary

authorities were potentially free to choose any level of seigniorage.
                                                                                    19




     This approach, however, fails to consider a crucial element in the

monetization decisions, i.e. the exchange rate regime.                     In fact, a fixed

exchange rate system imposes serious constraints on the ability of

governments to independently set the level of inflation.                     Given that a

country values a stable exchange rate, it may be willing to suffer the cost

of a suboptimal use of the inflation tax.        These are important

considerations since most of the observations in our data set refer to

periods of fixed or controlled exchange rates:            Bretton-Voods first and the

ENS later on.

     A simple way to model this idea is to introduce                 into the government

loss function an additional term which penalizes the variance of inflation

(around the mean level of the system or around the level of a leader

country).     Ye may think of this as the costs associated with devaluations

and switches to flexible exchange rates and with the resulting increase in

volatility of the real exchange rate.       Ye can rewrite the fiscal authority

problem as:



                                                          +          +

        T     b2+b3

        The larger the cost of deviating from        r,   the smaller the correlation

between       and          In the limiting case of b3-w: rt=r.      It is clear that
                     r.
unless b3 is very small, we may introduce a serious bias if we omit                 from

the regression.

        Table 10 reports the results of adding the inflation rate of the

leader country as an explanatory variable.                was chosen to be the US

inflation rate up to 1971, except for Ireland where U.K. inflation was used

for the whole sample.        After 1971,       was switched to be the German

inflation    rate,    except for Greece and Spain for which US inflation rate was

still used.     Also,     it is important   to verify that, for the U.S., the

inflation    rate has a unit root.         If U.S. inflation were stationary, we

would not have any hope to induce stationarity in the residuals by adding

it as a regressor. Tests analogous to the one performed in the previous

sections could not reject the unit root hypothesis.             Cointegration is

accepted for France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and the U.K., suggesting

that,    for these countries,        the exchange rate system may have been a serious

constraint to the seigniorage policies.            In this respect, the experience of

Germany and the U.K. is very revealing.            In both cases, the positive

correlation between seigniorage and taxes disappears. This can be

interpreted as an

indication of the priority of exchange rate policies over seigniorage

policies in these two countries.



4.   Is Jr. Ponzi Really Dead?               Solvency and Fiscal Reforms

      Suppose that, regardless of the results obtained in the previous

sections,    we believe that seigniorage has not played, at least since the

50's, any significant role in the conduct

Could we then conclude that seigniorage is not a serious threat to exchange

rate stability and to the existence of the EtS? A problem with this point

of view is that it neglects to consider the current status of the various
                                                        believe that
governments' finances in the Community. Jany economists

several of the countries in our sample are not following fiscal policies

which are sustainable in the long run.                Sooner or later these countries

will have to undertake budget adjustments which may well involve resorting

to seigniorage revenues.            While it is true that inflation does not need to

be part of a fiscal reform, the existence of domestic political constraints

on the use of alternative sources of revenues may make seigniorage

indispensable.

      In this section we present results of econometric tests designed to

determine whether the idea that some European countries are following

potentially insolvent fiscal policies, is indeed founded.

      Consider the government budget constraint at time              T-4-1:




      Bt÷1
             =   (1+r)   Bt
                              +
                                  Gt+l
                                         -
                                             R1                                (3.1)
                                                                                22




where           are total revenues (i.e. taxes plus seigniorage).              Taking the

expectations at time t, and by recursive substitutions, we obtain:



          = -                                -       +   lim
     Bt         Et                                             E{]3Bt+           (3.2)
                     !0[}[Gt+

In order for the budget constraint to hold, it must be true that:




     lim                           = 0
                                                                                 (3.3)
            Et[14F]3Bt+J



     This is the usual condition which says that the stock of debt cannot

increase faster than the government borrowing rate.                   Condition (3.3)

implies, as noted by IcCallum (1984), and Hamilton and Flavin (1986), that

a constant deficit inclusive of interest payments is consistent with

intertemporal solvency.                 In this case, in fact:




     8t÷j
            =
                (j   +   t)K   +
                                   B0                                            (3.4)



where K is the constant size of the deficit, so that condition (3.3) is

satisfied. Hamilton and Flavin (1986) test the intertemporal budget

constraint for the U.S. in the period 1962-84.                   Using a deterministic

bubble test of the kind proposed by Flood and Garber (1980), they conclude

that the US "government budget historically has been balanced in expected

present value terms" (p. 809).

     lore recently, Trehan and Valsh (1987) have employed a similar test,

closer in spirit to the ones employed in the previous sections of this

paper.    The intuition behind this test is quite simple.                The condition of a
                                                                         23




constant deficit (inclusive of interest payments) is extended in a

stochastic environment to the one of the deficit being a stationary
                                                               =              follows

           -          = a + A (L)                                         (3.5)
     (1        L)zt

where L is the lag operator, a is a vector of constants, A(L) is a 2x2

matrix of polynomials in L, and          is a vector of white noise innovations.

The process (3.5) implies that, consistent with our data, Gt and              must be

differenced once in order to induce stationarity.        Under this condition,

Trehan and Valsh (1987) show that the necessary and sufficient condition

for the budget to be intertemporallybalanced is that the first difference

of the stock of debt, i.e. the deficit inclusive of interest payments, is

stationary.       They also test this condition for the U.S., on a longer sample

than Hamilton and Flavin (1986), and they reach the same conclusion.

     Table 11 presents the unit root tests for the deficits of the ten

European countries. The non- stationarity of the deficit is rejected only

for the U.K. and, at a lower level of confidence, for Germany and possibly

Denmark.       For the other countries, this analysis suggests that the current

                                                                     to be
budget policies will have to be revised if intertemporal balance has

guaranteed.       Even if, given the small sample size, these results should be

countries the temptation to repudiate their European commitments, even by

                                      markets or by abandoning the defense
reintroducing controls on the capital

of their exchange rate parity, may become very strong.

Conclusions and Policy Implications

     In this paper, based on the experience of ten European countries,               we

tried to understand the relevance of seigniorage revenues in the recent

past, and speculate about their importance in the near future.             A first

conclusion is that the members of the European Community differ widely in

the way they manage monetary policies.       At a first level of approximation,

we divided the countries    into two groups.       For the first group, composed of

Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain and the U.K., we could not

identify a consistent seigniorage policy.          ilowever,   for the countries of

the second group (France,   Ireland,    Italy, Germany and Greece), seigniorage

appears to have been an important      component    of their financing policies.

This lack of consensus about the role of monetary policies is a potential

source of conflict in designing common exchange rate policies.

     A formal analysis of the current status of the finances of the

governments of the ten European countries revealed that several of them are

now following budget policies that are potentially incompatible with their

long run solvency.   This also represents a major obstacle toward monetary

unification on exchange rate stability.        lember countries will be faced

with quite different needs for revenues and eliminating a (politically)

flexible instrument like seigniorage may result in an unstable situation.

This problem is likely to become more acute in the near future since, with

the dismantling of capital controls, other forms of taxation which

intrinsically depended on the segmentation of capital markets, will have to

disappear. In the periods of social conflict which are likely to

characterize times of fiscal reforms, the temptation to resort to

seigniorage and thus either reintroduce capital controls or abandon the

exchange rate parity, may become very strong.
                                                                       25




       What is going to be the future of the exchange rate system in Europe?

In what direction should we move? One possibility is the return to a free

float.     Recent experience,    however,   has generated widespread skepticism

about the desirability of such an arrangement.          There exists a fear that

movements of the nominal exchange rate are dominated by speculative

bubbles, and thus that they may induce market responses that are unrelated

to economic fundamentals.        It is contended that a higher exchange rate

variability may also induce inefficiencies in the allocation of resources.

IcKinnon (1988), for example, argues that in a world where markets are

highly incomplete,    forward markets alone cannot provide sufficient

insurance against exchange rate risk, especially for long term irreversible

investments.     But, more fundamentally, a return to a free float      is in

contradiction with the goal of a European monetary unification.

       Another extreme possibility is the switch to an irrevocable fixed

exchange rate system.        At the moment, however, there do not seem to exist

the proper conditions for a tightening of the EIS bands and for the

implementation of a strictly fixed exchange rate system.          During the next

few years, the top priority of several member countries will be the

correction of their public finances.         This will probably involve major

adjustments in their fiscal and monetary policies.

       Practicable fiscal adjustments may require several realignments in the

exchange rate parities.         This, however,   need not to imply the end of the

EWS.     What is important    is that these realignments occur without major

speculative activities which may interfere with a smooth processes of
                                                                    even
integration. A way to guarantee the flexible management of the EIS,
                                                                26




in the absence of capital controls,   has been suggested by Grilli and

Alesina (1987).   This would involve the expansion of the inter-country

credit facilities and the formal commitment to large short term loans to

central banks who come under the danger of a speculative attack.

I   The title of this section was inspired by the title of lundell (1973).

2  Even if not done here, it is possible to derive these type of cost
function from more fully specified general equilibrium models. See Grilli
(1988).

3   See Trehan and Valch (1987) for a formal derivation.

4  Different measures of seigniorage can be found in the literature. The
most common are the inflation rate multiplied by real cash balances, the
rate of growth of monetary base multiplied by real cash balances, and the
nominal interest rate multiplied by real cash balances. Drazen (1985),
provides a general measure of seigniorage which produces most of the
popular measures as special cases.

5  Equations are not exactly true since, in general, Cov(rt, y1) and
            are not zero.
