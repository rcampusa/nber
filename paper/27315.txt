                                         ABSTRACT

I use Current Population Survey Data from February and April 2020 to examine how individual
workers have transitioned between labor-market states and which workers have been hurt most by
the COVID-19 pandemic. I find not only large effects on workers becoming unemployed but also
a decline in labor-force participation, an increase in absence from one’s job, and a decrease in
hours worked. Generally, more vulnerable populations—racial and ethnic minorities, those born
outside the U.S., women with children, the least educated, and workers with a disability—have
experienced the largest declines in the likelihood of (full-time) work and work hours.

Introduction
COVID-19 and its fallout have had a staggering effect on the U.S. labor market. 38.6 million
unemployment claims were filed in the 9 weeks preceding May 21, 2020. 1 As data has become
available, researchers have begun examining the determinants of job loss and its incidence.
Several new papers have focused on parsing out the effects of state and local social distancing
policies on job loss, with a common finding that individual policies have had a relatively modest
effect compared to the universal effects of the pandemic (Rojas et al., 2020; Lin and Meissner,
2020; Baek et al., 2020; Kong and Prinz, 2020). Another set of recent papers have begun to
analyze the distributional impacts of the pandemic (Coibon et al., 2020; Kurman et al., 2020;
Cajner et al., 2020; Montenovo et al., 2020; Fairlie, Couch, and Xu, 2020; Borjas and Cassidy,
2020). These papers collectively show deep effects of the pandemic on employment using a
variety of data sources on firms and workers.

I contribute to this literature by analyzing individual worker transitions between February and
April 2020 in the Current Population Survey (CPS). I use the set of individuals age 21 and older
interviewed in both of these months to establish several points. First, as shown in Figure 1, in
addition to a 6 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate over these 2 months, I
observe a 3 percentage point decrease in the labor force participation rate, a 3 percentage point
increase in the rate of absence from work, and a more than 2 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of working part-time when the worker usually works full time.

Second, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, I examine individual transitions between labor-market
states (out of the labor force, employed, absent from work, and unemployed) as well as
transitions between full/part time status (working full time, working part time, and not working)
from February to April. Workers are considered “unemployed” if they are not working but are
available to work and have either been looking for a job or are temporarily laid off from their
job. 2 Other individuals who are not working are either employed but absent from their job or out
of the labor force. From February to April 2020, more individuals transfer from being at work to
out of the labor force/absent from work (8%; roughly 4% each) than to unemployed (6.5%). In
addition, 6% of individuals transfer from full-time work (at least 35 hours per week) to part-time
work (less than 35 hours) in addition to the 9% who transfer from full-time work to not working.
Not surprisingly, there are very few individuals who go from not working to working (full time)
over this period. These results highlight the fact that the pandemic has had much deeper labor-
market effects than are measured strictly by the unemployment rate.

My third contribution is to examine how individual worker characteristics correlate with specific
labor-market transitions. I show that the pandemic has been particularly devastating to the
employment outcomes of vulnerable groups. Among those individuals who were at work in
February, all racial minorities (blacks, Asians, and members of other races) are less likely than
whites to be at work in April. Hispanics are less likely to be at work than non-Hispanics. The

effect for black workers is particularly large (3.5 percentage points) and is not affected by
controlling for occupation and industry fixed effects. Roughly half of this effect is due to
transitions out of the labor force (as opposed to transitions to absent from work or unemployed).

Workers under age 30 and over age 60 are less likely to be at work in April (conditional on being
at work in February). The former effect is explained by differences in occupation and industry,
but the latter effect is not. Most of the effect on older workers is explained by transitions out of
the labor force. Some of this effect may be due to declining labor supply on the part of older
workers given the elevated risk the virus poses to them. 3

Members of other vulnerable groups who are at work in February also suffer disproportionately
large reductions in the likelihood of being at work in April. This includes workers born outside
the U.S. (controlling for race and Hispanic ethnicity), disabled workers, and the least educated
groups. Individuals with no high-school diploma or only a high-school diploma are roughly 20
percentage points less likely than those with advanced degrees to transition to “at work” without
controlling for industry and occupation (and 10 percentage points less likely when controlling for
those factors). A substantial part of this reduction is explained by workers leaving the labor force
or absence from work in addition to workers becoming unemployed.

Lastly, as predicted in Alon et al. (2020), the experience of men and women has been different
during the early part of the COVID-19 recession. Conditional on being at work in February,
women are less likely to be at work in April. Men who are married and men who have children
are more likely to stay “at work” over these two months, but this is not the case for women.
There are also important gender differences in the likelihood of transitioning from full-time work
in February to full-time work in April. Women with children are less likely to make this transition,
and this effect is not explained by differences in industry and occupation. Women in this
situation are more likely to transition to part-time work, suggesting that both demand and
supply-side factors may play a role in their experience. I discuss this further in the Results
section.


Related Literature
Coibion et al. (2020) use the Nielsen Homescan survey to show large effects of the pandemic
on job losses that exceeded even unemployment claims by the first week of April. In particular,
since many individuals in the survey are not looking for new work following job loss or layoff,
they estimate that the decrease in the labor force participation rate (8 percentage points) dwarfs
the effect on the unemployment rate (which requires an individual to be looking for work) of 2
percentage points. Kurmann et al. (2020) use data from worker scheduling and time clock
software (Homebase) to show enormous employment effects in the Leisure & Hospitality and
Retail Trade sectors from mid-February to the end of April, with effects occurring both at the
extensive (temporary or permanent job layoffs) margin (60%) and intensive (hours reductions
for workers still employed) margin (10%). One-third of the former reduction is due to business

dropping employment to zero, which is missed by surveys that only consider employment
changes at continuing establishments. These papers do not, however, break down how
employment outcomes have changed by individual worker characteristics.

Cajner et al. (2020) use payroll data from ADP (covering about 20% of U.S. private
employment) to find that from mid-February to mid-April, private-sector employment declined by
around 22% and hours worked for continuously employed workers fell by 4.5%. The brunt of this
decrease has fallen on low-wage workers: 36% of the estimated job losses were in the lowest
quintile of the wage distribution. Though this data have many advantages, a weakness is the
inability to track workers once they leave a firm and limited number of worker characteristics for
heterogeneity analysis.

Fairlie, Couch, and Xu (2020) use CPS data to focus on how the labor-market shock due to the
pandemic has affected racial and ethnic minorities compared with whites. Their findings indicate
that compared with the Great Recession of 2007-09, blacks did not experience a
disproportionately large increase in unemployment compared with whites, but Latinx workers
did. The authors note, however, that when considering “absent” workers and workers who are
“out of the labor force but would like a job” to also be unemployed, the April 2020 unemployment
rate for both black and Latinx workers is staggering (and much higher than for whites): more
than 31% for each group. Borjas and Cassidy (2020) focus on the labor-market experience of
immigrants relative to native-born workers and find that the former group were
disproportionately hurt by the COVID-19 shock, which has already reversed the employment
advantage previously held by immigrant men relative to native-born men.

The paper most closely related to ours is Montenovo et al. (2020), which also uses CPS data to
analyze the consequences of COVID-19. Rather than analyze individual employment
transitions, the authors focus on recent unemployment as measured by being unemployed for
10 weeks or fewer in the April CPS. 4 They find larger recent unemployment for women, young
workers (ages 20-24), Hispanics, and middle education categories (those with a high-school
diploma or some college). The authors also examine how differences in industry and occupation
characteristics—particularly with respect to their need for face-to-face interaction, flexibility in
allowing work from home, and “essential” status—affect unemployment on their own and to
what extent they explain the discrepancies by individual demographics and other characteristics
described above.

The analysis in Montenovo et al. (2020) provides much insight into heterogeneity in recent
unemployment due to COVID-19. However, it neglects transitions from work to leaving the labor
force, neither does it account for transitions from full-time to part-time work (or more generally
reductions in hours). Both of these are demonstrated to be economically meaningful in other
papers (and in my subsequent analysis). Furthermore, while the authors show that their
measure of recent unemployment is similar to the one estimated by looking at within-worker

4 The authors also examine being employed but absent from work, noting that some workers who were
laid off due to the pandemic appear to have been recorded as “employed but absent” rather than laid off
by BLS surveyors.

changes in employment between February and April, they do not perform their analysis using
individual worker transitions.

My contribution relative to these papers is to examine all possible employment status transitions
due to COVID-19 and the individual factors that are correlated with them using the rich set of
demographic and socioeconomic variables available in the CPS. The only paper I know of in
this nascent literature that exploits the panel dimension of the CPS to analyze individual worker
job-market transitions is Borjas and Cassidy (2020); however, their focus is on immigrant vs.
non-immigrant labor, while my purpose is more general in scope. In addition, my paper is
among the first using recent CPS data to analyze changes in work hours via full/part-time status
in addition to analyzing extensive margin effects of COVID-19.


Data
I use data on individuals who were interviewed in both the Basic Monthly February and April
CPS. 5 CPS respondents are interviewed for 4 consecutive months, not interviewed for the next
8 months, and then interviewed again for the following 4 months. Because of my sample
selection rule, in February I observe individuals in their 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th interview months, and
in April I observe these individuals in their 3rd, 4th, 7th, and 8th interview months, respectively. I
compare individual outcomes in April (the latest month of publicly available data) to those in
February because the U.S. economy was largely unaffected until the very end of that month (for
example, the decline in the U.S. stock market, which led the surge in unemployment claims,
only began to decline after February 21st). 6 My sample includes 38,099 individuals age 21 and
older each interviewed twice (once in February, once in April). Summary statistics from
February on these individuals are included in Table 3.

Montenovo et al. (2020) demonstrate that there is a large drop in response rates in the March
and April CPS (by around 13 percentage points). Part of this may be due to the fact that BLS
had to change its interviewing procedure and timing due to the pandemic, while part may be due
to individuals having a more difficult time completing the survey due to the same. An important
question is the extent to which this non-response is random with respect to employment
outcomes. The authors provide some evidence that the non-response is correlated with
individual socio-demographics. However, the elevated non-response happens to be particularly
concentrated among individuals in their 1st, 2nd, 5th, or 6th interview month in the survey.
Because our sample requires individuals to be interviewed in both February and April of 2020, it
only includes individuals interviewed in their 3rd, 4th, 7th, or 8th response month in April. This
mitigates, but does not eliminate, the possibility that my sample is selected on characteristics
that affect employment outcomes. In addition, however, average sample characteristics of all

CPS individuals interviewed in February are very similar to those of our analysis sample, as
shown in the second panel of Table 3.

Individuals are defined as being in the labor force if in the previous week they were at work, held
a job but were temporarily absent, were looking for work, or were temporarily laid off from a job.
Individuals are classified as “at work” if they did work for pay or profit or worked at least 15
unpaid hours in a family business/farm in the previous week. Individuals are “absent” if they held
a job in the previous week but were away from it for various reasons (e.g., illness). As noted in
Montenovo et al. (2020), some workers who were temporarily laid off due to the pandemic
appear to have been recorded as absent rather than laid off (unemployed) by BLS surveyors,
highlighting the importance of tracking this occurrence in my analysis. Lastly, individuals are
classified as “unemployed” if they had been looking for work or were temporarily laid off from a
job. The employment categories “out of the labor force,” “at work,” “absent,” and “unemployed”
are disjoint and cover all individuals in the data.

I measure the hours an individual works as the total number of hours she actually worked in the
previous week (at all jobs). Following CPS’s definition, I classify individuals as “full time” if they
worked at least 35 hours in all jobs in the previous week. “Part time” workers work a positive
number of hours but less than 35 in the previous week.


Methodology
I examine how individual characteristics affect employment transitions using regression
analysis. In particular, I estimate models of the following form:

                                                 𝑗𝑗(𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓),𝑘𝑘(𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎)        𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
                                      𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖                       = 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖        𝛽𝛽 + 𝑢𝑢𝑖𝑖 ,

              𝑗𝑗(𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓),𝑘𝑘(𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎)
where 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑖𝑖         is the job-status transition for individual 𝑖𝑖 between state 𝑗𝑗 (in February)
and state 𝑘𝑘 (in April). These states either represent employment status (at work, not in labor
force, absent from work, or unemployed) or “hours” status (full time, part time, or not working).
              𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓𝑓
The vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 contains individual characteristics (measured in February) including dummies
for gender, age category, race, Hispanic ethnicity, whether born in the U.S., presence of a
disability (at least one limitation of the following types: hearing, seeing, cognitive, physical,
mobility, or personal care), marital status (and its interaction with female), presence of children
in the home (and its interaction with female), veteran status, urban status, and state of
residence. Including state fixed effects is meant to control for the different state-level policies
and infection/death realizations from COVID-19 over this time period. I also include dummies for
educational attainment (based on highest grade or degree completed), and in some
specifications I include dummies for occupation and industry. 7

7 There are 515 distinct occupations and 263 distinct industries among individuals in our sample.

Occupation and industry codes are 4-digit codes that correspond with the individual’s primary job in the
previous week (if they had a job in the previous week). If the individual did not have a job, their most
recent job was used to code their occupation and industry.
                                                                                                   6



All regressions are weighted by the final basic person weight in the February survey, and
standard errors in all regressions are robust to heteroscedasticity.


Results
I. Transitions between employment states

Because very few individuals transition from not working to “at work” between February and
April 2020 (a little over 2% of my sample; see Table 1), in this analysis I focus on the 22,785
individuals in my sample who were “at work” in February. Only about 76% of these are at work
in April. I examine, in turn, the likelihood of transitioning from “at work” in February to “at work”
(columns 1 and 2), to “out of the labor force” (columns 3 and 4), to “absent from work” (columns
5 and 6), and to “unemployed” (columns 7 and 8), all in April. The regression results are
contained in Table 4. Individuals from certain backgrounds may be disproportionately
represented in certain occupations and industries that have been most affected by the COVID-
19 crisis (Montenovo et al., 2020). In the first column pertaining to each dependent variable, I do
not include industry and occupation fixed effects; in the corresponding second column, I do. The
coefficients from these two specifications are of course important for answering different
questions.

The results from the first column of Table 4 indicate that women are 2 percentage points
(significant at the 10% level) less likely to transition from “at work” in February to “at work” in
April. Furthermore, positive effects of being married and having children in the home on this
transition for men are nonexistent for women (see the coefficients on the interactions between
“female” and “married” and “female” and “children”). Inclusion of industry and occupation fixed
effects eliminates the difference in outcomes for single women without children relative to
childless single men (the coefficient on “female”) but does not change the discrepancy between
men and women when it comes to marriage or the presence of children in the home. Looking at
transitions to other labor-market states (columns 3 through 8), it is apparent that transitions to
out of the labor force, absence from work, and unemployment each contribute to the overall
decrease in the likelihood of remaining at work for married women (relative to married men) and
women with children at home (relative to men with children at home).

Alon et al. (2020) discuss how the 2020 recession associated with COVID-19 is different (due to
social distancing measures) from recent past recessions in terms of which sectors of the
economy are most affected. Many of those taking the biggest initial hit have larger-than-average
female shares. This would be one explanation for the negative effect on “female” that is present
without industry and occupation controls but is eliminated once they are included in my model.
Part of the gender difference in effects related to children may be due to school and daycare
closures that have accompanied social distancing, a point I return to in the next section. Since
the presence of children magnifies the gap in male and female labor supply in normal times
(Juhn and McCue, 2017); the results in Table 4 imply that COVID-19 has exacerbated this
pattern, at least in the short run.
                                                                                                       7



Workers in the 31-40, 41-50, and 51-60 age categories are about 3 percentage points more
likely than 21-30 year-olds to stay “at work” between February and April without controlling for
industry/occupation effects. Older workers are less likely than 21-30 year-olds to make the
transition. For those over age 70 who were at work in February, the effect is huge at almost 17
percentage points. The positive effects for middle-age workers relative to young workers is
mostly explained by the inclusion of industry and occupation controls, but the effects for older
workers is not. The majority of the effect for older workers is explained by transitions out of the
labor force (columns 3 and 4 of Table 4), which may be partly due to a reduction in labor supply
for this group given their elevated risk associated with contracting the virus.

Blacks, Asians, and members of other races who were at work in February all experience a
lower likelihood than white workers of maintaining that status in April. 8 Inclusion of industry and
occupation fixed effects explains part of the effect for Asians and members of other races, but
none of the effect for blacks. The latter results is consistent with the analysis in Fairlie, Couch
and Xu (2020), who find that industry/occupation explains little of the black unemployment
change in a decomposition analysis. Transitions to specific labor-market states other than “at
work” (Table 4, columns 3-8) indicate that while the negative “at work” effect can be explained
almost entirely by an increase in the probability of unemployment for Asians and other races, a
decrease in labor-force participation is an important component of the overall effect for blacks.
They are about 1.5 percentage points more likely than whites to transition from “at work” to “out
of the labor force.” This is consistent with the tendency of blacks to leave the labor force
altogether, likely as discouraged workers, in prior recessions (Fairlie, Couch, and Xu, 2020).

Table 4 also shows that individuals born inside the U.S. experience a much higher probability of
staying “at work” and Hispanic individuals a lower one, consistent with Borjas and Cassidy
(2020), Montenovo et al. (2020), and Fairlie, Couch and Xu (2020). The full effect on Hispanics
manifests itself through an increase in unemployment, while the predominant effect for non-
native workers is via absence from work. More work is needed to understand the differing
effects on transitions away from “at work” by race/ethnicity/nativity during the COVID-19 crisis.

Though many new papers analyze distributional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor-
market outcomes, few if any have focused on the case of workers with a disability prior to the
crisis. My regression results suggest that those with a disability who were at work in February
are about 7 percentage points less likely than those without a disability to be at work in April.
This effect is barely explained by inclusion of the industry/occupation controls. Furthermore,
since there is essentially no effect of having a disability on transitioning to unemployment as it is
defined by the BLS (columns 7 and 8), an analysis focused exclusively on this narrow definition
of unemployment would miss these large effects. Workers with a disability are both significantly



8 The “other race” category in this analysis includes many groups combined due to relatively small sample

sizes among each of them. They include American Indian/Aleut/Eskimo, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, and
many categories in which the respondent marks more than one race. Altogether, this category makes up
about 3% of my sample.
                                                                                                   8


more likely to exit the labor force (columns 3 and 4) and be absent from work (columns 5 and 6)
than workers with no disability.

Finally, very large effects of educational attainment on worker transitions from February to April
2020 are evident in Table 4. The reference group is individuals with advanced (beyond a
bachelor’s) degrees, the highest education group. The coefficients associated with various
education categories are monotonically increasing (in absolute value) as education levels fall.
This pattern differs somewhat from the one found in Montenovo et al. (2020), who find the worst
effects of the pandemic recession on middle education categories when it comes to more
narrowly defined recent unemployment. In my analysis, those with less than a high-school
diploma are a staggering 23 percentage points less likely to transition from “at work” in February
to “at work” in April (column 1 of Table 4). Adding industry and occupation controls cuts the
education effects roughly in half, but they remain economically large (between about 5
percentage points for college graduates to about 11 percentage points for those with less than a
high-school diploma). There are large effects of education category on all three transitions away
from “at work,” as seen in the remaining columns of Table 4.

II. Transitions between hours states

Table 5 examines a different dimension of the employment effects of the COVID-19 labor-
market shock: hours worked. In particular, I examine how individuals transition not just to being
out of work but to lower hours (part-time) as a result of the crisis. Again, because transitions
from part-time or out-of-work to full-time work are rare over this time period, I focus on the
portion of my sample who were full-time workers in February (17,880 individuals). Only 69% of
these were employed full-time (at least 35 hours worked last week) in April. Columns 1-2 pertain
to the probability of “full time to full time” transitions, Columns 3-4 pertain to “full time to part
time” transitions, and Columns 5-6 pertain to “full time to no work” transitions. As was the case
in Table 4, odd columns do not have industry/occupation fixed effects while even columns do.

For some of the groups discussed in the previous section who experienced large “at work”
reductions, transitions away from full-time work are largely explained by transitions to no work
(zero work hours in the previous week). This is the case for differences by education group and
for Hispanics. Asians—as well as blacks and other races, to a lesser extent—are actually less
likely than whites to transition to part-time work but much more likely to transition to no work at
all. On the other hand, the large effect of “native born” on full-time to full-time transitions is
explained in part by transitions to part-time work as well as transitions to no work.

A major finding of the analysis shown in Table 5 pertain to the different experiences of men and
women during the first two months of the pandemic. Single women without children at home are
less likely to keep their full-time status and more likely to switch to part-time status when
industry and occupation controls are not in the model. However, this effect disappears with
these controls included, suggesting that these women are more likely to be in industries and
occupations that have been particularly hard-hit by the crisis and resulting public health policies.
Women with children, however, have seen a large reduction in the probability of full-time
                                                                                                   9


employment compared to men with children (roughly 4 percentage points), and this effect is not
mediated by the industry/occupation dummies. Furthermore, women in this situation are about
2.3 percentage points more likely to transition to part-time work than men with children.
Because these effects are largely impervious to controlling for industry and occupation, they
may be a result of labor supply factors resulting from the combination of 1) school and daycare
closures resulting from the spread of the virus and 2) women generally shouldering a larger part
of the childcare burden than men (as posited in Alon et al., 2020). Whatever the reason,
COVID-19 has caused at least a temporary increase in the gender gap in (full-time)
employment, particularly for those with children at home.


Conclusion
This paper examines the labor-market transitions of all workers interviewed in both the February
and April 2020 CPS over these two months, which have been characterized by the
unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic. Examining transitions to all possible employment states
reveals important differences in the experience of workers who belong to different groups, both
as it pertains to the reduction in those who are “at work” and where those workers wind up in
official categories (unemployed, absent from work, or out of the labor force). Examining
transitions to different “hours” states (full-time work vs. part-time work) further reveals important
sociodemographic differences.

In general, I find that workers in traditionally vulnerable groups have been especially hard hit by
the economic crisis associated with the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This
includes racial and ethnic minorities, those born outside the U.S., women with children, the least
educated, the youngest and oldest workers, and workers with a disability. Policies that focus
resources on such groups may have the biggest “bang for the buck” in terms of ameliorating the
effects of the crisis, and careful attention is needed to examine how the initial large reduction in
employment for these groups responds to changing economic and public health conditions as
the pandemic evolves.

Notes: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. Robust standard errors in parentheses. N=17,880. All regressions were weighted using
the final basic CPS person weight from February and include state fixed effects (not shown). Dependent variables represent
individual worker labor-market transitions from February to April. Omitted categories are as follows: for age dummies: "Age
21-30"; for race dummies: "White"; for education categories: "Advanced degree."
