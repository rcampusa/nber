                 Business Cycles and Oligopoly Supergames:
               Some Empirical Evidence on Prices and Margins




                                  ABSTRACT



        There has been a significant interest on a theoretical level in the
   application of supergames to oligopoly behavior. Implications for
   pricing behavior in trigger—strategy models in response to aggregate
   demand are of particular importance for public policy considerations.
   We contrast the predictions for the movements of industry prices over
   the business cycle of two such models——put forth by Edward Green and
   Robert Porter and by Julio Rotemberg and Garth Saloner——and test the
   predictions using a panel data set of U.S. manufacturing industries.

        Our principal findings are four. First, the levels of price—cost
   margins of concentrated, homogeneous—goods industries, while higher than
   those of unconcentrated counterparts, appear to be closer to those
   predicted by a single—period Cournot—Nash equilibrium than monopoly.
   Second, there is little evidence to support the idea that price—cost
   margins of these industries have different cyclical patterns from other
   industries apart from effects by level of industry concentration.
   Maximum price declines for concentrated industries give little support
   for the occurrence of price wars during either recessions or booms.
   Finally, consistent with the predictions of the Rotemberg—Saloner model,
   the industries with high price—cost margins have more countercyclical
   price movements than those exhibited by other industries. That gradual
   price adluatment is quantitatively important for those industries,
   suggests, however, that other factors may lie beind the apparent
   rigidity of prices.

    Whether oligopolists are able to achieve collective outcomes

approaching that of a monopolist is an issue of considerable debate in

theoretical industrial economics; its relevance for public policy is

clear. Recent theoretical work on oligopoly supergames has demonstrated

that, for a wide range of situations, oligopolists may be able to

approximate cooperative outcomes in games which are (structurally)

noncooperative.1

     In this paper we focus on two recent and innovative supergames

models involving trigger strategies and generating predictions about the

cyclical behavior of prices——those of Green and Porter [19841 and

Rotemberg and Saloner [1986].

     In the model of Green and Porter, demand shifts are imperfectly

observed by oligopolists and output does not vary as long as price

remains above the trigger price. Since all adjustments occur through

price unless a reversion occurs, prices and price—cost margins should be

procyclical with the possibility of occasional very sharp price

declines. It is possible that firms might actually expand production

during a recession, dampening cyclical downswings.

     In contrast, Rotemberg and Saloner assume that demand shifts are

perfectly observable and versions of their model predict that price—cost

margins should be countercyclical. That is, oligopolists behave more

competitively during booms. Thus, a shift in demand toward goods

produced by oligopolists may cause an increase in the output of all

sectors, bringing about a boom. The opposite can occur if demand shifts

away from oligopolistic sectors. The assumptions and predictions of

 these two models are further described in the next section of the paper.
                                 —2—

    An empirical test of the predictions of these models in particular,

and oligopoly supergames in general, is best undertaken with panel

data. Using information on four—digit—S.I.C. level manufacturing

industries over the period from 1958 to 1981, we focus on a subset of

industries having structural characteristics closely resembling those

cited by Green and Porter and Rotemberg and Saloner. While oligopoly

supergames predict that prices and margins will on average be above the

Cournot levels, this need not be true for all time periods (see for

example Green and Porter [1984)). It is desirable, therefore, to

examine several years of data for any given industry. The use of

longitudinal data also allows for tests that distinguish between

individual models employing trigger strategies.

     In section III we examine whether the price—cost margins of any

industry ever approach collusive levels in any time period covered by

the available data. We find that margins for our sample of highly

concentrated industries are on average higher than margins in

unconcentrated industries, but they more closely resemble the predicted

levels of a single—period Cournot equilibrium than that of monopoly.

This finding alone, however, is not conclusive evidence that

oligopolists never engage in the quasi—cooperative arrangements implied

by trigger equilibria strategies. There are many reasons why the

 sustainable outcomes in such games may not be on the profit—possibility

 frontier.

      In section IV we examine the cyclical behavior of margins and

 prices for a subset of highly concentrated oligopolistic industries

 exhibiting above average price—cost margins over the 1958—1981 period.

 Census price—cost margins are procyclical for concentrated industries,
                                 —3—

although less so for high—margin than low—margin industries. We find no

evidence for reversions from cooperative to Cournot behavior as in Green

and Porter. Finally, price movements among highly concentrated, high

price—cost margin industries are countercyclical.



                   [1. TRIGGER STRATEGY EQUILIBRIUM

     The basic concept of trigger strategies was first discussed by Luce

and R.aiffa [1957] with respect to repeated games based on the Prisoner's

Dilemma. An excellent overview of the literature that followed and a

description of the conditions for trigger—strategy equilibria are given

by Friedman [1986, chapter 3]. Simply put, these equilibria are

agreements, possibly including the joint—profit maximizing outcome,

which can be enforced by the threat of retaliation in the event of

defection. That is, in response to a violation, all players agree to

revert to a (single—period) noncooperative equilibrium. Because the

threat involves playing noncooperative strategies, it must be credible;

the equilibrium is subgame perfect (in the sense described by Selten

[1975]).

     Recent work involving infinite and finite—horizon supergames has

demonstrated that trigger strategies are viable under a wide range of

conditions. Friedman [1985] derives the conditions under which finite—

horizon trigger strategies exist. He also shows that where trigger

strategies do not exist, the discontinuity between infinite and finite

horizons can be smoothed if the players no longer seek perfect

optimization in their strategies. Furthermore, if players are "close"

to behaving optimally, then trigger—strategy "epsilon—equilibria" are
                                   —4—

possible if games have sufficiently long but finite horizons (see Radner

[19801).

       We now turn to two well known models involving trigger

strategies. Green and Porter [1984] examine an oligopoly situation

where the industry is presumed to be stable (mature), products are

homogeneous, and all available information is public knowledge except

for each firm's knowledge about its own present and past output

levels. Firms cannot perfectly observe the level of industry demand in

each period and the output choices of their competitors; they agree on a

"trigger price" to which they compare the market price when they make

their production decision. If the market price remains above the

trigger price, all firms agree to produce at a cooperative level. If,

however, the price drops below the trigger price, all firms agree to

revert to the one—shot (Cournot) equilibrium for some fixed period of

time. A firm which considers a secrete expansion of output above the

collusive level must trade off immediate profit gains with the increased

probability that the market price might fall below the trigger price,

thereby increasing the likelihood of an industry reversion and lower

profits.2 Alternatively, Porter [1985] describes how firms could focus

on market shares instead of a trigger price; in this case, large enough

deviations of actual from allocated market shares would trigger a price

war.

       In the Green—Porter model, reversionary episodes sometimes will

occur simply because of low demand. They emphasize that such reversions

are not defections by any of the participants from the supergame.

Rather, in the uncertain environment of their model, reversions are

necessary to keep the equilibrium subgame—perfect; that is, to provide
                                 —5—

incentives for all firms to choose rationally to produce at cooperative

levels in normal times.

     One testable prediction of the Green—Porter model involves the

cyclical behavior of prices and price—cost margins. Output is fixed in

their model unless a reversion occurs,   If all demand shocks are

unobservable, prices and margins should be procyclical.3 While changes

in cost are not considered by Green and Porter, economy—wide inflation

should not affect the cooperative output level. All that has to be

updated is the nominal value of the trigger price. Shocks which

increase costs will reduce profit margins until the cooperative output

is updated, but prices will continue to be procyclical. If, however,

some demand shocks are observable and others are not, a definitive test

of the Green—Porter model with respect to the cyclical behavior of

prices may not be possible.

     A second testable prediction of the Green—Porter model is that of

periodic sharp declines in industry price. Green and Porter [1984, p.

94] emphasize that according to their model industries having the

appropriate characteristics will exhibit price instability if oligopoly

members are colluding and that such episodes play an essential role in

the maintenance of an ongoing scheme of collusive incentives.

     Roteinberg and Saloner [19861 present a second supergame model

employing trigger strategies and generating predictions about oligopoly

price behavior over the business cycle. As in Green and Porter, the

major departure of this model from the earlier literature is allowing

for industry shifts in demand. The major distinction between the two

models is that Rotemberg and Saloner assume that demand shifts are
                                 —6—

observable. In most other respects, including the set of industry

characteristics (homogeneous products, etc.) the models are alike.

     Changes in industry demand cause firm payoffs to be

nonstationary. It is this nonstationarity that Rotemberg and Saloner

exploit. They do so by assuming that firms know the new level of demand

before selecting their level of the choice variable in each period.

Once choice variables are selected, they cannot be adjusted until the

following period.

     In this environment, the rewards for cheating on a collusive

agreement will be different from period to period, in general varying

positively with the state of demand. The future punishment that can be

inflicted on a cheater, however, is independent of current demand if

variations in demand are assumed to be independently and identically

distributed. Thus, in periods of sufficiently high demand, the rewards

from cheating on at least some collusive agreements may exceed any

future punishments. The likelihood of such an episode, of course,

depends on the length of the period for which a firm can cheat on its
                                            4
competitors before retaliation can begin.

     Rotemberg and Saloner suggest a method by which oligopolies may

keep firms from defecting. For periods of high demand, firms agree to

 choose a price (quantity) low enough (high enough) such that the rewards

 from defection are sufficiently reduced to keep cooperation the optimal

 strategy. This is possible since industry demand is observable to the

 oligopoly. Their strongest results are for the case in which prices are

 the strategic variable and marginal costs are constant. In this case,

 increases in demand beyond a certain point actually lower the

 oligopoly's prices monotonically. Their results are somewhat weaker
                                      —7

when quantity is the strategic variable, but they do present examples

where increases in demand again lead to more competitive behavior.

     The testable prediction of the Rotemberg and Saloner model is that

the Lerner index is countercyclical; in booms oligopolies reduce the

spread between price and marginal cost to lower the per unit gain from

cheating. They present some rudimentary evidence that this may in fact

be the case in some industries. They also point out the practical

difficulties in testing their hypothesis using traditional measures of

the price—cost margin if movements in marginal cost and average variable

cost over the business cycle are not highly correlated. An alternative

test is to assume that marginal cost is procyclical and to test for the

cyclical behavior of price.

     In the sections which follow, we provide some simple tests of the

predictions of these models for industry price—cost margins and prices

for a selected sample of manufacturing industries.



       UI •    LEVELS OF PRICE—COST MRCINS FOR SELECTED INDUSTRIES

     One straightforward test of trigger—strategy models is to examine

whether the Census price—cost margin of any industry ever approaches

collusive levels in any time period covered by our panel. For

industries producing undifferentiated products, expressions can be

derived relating the price—cost margin (Lerner index) to industry

structural conditions for different types of industry behavior.

     It is well known that5 for a given industry, a fir&s price—cost

margin (PCM) can he expressed as:


         P —      MC       s (1+v )
                       —
              P
                                          —8—

where         is the ith firms market share,     is its conjectural variation

(the ith firm's guess about the output response of all other firms), and

c is the industry demand elasticity. Reference points of interest are

the monopoly outcome, PCM =         1/c, and the Cournot outcome, P =
        We   do not have firm data and it is extremely difficult to estimate

marginal cost. However, industry expressions can be derived by

aggregating equation (1) across firms. If marginal cost is assumed to

equal average variable cost for each firm, then such an aggregation will

yield6


              P — AVC
                        =       s (1+v)
(2)             p



where AVC is the industry—weighted average variable cost. The left—hand

side of equation (2) can also be expressed as the ratio of gross profits

to revenue. The interesting reference points again are the monopoly

outcome,



              P—AVC     —
                            1
                    P




 and the Cournot outcome,


              P — AVC                     H
                                s
 (4)                P
                        =
                                E         C'

 where H is the Herfindahl index of concentration.
         Three points should be made about equations (3) and (4). First,

 the difference between the predicted margins in equations (3) and (4)

 (collusion versus Cournot) is very large. In manufacturing industries,
                                   —9—

Herfindahl indices above 0.35 are rare, while values much above 0.4 are

no longer observed.7 Secondly if MC differs from AVC, (P — AVC)/P will

result in a biased estimate of market power; this estimate will he

biased upward if marginal cost exceeds average variable cost, but the

opposite bias is theoretically also possible. Finally, if c is large

enough, then values of (P — AVC)/P considerably less than unity are

consistent with collusion.

      This final point, as well as the differences between predicted

margins in equations (3) and (4), are illustrated in Table I. For both

the Cournot outcome and the monopoly outcome, margins are calculated for

selected values of the Herfindahl index and the demand elasticity C

It   is apparent that elasticities must be quite high for the monopoly PCM

to be less than 0.50. It is also apparent that for the Cournot outcome,

PCMs are not likely to exceed 0.30.

      We now turn to an examination of actual price—cost margins for

four—digit—S.I.C.—level Census manufacturing industries.8     While Census

price—cost margins are only approximations to the Lerner index, they are

flow measures that are relatively free of accounting distortions.

Detailed descriptions of the data can be found in Domowitz, Hubbard, and

Petersen (1986a], [1986bJ.9 The full data set contains information on

312 manufacturing industries over the period from 1958 to 1981. To

focus on trigger—strategy models, we delineate a subsample of fifty—

seven industries in Table II. The common characteristics of these

industries are: (i) they are "producer—goods" industries;'0 (ii) they

have been recognized as Census industries at least since 1958; (iii)

they have four—firm concentration ratios'1 above 0.50 in 1972; and (iv)

they are not listed as "miscellaneous" or as "not elsewhere
                                    — 10 —



classified."   The object of (i) —   (iv)   was to select mature,

homogeneous—goods oligopolies operating in well defined markets. These

industries approximate the structural characteristics cited by Green and

Porter and Rotemberg and Saloner.

     For each industry, Table II reports the following information: (i)

the Census four—firm concentration ratio and the Weiss—Pascoe adjusted

concentration ratio in 1972, (ii) the average value and the standard

deviation of the Census price—cost margin over the period from 1958 to

1981, and (iii) the minimum and maximum values of the price—cost

margin. In addition, Table II is divided into "high PCM" industries ——

those with average PCNs greater than the mean for producer—goods
industries, and corresponding "low PCM" industries. We will make use of

this division of industries by level of PCM later in the paper. One

would expect that the high—PCM industries are the ones most likely to be

collusive —— and thus to behave as per trigger—strategy models.

     Unfortunately, we are unable to include Herfindahl values for the

industries in Table II. Nelson [19631 reports Herfindahl's for many of

the Table II industries, but they are out of date. As a point of

reference, Nelson's numbers indicate that industries with four—firm

concentration ratios between 0.80 and 0.90 (highly concentrated) have

Herfindahl's that cluster between 0.25 and 0.30.

     Not unexpectedly, the industries in Table TI have, on average,

higher PCMs than the average for all producer—goods industries in our

 panel, which is'2 0.250. However, the difference is not that great; the

 average PCM for the fifty—seven industries in Table II is 0.289. If we

 divide Table II into high—PCM and low—PCM industries, thirty—nine fall

 into the former category, with an average PCN of 0.333. Within this
                                 — 11 —



high—PCM group, only five have averages over 0.400 (flavoring extracts,

industrial gases, hydraulic cement, electric lamps, and photographic

equipment). The largest average P04 is 0.506. Even an examination of

each industry's maximum POt over the 1958—81 time period does not reveal

many particularly large margins; in only five instances does a maximum

P04 exceed 0.500, the largest recorded margin being 0.605.

     There are several explanations for the patterns in Table II. One

possibility is that oligopolists are rarely able to engage in quasi—

cooperative arrangements such as trigger strategies. A second

explanation is that credible punishments are not large enough to permit

margins much above a one—shot equilibrium level; that is, trigger

strategies may not generally permit outcomes near the profit

frontier.'3 Oligopolists also may face much more elastic industry

demand curves than generally believed. A final explanation is, of

course, that the threat of entry, perhaps from import competition or

from the backward integration of major buyers of producer goods, may

keep margins at levels close to noncooperative levels for even very

concentrated industries.



         IV.   RESPONSES OP MARGINS AND PRICES TO DEMAND CHANCES

     We turn now to tests of the cyclical predictions of the trigger—

strategy models described in section II. The Green—Porter model

predicts that oligopoly prices and margins will be procyclical while the

Rotemberg—Saloner model predicts that price—cost margins will be

countercyclical. We therefore present evidence on the cyclical behavior

of both price and the price—cost margin for several categories of
                                   — 12   —




industries,   including highly concentrated producer—goods industries

having comparatively high margins.

     While we present evidence on the cyclical behavior of price—cost

margins, we place much greater emphasis on the corresponding cyclical

behavior of prices. The reasons for this are as follows. With respect

to the Green—Porter model, the cyclical behavior of the price—cost

margin is probably a poor indicator of the cyclical behavior of price if

in fact output and average variable cost are not constant. With respect

to the Rotemberg—Saloner model, there are a number of reasons why the

cyclical behavior of (P — AVC)/P may he a misleading indicator of the

cyclical behavior of (P — MC)/P.     During industry downturns, marginal

cost may fall below AVC because of labor hoarding. Rotemberg and

Saloner (p. 400) point out that measurements of labor costs may include

a fixed cost component. Finally, concentrated industries tend to be

more unionized, and most of the evidence indicates that the union—non-

union wage differential is countercyclical.'4



Cyclical Movements in Price—Cost Margins

     In previous studies (see Domowitz, Hubbard and Petersen [1986a],

 [1986b]), we found that PCMs were more "procyclical" in concentrated

 industries and in producer—goods industries than in consumer—goods

 industries. In this paper, we extend our previous work by examining the

 cyclical behavior of margins across several categories of industries as

outlined in section III. These categories are:      (i) all industries,

 (ii) industries for which C4 < 50, (iii) consumer—goods industries for

which C4 > 50, (iv) producer—goods industries for which C4 > 50, (v)

 above—average PCN producer—goods industries for which C4 > 50, and (vi)
                                  — 13 —



below—average PCM producer—goods industries for which C4 > 50. This

partitioning of our sample by concentration is sensible given the models

we are interested in testing.'5

       For each category of industries, we model the PCM as a function of

industry measures of concentration, capital—output ratio, advertising—

sales ratio, and capacity utilization in manufacturing'6 (as a measure

of aggregate demand). That is,



(5)        PCM1 =   o   + 81C4ft + 2(K/Q)i + 3(A/S)i + 4t +      sit'

where i and t denote the industry and time period, respectively. OLS

and fixed—effects'7 estimation results for equation (5) appear in Table

III.

       The effects of industry variables on the price—cost margin are

consistent with our previous results (see the interpretation there in

light of standard structure—conduct—performance models). With respect

to the impact of changes in capacity utilization on margins, our

principal findings are two. First, margins are procyclical in all

categories, though demand effects in unconcentrated industries are

negligible, with more pronounced cyclical impacts in concentrated and

producer—goods industries. Second, price—cost margins in concentrated,

high—PCX industries ("trigger—strategy industries) are less procyclical

than margins in concentrated, low—PCN industries. It will be easier to

interpret this result after the evidence on the cyclical behavior of

price and cost is presented.
                                  — 14



Price Wars and the Cyclical Responses of Industry Prices

     For reasons discussed in section II, we are interested in both the

cyclical behavior of industry prices and in any evidence for the

existance of price wars, either during recessions or otherwise. We

begin with the latter issue.

     It is straightforward to compute expressions for both the

percentage change in the PCI and in the industry price following a

reversion from monopoly to Cournot behavior. Using equations (3) and

(4) and assuming constant marginal cost, the predicted percentage change

in the PCM is (1_H)*100 and the predicted change in industry price is

[(l_H)/(c_H)J*100. These expressions imply quite dramatic changes

following a reversion. For example, if H = 0.30 and c = 2, the

predicted percentage change in price is approxi—mately forty percent.

     To analyze the prediction of the Green—Porter model of large,

discrete price decreases in periods of low demand, we report in Table IV

price changes'8 for thirty—nine "high—PCM" industries for 1961, 1970,

1975, and 1980, the four points in time when capacity utilization in

manufacturing fell below eighty percent. The sharpest declines occurred

in 1970 and 1975, when capacity utilization fell by ten percent and

thirteen percent respectively. These price changes are all expressed

relative to the rate of change for all manufacturing industries on

average in 1961, 1970, 1975, and 1980. While many industries do indeed

exhibit declines, (fifteen in 1970 and ten in 1975) these relative price

decreases are quite small ——   certainly   less than what would normally he

expected from an industry reverting from a collusive to either a Cournot

or a Bertrand outcome in the middle of a recession.
                                 — 15   —




     Of course, we can not be sure how an economy—wide recession affects

demand in any given industry; that is, output movements in individual

industries could "lead" or "lag" the business cycle. Large declines in

demand also occur for some industries in non—recession years. Such

demand shocks may be more difficult to observe and therefore more likely

to trigger the sort of reversion predicted by the Green—Porter model.

We therefore report in Table IV maximum price declines (and the years

they occurred) for the thirty—nine "high—PCM" industries. Incidences of

large price declines appear to be quite rare. In only two instances

(corn wet milling and X—ray apparatus) were there relative price

declines exceeding twenty percent.

     The evidence in Table IV does not lend much support for oligopoly

price wars, at least not at the Census four—digit level of

disaggregation. We should point out, however, some qualifications. Our

data are annual, so that price wars of short duration would not show up

in Table IV. Punishments resulting from such short reversions, however,

would be very small and probably would not deter cheating. Another

consideration is that if margins are not greatly elevated by trigger

strategies for any of the reasons mentioned in the previous section,

then a price war (or a reversion to a one—shot equilibrium) may result

in only a modest decline in price.

     We turn now to an assessment of the cyclical behavior of prices.

In the Green—Porter model, prices increase continuously with increases

in industry demand, although prices could fall discontinuously during

downturns in demand if a reversion occurs. In the Rotemberg—Saloner

model, prices fall continuously when demand increases beyond a certain

point.
                                     — 16 —



       To pursue differences across categories of industries in response

of price changes to cyclical fluctuations, we begin with a simple markup

model of pricing. The target industry price P is determined as a

markup over unit cost C:



               = (1 +
(6)                     Xi)   Cit.



Variation in P arises both from changes in unit cost and from the

cyclical nature of the markup, A. This simple formulation does not

violate any of the main features of either the Green—Porter or the

RotembergSaloner model. The average markup, Xi, presumably depends on

such industry specific features as the magnitude of credible

punishments.

       Letting lower case variables denote logs, we can reexpress equation

(6) as:




(7)              Ait +



Taking first differences of equation (7), we obtain:



 (8)              Ai +    ci
       We assume that the markup A can be expressed as:



 (9)       A
                 T ÷11t +Y2CU
                                        — 17 —



where         is the time—invariant industry component, ''    allows   for the

possibility of a secular time trend and           is the cyclical component.

Differencing equation (9) and substituting into equation (8) we
         19
obtain



(10)               =
                       1   + 2       + 13 Cj +




We note that differencing cost removes any fixed—cost comoonent that may

inadvertantly he entering into the computation of variable cost.2° The

coefficient on cost in equation (10) is unrestricted in the empirical

work reported below, rather than set to unity, as in equation (8).

Although this may entail a loss of efficiency in estimation if the

restriction indeed holds, our measure of cost is not perfect, and a unit

coefficient may not be appropriate.

        We can extend this cyclical markup model to capture the idea that

differences in price adjustment across industries may also reflect

sticky prices due to costs of adjustment (Rotemberg 119821) or nominal

contracts (Hubbard and Weiner [1985J). If               is the target industry

price adlustment, and            =               + 14         then equation (10)
                                     (1_14)
can be rewritten as21:



(11)                                                      +
                       a1 + a2 CU + a3 Cit ÷ a4


Results from estimating (10) and (11) using instrumental variables22

appear in Table V.
                                 — 18   —




    With respect to all concentrated producer—goods industries (high—PCM as
well as low—PCM industries) price movements are countercyclical. That is, the

coefficient on iCU is negative although only marginally statistically

significant. If we partition the sample into high and low—PCM industries,

however, differences appear. It is the high—PCN ("trigger—strategy") sub-

sample for which countercyclical price movements are statistically significant

and economically important. Concentrated producer—goods industries with low

average PCMs have procyclical price movements although the coefficient on

ACU is measured with a large standard error. This pattern is robust to

whether or not a lagged dependent variable is included. The coefficients on

CU in the specifications including the lagged rate of change of prices imply

that a 10—percentage—point increase in the aggregate rate of capacity

utilization lowers the rate of change of prices in the high—PCM, concentrated,

producer—goods industries by approximately 1.3 percentage points, and raises

the rate of change of prices in the low—PCM counterparts by 1 percentage

point.

     We considered two tests of the robustness of the results presented in

Table V. The first was to add an industry specific measure of demand

variation to equations (10) and (11). Demand variation coming from        is


 quite in keeping with the flavor of the Rotemberg—Saloner model and is

 consistent with a strict interpretation of the imperfectly observed demand

 assumption in the Green—Porter model. While it is difficult to construct good

 proxies for industry specific demand variation, we entered such a measure in

 equation (10) and (11). The coefficient on this variable was estimated with

 large standard errors across categories, while the qualitative conclusions

 reported above went unchanged.23
                                — 19   —




    As a supplementary test, we examined the cyclical behavior of cost

itself. We have found that concentrated producer—goods industries have more

procyclical price—cost margins and that concentrated high PCM industries have

countercyclical prices. These results lead one to expect that costs must be

more countercyclical for concentrated, producer—goods industries, and in

particular for the high—PCM category. While a formal study of cost behavior

is well beyond the scope of this paper, preliminary results indicate that

average variable cost is considerably more countercyclical for our

concentrated, high—PCM category of industries.24

     The results in Tables 11—V shed some light on the two trigger—strategy

models described in the paper. The absence of large discrete price declines

during the period covered by our data combined with the countercyclical price

findings casts some doubt on the empirical validity of the Green—Porter

model. Our price findings are qualitatively consistent with the predictions

of the Rotemberg—Saloner model, as long as marginal cost is not

countercyclical. However, the movements in prices estimated here cannot be

described as large.

     Interestingly, prices are "stickier" for the trigger—pricing subsample as

well (in the sense of a significantly higher coefficient on the lagged rate of

change in prices), indicating the need for additional research on sources of

possible differences in dyna1c price adlustment. That source of price

rigidity may well be quantitatively more Important than the differences In

contemporaneous adjustment to cyclical movements.



                       V. CONCLUSIONS MID IMPLICATIONS

     There has been a significant interest on a theoretical level in the

application of supergames to oligopoly behavior. Implications for pricing

behavior in trigger—strategy models in response to demand changes are of
particular importance for public policy considerations. We contrast the

predictions of two such models put forth by Green and Porter [1984] and

Rotemberg and Saloner [19861, and test the predictions using a panel data set

of U.S. manufacturing industries.

     Our principal findings are four. First, the levels of price—cost margins

of concentrated, producer—goods industries, while higher than those of

unconcentrated counterparts, appear to be closer to those predicted by a

single—period Cournot—Nash equilibrium than monopoly. Second, there is little

evidence to support the idea that price—cost margins of these industries have

different cyclical patterns from other industries apart from effects by level

of industry concentration. Maximum price declines for concentrated industries

give little support for the occurrence of price wars during either recessions

or booms. Finally, consistent with the predictions of the Rotemberg—Saloner

model, the industries with high price—cost margins have more countercyclical

price movements than those exhibited by other industries. That gradual price

adjustment is quantitatively important for those industries, suggests,

however, that other factors may lie behind the apparent rigidity of prices.

     These conclusions suggest two promising extensions for future research.

 First, the results for interindustry differences in responses of PCMs and

 prices to changes in aggregate demand suggest that countercyclical cost

 movements are likely to be important in producer—goods industries (say sticky

 real wages traceable to union bargaining agreements). Second, decomposing

 manufacturing industries into subgroups based on industry concentration or

 type of good produced, it is possible to test whether predictions of models of

 price adjustment based on costs of adjustment, contracting, or strategic

 considerations are consistent with the data. These extensions overlap

substantially   with recent theoretical concerns of both industrial economists

and macroeconomists.

Notes
'Until recently, it was generally thought that finitely repeated games of the
"Prisoners' Dilemma" variety were inherently similar to a single—period game
(see the review in Friedman 11986J.).

2For each firm's cooperative output level to be the noncooperative action, the
marginal expected loss in future profits from triggering a Cournot reversion
must exactly balance the marginal gain from cheating on the agreement.

3Assuming that demand shifts are so imperfectly observed that output changes
never occur unless there is a reversion is extreme. Relaxing this assumption,
however, and permitting a partial response (i.e., by allowing output to be
somewhat procyclical) would not change the basic prediction that prices should
be procyclical with periodic sharp declines.

41f such a period were very short, defection would never be desirable.

 See for example Waterson [1984, pp. 18—201.

6Multiplying equation (1) by q1/Q and summing across all firms in the industry
yields:

           P•q. — MCq1                s(1 + v1)
                               =
                  PQ                        c


If marginal cost equals average variable cost, than the above expression can
be rewritten as:

          ,r+F         H
           PQ

where F is fixed cost and the left—hand side of the equation is the ratio of
gross profits to sales.

7Consider as an example the automobile industry, one of the most concentrated
industries in the United States. The approximate market shares of General
Motors, Ford, Chrysler and American Motors are: 0.5, 0.25, 0.20, and 0.05.
The Herfindahi index for this configuration of market shares is 0.355. Nelson
[19631 reports Herfindahi values for most of the existing four—digit Census
industries between 1947—1956. None of the Herfindahl's exceed 0.30. Nelson
was unable, however, to report H values for a few of the most concentrated
industries (e.g., aluminum).

 8The PCM is defined as

                                     A Inventories— Payroll — Cost of Materials
                = Value
                        of Sales +
                                     Value of Sales + Alnventories

 which is identical to (Value Added — Payroll)/(Value Added + Cost of
 Materials) given the Census's definition of value added.

9me Census of Manufactures and the Annual Survey of Manufactures (published
by the U.S. Bureau of the Census) are the primary sources of information used
in constructing the panel data base. Other possible sources were not used
because of definitional problems, the short time period covered, or stringent
confidentiality restrictions. Data for most industries go back to at least
1958, and for some industries even as far back as 1947, allowing for a panel
of substantial length. Census definitional issues are discussed in Domowitz,
Hubbard, and Petersen (1986a], [1986b]. The data are described therein, with
the exception of the capital stock series, which has been modified to reflect
a more realistic depreciation schedule.

'°The producer—goods/consumer—goods classification is taken from Ornstein
(1975]. Ornstein's classification is based on the percentage of shipments of
output for final demand in four categories: consumption, investment,
materials, and government. If fifty percent or more of an Industry's output
went to consumption, it was classified as a consumer—goods industry, if fifty
percent or more went to investment plus materials, it was classified as a
producer—goods industry.

''We used the four—firm concentration ratios constructed by Weiss and Pascoe
[1981]. They adjusted the concentration ratio for all Census industries for
1972 for inappropriate product groupings and geographic fragmentation.

'2This result Is consistent with the findings of several cross—sectional
studies of small differences in measures of profitability between concentrated
and unconcentrated industries. For recent examples, see Salinger (19841 and
Alberts [1984].

'3A necessary condition in the Rotemberg—Saloner model is that the magnitude
of the punishment be a binding constraint on margins and prices. Oligopolists
then have to lower prices to keep cheating incentives in line with punishments
when industry demand increases.

'4For an overview of the evidence, see chapter three of Freeman and Medoff
[1984].

15Rotemberg and Saloner note that their theory says nothing about the
volatility of price as concentration increases, only that once an industry
becomes an oligopoly it becomes more likely that it will cut prices in a boom.

'6Data on capacity utilization In manufacturing are taken from the Economic
Report of the President [1986].

'7An important potential qualification of the OLS results is that the
coefficient estimates may be biased by the omission of individual industry
effects. With panel data, we can account for unobservable persistent industry
differences; here we interpret "persistent" as time—invariant and reestimate
the model using the standard fixed—effects within—group estimator.

           output price deflators are obtained from the four—digit—S.I.C.
level data base constructed by the Penn—SRI—Census project and updated and
extended at the National Bureau of Economic Research.
                                      — 24 —



'9since the equation is in first differences, fixed unobservable industry
effects in setting prices have been removed. A natural way to interpret
equation (10) statistically, as well as equation (11) which follows, is to
view the original equation as one in the log levels of the variables, which
also includes a time—invariant industry component and a secular time trend.
Equations (10) and (11) are then the estimating equations for the fixed—
effects differencing estimator.

20The percentage change in unit labor costs is defined as the excess of the
percentage growth in wage rates over the percentage growth in output per
worker—hour. Industry specific data on the materials prices are not
available. Assuming a constant ratio of materials to output, the percentage
change in unit materials costs can be expressed as the percentage change in
the total cost of materials less the percentage change in industry output.

21Civen the interpretation of (11) as a fixed—effects estimating equation, we
note the problems associated with the use of a lagged dependent variable, as
exposited, for example, in Nickell (1986). The bias in coefficient estimates
is sharply reduced as the number of time—periods grows, and may be considered
negligible for the case here, given the length of our sample in the time—
dimension.

22The endogenous variable is cost, of course. The instrument list included
the (current—period) percentage change in the aggregate industrial production
index, as well as percentage changes in cost and output prices lagged two
periods. The first lag of the last two variables was not used, due to the
nature of the error term under the fixed—effects interpretation given in
footnote 13. Ordinary least squares estimation of (6) and (7) yielded results
which were quite similar to those reported here. The main effect of using an
instrumental—variables scheme was to enlarge the standard errors of the
estimated coefficient on the percentage change in cost.

23We constructed the percentage rate of change in industry output (i/Q)
as a proxy for industry demand fluctuations. Industry output Q was
constructed as the quotient of the sum of current—dollar value added and cost
of materials and the industry—specific output deflator. The percentage rate
of change of output was orthogonalized with respect to changes in the
aggregate rate of capacity utilization. An instrumental variables procedure
was employed to eliminate the potential simultaneous equations bias inherent
in regressing the change in prices on change in output.

 The results from adding Q/Q to the model in equation (11) are given below.
 The results for all unconcentrated industries (C4 < 50), concentrated low—PCM
 industries, and concentrated, high—PCM industries, respectively, are:
