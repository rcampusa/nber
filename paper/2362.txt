                      Tests of Excess Forecast Volatility
                   in the Foreign Exchange and Stock Markets




                                       ABSTRACT




 Simple   regression tests that have power against the alternatives that. asset prices and
expected future asset returns are excessively volatile are developed and performed for
the foreign exchange and stock markets. These tests have a number of advantages over
alternative, variance hounds techniques. We find evidence that. both exchange rates and
stock prices are excessively volatile and that expected retuiriis on foreign exchange and
stocks move too much. We also investigate whether these findings ran he attributed to
time-varying risk premia, but in our tests the data provide little support for such an
alternative hypothesis.

       Beginning with Robert Shiller (1981a). variance l,ouiir]s tests of iiiarket efficiency have gen-
erated an enormous anioiuit of research. Such tests are widely viewer! as an alternative technique
to their predecessors, simple regression tests of market efficiency. Surprisingly little energy, how-
ever, has been applied to examining whether particular regression tests ran uncover evidence for
the same types of alternative hypotheses as tests of variance bounds. This paper develops simple
regression tests with power against the alternative hypotheses that asset prices and expectations of
future asset returns are excessively volatile, and it applies these tests to the foreign exchange and
stock markets.

      In the case of the foreign exchange market, several authors investigate the volatility of spot
rates.1 They construct variance bounds relations based on monetary models of exchange rate
determination, and their results provide no support for the view that exchange rates are excessively
volatile.2 But economists seem to plate little faith in these tests, regardless of the results, because
the models used to construct the variance inequalities perform                            poorly when tested alone, and
because the assumptions of these models (such as purchasing power parity) are so egregiously
violated in the data. Among a wider audience. the belief that exchange rates are excessively
volatile is widely and unrehectively held, manifesting itself in rerent proposals for international
macroeconomic policy coordination and the adoption of exchange rate target 7.ones.
      There is a similar lack of consensus on the presence of excess volatility in the stock market.

stock price can be statistically rejected, violations of the variance inequalities are not statistically

      The regression tests of excess volatility we develop below liavr several advantages over methods
used previously in the examination of exchaiige rates and stork prices. First. they do not rely on
a complete specification of the underlying fimdainentals which ultimately (leterinine asset values.

fundamentals. Second, the tests do not require knowledge of the stochastic processes driving
the fimdamentais. The results of variance bounds tests for rxressive stork price variability, for
example inve been questioned based oii their assumptions about the driving processes. Third,
our stock price tests allow for a time-varying discotmt factor. This is nportant because many
observers have suggested that the constant discount rates employed in litany tests could account for
findings of excessive volatility. Fourth, our tests have equal power against the opposite alternative
hypothesis, that asset prices and expected returns are in.tujjiriently votatile. Fifth, the tests are
simple. Indeed, they are versions of particular efficient market tests with precise interpretations
given to the alternative hypotheses in each case. Finally. the tests appear to have power against
these alternatives. While we do not specifically compare their power with other test methodologies
in simulations, we use them on actual data and hnd substantial evidence of excessive volatility of
prices and of expected future returns in bot.h the foreign exchange and stock markets,
     Of course, failures of market efficiency may he alternatively attributed to risk prenhia that vary
in ways not specified by the underlying model. We attempt to shed light oii the importance of this
alternative hypothesis in two ways. First, we employ survey data on exchange rate expectations in
order to get around the presence of the exchange rate risk prenhiutni that contaminates forward rates.
Second, we ask whether the volatility of stock market returns can account for the hypothesized
behavior of the equity premium. Both of these techniques suggest that our results are not primarily

a consequence ol time-varying risk premia.
         The paper is organized as follows. In section 1. we discuss the relationship between vari-
ance bounds tests of asset price volatility and simple regressiohi tests of market efficiency. While
straightforward1 this relationship seems to be lost in the literature, We then propose in section II a
different definition of the concept that asset prices are "too volatile. ezeesp forecast volatility. This
definition ins clear economic meaning, encompasses the usual variance hoiuttls restrictions, and is
most directly put to use in a regression framework. In an effort to stress that the issues raised in
the first two sections are quite general1 sections Iii and IV apply the tests to the foreign exchange
market, and the U.S. stork market, respectively, Section V concludes.

1. Comparison of Regression Tests with Variance Bounds
     Consider an attempt to forecast a stationary variable. 17. iii which the forecast is denoted by
f, and the prediction error by f:
                                                 = f, + 1•                                         (Li)
If the forecast is optimal, then equation (1.1) gives rise to tlit' usual upper and lower bounds on
the variance of the forecast and the prediction error:

                                          var(f,) < var(f,)                                       (l.2a)

                                          var(c,) < var(fI)                                       (1.2h)

Clearly, a violation of the tipper variance bound in equation (I .2a) implies that 1, is "too" variable.
In this section we relate this notion ef excessive variability hi the coefficients in simple regression
tests.
     Under the alternative hypothesis that the forecast is not efficient, the variance of the prediction

error term, fg, may be expressed:

                             var(ct) = var(ffl   —
                                                     var(f,)   —
                                                                   2cov(t,.f,)                    (1.3a)

                                     = var(ffl + var(f,) — 2cov(f,', 1,)                          (1.3b)

From these two expressions, the necessary and sufficient conditions for tile variance bounds to be

satisfied are:
                                                               cov(c,,f,)        I
                            var(f) > var(f1) c=>                            > ——
                                                                               2
                                                                                                  (1.4a)
                                                                var(c,)
                                                     3

                              var(I, ) > var(r,) <=>                     > ——
                                                                                                    (1.46)
                                                             var(fi)        2
 In words, the upper hound iii equation (1.4a) is satisfied if and only if the coefficient, in a regression
 of the forecast, f,, on the prediction error, q, yields a coefficient greater than —1/2. The second,
 or lower, variance bound in equation (1.4h) is satisfied only when the coefficient, in the opposite
 regression -. in which the prediction error, q, is projected onto f1    is greater than minus one half.
 In practice, the latter regression is more convenient, to inn because the null hypothesis implies
 that , is purely random. Either way, 1i tile regression test the joint. maintained hypothesis that
 rational expectations holds and that the model used to generate the forecast 1, is tnie is rejected if
 the coefficient is statistically different from zero.

     A more complete comparison of the relationship between the regression parameters and the
variance inequalities is presented in Figure 1. In a regression of the predictioti error on the forecast,


                                            q=a+flf,+,.                                              (1.5)

there is a direct mapping between the coefficient estimate and the validity of the lower bound
(equation (1.4bfl: if $ < —1/2 the lower hound is violated and if ft > —1/2 the lower bound is
satisfied. A finding that ft is positive indicates that both inequalities 1.4a and 1.4b are satisfied.
Notice that if var(f,) > var(ffl, the regression test will detect the violation, and the parameter
estimate will be negative. But the converse is not trite. If the paraiiieter estimate is negative, it
need not follow that the tipper bound is violated. The bottnnm half of Figure 1 shows that the
opposite regression test yields all the same conclusions. bitt for the opposite variance bounds.
     Suppose for example that the variable we are trying to forecast, f. is identically zero for all
t. Then any variation in the forecast 1, will he ntirrored iii the forecast error, rg. Clearly, in this
special case both the forecast error and the forecast are excessively variable, so that 1)0th variance
bounds will be violated. The regression in equation (1.5). as well as time opposite regression of the
forecast on the prediction error, will yield ft = —1.
     Figure 1 indicates that the unconditional variance bounds inequalities above have less power
to distinguish correlation between the forecast and the prediction error than do the regression tests:
the former require that ft c —1/2, whereas the latter allow us to reject whenever ft < 0. Such
correlation is a clear signal that forecasts can he made more efficient,. But while the relative power of

 issue in comparing these two test methodologies. First of all, roncentrating only on the subject

 of power obscures the fact! that 1)0th types of tests are ha.qed on a single covariance restriction,
 expressed in equation (1.4). Second of all, when there are several ways of testing the efficiency of
 forecasts, it is worthwhile to ask how well each method distmguitslies among competing alternative
 hypotheses, not. just! how well each distinguishes between the null hypothesis and a particular
 alternative. For instance, one might pose as an alternative hypothesis that certain forecasts are
 inufJieicntly volatile, Before rejecting out of hand such an alt eniative, it is worth recalling that
investigations of the term structure of interest rates have found repeatedly that long rates move too
little relative to short rates.5 Unlike regression tests, variance bounds tests are imahie to uncover
evidence of insufficient volatility in asset prices.

  2. Excess Forecast Volatility

         What makes a forecast "too' variable? While a violation of the upper variance bound in
  equation (1.2a) is a striking example of inefficient forecashiig. its economic sigiiificance lies in the
 fact that the prediction errors, t            arc   needlessly large. The mean scpiared prediction error could be
 reduced simply by lowering the variance of the forecast around its mean. Similarly, violation of the
 lower variance bound implies that! a marginal reduction in the variance of the forecast. will reduce
 the mean squared prediction error. Thus the necessary and sufficient condition for a forecast, to
 he excessively volatile is that a reduction in the variaice of the forecast reduces the mean squared
 prediction error. An "insufficiently' volatile forecast is one that can be improved upon merely by
 increasing the forecast variance.
        It is intuitively clear that such a test for excessive or insufficient forecast volatility can be
 implemented by running a regression. The derivative of tile Divan squared forecast error in equation

 where p is tile correlation coefficient between 1, and f,. and p is the correlation coefficient between

 where a is a positive parameter, and As÷1 is the expected percentage depreciatioii in the spot
 rate between time t and t H- 1. There are a number of specific exchange rate models which at the
 form of equation (3.1), each of which leads to a different interpretation of the parameter a and
 the fundamentals term c, . For example, equation (3.1) ran he iiterpreted in terms of the flexible-
 price monetary model of Mussa (1976), Frenkel (1976) and Bilsrm (1978). Then a corresponds to
 the semi-elasticity of money demand with respect to the alteruativc' rate ofrctiirn (which would
be the interest differential, expected depreciation or the expected inflation differential), and C is
proportional to the log of the ratio ol the domestic Inruiry supply to the foreign money supply, plus
any other determinants of money demand.8 Variance hounds based on tins version of the flexible-
price monetary model are considered by Huang (1981). Meese and Singleton (1983), Vander Kraats
and Booth (1983) and Diba (1987).

      Equation (3.1) is usually solved iteratively, so that the spot price is expressed solely in terms
of the expected future path of fundamentals:°

                                               =   (1   + ar'                                                       (3.2)


A perfect. foresight price analogous to that of Shiller (1981a) would prevail if agents knew with
certainty the actual future path of c:

                                               = (1     + ar' (            (I

Under rational expectations the perfect loresight price. s. is tl1 sum of the forecast, s1, plus an
error term which is conditionally independent of contemporaneous information:

                                                             = s, + cg.                                             (3.4)

 forecast, s1 — x1, to test for excessive volatility. Bitt, slice the error term is not observable there
 is no direct way to implement such a test.. If the iteration in equations (3.2) and (3.3) stopped
 at a finite terminal date, as in Mankiw, Homer and Shapiro (1085), then the error term would be
observable, but would be highly serially correlated.11
       Even if the error and the perfect foresight spot rate are observable, there are several well-
known difficulties in implementing both the regressions and tests of variance bounds based on
equation (3.5). First, both tests assume that the vector o1ftndaiiientals (defined here as everything
influencing the currency but for expected future appreciation) is properly specified. In the case
of the exchange rate, there is little agreement on or evidence iii favor of a short list of important
macroeconomic variables. The monetary model, winch employs niolley supplies and measures of real
income, is notorious for producing unstable coefficient estimates and for failing to account for any
positive percentage of exchange rate movements.12 Even absent issues of imprecise measurement
of income and money, few macroeconomists would argue that money demand is an exact linear
function of these variables alone, or that purchasing power parity holds exactly in the short rim.
       Second, even if the model of fundamentals is not contentions, variance hounds tests are not
robust to misspecification of the dynamic process of the forcing variables. The most obvious
illustration is in the stock market. Marsh and Merton (1986). for example. show how measured
variances will violate the tipper variance bound in every sample if dividends follow a nonstationary
process driven by lagged stock prices.'3 The same sort of criticism applies to variance bounds
relations in the foreign exchange market. In a direct analogy to the Marsh and Merton example1
if monetary policy is set in response to the (noustatioiiary) exchange rate and if the monetary
model is trite, then measured variance hounds will be violated in every sample. Without precise
knowledge of the stochastic process of c1, small sample biases will plague unbiased measurement of

       These difficulties can be avoided by deriving tests which do not req ure iteration of equation
 (3.1). Consider an alternative perfect foresight price. s.                    winch    prevails if agents know with
 certainty the subsequent. change in the spot rate:


                                                         = c1 + aAs,1                                                   (3.6)

 Under rational expectations, this perfect foresight spot rate is the sum of the forecast, B, plus an
 error term that is conditionally independent, of contemporaneous inforuii ation

                                                     —   ., =        , + (,                                            (3.7)

 where we have subtracted the nive forecast from both s and s,.

      The prediction error g now has a simple interpretation. in that it is proportional to the error
macic when predicting the subsequent spot rate:

                                                   C, = rt(s,..l —                                                     (3,8)


The one period difference in dating of tile right- and left-hand sides of equation (3.8) implies one
need not wait many periods (or forever) to observe the perfect Foresight error: it. is known at time
t-l-1.15 In addition, the error is serially uncorrelated under the null hypothesis, a desirable property
for our regression tests.
      While c is itself unobservable, we can nevertheless draw consistent inferences about its behav-
ior. Most of the models mentioned above. including the iiirmetary models tested by Huang (1981)
and Vander Kraats and Booth (1983), assume that covered and uncovered interest parity hold, i.e.
that assets denominated in different currencies are perfect substitutes. These assumptions imply
the forward discount. is equal to expected depreciation:


                                                      fd, = a1.                                                       (3.9)
  '  Papers discussing these problems include Marsh and Merton (1986). Icleirlon (1988), flaviu, (1983) Mankiw, Romer and
Shapiro (1985). Mattey and Meese (1987), and Frankel and Nicest (1987). See also Campisell and SlillIer (1987) who us., the
theoiy of co-integration to allow for nonstat.ionarity in asset prices and the forcing variables.
  '" This removes one important criticism of the regression-based tests we develop below. Shiller (1081h), for erample, argues
that because asset. prices depend on the discounted value of an infinite stream of future fmidame,ial,, the perfect foresigM
error will not be fully known in a given sample and tints regression tests will stiffer fron, a "data alignment' problem. The
perfect foresight error in equation (3.6) is not subject to this problem.

later and is not dependent. on precise specification of the lundaniemital variables:

The exchange risk premium term, A, is zero if equation (3.0) holds exactly.
     From equation (3.7), the spot rate is too variable around :r, if the coefficient in a regression
of J'H on s1 — x is negative, ad not. variable enough if time coefficient is positive. This inference
holds even though the parameter a is unknown, In contrast, it is not possible to test. the validity
of variance bounds constricted from equation (3.7) unless the value of it is known. Indeed, the
appropriate magnitude of a has been a point of contention. Huamig (1081) and Vander Kraats and
Booth (1983) both find evidence that variance hounds are violated based on their assumed values
of the semi-elasticity of money demand, a. Deha (1087) argues iii response that the values these
authors chose for a are too low, and that the variance inequalities are satisfied for larger, more
plausible semi-elasticities. Our regression tests, however. can remain agnostic on the precise value
of a, as long as it is positive. The regressions also do not place any restrictions on the identity of
the fimdamental variables included in c,, or on the stochastic processes generating these variables.
     Next we turn to candidates for the naive forecast. ,.     One     potential candidate is the log of the
lagged spot. rate, so that the deviation of the current spot rate from r1 is just the lagged percentage
change, As,. Another possible replacement for , would In' the long-rim equilibrium spot rate, S,
which evolves over time according to relative inflation rates iii the two countries. Note that. if the
long-nm eqmulibrium is constant., then the log of the spot rate is itself stationary, and, in terms of
equation (1.1), we can regress q on 1, directly.

3.1. Tests of Excessive Forecast Volatility in the Spot Exchange Rate
    We can now test whether spot exchange rates are excessively variable. Our regressions in this
section will be of the form:
                                         = a + j9(s, — x,) +       q,.                               (3.11)
                                                   10
  The null hypothesis is that the spot rate is an efficient forecast of r. or that a = /9 = 0, and the
  error term,      is purely random. Before proceedi ig to the estimation, we make several general
 points about the specification of equation (3.11).
       First, in the discussion so far and in Tables Ia. lb and Ic below. We use the forward rate as a
 proxy for the expected future spot rate, as in equation (3.9). This is useful because the monetary
 model tested by Huang (1981), Vander Kraats and Booth (1983) and Diha (1987), as well as many
 other exchange rate models, take the forward rate to he equal to the expected future spot rate.
       Second, if this assumption is relaxed (as it would he in a IILOFe general model), tile forward
 rate would be the sum of a time-varying risk prenuuui and the expected future spot rate. Since
 the forward rate prediction errors will also include the risk ln'1niuin. biased estimates of /9 will
 result. One solution to tins problem (other than assunung it away) woiilrl he to use in place of
 the forward rate another data source that does not suffer from tltr' interference of a risk premium,
 such as survey data on exchange rate expectations. By using these data in the second set of tables
 below, we attempt to augment the generality of our estimates of /9 in equation (3.11) beyond those
 that would be implied by restrictive models that assume the risk premium does not change over
 time.'°

       Third, some estimates of equation (3.11) already appear in the literature, only with a different
interpretation attached to the alternative hypothesis, 9                       11. Indeed, Frankel and Froot (1987)
present estimates of equation (3.11) for all of the candidates for X mentioned iii the preceding
section. They interpret the results in the same way as have previous authors: as statements about
the behavior of expectations, instead of statements about the behavior of the spot rate. To see this
alternative interpretation, posit a particular model of expectatiniis formation:

                                                      = (1 — t91)s, + 01z,.                                             (3.12)


which says that the expected future spot rate is formed as a weighted average of the contempora-
neous spot rate and the other element, x1. The actual spot procss is then assumed to follow:


                                           81-4-i = (1 — 02)s, +    i92z +                                              (3.13)

  16 To guarantee consistent estimate, of fl we asqump that the media,, c,irvry rrpone is rqiial to "t.l,r (unobservable) market
expectation plus random measuremeS error.

                                                              11
 Equation (311) ran he obtained by subtracting equation (3.14) from (3.13). so that /9 = 6 —
 It follows that if expectations place too little wright on the 'otIirr information x1 (or too much
weight.   on the conteinjioraneous spot rate) relative to what              is rational. /9 <     0. In the case where
x1 is the long-run equilibrium spot rate, for example, a finding that /9 is negative implies that
expectations are insufficiently regressive.
      Fourth, several issues of econometrics should 1w mentioned before we proceed. Equation
(3.11) and other equations that follow can he estimated using OLS with with standard errors
calculated using Hansen's (1982) Generalized Method-of-Moments (CMM). Where appropriate,
the covariance matrix estimators allow for serial correlation induced under the null hypothesis
by overlapping observations. Due to the downward finite-sample bias of tlieheteroskedasticity-
consistent 0MM covariance estimates, we report two sets of shindard errors for the coefficients.
The upper set are calculated assuming the residuals are Ijoinoskedastic. and the lower set. allow
for unknown conditional heteroskedasticity. if we wish to lw on the safe side, we should weigh
this downward bias more heavily than a Toss in power. and therefore draw inferences based on
the larger of the two reported standard errors.17 We use Seeiiungly Unrelated Squares (SUR)
to estimate parameter estimates for all the currencies combined in Tables la. lb and ic. SUR
is consistent and asymptotically efficient in the absence of conditional heteroskedasticity and the
presence of contemporaneous correlation. Finally, in all of the regressions each currency was given
its own constant terms, which we do not report to save spare.


3.2. Results                                  -

     We   now turn to the estimation of equation (3.11). Tables Ia. lb. and lc employ the forward
rate as a measure of the expected future spot rate for each of the various Z'5 discussed above.
The data are monthly observations on six currencies from Jiiw 1973 to Febniary 1987. Tables
2a through 2c follow tile same pattern, hut instead use exchange rate survey data from Money

Market Services (MMS) to measure expected depreciation during the period from January 1984 to

 constant, so that the log level of the spot rate is presumed Iv, be stationary. Each of the point esti-
 mates of       is negative, indicating excessive volatility. The tiieasured coefficients for the individual
 currencies are not very precise, however. To check whether an SITU. estimator was appropriate,
 White (1980) tests of conditional heteroskedasticity were performed for each currency, and none
 rejected the hypothesis that the residuals are homoskedastic. When we combine all six currencies,
 however, the data reject the hypothesis that 5 = 0 at the 5 percent. level. In Table lb. we use
 a second measure of the long-rim equilibrium spot rate, allowing it to evolve over time according
 to inflation differentials. Table ic replaces x1 with the log of the lagged spot rate. Both tables
 report results very similar to those in Table Ia: all of the point estimates of 5 are negative, and
 the estimates for the combined currencies are significantly less than zero.
      One possible explanation for the negative coefficients in Tables la-Ic is that they are induced
by errors in the measurement of the spot rate. The average of the hid and ask rates, winch we
used in the regressions, will overstate or understate the relevant price by a maximum of about
0.1 percent. Such measurement error by itself generates a negative regression coefficient since it is
present in both the left- and right-hand side variables. The magnitude of this effect is given by:

                                                 var(v,)         0.000001
                                                                             0M009
                                               var(A,)            0.0011

where 0.0011 is the sample average variance of monthly exchange rate changes. It appears that
this source of measurement error would not he enough to explain imiore than a small fraction of the
magnitude of the estimated coefficients.
      Tables 2a though 2c use survey data with forecast horizous of one month or less in place of the
forward rate.19 If the forward rate contains a time-varying risk premium which is responsible for
the negative parameter estimates, then we would expect very different estimates here. h fact, of
the estimates in all three tables is negative, and the magnitudes are comparable to those in Tables
la, lb and ic. Several of the estimates are even slightly more significant: we can reject /9 = 0 at
the five percent level in two cases-20

 3.8. Tests of Excessive Speculation
         Tue framework set. tip In the first two sections also allows its to ask whether expected depre-
 ciation us excessively or insufficiently variable. Consider a legiessiohi of the expertational error on
 expected depreciation:

                                           Asf+I —             =n+        flAs÷1 -f t                               (3.14)

where the null hypothesis is again that = /? =                       0,   and that the residual is purely random. The
alternative hypothesis in this regression is exactly what Bilson (1981) termed "excessive spent-
lation:" a finding that /9            C   0 implies investors would do better to move their expectations of
the future exchange rate toward the contemporaneous spot rate. thereby reducing the variability
of expected depreciation. Indeed, if the spot rate follows a random walk, expected depreciation
should he reduced toward zero. A prime motivation for investigating the variability of expected
depreciation comes from equation (3.1): if expected depreciation moves too much, this may cause
the spot rate to be too variable.
        If we take the forward discount to measure expected depreciation. then equation (3.14) is
equivalent to the usual test of forward rate ianhiasedness. Table .3 presents estimates of this speci-
fication on monthly data for the duration of the floating rate period. The estimates reaffirm what
many papers testing forward rate unhiasedness have found: that the optimal forecast of the future
spot rate change places negative weight on the forward rate.21 If one is to accept that the risk
prenutim is constant (or, somewhat more weakly. uncorrelated with the forward discount) then
the significantly negative estimates of /9 reported in Table 3 indicate that expected depreciation
is excessively volatile. Indeed, many of the coefficients in Table 3 are significantly less than 1/2,
indicating that the lower variance hound in equation (1 .41i) is violated. Huang (1984) compares
directly the variance of the forward rate prediction error with the variance of spot rate changes.
Although he finds that the point estimate variance of the forward rate error is greater (so that
the lower variance hound is violated), he cannot reject the hypothesis that. the variances are equal.
In the same paper, he is able to reject using regression tests of the form of equation (3.14). This
suggests that the regression framework may in practice have more power not only in detecting the
alternative of a nonzero covariance between the forecast and the forecast error but also in detecting

       Most authors interpret the results (rolli regressions such as those in Table 3 as evidence of
 a time-varying risk premium contained in the forward discount.,22 Once again, we can put. the
 survey data on expected depreciation to use because they are not contaniinat.ecl by a risk premium.
 Regressions of equation (3.14) are reported in Front. and Frankel (1986) for 3 different survey
 sources over a variety of time periods and forecast horizons.23 All of the estimates of fi                          are all

 highly significant and negative, suggesting that the results reported in Table 3 are not evidence
 of a time-varying risk premium, and that they reflect instead excessively volatile expectations of
 future depreciation.

 4. Tests of Excessive Forecast Volatility n the U.S. Stock Market
      Next we develop our regression tests of excessive volatility hi the stork market. A necessary
 first order condition from a representative investor's utility maximization states that the real stock
price must equal the expected future ratio of marginal utilities. weighted by future stock prices:
                                      =       mg1(p,÷1 +
                                                            dv))                               (4.1)

where P, is the nominal stock price at time t, d1 is the current dividend payment, q is the price
of the consumption good, and mg+1 = —6                            the discounted ratio of the marginal utility of
consumption in between periods t and t + 1.24 The associated first order condition for a nominally
riskless bond is:

                                 (1 +      =                                             (4.2)
                                              E1(m1+11)
                                   -
Combining equations (4.1) and (4.2) and solving For P, we have that the nominal stock price is
equal to the discounted value of the next period price plus dividends:
                                                        P7 + d,
                                                    (1 + i,)(l + A)
                                                                                                                       (4)
where A =     cov(m'            I + r1.), and r,+1 is the realized return on stocks.              The perfect foresight

price is then:
                                                      =     1'+ + d,

                                    _______                         /            I   + r,1

The first. term is the covariance of marginal utility with the subsequent real return on stocks the

usual reward for risk when returns are expressed in real terms. The second term is the covariance
of stock returns and inflation. The third term is the covariaiic' of marginal utility with inflation.
For the time being we allow the discount factor. ((1 + A)(i + i,W' to vary only with the nominal
interest rate, holding A (and therefore the conditional covarialires in equation (4.5) constant). Later
we consider a generalization of this model, in which tin' conditional covariances can also vary with
price-dividend ratios and nonunal interest rates.                            -


     The prediction error of the contemporaneous stork price is:


                                                    =        — P,                                  (4.6)

Dividing through by z1 yields an equation in which each tenti is stationary:

If the correlation of the modified prediction error on the left-hand side of equation (4.7) with      is

negative, stock prices are excessively volatile around x. Although tims' prediction error,     is   not
observable, we can observe the left-hand side of equation (4.7) up to a term proportional to
Using equation (4.6), we have our regression equation:


                                          41 = a + flp, + ti,+i                                    (4.8)


where p1 = (r,41    —
                        i,)(P,/zj) is the adjusted excess return on stocks over short-term nominally
riskless bills, and p, = P1/zg. The joint hypothesis that equation (4.3) holds and expectations are

                                                        16
 rational implies that. a =         0, fi = A and the residual is purely raiicloiu . Equation                 (4.8) simply tests
 whether the one period excess return on stocks over Thills is systematically related to the current
 level of stock prices.

       For stocks, the natural candidate for z is the conteiiiporaiic'oiis dividend payment, d,. The
 hypothesis that the price-dividend ratio is nonstationary appears to be strongly rejected, so that
 the usual asymptotic clistrihutioii theory can he applied iii the regressions heIow.2 We therefore
 ask whether stock prices are excessively volatile around cluTeilt rlivideiids. Indeed, there is already
some evidence that when the price-dividend ratio is low, rationally expected future excess returns
are high.2°

       There are four main advantages to using equations (4.3) and (4.4) as opposed to an iterated
version which expresses the price as a weighted average of r'xpecterl future dividends. First it is
easy to allow the discount factor ((1 + A)(1 + I,)) to vary over time. By contrast, iterated models
quickly become intractable when the discount factor varies.27 It seems intuitively plausible that
discount factors vary considerably; allowing for this source of variation may well reverse many prior
findings of excessive variability in stock prices. A second advantage to allowing for a time-varying
discount factor is that the specification in equation (4.4) can then be consistent with a wide range of
i.it.ility functions. Most infinitely iterated solutions to equation (4.3) use a constant discount factor,
and consequently, the associated perfect foresight price is consistent with utility maximization only
if agent.s are risk neutral or if consiunption is perfectly fixed over time. The third advantage of
tlus simple specification is that we can remain agnostic on the time-series behavior of the price and
dividend processes, so long as the price-dividend ratio is stationary. A Fourth advantage is that. our
regression equation (4.8) is insensitive to the price level. The excess nominal return, i'T+1, is equal
to the excess real return bitt for a constant term due to Jenseiis inequality (the sum of the last
two terms in equation (4.5)). Similarly, the price-dividend ratio is unaffected by the current price

of consumption goods.

ability ol the price'dividendratio to predict future stock returns. ICeim and Stambaugli (1986) 'ase a variety of proxies for stock
prices, such as the stock prices of smalI'capitalization firms, to predict future returns on the market. They find evidence of
substantial predictive power. In fact, their estimated coefficies.s are all negative. though they (to not. interpret this as evidence

 4.1. Results
      Table   4 presents our estimates of equation (4.8). The data on stork returns, both inclusive
 and exclusive of dividends, are the Center for Research in Seriirities Prices (CR.SP) monthly value-

 weighted index, which nins from 1926 to 1985. Monthly interest rates on 11.5. government securities
 with approximately one month to maturity come from Ihbots011 Associates (1086).28 The first row
 of Table 4 uses monthly data for the entire 60 year sample period. Monthly dividend measures
 contain noise, however, since firms do not change their dividend payments each month. One way
 to avoid this problem is to follow Campbell and Shiller (1987) and Marsh and Merton (1987) by
 aggregating the data up to the annual level. Estimates of equation (4.8) on annual data over
 the same period are presented in the second row of Table 4. The estimate of fi is negative and
statistically different from zero at the five percent level. Unfortunately in this regression, excess
returns on stocks were calculated using a one-month riskless rate rolled over, because the Ibbotson
data do not contain a riskless annual rate. A second, and perhaps jnon' satisfactory, means of
eliminating the measurement error in monthly dividends would 1 n' to employ a moving average of
dividend payments over the last 120 months. We term this naive forecast d0. and use it for the
regressions reported in rows 4 through 9 of Table 4. This pi'orNllire has the advantage of allowing
us to use the monthly data, so that the excess returns are computed above the appropriate riskless
rate. The estimates for the entire sample period, reported in row 4, are negative and statistically
different from zero at the five percent level.

4.2. Excessive Volatility of Expected Stock Market Returns
      Analogously to section 4.2, we next ask whether ripener! rcfltrn., on the stock market are
excessively volatile. in terms of the hrst two sections, the perfect foresight variable, f,' can be
interpreted as the realized gross nominal return on storks, and the forecast, 1,, can he interpreted
as the expected gross return. Equation (4.6) implies that the expected retuni is (approximately)
equal to the nominal interest rate plus the premium. A. Thus our regression of q on f1 can he
accomplished in this case by regressing the excess return oii stocks on a constant and the nominal
interest rate:
                                                     = a + $1, + 'U-fl                                             (4.9)
 This     standard data set is used by Marsh and Mrrton (1987), Famq anti French (1987), Campbell and Shiller (1987), and
T'oterha and Summer, (1987) among other,.

                                                           18
 where           =        — j,.   The joint hypothesis that. equation (43) holds and expectations are rational
 implies that a =        A   and /9 =         The alternative hypothesis is that /9 is less or greater than zero:
 that expected stock market. returns are excessively or insufficiently volatile, respectively.
       Table 5 presents estimates of equation (4.8). The first VOW reports the results from weekly data
 over the period 1973-84, using a seven-day eurodollar interest ra!e. The estimate of /9 is -3.98, and
 is statistically different. from zero at the one percent. level. Once again, the finding that /9 < —1/2
 indicates that the lower variance hound is violated so that the forecast error has greater variance
 than actual excess returns. The second row of Table 5 itsesase yen-clay interest rate on repurchase
 agreements collateralized by ftS. government securities, which is available from DPI beginning in
 1980. The coefficient here is statistically less than —1/2 at the one percent level. In rows 3 through
9 of Table 5 we report estimates of equation (4.9) for longer horizons (one month and one year)
over the full Ibbotson sample and over 10 year siibsamples. All bitt one of the estimates of /9 are
less than zero1 though none is as large or statistically sigiiihcant as in the weekly data.303'

43. Excessive Forecast Volatility or Time-Varying Equity Premia?
       Naturally, an alternative explanation for the statistically significant coefficients in Tables 4 and
5 is that the eqnity premium, A, varies over time. Uufortunately, we have no survey data on stock
returns to which we-can appeal. Nevertheless we can gain a crude sense of whether a time-varying
equity premium could he responsible for the results. If the foregoing negative coefficients were
generated by a risk premium, then when nominal interest rates or price-dividend ratios are high,
expected excess returns are low. Lower expected excess returns imply that the equity premium,
                     .1 + r,÷1), must he high. In view of the large amoimt of predictable variation in
stock market variances and the consistently low variability of consumption, mitch of the variation
in the equity premium is likely to he due to changes in volatility iif stock ietimrmis.32 Indeed, Malkiel

(1979) and Pindyck (1984) argue that market movements largely reflect movements in perceived
      we include the second-order term, M1, then the null hypothesis implies n = /I = A.
  10The findings in Table 5 appear to he independent of' those in Table 4. When the exress market return is regressed
simultaneously on the price-dividend ratio and the interest rat.., isoth eneffiripigs remain virtually unchanged from those
reported in the tables above. Indeed, the. correlation between tlw pdre-.liviillrnil ratio a,;t flip short-term interest rate in the
1926-85 sample is only 0.07.
 ' A number of authors have found evidence of a negative correlation l,etwrrn short-term nominal interest rates and subsequent
stock market. return! both in the U.S. and in other industrialized countries as well (see Fama and Schwert, 1977 and Solnik,
1983). This is usually interpreted to mean t.h5t stock return, respond negat.i'eIy to .'xpect.-cl inflation, An intertemporal model
of asset pricing, which posits correlation between contemporaneosi.. returns and future exported returns is usually invoked to
explain this correlation.
  Merton (1980) consider, a model in which erpert.ed excess returns on the market are proportional to the variance.

                                                                19
  stork market volatility.33

       This alternative hypothesis would then imply that tin' expected volatility of stoc.k returns is
 negahvely correlated with the price-dividend ratio and the interest rate. To test for this pattern,
 we regress a measure of        volatility on price-dividend ratios and then on interest rates:

                                                        = a1 + siP, + 71,11                                          (4.lOa),



                                               &2,I+1 = (Y2 + 8211 + P721+1                                          (4.1Db),

 where             is the unexpected return oii the stork ]uarket front equation (4.8), and &2v+1 is
 unexpected return on the stork market from equation (4.0). TIn' time-varying equity premium
 hypothesis iniplies that & < 0. Under rational expectations and the assumption that equation
 (4.10) is a complete model of the expected future variance. the error terms are attributable to
 news, and are therefore conditionally independent of iiiforniatirnt available at time t. In case the
 error term contains left-out (orthogonal) variables we report standard errors using a covariance
 matrix estimator due to Newey and West (1985) which allows for unknown serial correlation.
      Table Ga and 6h present estimates of equations (4.1(M) and (4.1Db), respectively. The estimates
of 8 in Table Ga for different samples are of different signs. but only the estimate in the first row is
statistically significant at the 5 percent level and it is positive. Table Gb reports estimates of the
regression of unexpected returns on the interest rate. Here the estimates of 82 for the seven-day
holding periods are positive at the 5 percent level. On the other hand. the estimates for monthly
and annual holding periods are statistically less than zero. Fot' tin' shorter holding periods, there is
no evidence that the findings of excessively volatile expected returns ran be interpreted as variation
in the equity premia.34




     The' analysis of Fot.erha and Summer, (197) argues against this alternative hypothesis. It show, that while volatility
ritang., are substantial, they do not appear to he persistent enough to explain large movement, in stork prices.
  5401o'annini and Jorion (1987) regress the srpared return, on a rn,mhrr of as,et,s on seven-day nominal interest rate,1 and
report results similar to those in Table 6k Th.-y also find a signillrantlv positive relationship.

 5. Conclusions

      We have developed several simple regression tests of eXcessIve volatility in the foreign exchange
 market. awl the 15.3. stock market. These tests are easy to implement and are free of many the
 small-sample difficulties that plague tests of variance bounds relations.
     In the foreign exchange market, we find evidence (based 1)11 new results and reinterpretations of

old results) that exchange rates are excessively volatile. This Rnding holds whether expected future
spot rates are measured using the forward rate or survey data oji exchange rate expectations. One
potential explanation for such excessive volatility is that expected depreciation is too variable. We
cite and confirm an abundance of earlier evidence suggesting that expected exchange rate changes
are indeed too volatile. Once again, this conclusion holds regardless of whether the expected future
spot rate is measured using the forward rate or survey data.
     We also find analogous evidence of predictable variation in excess stock iiiarket returns, which
within our model can he interpreted as excessive stork price volatility and excessive volatility in
expected stock market returns. For shorter holding periods. We find 110 evidence that changes
in perceived volatility could account for tile inovenients iii equity premia required to explain this
excessive variation. Thus we join a host of other authors who reject the simple representative agent
model of stock prices, hut this time in favor of the specific alternative that expectations and stock
prices are too variable.

Notes: The symbols *, **, ***, represent significance at the 10, 5 and 1 percent levels,
respectively. Estimates are aggregated over 4 currencies, the pound, deutsch mark,
Swiss franc, and yen. Standard errors (reported in parentheses) are GPill without
heteroskedasticity correction. Overlapping observations in the one month data are
accounted for by allowing the residuals to follow an NA(3) process.

Notes:   All estimates are monthly data from April 1973 to February 1987. The first six
regressions are estimated using OLS, with standard errors (in parentheses) calculated
using GMM under homoskedasticity, and using White's heteroskedasticity correction,
respectively. The last regression combines all six currencies, and is estimated with
OLS.            represent significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
