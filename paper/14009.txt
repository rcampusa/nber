                                              ABSTRACT

We examine the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on the longevity of Australians during the period
1995-2003. Due to the government's Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, Australia has much better data
on drug utilization than most other countries. We find that mean age at death increased more for diseases
with larger increases in mean drug vintage. The estimates indicate that increasing the mean vintage
of drugs by 5 years would increase mean age at death by almost 11 months. The estimates also indicate
that using newer drugs reduced the number of years of potential life lost before the ages of 65 and
70 (but not before age 75). During the period 1995-2003, mean age at death increased by about 2.0
years, from 74.4 to 76.4. The estimates imply that, in the absence of any increase in drug vintage, mean
age at death would have increased by only 0.7 years. The increase in drug vintage accounts for about
65% of the total increase in mean age at death. We obtain a rough estimate of the cost per life-year
gained from using newer drugs. Under our assumptions, using newer drugs (increasing drug vintage)
increased life expectancy by 1.23 years and increased lifetime drug expenditure by $12,976; the cost
per life-year gained from using newer drugs is $10,585. An estimate made by other investigators of
the value of a statistical Australian life-year ($70,618) is 6.7 times as large as our estimate of the cost
per life-year gained from using newer drugs. We discuss several reasons why our estimate of the cost
per life-year gained from using newer drugs could be too high or too low.

        In previous papers, Lichtenberg (2005a, 2005b) has examined the impact of
pharmaceutical innovation on longevity in the United States and in a group of developed
and developing countries. Due to data limitations, the measure of pharmaceutical
innovation used in these studies was the cumulative number of drugs launched. These
studies provided support for the hypothesis that the introduction of new drugs has played
an important role in increasing longevity.
        In this paper, we will examine the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on the
longevity of Australians during the period 1995-2003. In one important respect, the data
available for Australia are much better than those used in the previous studies. Rather
than merely knowing whether a given drug has been launched in Australia by a certain
date, we know how frequently that drug is used in each year. Combining these data with
data from other sources enables us to calculate the mean vintage1 of drugs utilized in
Australia, by disease and year.
        Section I contains a discussion of the “embodied technological progress
hypothesis”. Section II describes an econometric model to test this hypothesis. Data
sources and descriptive statistics are presented in Section III. Empirical results are
presented in Section IV. Section V contains a summary and discussion.

I. Embodied technological progress hypothesis

        Economists believe that the development of new products is the main reason why
people are better off today than they were several generations ago. In their 1993 book,
Innovation and Growth in the Global Economy, Grossman and Helpman argued that
“innovative goods are better than older products simply because they provide more
‘product services’ in relation to their cost of production.” In their 1996 book, The
Economics of New Goods, Bresnahan and Gordon stated simply that “new goods are at
the heart of economic progress.” In a recent paper, Measuring the Growth from Better

  The dictionary contains several different definitions of vintage. The definition we use is: “a period of
origin or manufacture”. We define the vintage of a drug as the year in which the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) first approved the drug’s active ingredient. (The FDA, which has been in existence
since 1938, provides the most complete data on drug vintage.) For example, the vintage of Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme items 8213G, 8214H, 8215J, and 8521L is 1997, the year the active ingredient of all these
items (atorvastatin calcium) was approved by the FDA. (These items correspond to 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg
tablets, respectively.)
                                                                                                         4

and Better Goods, Bils (2004) makes the case that “much of economic growth occurs
through growth in quality as new models of consumer goods replace older, sometimes
inferior, models.”
        We seek to test the hypothesis that, ceteris paribus, people using newer, or later
vintage, drugs will be in better health, and will therefore live longer (die later). This
hypothesis is predicated on the idea that pharmaceuticals, like other R&D intensive
products, are characterized by embodied technological progress.
        A number of econometric studies (Bahk and Gort (1993), Hulten (1992),
Sakellaris and Wilson (2001, 2004)) have investigated the hypothesis that capital
equipment employed by U.S. manufacturing firms embodies technological change, i.e.
that each successive vintage of investment is more productive than the last. Equipment is
expected to embody significant technical progress due to the relatively high R&D-
intensity of equipment manufacturers. The method that has been used to test the
equipment-embodied technical change hypothesis is to estimate manufacturing
production functions, including (mean) vintage of equipment as well as quantities of
capital and labor. These studies have concluded that technical progress embodied in
equipment is a major source of manufacturing productivity growth.
        Although most previous empirical studies of embodied technical progress have
focused on equipment used in manufacturing, embodied technical progress may also be
an important source of economic growth in health care. One important input in the
production of health—pharmaceuticals—is even more R&D-intensive than equipment.
According to the National Science Foundation, the R&D intensity of drugs and medicines
manufacturing is 74% higher than the R&D intensity of machinery and equipment
manufacturing. Therefore, it is quite plausible that there is also a high rate of
pharmaceutical-embodied technical progress.
        The hypothesis that technical progress is embodied in pharmaceuticals may be
tested in two alternative ways. One approach is to investigate whether the health and
longevity of people with a given disease is positively related to the number of drugs that
have been approved to treat that disease.2 Lichtenberg adopted this approach in several


2
 In his model of endogenous technological change, Romer (1990) hypothesized the production function Y
(AL)1-α Kα, where Y = output, A = the “stock of ideas”, L = labor used to produce output, K = capital, and
                                                                                                        5

studies (2005a, 2005b, 2005c); in all of them, he found that increases in the cumulative
number of drugs improved health. This approach allows one to distinguish between the
effects of approval of “priority-review” drugs—drugs that the FDA considers to offer
significant improvements over existing therapies—and approval of “standard-review”
drugs—drugs that the FDA considers to be similar to previously approved drugs. In two
studies, Lichtenberg distinguished between the effects of priority-review and standard-
review drug approvals. The results of distinguishing between the two were mixed.
Lichtenberg (2005a) found that that approval of standard-review drugs had no effect on
longevity, but that approval of priority-review drugs had a significant positive impact on
longevity. But most of the results in Lichtenberg (2005c) indicated that the difference
between the effect of priority-and standard-review drugs on ability to work was not
statistically significant.
        The second way to test the hypothesis that technical progress is embodied in
pharmaceuticals is to investigate whether the health and longevity of people with a given
disease is positively related to the mean vintage (FDA approval year) of drugs used to
treat the disease. We believe that the second approach is superior to the first approach.
The drugs that have been approved to treat a given disease influence the therapy that a
patient could receive, but his health and longevity depend on the therapy he actually does
receive. The fact that a drug has been approved does not necessarily mean that it is
commonly used. In this paper we will pursue the second approach.
        Although we believe that mean vintage is a better measure of innovation than
number of previously-approved drugs, proper accounting for the distinction between
priority- and standard-review drugs when measuring drug vintage, while straightforward
in theory, is difficult in practice. Suppose a (standard-review) drug approved in 2008 is
“therapeutically equivalent” to a drug approved in 1998. Then the “effective vintage” of
the drug is 1998, whereas its actual vintage is 2008. (The effective vintage of a priority-
review drug is the same as its actual vintage.) If we could measure the effective vintage
of all drugs, we would use mean effective vintage instead of mean actual vintage in our
econometric model. However, although the FDA characterizes some drugs as


0 < α < 1. The cumulative number of drugs approved is analogous to the stock of (FDA-approved) ideas.
Health and longevity may be considered outputs of a health production function.
                                                                                                 6

therapeutically equivalent to previously approved drugs, it does not specify the drugs to
which they are therapeutically equivalent. Hence measurement of mean effective vintage
is not feasible.

II. Econometric model

           To test the hypothesis that pharmaceutical innovation has increased the longevity
of Australians, we will estimate the following econometric model:

           Yit = β [Σd N_RXdit FDA_YEARd / Σd N_RXdit] + αi + δt + εit

or         Yit =                       β Vit                         + αi + δt + εit       (1)

where
              Yit = a measure based on the age distribution of deaths from disease i
                  in year t
          N_RXdit = the number of times drug d was used to treat patients with
                  disease i in year t
       FDA_YEARd = the FDA approval year of the active ingredient of drug d
              Vit = Σd Ndit FDA_YEARd / Σd Ndit
                  = the mean vintage of drugs used to treat disease i in year t
              αi = fixed disease effects
               δt = fixed year effects

           There are both practical and theoretical reasons to define the vintage of a drug as
the year the drug was approved by the U.S. FDA rather than the year the drug was listed
(approved for reimbursement) in Australia’s Pharmaceutical Benefits Sceme (PBS). Data
on PBS listing dates are quite incomplete. We obtained unpublished data on listing dates
of drugs listed by the PBS after 1990.3 Based on a sample of 311 drugs for which both
FDA approval dates and PBS listing dates were available, we estimate that the mean lag
between FDA approval and PBS listing is 3.6 years. However we believe that the FDA
approval date is theoretically superior to the PBS listing date as a measure of vintage
(which is intended to indicate year of (global) market introduction or first use). The
vintage of a wine is the year the wine was bottled, not the year it was opened!

    We are grateful to Kim Sweeny of Victoria University for sharing these data with us.
                                                                                                        7

        In principle, health and longevity may be affected by lagged as well as current
mean drug vintage. However, including lagged vintage would substantially reduce the
size of our sample since we have data on Y and V in only 9 years (1995-2003).
Moreover, since vintage tends to be serially correlated, including lagged vintage terms
would introduce multicollinearity. We will therefore only include contemporaneous
vintage in the model.
        We will estimate the model using 4 different dependent variables. The first is the
mean age at death of Australians dying from disease i in year t:
        AGE_DEATHit = Σa (a N_DEATHait) / Σa N_DEATHait
where N_DEATHait is the number of deaths at age a from disease i in year t.
        The second is the logarithm4 of potential years of life lost before age 75 from
disease i in year t:
         LPYLL75it = ln[Σa max(75 – a, 0) N_DEATHait]
The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) reports both mean age at death
and potential years of life lost before age 75 in its General Records of Incidence of
Mortality. It also notes that the limit to life of 75 years is “arbitrary”. We will also
estimate models using two lower thresholds, 70 and 65:5
        LPYLL70it = ln[Σa max(70 – a, 0) N_DEATHait]
        LPYLL65it = ln[Σa max(65 – a, 0) N_DEATHait]
        All models will be estimated via weighted least squares. For the first model the
weight is the number of deaths from disease i in year t: N_DEATH.it = Σa N_DEATHait.
        For the second model the weight is the mean number of potential years of life lost
before age 75 from disease i during the 9 years 1995-2003: (1/9) Σt exp(LPYLL75it).
Analogous weights will be used for the two lower age thresholds.
        Due to the presence of fixed disease effects and year effects, eq. (1) is a
difference-in-differences model. If the dependent variable is mean age at death, a
positive and significant estimate of β would signify that there were above-average

  The logarithmic specification embodies the assumption that equal increases in vintage result in equal
percentage reductions in potential years of life lost.

  The 70-year threshold is the one used in the OECD Health Database for making international
comparisons. The 65-year threshold is the “default choice” in the U.S. Center for Disease Control’s Years
of Potential Life Lost Reports <http://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars/fatal/help/definitions.htm>.

increases in mean age at death for diseases with above-average increases in mean vintage
of drugs.

III. Data sources and descriptive statistics


Mortality data. The AIHW has compiled long-term mortality data on selected causes of
death by age and sex for each year from the beginning of the 20th century, and published
them in its GRIM (General Record of Incidence of Mortality) books. These are
interactive Excel workbooks updated annually containing comprehensive long-term
mortality data on selected causes of death by age and sex for each year. The GRIM books
have been grouped together by chapters as adopted by the 10th Revision of the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-
10). Each workbook contains mortality data, population data, derived data items (e.g.
age-specific and age-standardised rates), summary measures (e.g. mean age at death,
potential years of life lost, lifetime risk of dying), birth cohort information and graphs.
           The following table shows annual mortality data for all causes of death combined
for the period 1995-2003.

Pharmaceutical utilization data. Data on pharmaceutical utilization were obtained from
the National Social Health Statistical Data Library (HealthWIZ)6 a database on CD-ROM
that is used to disseminate comprehensive population health related statistical datasets,
across the Australian health services sector, for the purposes of clinical research, policy

development and health services planning, particularly in regional areas. Several datasets
contained in HealthWIZ are derived from the Australian Government’s Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme (PBS).7
        For nearly 60 years, the PBS has provided reliable, timely and affordable access
to a wide range of medicines for all Australians. Many medicines cost the Government
much more than the price paid by the patient – some cost hundreds, even thousands of
dollars, but the government provides a subsidy so that patients pay much less. The patient
receives the benefit of this subsidy when she has her prescription for a medicine filled
under the PBS. Current provisions governing the operations of the PBS are embodied in
Part VII of the National Health Act 1953 together with the National Health
(Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 made under the Act. The scheme has proven
itself to be one of the best drug subsidy systems in the world and around 80% of
prescriptions dispensed in Australia are subsidized under the PBS.8 Every time a patient
fills a prescription for a PBS medicine, she receives a subsidy. From 1 January 2006, the
patient pays up to $29.50 for most PBS medicines or $4.70 if she has a concession card.
The Australian Government pays the remaining cost. The PBS covered around 170
million prescriptions in the year to June 2005. This equates to about eight prescriptions
per person in Australia for the year. With new and more effective medicines helping us
to lead longer and healthier lives, the PBS is growing each year. The cost of the PBS is
currently around $6.0 billion per year.
        HealthWIZ provides data on the number of prescriptions filled under the PBS, by
drug and year, 1995-2004. This dataset contained information about approximately 700
drugs. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System is used for
the classification of drugs. It is controlled by the WHO Collaborating Centre for Drug
Statistics Methodology, and was first published in 1976. Drugs are divided into different
groups according to the organ or system on which they act and/or their therapeutic and

  Some of the reasons why a medicine may not be available on the PBS are: (1) the manufacturer has not
registered its product to treat a particular condition with the Therapeutic Goods Administration; (2) the
manufacturer did not apply to the government’s independent expert committee – the Pharmaceutical
Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) – to list the medicine on the PBS; and (3) the manufacturer hasn’t
supplied sufficient evidence, or the evidence supplied does not support a recommendation by the PBAC.

        The level and growth rate of vintage varies considerably across ATC groups.
Figure 1 depicts the mean vintage of two classes of drugs during 1995-2003.
Cardiovascular drugs tend to be much newer than antineoplastic and immunomodulating
agents; in 2003 the vintage of the latter was almost 10 years lower. The mean vintage of
cardiovascular system drugs increased almost twice as much during the first half of this
period (1995-1999) as it did during the second half (1999-2003). In contrast, the mean
vintage of antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents increased over four times as
much in the second half as it did in the first half.

IV. Empirical results

            Estimates of eq. (1) with four different dependent variables are shown in Table
     12
1.        The equations were estimated using annual data for the period 1995-2003 on the
eleven groups of diseases shown above: N = 99 (11 diseases * 9 years). All equations
include disease fixed effects and year fixed effects.
            The dependent variable of the first equation is the mean age at death of
Australians dying from disease i in year t. As shown in line 1, the coefficient on the
mean vintage of drugs is positive and statistically significant (p-value = 0.0497). This
indicates that mean age at death increased more for diseases with larger increases in mean
drug vintage. The point estimate of β indicates that increasing the mean vintage of drugs
by 5 years would increase mean age at death by almost 11 months. Additional
implications of the estimates of the first model will be considered below. Before doing
that, we will discuss estimates of the other three models.
            As shown in line 11, when the dependent variable is the logarithm of potential
years of life lost before age 75 from disease i in year t, the coefficient on the mean
vintage of drugs is negative but not statistically significant (p-value = 0.1787). However,
as shown in lines 21 and 31, when the age threshold is either 70 or 65, the coefficient on


12
     Data used to estimate eq. (1) are shown in Appendix Table 1.
                                                                                                           13

the mean vintage of drugs is negative and statistically significant (p-value = 0.0488 and
0.0135, respectively). This implies that using newer drugs has reduced premature
mortality—especially mortality before age 65—in the Australian population.13 The
estimates of the three potential years of life lost equations tend to confirm the estimates
of the mean age at death equation.
         We can use our estimates of the first equation to compare the actual increase in
mean age at death during the period 1995-2003 to the increase that would have occurred
in the absence of any increase in drug vintage.14 As shown in Figure 2, during this
period, mean age at death increased by about 2.0 years, from 74.4 to 76.4. The estimates
imply that, in the absence of any increase in drug vintage, mean age at death would have
increased by only 0.7 years. The increase in drug vintage accounts for about 65% of the
total increase in mean age at death.
         We can also obtain a rough estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using
newer drugs. The calculations are shown in the following table.
                                                                year

     death)                                                     75.13                 76.36              1.23

     capita ((4) * (3))                                      $11,109               $24,085          $12,976

Line 3 shows that per capita drug expenditure more than doubled in Australia from 1995
to 2003, from $148 to $315. For simplicity, suppose that all of this increase was due to
the fact that the drugs used in 2003 were newer than those used in 1995. Line 4 shows
the increase in “life expectancy” (mean age at death) that is attributable to increasing
drug vintage. Line 5 shows “lifetime” drug expenditure per capita: annual expenditure


13
   The magnitude of the point estimate in line 31 is about 35% larger than the magnitude of the point
estimate in line 21. But since the number of years of potential life lost before age 70 is about 47% higher
than the number of years of potential life lost before age 65, these two models yield similar estimates of the
absolute reduction in years of potential life lost from increasing drug vintage.
14
   The increase that would have occurred in the absence of any increase in drug vintage is measured by the
differences between the year fixed effects shown in lines 2-10 of Table 1.

times life expectancy. Under our assumptions, using newer drugs (increasing drug
vintage) increased life expectancy by 1.23 years and increased lifetime drug expenditure
by $12,976. The cost per life-year gained from using newer drugs is $10,585 (=
$12,976/1.23).
        Viscusi (2005), citing Kniesner and Leeth (1991), estimates that the value of a
statistical Australian life is 4.2 million USD, which is equal to $A 5.4 million at the
current exchange rate (1.2839 $A/USD). This implies that the value of a statistical
Australian life-year is $70,618 (=$A 5.4 million / 76.4). This value is 6.7 times as large
as our estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using newer drugs.


V. Summary and discussion


        We have examined the impact of pharmaceutical innovation on the longevity of
Australians during the period 1995-2003. Due to the government’s Pharmaceutical
Benefits Scheme, Australia has much better data on drug utilization than most other
countries.
        We found that mean age at death increased more for diseases with larger increases
in mean drug vintage. The estimates indicated that increasing the mean vintage of drugs
by 5 years would increase mean age at death by almost 11 months. The estimates also
indicated that using newer drugs reduced the number of years of potential life lost before
the ages of 65 and 70 (but not before age 75).
        During the period 1995-2003, mean age at death increased by about 2.0 years,
from 74.4 to 76.4.16 The estimates implied that, in the absence of any increase in drug
vintage, mean age at death would have increased by only 0.7 years. The increase in drug
vintage accounts for about 65% of the total increase in mean age at death.
        We obtained a rough estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using newer
drugs. Under our assumptions, using newer drugs (increasing drug vintage) increased life
expectancy by 1.23 years and increased lifetime drug expenditure by $12,976; the cost



16
  Lichtenberg (2005a) found that, in the U.S., within-disease increases in mean age at death accounted for
about 80% of the aggregate long-term increase in mean age at death; the remaining 20% was due to a shift
in the distribution of fatal diseases.
                                                                                                             15

per life-year gained from using newer drugs is $10,585.17 An estimate made by other
investigators of the value of a statistical Australian life-year ($70,618) is 6.7 times as
large as our estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using newer drugs.
         For several reasons, our estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using newer
drugs could be too high or too low. Studies based on U.S. data (Lichtenberg (2001,
2005c, 2006)) indicate that use of newer drugs reduces admissions to hospitals and
nursing homes, and increases ability to work. By not accounting for this, we may have
overestimated the cost per Australian life-year gained.
         Use of newer drugs may have cross-disease spillover effects: using newer drugs
for one disease may either increase or decrease mortality from other diseases (in part due
to “competing risks”). Such spillovers could be either negative or positive. For example,
using a newer drug to treat cancer might reduce cancer mortality but increase life-years
lost due to cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, using a newer drug to treat
depression and other mental disorders might lead to better management of cardiovascular
disease.
         Finally, innovation in medical devices and procedures, as well as in drugs, have
undoubtedly contributed to Australian longevity increase.18 The models we have
estimated control (via year fixed effects) for device/procedure innovation that is common
to all diseases, but not for disease-specific device/procedure innovation: measuring
disease-specific device/procedure innovation is far more challenging than measuring
disease-specific drug innovation. Since device/procedure innovation may either
substitute for or complement drug innovation, controlling for disease-specific
device/procedure innovation could either decrease or increase our estimate of the cost per
life-year gained from using newer drugs.
         Our findings, which are based on aggregate data, are broadly consistent with
previous findings based on individual-level data. Lichtenberg and Virabhak (2007)
examined the impact of drug vintage on health and longevity using data on (American)
individuals before and after the drugs were consumed. They found that people who used

17
   This is an estimate of the cost per life-year gained from using newer drugs in general. It is likely that the
cost per life-year gained from some newer drugs is higher, and from other newer drugs is lower, than this
average.
18
   However, the biopharmaceutical industry is much more R&D-intensive than the medical device and
equipment industry.
                                                                                              16

newer drugs had better post-treatment health than people using older drugs for the same
condition, controlling for pre-treatment health, age, sex, race, marital status, education,
income, and insurance coverage: they were more likely to survive, their perceived health
status was higher, and they experienced fewer activity, social, and physical limitations.
Most of the health measures indicated that the effect of drug vintage on health is higher
for people with low initial health than it is for people with high initial health. This
suggests that pharmaceutical-embodied technical progress has a tendency to reduce
inequality as well as promote economic growth, broadly defined.
