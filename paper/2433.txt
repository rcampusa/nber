                      The Effect of Mental Distress on Income:

                          Results from a Community Survey




                                     ABSTRACT


      We employ a unique data set from a community based survey to assess the

  effect of mental distress on earnings. The main advantage of the data is that

  detailed measurements of mental health status were made on all subjects in the

  study. This means that our population—based measure of mental distress does

  not rely on a patient having had contact with the health care system and ob-

  taining a diagnosis from a provider. The use of diagnosis—based measures may

   introduce measurement—error bias into the estimates. Our results show that

   the presence of mental distress reduces earnings by approximately 21% to 33%.

  To assess the magnitude of any measurement—error bias we present a estimates

   of models using measures of mental health both on a population—wide basis and

  on a diagnosis basis. The estimated impact of mental illness on earning is

  only 9% lower using the using the diagnosis—based measure. The conclusion

  drawn from this is that little bias is introduced by using the diagnosis—based

  measure.

I. Introduction

    Economists have long been interested in the social cost of illness. Not

surprisingly, much of the attention has been focused on the labor market. In

this work we employ a unique data set from a community based survey to assess

the effect of mental distress on earnings. The main advantage of the data is

that detailed measurements of mental health status were made on all subjects

in the study. This means that our measure of mental distress does not rely on

a patient having had contact with the health care system and obtaining a diag-

nosis from a provider.

    Relying on health status measures obtained from contacts with the medical

sector is common in much of the analysis of the impact of illness on earnings.

The use of these measures may introduce measurement—error bias into the

estimates. The measurement error arises because mentally—ill individuals who

did not seek medical care will appear as "mentally healthy" in the data. The

measurement error is the result of some individuals selecting to obtain medi-

cal care and others not. Since the selection of medical care is likely to be

a function of some of the exogenous determinant of earnings such as education,

there is reason to believe that the measurement error may be correlated with

other right—side variables in the earnings function and thus bias the

estimates.

    Two   important   advantages of diagnosis—based measures make them preferable

if the measurement—error bias can be demonstrated to be small. First, diag-

nosis based measures are available in many data sets whereas population—based

measures are not, and second, diagnosis—based measures are substantially

easier and cheaper to collect. One objective of our research is to investiga-

te the degree of the bias.

     Our results show that the presence of mental distress reduces earnings by

approximately 21% to 33%. These estimates are of the same order of magnitude

as were found in previous studies, which are surveyed in detail in section II.

To assess the magnitude of any measurement—error bias we present a estimates

of models using measures of mental health both on a population—wide basis and

on a diagnosis basis. The estimated impact of mental illness on earning is

only 9% lower using the using the diagnosis—based measure. The conclusion

drawn from this is that little bias is introduced by using the diagnosis—based

measure.


II. Background

    Several studies of the impact of mental disorders on earnings have been

reported in the literature. These include Bartel and Taubman (1979, 1986) and

Benham and Benhain     (1981)   who have used micro data to systematically assess the

separate   effect of mental distress on earned income1 All of these articles

use diagnosis—based measures of mental distress.

    Bartel and Taubman (1979, 1986) made use of the National Academy of

Science —   National   Research Council (NAS—NRC) panel of twins to analyze the

impact of various illnesses on labor market activity. Thesedata presented a

unique opportunity to study the persistence of the effects of illness on earn-

ings overtime. This is art especially salient issue for mental illness since

it is often a chronic condition.


1 Studies by Levine and Levine (1974) and Cruze et al (1981) have made ag-
gregate estimates of lost earnings due to mental illness. Those studies will
not be treated here.
                                      3

    In Bartel and Taubman (1979) estimates were made of the impact of diag-

noses of psychosis and neurosis, made at various points over a 25 year time

period, on 1973 earnings. The results indicated that recent diagnoses of men-

tal disorders were associated with a significant and large reduction in earn-

ings relative to individuals with no mental disorders. They report a roughly

24% reduction in 1973 earnings attributed to the presence of a psychiatric

diagnosis made between 1968 and 1973. In contrast, a psychiatric diagnosis

made in the years 1948 to 1954 had no effect on 1973 earnings. The size of

the estimated effects on earnings underscore the disabling nature of mental

disorders.

    The subsequent paper by Bartel and Taubman (1986) probed the link between

mental illness and reduced earnings further. They did so by using a finer

definition of mental disorder, which differentiated psychoses from neuroses

from other disorders. Also, earnings throughout the period were used thereby

making fuller use of the panel design. The results indicated that recent (1

to 5 years) diagnoses of psychosis were linked to a 37% reduction in earnings

compared to unimpaired individuals. A psychotic diagnosis made 11 to 15 years

previously was estimated to reduce earnings by 27%. Recent neuroses were

found to reduce earnings by about 11%, while neuroses uncovered 11 to 15 years

earlier reduced earnings by 13%, a somewhat puzzling finding.2 Other mental

disorders only had a significant impact when they were recent. The estimated

effect was a 24% reduction in earnings.

cients (b) in the following manner IMPACT— eb_l.

    Benham   and   Benham (1981) used a sample of 244 men who were studied at two

points in time over a 30 year period. Data from personal interviews, clinic,

hospital and military records were used to assign lifetime diagnoses of mental

disorders. The impact of psychosis, sociopathy, alcoholism, and neurosis on

earnings were analyzed. The diagnoses therefore reflected whether an individu-

al had ever experienced a diagnosable mental disorder. Thus, the impacts of

more chronic conditions such as psychoses should have more pronounced impacts

than more transient disorders such as neuroses (independent of initial

severity).

    The estimated impacts for psychoses on weekly earnings ranged from a

reduction of 27% to a reduction of 35%. Sociopathy had no significant impact

on earnings nor did alcoholism. Neurosis surprisingly had a significant posi-

tive impact on weekly earnings equal to about a 23% increase over individuals

with no such disorder. These results again suggest that serious mental disor-

ders can have a pronounced and rather long lasting impact on labor market out-

comes.


III. Data

    This work uses data from the Baltimore ECA survey, which is one of five in

the Epidemiological Catchment Area study (Eaton et al. 1981). The study,

which was principally aimed at establishing prevalence and incidence estimates

for mental disorders in the adult population of East Baltimore, collected

detailed information on health and mental health care utilization.

    The survey was based on a longitudinal design which included two face—to—

face interviews 1 year apart and a telephone interview between personal con—
                                      5

tacts (for a total of 3 waves of data collection). The geographic area cov-

ered by the Baltimore ECA is the eastern third of Baltimore City, an area with

a population of 241,000 which was 38% black and where 19% of the population is

Medicaid eligible. The field survey was designed to obtain household inter-

views with one randomly selected person from those 18 to 64 years of age and

with every household member 65 or older; proxy respondents were accepted for

2.7% of subjects who were ill or had language problems. The overall response

rate in the baseline survey was 78% which resulted in 3481 completed inter-

views. The followup six month telephone survey and the one year household

survey had response rates of 83% and 81% of the original sample respectively.

The longitudinal sample was compared to the baseline sample for evidence of

systematic selection by respondents (Shapiro et al. 1984). Only minor dif-

ferences were found between the two samples which should not influence

analyses of income. The questionnaire used in the household survey contained

a battery of mental health and health status measures.

    At the core of the ECA data base is the Diagnostic Interview Schedule

(DIS), a structured questionnaire administered by lay interviewers that in-

clude data for computer generated diagnoses according to the criteria

specified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Third Edition (DSM)III) of

the American Psychiatric Association. Other mental health status measures in-

clude: a score on the Mini—Mental State Examination (Minimental), a question

as to whether a disability day occurred due to an emotional problem, and a 20

item version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) (Goldberg 1972). The

GHQ identifies current symptoms of distress and demoralization and is designed

to identify individuals at high risk of emotional distress. While the scale
                                       6

provides a numerical index of syinptomatology (the properties of which are not

clear) a score of 4 or more has been shown by Goldberg to designate individu-

als at high risk of having a diagnosable mental disorder which implies non-

linearity in the numerical scale.

    All three waves of the ECA collected detailed health care utilization in-

formation. Thus, a complete picture of utilization based on three consecutive

six month recall periods is possible. The complete health and mental health

status battery was only administered during the two face—to—face interviews.

Nevertheless, the panel design allows us to study the impact of mental health

status at one point in time on earnings over the subsequent year. This makes

causal inferences somewhat clearer in this study than in traditional cross

section study designs. The analysis performed below uses a sample of 882

males between the ages of 18 and 64 to study the impact of mental problems on

earnings.


IV. The Model and Measurement of Variables

    We employ the standard model of earnings, where the log of income is ex-

pressed as a linear function of education and other demographic variables one

of which is mental—health status.   The demographic variables used in specifi-

cations estimated below draw on the human capital formulation of earnings.

That is, an individual's wage rate is equal to his or her marginal product

which depends on ability, investments in the acquisition of skills and work

effort. Mental disorders may effect productivity in a variety of ways. They

may make skill acquisition more costly and thereby result in lower skill

levels among the mentally ill. Mental problems may decrease the intensity of
                                       7

work effort either through factors such as absenteeism or by diminished cogni-

tive function.

    The rest of this section is devoted to discussing the measurement of the

variables used to estimate the earnings functions. Table 1 presents descrip—

tive statistics and variable definitions for the variables discussed below.

    The dependent variable is defined as an individual's gross contribution

(from all sources) to his household's income. This is not the ideal measure

of earnings because it includes unearned income. The data set does identify

sources of unearned income, most of which is derived from transfer programs.

It is possible to include dummy variables on the right hand side of the earn-

ings equations which, in principle, control for unearned income (this point    is
addressed   in greater detail in the discussion of model specification). The

level of income is measured in $1000 to $5000 increments dependent on the

level of income.3 We used a Kolmogorov—Smirnov test to assess the distribu-

tion of the income variable. The lognornial distribution of earnings could not

be rejected at the 0.20 confidence level. The income variable is transformed

into logs in the regression models presented below.

    Measuring mental health status is a difficult problem where any solution

is subject to important caveats (Ware et al. 1983). The approach taken here

draws on the previous work of Shapiro et al. (1985) and Frank (1987). The ECA

is a rich source of information on mental health status; the DIS, CHQ and self

report questions provide three separate and somewhat different assessments of


3 There was an open ended category at the 50,000 dollar level. We used census
data from 1980 for the relevant census tracts to estimate the mean of that
category. It was roughly 67,00 dollars. Thus some measurement error is pres—
ent.
                                      8

signs, symptoms and distress associated with mental health problems. Each of

the indicators of mental health status is limited in various ways. The DIS

and standardized diagnoses made by clinicians had very uneven rates of agree-

ment across psychiatric diagnoses (Anthony et al., 1985). The GHQ was

originally designed as an aid to primary care clinicians in evaluating mental

health status. It's stability has been questioned in previous research

(Shapiro et al. 1985). Self reported disability due to a mental disorder is

generally viewed as a strict criteria requiring rather severe distress.

    The approach taken in this research to measuring mental distress is based

on Shapiro et al.'s (1985) measure of need. Our measure makes use of all

three measures of mental health status: A DSMIII diagnosis is measured by the

DIS and the Minimental (score of less than 18); a GHQ score indicating at

least four symptoms of psychiatric distress; and a self reported disability

day due to a mental or emotional problem. Because we are reluctant to rely on

any single indicator we set a criteria that an individual had to be identified

as suffering from mental or emotional problems by at least two of the three

indicators to be considered in mental distress. In order to make the in-

dicators consistent with one another we used the two week version of the DIS

and the self report questions. Our measure of mental distress is thereby an

indicator of a clustering of signs and symptoms of a mental disorder. In this

study we use a simple dichotomous variable equal to one when at least two in-

dications are present and zero otherwise. In a previous analysis Frank (1987)

used this indicator both as a dichotomous variable and as an ordinal variable

that could take on a value from zero to three. In that analysis he found that

little added information resulted from use of the ordinal variable.

    In order to trace the consequences of using a measure of mental health

status which depends on contact with a service provider we experiment with a

mental health status measure which is an interaction of the mental distress

variable defined above with utilization of health services where a mental

problem was discussed.4 This diagnosis—based measure will allow us to compare

our mental distress measure with one that is similar to the one used by Bartel

and Taubman (1979, 1986).

    Several socio—demographic variables are specified in the earnings models

to account for the human capital of individuals. These variables include age

(specified as a quadratic), sex, race, marital status, and educational attain-

ment measured in years of schooling. In order to account for household ef-

fects such as other income sources and demand for goods and services we

measure the number of children in a subject's household, and the number of

other adults in the household. Finally we include dummy variables that ac-

count for the receipt of various sorts of transfer payments. These are: wel-

fare unemployment compensation, social security, and disability payments.


V. Estimation

    The earnings function is estimated using two different specifications and

two different estimators. Since we could not reject a lognormal distribution

for income and some of the observations reported zero income, we estimated a

Tobit model where the non—zero observations are transformed into logs. This

approach will result in unbiased and consistent estimates. However, since


4 This is a self reported question of each subject. Some validation studies
have been done of this approach and have found the responses to be quite ac-
curate.
                                      10

only 8% of the observations had values of zero for income, we also used or-

dinary least squares to estimate a model where the dependent variable is

specified as the log of income plus one. This approach is not strictly ap-

propriate and may not result in consistent estimates.

    Two general specifications are used with both of the estimators. The

first model includes the indicators of transfer payments so that the other

coefficients in the model can be interpreted as measuring impacts on earned

income (total income net of transfer payments). However, since we were con-

cerned with the potential endogeneity of the transfer income indicators, a

version was estimated using only variables that were clearly exogenous. This

meant excluding the the transfer program dummy variables from the regression.

Both specifications are reported using the two approaches to estimation.

    Finally, we estimated a version where the mental health variable only took

on a value of one if both the mental health status criteria were met and con-

tact with a health care provider had been made. This was meant to approximate

a diagnosis—based mental health status variable similar to that used by Bartel

and Taubman.


VI. Results

    Table 2 presents parameters estimates and t—statistics for the five earn-

ings models. Columns 1—3 report ordinary least squares regressions on the log

of earnings (plus one). The first two columns present results using the

population—based measure of mental health status. The third column presents

results which use the diagnosis—based mental health status measure. The

fourth and fifth columns report Tobit estimates on the log of earnings. Both

of the Tobit models use the population—based mental health status measure.
                                      11

   The coefficient estimates for most variables are consistent with the find-

ings of previous research. For example, years of schooling is positively and

significantly related to earnings. The elasticities implied by the coeffi-

cient estimates vary between 0.40 and 0.61 depending on whether the transfer

income dummy variables were included or excluded. The coefficients for racial

status, age and marital status were all significantly different from zero at

conventional levels. Nonwhite racial status and being unmarried reduced earn-

ings while increasing age increased earnings but at a decreasing rate.

    The variable of primary interest is the measure of mental distress (MEN-

TAL). The magnitude of the coefficient estimate is quite sensitive to model

specification. In both the OLS and Tobit models the exclusion of the transfer

income variables increased the estimated coefficient for the MENTAL variable

by over 50%. The eligibility criteria for several of the transfer programs

are related to mental disorder. For instance, one can qualify for Supplemen-

tal Security Income on the basis of chronic mental illness. Similarly, one

can receive Social Security Disability payments due to a disabling mental con-

dition. We therefore suspect that biases due to omitted variables are of more

concern than simultaneous equations bias.5 This leads us to prefer results

based on the specifications which include the transfer payment indicators.

The coefficients were not sensitive to the estimator used. Although the

estimates for the Tobit models were substantially more precise than in the OLS

niodels (as might be expected).


5 This is especially true when analyzing the male population where only wel-
fare transfer payments are strictly income linked and only 2% of the sample
received such transfers.
                                      12

    Table 3 presents the earnings impacts implied by the coefficient

estimates. The results suggest that individuals meeting our criteria for men-

tal distress earn between 21% (in the model with transfers) and 33% (in the

model without transfers) less than otherwise similar individuals.

    Comparing columns (1) and (3) of Tables 2 and 3 allow us to trace the con-

sequences of using a mental health status measure that is conditioned on use

of health care services. Roughly 50% of the subjects with a mental problem

are misclassified using the indicator which depends on services utilization.

However, the coefficient estimates for MENTAL are only slightly lower for the

regression reported in column (3). The differences in the estimated earnings

impact amount to 1.8 percentage point (not a significant difference). One ex-

planation for this is that the most severe cases of mental disorder are sub-

stantially more likely to obtain care than are less severely ill individuals.

For instance the rate of utilization is far higher for patients with major

depressive disorders than for panic disorder. Thus, because individuals who

are least dysfunctional are least likely to seek care the bias from the use of

the mental health status variable conditional on use is small.


VI. Concluding Remarks

    Mental disorders are seriously disabling conditions. The onset of

illnesses are disruptive and impose substantial costs to society. In the re-

search presented here we used a rich data set from a community survey to

estimate the effect of a clustering of indicators of mental distress had on

earnings of adult males. The results show a substantial impact, which is con-

sistent with several previous studies.
                                      13

    We also examined the degree to which relying on health status measures

which require contacts with the health care system cause bias in estimates of

the impact of illness on earnings. The results suggest that the bias is small

because the most severe cases are most likely to seek care.

    Further work on the social costs of specific disorders would be useful.

Unfortunately the data set used here does not have sufficient numbers of cases

in many key diagnostic categories to pursue such questions. Moreover, the DIS

diagnostic instrument may introduce sufficient measurement error when used by

itself as to decrease confidence in findings.
