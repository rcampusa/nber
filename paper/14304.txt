                                             ABSTRACT

This paper has two objectives. First, we identify a problem with the ability of the discrete-continuous
choice (DCC) framework and conditional demand functions to fully describe consumer preferences
in the presence of kinked budget constraints. Second, we propose and illustrate an alternative, preference
based, method for estimating consumer responses to price changes under these conditions. Our preference
based approach yields price elasticities on the order of 0.4 and a "utilities expenditure" elasticity of
near unity. This research highlights the possibility that households may be more sensitive to price
schedules than previously thought. It is recognizes commitments to commodities such as pools or outdoor
landscaping influence how water consumption responds to price changes as part of the long run adjustments.

I. Introduction

         This paper has two objectives. First, we identify a general problem in using the

discrete-continuous choice (DCC) framework and conditional demand functions for

applied welfare analysis with changes in kinked budget constraints. To illustrate the

relevance of our argument, we consider the estimation issues that arise for the case of

models for residential water demand with increasing block rate structures. Second, we

propose an alternative, preference based, method for estimating consumer responses

under these conditions. By specifying a direct utility function and estimating its

parameters, our approach can evaluate policies that alter all the attributes of a block

pricing structure. For the case of residential water demand, in many areas of the United

States, especially in the arid Southwest, this type of change is being discussed as a

component of increased incentives for conservation.1 At a national level, it is also part of

EPA’s policy known as the “Four Pillars of Sustainable Infrastructure.”2

         Conventional models for commodity demand (or labor supply) in the presence of

a piece-wise linear budget constraints use a parametric specification for the conditional

demand (labor supply) function to describe the selection of a “best facet” on the budget

constraint and with it, an amount of the commodity demanded (or labor supplied). The

choice is decomposed into the discrete and continuous components. This strategy has

been widely adopted in describing labor supply responses including differences in

participation status (i.e. working, retired, etc), and the extent of participation, part time

vs. full time. It has also been an important component modeling of the strategies used to

consistently estimate electricity and water demands in the presence of block rate pricing

structures.

       By contrast, our proposed method uses a different maintained assumption. It

specifies household preferences using a direct utility function. As a result, there are also

assumptions that underlie the model’s results. One of the important questions arises from

identification. That is, given a preference specification, a key issue concerns whether we

can identify and estimate the structural parameters using the first order conditions from

the constrained choice problem. The limited price variation usually encountered in

applying the model to households in a single region can confound the ability to observe

quantity adjustments.

       We illustrate the logic for our method with an application to the residential water

demand for the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area. Our empirical model uses monthly

consumption data for 2005 for the “average” household (in a single family dwelling) in

the service areas of each of 43 water service providers in the Phoenix Active

Management Area (PAMA) of Arizona. By intersecting the GIS descriptions of the

water providers’ service areas with the GIS records for 2000 Census at the block group

level and the Maricopa County (the county within PAMA) parcel records, we construct a

set of economic, residential property, and demographic variables to serve as instruments.

We compare our results for the preference model with the conventional DCC framework

applied to the same sample and find the later yields insignificant income coefficients and

smaller (in absolute magnitude) conditional price elasticity estimates.

        Section two describes the main elements of our argument. It begins by describing

the DCC framework. After that, we explain one of the issues motivating this paper –an

apparent contradiction between the Hausman [1979] interpretation of what is possible

within the DCC framework and the Bockstael-McConnell [1981] conclusion about the

difficulties facing welfare measurement with nonlinear budget constraints. With that

background, we then summarize how Reiss and White [2006] explain the appropriate

strategy for welfare measurement with nonlinear budget constraints.3 Within that

context, we describe the problems with using the DCC logic to evaluate large changes in

a block pricing structure for resources whose demands are largely determined by the

utilization of complementary goods. Section three outlines the estimation strategy.

Section four describes the data sources and five presents our results. The last section

comments on the potential role measures of the responsiveness of water demand to major

revisions in the price schedule can play in the design of policies intended to be part of

developing sustainable infrastructure.4



II.     Background and Economic Consistency

        A.       Context

        Water demand is one of the prominent applications for models explaining

consumer choice in the presence of kinked budget constraints. The Hewitt and Hanemann

[1995] paper is the first, and arguably the most comprehensive, application of the DCC

framework to water demand. Their analysis follows the general recommendations of


3
  To our knowledge, none of the water demand models have attempted to measure the consumer surplus
associated with price changes. Most of their focus has been correctly measuring unconditional price
elasticities in the presence of kinked budget constraints.

  For example see Hanak and Chen [2007].


                                                                                                      4
Hausman [1979] and Moffit [1986] for these situations. A conditional demand is

specified. In their case, it is a constant elasticity function. The price and virtual income

for the conditional demand are defined by the first stage selection of an optimal budget

segment given the block pricing structure. Two errors are included in the specification.

One represents optimization error and the second captures unobserved heterogeneity.

Given assumed distributions for these errors (usually independent normality), observed

water use, and knowledge of the specific features of the pricing structure faced by

households, the framework defines the likelihood function for a sample of households’

water consumption. Variation in the pricing structures, the maintained distributions for

the errors, and the parametric specification for conditional demand function allows

statistically consistent estimates to be developed.

         The DCC model characterizes consumer preferences with the specification of a

conditional demand function. The same functional form and parameterization is used to

describe all of the segments of an increasing block rate structure. This restriction assures

that the parameters can be identified. To illustrate our argument here, we selected the

simplest of the popular specifications, a linear conditional demand given in equation

(2.1):

                                     wi = Z γ + α pi + δ mi                               (2.1)

         Water is assumed to be priced with an increasing block rate structure with the

nonlinear price for water defined as c( w) and the form of the relationship given in


equation (2.2). Assuming a two block pricing structure, p corresponds to the higher

marginal price (the second block) and p the initial block’s marginal price. ŵ is the




                                                                                               5
threshold for the change in the marginal price (the amount of water defining kink point

on the budget constraint ).

                                     ⎧       pw         if w ≤ wˆ
                              c(w) = ⎨                                                    (2.2)
                                     ⎩ p(w - wˆ ) + pwˆ if w > wˆ

       Z is a vector of socio-demographic and household specific attributes, pi is the

marginal price of the ith block and mi is the virtual income of the ith block. m2 , the

virtual income of the second block, is defined by equation (2.3):

                                        m 2 = m + (p - p )wˆ                              (2.3)

       Following Hausman [1979], the quasi indirect utility function implied by this

conditional demand specification is derived by Roy’s identity. The first step links the

specified conditional Marshallian demand from equation (2.1) to the relationship implied

by Roy’s identity in equation (2.4). This sequence describes how the differential

equation given on the right hand side of the equation is related to the empirical demand

function.

                                   Vp         dm
                               −        =w=      = α p + δ m + Zγ                         (2.4)
                                   Vm         dp

       Solving this differential equation yields equation (2.5), where c is the constant of

integration:

                                               ⎛α   α Zγ ⎞
                                   m = ce −δ p ⎜ p + 2 +                                  (2.5)
                                               ⎝δ   δ    δ ⎟⎠

       As a rule, initial conditions help to relate c to the other factors that may influence

the quantity demanded and also serve to provide the utility index. For our purposes,




                                                                                                6
without loss of generality, we can write the expression for of the indirect utility function

implied by this demand using equation (2.6)5:

                                                      ⎛    α   α Zγ ⎞
                                   V ( p, m) = e −δ p ⎜ m + p + 2 +                     (2.6)
                                                      ⎝    δ   δ    δ ⎟⎠

           A part of Hausman’s argument for the model noted that the log likelihood

function can be defined from the conditional demand functions. Thus, it is possible to

recover parameter estimates for (2.6) using the conditional demand given in equation

(2.1). It relies on the restriction of a common conditional demand specification for all

facets of the budget constraint. Moreover, it restricts the demand parameters to be equal

across all blocks. The estimator resembles one for interval censored data, adjusted to

reflect the effect of block choice on the implied virtual income (i.e. actual income

adjusted by the difference between what would be implied if all units consumed were

priced at the marginal price implied by the selected price block and what each household

actually pays as we have described in equation (2.3)). What is important about this logic

is that it would appear that the estimated parameters of the conditional demand function

contain sufficient information for welfare measurement when they are used in the scheme

outlined by Reiss and White. However, this suggestion overlooks the importance of the

assumption that conditional demand functions “look just like” unconditional demand

functions aside from the adjustment to the income term. We can investigate the

importance by examining the Reiss-White proposal in more detail.

    The direct utility function implied by equation is:
                ⎛ δ⎛      α         ⎞⎞      ⎛ 2 ⎛ x ⎞⎞    ⎛ δ ⎛α    ⎞⎞⎛ w α ⎞

                                                                                               7
        A key conclusion of the earlier work discussing problems with applied welfare

analysis in the presence of nonlinear budget constraints is that with a nonlinear budget

constraint, the Marshallian “prices as parameters” demand function (or labor supply

function) does not exist! Bockstael and McConnell [1983] made this point in discussing

the implications of the household production function (HPF) framework for applied

welfare analysis. Reiss and White’s [2006] might seem to have proposed a resolution to

the problem. However, their derivation of welfare measures with nonlinear prices relies

on the ability to assume the existence of what appears to be an ordinary Marshallian

demand function that can be integrated back to quasi-expenditure function. The resulting

compensated demand is then used with the marginal price function to develop the welfare

measures. This marginal price function helps in describing the path of price change.

        Reconciling the two disparate arguments requires understanding the role for the

assumed properties of the “Marshallian” demands defined for each value of the marginal

price. Marginal prices can be continuous in the household production case considered by

Bockstael and McConnell or they can change discretely for the kinked budget constraint

due to block rate pricing. It is this relationship that is giving rise to the nonlinearity in the

budget constraint.6 As Bockstael and McConnell demonstrate in note #1 (p. 810) with a

general nonlinear budget constraint, the features of preferences and nature of the

constraint are scrambled. In their example, each of the marginal cost functions will imply

a different slope for the Marshallian demand function. Reiss and White’s argument

requires that there exists a single Marshallian demand that describes how quantity



6
 It also influences the relationship between the sum of the quasi expenditure function and the infra
marginal expenditure adjustment to derive the unobserved arguments needed for the Hicksian welfare
measure in the Reiss and White [2006] framework. See 10-11 for their discussion.


                                                                                                       8
demand changes for each marginal price.7 This is essentially the same as what is being

assumed in the DCC framework. We must assume preferences are consistent with an

identical conditional demand for all price facets of the kinked budget constraint.

         This requirement stands in contrast with conclusions from the literature on the

econometrics of kinked budget constraints that appear much more general in their scope.

For example, Hausman [1979] has argued that demand (or supply) functions can be

estimated without instrumental variables or a weighted average of prices. Roy’s identity,

together with the convexity of the budget set, assure that the choice of segment and the

quantity demanded can be based solely on the “demand functions.”8

         The DCC framework describes the unconditional demand in a two step

framework. A conditional demand function is used to describe both the choice of the

“best” price segment on the kinked budget constraint as well as the quantity demanded,

given the marginal price and virtual income implied by the first selection. The

framework uses the logic implied by analytical (or numerical) solution to the differential

equation defined by Roy’s identity to compute the correct response in quantity demanded

to a movement along one segment of the faceted budget constraint. However, as Reiss

and White make clear, this result requires the assumption that a common (across facets)


7
  Following Edelfsen [1981] it is possible to define a relationship (correspondence) between the marginal
price/cost implied by the nonlinear constraint for each value of this partial derivative and in principle
numerically implements the Reiss-White logic. At each of the steps of the process, define the Marshallian
relationship for that marginal price, apply a Vartian approximation and solve the implied extension to Reiss
and White’s two equation framework for a specific marginal price and utility level. A comparable issue
arises with hedonic models and the definition of “demand” functions for the characteristics of
heterogeneous goods. See Brown and Rosen [1982], Mendelsohn [1985] and Palmquist [2005] for
discussion
8
  In the context of a labor supply framework, Hausman [1980] develops this conclusion directly citing his
earlier result and concludes “… an econometric model of both labor force participation and labor supply
can be based solely on a labor supply equation specification. Neither the direct not indirect utility function
is needed” (p.165) This same argument has been applied to consumer demand models where decisions
about budget segment and amount demanded parallel the choice of participation and extent of work in the
labor supply literature.


                                                                                                            9
Marshallian conditional demand exists and describes demand responses correctly for all

the marginal prices.

       This logic has been applied in modeling water and electricity demands. In these

cases, the demand is also conditional to another set of choices that are usually assumed to

be made prior to the utilization decisions giving rise to water (or, in a similar context,

electricity) usage patterns. As a rule, these cases involve equipment or durables

associated with residence. Once we acknowledge that large changes in water price

structures would influence these types of decisions then we must consider whether the

envelope condition associated with re-evaluating commitments contains sufficient

information to derive the associated “long run” demand response. In general, we cannot

be assured it will!

       To the extent the nature of the price schedule affects decisions to install pools or

adopt different types of residential landscapes; those effects cannot be detected with the

estimates derived from the DCC framework. The DCC logic assumes the responses to

changes in the implied marginal price along with the infra-marginal expenditure

adjustment is all that is needed to “predict” the optimal facet for water (or electricity).

One realization of this assumption arises with the model requiring that the form of the

conditional demand function and the values for its unknown parameters are constant

across all facets of the budget constraint.

       When we wish to re-design the price schedule in a general setting that assumes

commitments to complementary goods might change, we do not have enough information

to compute the marginal price and expenditure adjustments. These effects are important

because it is often the case that policy makers are selecting higher priced blocks to




                                                                                              10
discourage investments in high consumption complementary goods and therefore, the

associated higher water consumption.




                 Reiss and White [2006] demonstrate that exact welfare measures can be

derived in nonlinear pricing situations. They propose a four step logic:

                 (a) estimate ordinary demand functions relating quantity to the

        relevant marginal prices at the observe levels of the quantity demanded;9

                 (b) use these demand functions from (a) to recover the quasi-

        expenditure function analytically (Hausman [1981]) or numerically

        (Vartia [1983]) and derive the corresponding Hicksian demand; (as our

        example illustrated)

                 (c) at the observed quantity demanded, this expression for the

        Hicksian demand evaluated at an unknown constant marginal price and

        utility level should equal the inverse of the marginal price schedule also

        evaluated at this price; and finally,

                 (d) the initial level of utility realized at the initial nonlinear price

        schedule should be consistent with the total expenditures implied by the

        price schedule and the virtual income (i.e. Hicksian expenditures




9
 This first step is the practical constraint that avoids the numerical approach proposed by Edelfsen and
described in footnote 3. To begin the process, the analyst must have an estimate of the Marshallian demand
function. Without locally constant prices and the assumption of constant parameters across all price
segments, we do not have the requisite demand function Reiss and White assume as a starting point.


                                                                                                       11
         evaluated at the initial marginal price and utility plus the income

         adjustment defined earlier).10

         The equations defined by steps (c) and (d) provide two relationships and two

unknowns – the initial marginal price consistent with the utility level realized and the

level for the initial utility.

         With these two variables, they demonstrate compensated demand defined in terms

of an artificial constant marginal price can be used. A price schedule change is then

recovered with the initial price and utility as well as the new price. Exact welfare is the

integral under the compensated demand between the two marginal prices corrected by the

change in the adjustment to income.

         Reiss and White observe a big advantage of their logic is that:

                 “… a researcher can begin an empirically satisfactory model for
         the ordinary demand function … and then compute exact consumer
         surplus under nonlinear prices without having to recover the direct utility
         function.” (Reiss and White [2006] p. 12)

         The problem with this logic is that it ignores the effects of changes in these

conditional demands when the modifications in the price schedule are large enough to

adjust quasi fixed goods, as we illustrate in the next section.



         C.       Complementary Goods

         Suppose that Z in equation (2.4) is a measure of the swimming pool or landscape

structure that a household has committed to. It is reasonable to assume there are

complementarities between either of these “goods” and water demand. The compensated

demand response implied by equation (2.5) will consistently describe household

10
  This process is consistent with Epstein’s [1981] discussion of consistent application of duality with
nonlinear constraints. See his Theorem 5 and the example of household production functions.


                                                                                                          12

equality of the Marshallian virtual price for Z and the market price. Thus, we should

expect:

                                                     = pZ                                        (2.7)
                                                  Vm

with VZ and Vm the partial derivatives of equation (2.6). Using the quasi indirect utility

function (equation (2.6)) this envelop condition means γ = δ pZ . Substituting we can

write Roy’s identity for long run adjustments as:

                                     Vp       dm
                                 −        =      = α p + δ ( m + pZ Z )                          (2.8)
                                     Vm       dp

          Suppose, however, the virtual price and market price cannot be assumed to be

equal. In this case, the conditional demand specification for water is not enough

information to describe how water demand would adjust in the long run as there are

opportunities to modify these quasi-fixed commitments. We need some basis for

describing how Z would adjust to changes in p and pZ .11 That is, to recover the full

adjustment to changes in p through the conditional demand, we are implicitly assuming

the response implied by the envelop condition fully characterizes Z’s adjustment.

Solving Roy’s identity uses changes in the water demand and p as well as initial

conditions. It tells us nothing about how Z would adjust to non-local changes in p.




11
  This is not a new point. Hausman [1981] noted that we only learn about variations in the own price of
the good with the solution of the differential equation implied by Roy’s identity. As La France and
Hanemann [1989] and von Haefen [2003] document, we need additional assumptions and a line integral for
more price changes.


                                                                                                    13
        To illustrate, suppose we assumed the demand for Z was also linear and adjusted

in the “long run.”12 Yet the demand given in equation (2.1) is a short run demand for

water. Assume equation (2.9) describes the long run demand for Z. Using the envelop

condition (2.7) and (2.9) we can illustrate why the Reiss-White procedure will not reflect

the complementarities between w and Z.

                                           Z = a + bm + cpZ − dp                                     (2.9)

        Substituting into equation (2.8) for Z and rearranging terms, we have (2.10)

                       Vp       dm
                   −        =      = (α − δ dpZ ) p + δ (1 − bpZ ) m + δ apZ + δ c 2 pZ2            (2.10)
                       Vm       dp

        This result illustrates how the long run demand for w would imply that the

marginal effect of p on water demand depends on pZ (i.e. the first term in equation

(2.10)).

        We could, as sometimes proposed with another situation involving a nonlinear

budget constraint, assume that the nonlinearity of the conditional demand is sufficient to

identify a role for Z’s adjustment.13 However, what is estimated will be conditional to the

relationship between Z and pZ in the envelop condition.

        The DCC model decomposes water demand into two steps, the choice of a best

segment and then, conditional on that selection, a demand response to changes in that

segment’s marginal price, given the adjustment to income required by the increasing

block rate structure. In principle, goods that are complements for water such as

12
   Chetty and Szeidl [2007] used this argument in a dynamic setting to explain discrepancies between some
types of behavior and measures of the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Assuming two classes of goods,
food and committed consumption, they demonstrate that the income elasticity of food consumption is
larger, implying greater food consumption response to income shocks with commitments than would be
present without them.
13
   This was Brown and Rosen’s [1982] argument. See Palmquist [2005] for further explanation and
Chattopadyay [1999] for an example.


                                                                                                        14
swimming pools or landscape systems have demands that depend on the full price

schedule for the water that is utilized with them. Once these commitments are made,

they are quasi-fixed goods that influence the parameters of the Marshallian demand for

water, as our simple example illustrates. Large changes in the price schedule are likely to

change these commitments. They cannot be identified from the short run responses in the

water usage alone. We illustrated this point in very simple terms by using the envelop

condition together with an assumed demand function for one complementary good. The

bottom line is we don’t escape making additional assumptions. The single conditional

demand function is not sufficient.

       Arrufat and Zabalza [1986] identify a related issue in describing advantages of

their use of a CES direct utility function to describe labor supply choices. They note that:

                       “… there are two reasons why, even when dealing with convex
               budget sets, it may be convenient to estimate a specific utility index.
               First, we may want to use our estimates to predict the effects of
               introducing non-convexities in the budget constraint … unless we have at
               our disposal an explicit utility index, in either direct or indirect form, we
               will not be able to predict behavioral responses to these types of changes
               in the opportunity set. Second, and less obvious, if there exist
               optimization errors … the conventional measures of welfare change
               cannot be inferred from areas under market supply curves (even if
               compensated), since neither initial nor final positions will correspond to
               tangency positions.” (p.48, emphasis added)

        This discussion recognizes that the estimates from the demand model approach

do not permit analysis of large scale reform in pricing (or tax) structures.



III. Model

       Our alternative model begins with a specification for the direct utility function.

We believe that this strategy offers a more transparent basis for characterizing




                                                                                            15
relationships between water and the complementary goods that influence how water is

used. This approach relies on a composite of structural restrictions as well as the need to

observe sufficient variation in the price schedules for water along with household

conditions to identify and estimate the parameters of that preference function.

        As a practical matter, commodities such as water, electricity and other utilities are

associated with a small fraction of budget. Small price changes in any one of them are

unlikely to induce large re-allocation of income among all goods. This feature of demand

can compound the difficulties in estimating household demand. The effects of small

price changes may primarily induce re-allocation of the expenditures on household

utilities. Recognizing this prospect for estimation of the preference parameters using data

with limited variation in the price structures, we assume utilities enter preferences in a

separable sub-function and treat their expenditures as a fraction of income that varies

with income. Our estimates for this share are based on the Consumer Expenditure

Survey (CES) average for utilities (including water). In 2006, they identified thirteen

different income classes (see BLS [2007]).14

        The preference specification describing the choice of utilities corresponds to the

von Haefen et. al [2004] direct utility function and is given in equation (3.1)15

                                    1                                           1
                      U ( w, x) =        exp( Z δ + ε )(exp(qβ ) w + θ ) ρω +        x ρx           (3.1)
                                    ρw                                          ρx




14
   Our sample is composed of average consumption levels and there are no area specific measures of these
expenditure shares at the level of census data. To account for differences with income we use the census
measures of household income for each water provider’s service area along with the CES to assign one of
thirteen different values for the expenditure share ranging from about .068 to .108.
15
   This is based on Hanemann’s [1984] earlier proposed model for generalized corner solution model.


                                                                                                      16
        If we assume the expenditure on this component of a household’s budget is

m = sy (with s equal to a value based on household income), then we can embed the

budget constraint into the utility function. As in equation (3.2):

                               1                                           1
                    U ( w) =        exp( Z δ + ε )(exp(qβ ) w + θ ) ρω +        (m − c( w)) ρ x     (3.2)
                               ρw                                          ρx

         m − c( w) corresponds to a household’s virtual expenditures on the other

components of utilities and will depend on the block rate structure faced by each

household (see Hewitt and Hanemann [1995] for a detailed discussion). Z is a matrix of

socio-demographic variables, q is matrix of water specific attributes such as lot size, and

presence of a pool, θ is a demand shift parameter (e.g. similar to a threshold consumption

in a Stone-Geary specification) that also contains the identification of summer vs. winter

time span, and ρω and ρx are substitution parameters.16 The complementary goods

(treated as quasi-fixed commitments) enter the utility function as part of a scaling

function. This is consistent with the utilization logic described earlier. By specifying the

direct utility function, we include the equivalent of the information that would be needed

in the set of long run demands for complementary goods. The expression, exp(qβ ) w + θ ,

can be considered as a quality adjusted, or quantity augmentation based on prior

commitments, measure for the use of water. The first of these interpretations is similar to

that of von Haefen et al. [2004] in a recreation application.

        Further intuition for these parameters, can be offered by recognizing that this

function is a variation on Mukerji’s [1963] constant ratio of elasticity of substitution

function. The Hanemann-Von Haefen et al. function can be derived using a monotonic


16
  These two parameters implicitly allow for complementary or substitute relationships between the
quantity of water consumed and these other goods.


                                                                                                      17
transformation of the Mukerji generalization of the CES function. This re-casting of the

model allows Smith’s[1974] derivation of the price and income elasticities implied by

this function to be used to describe local responsiveness within budget segments and thus

to compare the estimates implied by the function with what has been derived using

conditional demand functions within a DCC framework.17

         The estimating equation for the model’s parameters uses the first order condition

for the local optimization component of the household’s budget and is given in equation

(3.3):

         exp( Z δ + ε ) exp(qβ )(exp(qβ ) w + θ ) ρω −1 + c '( w)(m − c( w)) ρ x −1 = 0              (3.3)

It is able to include the implications of the kinked budget constraint by defining mi as the

virtual available income for utilities in block i and pi the relevant marginal price. The

expression is conditional on the block selected. Water demand, price, and expenditures

on remaining utilities (i.e. mi − pi w ) are all endogenous variables. Taking natural

logarithms of (3) and re-arranging terms, yields equation (3.4).

            ln( pi ) = Z δ + qβ + ( ρ w − 1) ln(exp(q β ) w + θ ) + (1 − ρ x ) ln(mi − pi w) + ε           (3.4)

ε can be assumed to correspond to either optimization error or unobserved household

heterogeneity.

         Our analysis does not confront the issues associated with choice at the kinks of

the budget constraint versus tangencies to a facet. As we discuss below, the use of

consumption for an “average” household implies that all choices can be interpreted as

tangencies with optimization errors that are on average zero. Our framework uses GIS


17
  An analysis of the responses to changes in the full price schedule is also possible and would require
simulating the constrained optimization for different price schedules. This is outside the scope of this
paper.


                                                                                                             18

Maricopa County as well as with the parcel records for residential properties. These

variables characterize water providers’ customers. They are used to define instruments

for the quantity of water demanded and virtual expenditures.

IV. Data

       A. Background

               Ideally, our model (and the DCC specification) would be applied with

household level data. These data are generally not in the public domain. When studies

have had access to micro data they often span wide geographic domains with quite

different patterns of water use or they have very limited price variation. Olmstead et al.

[2007] is an example of the first situation and Pint [1999], the second.

       We illustrate our model and compare it to the DCC framework using data that are

consistently in the public domain. These data are based on average household water

usage for residential customers in each of a set of water providers. We exploit the

variation in price schedules and construct the bill that would have resulted for a

household with this water usage for each provider. Thus, our example considers a

potentially important issue that is secondary to the main objective of the paper. That is,

we investigate whether differences in modeling assumptions between a preference based

formulation and the DCC model can be detected with relatively “coarse” aggregate data.



       B. Data Sources

       The Phoenix Active Management Area is shown in Figure 1 and corresponds to

approximately the northern two-thirds of Maricopa County. It encompasses all of what

would be considered the Phoenix Metropolitan area. The data for our application were

collected from a variety of sources. The 2005 price schedule for each water service

provider is reported by the Arizona Water Infrastructure Financing Authority. Table 1

summarizes the features of these price schedules. The first panel highlights the variation




                                                                                         20
in the price schedule across providers. Each element in the table displays the range of

marginal prices (per thousand gallons) for each block. The second panel provides the

average width of the blocks across the uniform, two, three and four block schedules. Each

is measured in gallons.

        Information on aggregate single family consumption in 2005 and number of

single family customers was obtained from imaged records of the Arizona Department of

Water Resources’ Schedule F available for monthly water consumption by residence

type. These data allow construction of water used by an “average” single family

residential consumer. Based on that monthly water consumption and each provider’s

price schedule we can recover measures for their marginal price and expenditures on

water. These two datasets provide 516 provider/month observations for water

consumption and price schedule information.

        Census data for 2000 were adapted to conform to the service areas of each of the

providers to construct measures of expenditures on utilities as well as other economic and

demographic variables characterizing their customers. This was accomplished by

intersecting the Census block groups with the water service provider areas.18 Average

household income together with the CES schedule of the proportions of income spent on

utilities by income class was used to construct the total expenditures on utilities for each

area. The parcel records from the Maricopa County Assessor were used to develop

summary statistics for housing measures at the Census block group level and ultimately



18
  The construction of the demographic information required intersecting the service provider areas with the
census block groups. Two statistics were defined: (1) the percentage of each block group contained in the
service provider area; and (2) the percentage of the service provider area contained in each of the block
groups. The first was used to aggregate census variables describing distributions (e.g. income, race, etc.)
and the second for summary statistics such as means or medians



                                                                                                        21
intersected with water service provider areas. This allows measurement of the percentage

of households with pools located in a given service provider area. To control for climatic

conditions monthly data on cooling degree days with a 65° baseline and total

precipitation during the month were obtained from the National Climatic Data Center of

NOAA for the Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport station.

           There are approximately 60 water service providers that serve the Phoenix

Metropolitan area. Of these, 43 have complete records for residential customers in single

family dwellings. The first panel of Table 2 provides some summary statistics for the

demographic characteristics for the residential customers across providers. The second

panel in the table summarizes the variation in temperature and precipitation across the

months in our sample. The majority of the water service providers that we eliminated are

simply irrigation districts that may provide water to a few households usually at a fixed

cost. 19

           As with most water studies such as Hewitt and Hanemann [1995] and Olmstead et

al. [2007], we are exploiting structural restrictions inherent in our model as well as the

variation across water service providers in price schedules, socio-demographic, and

housing characteristics to identify the model’s parameters. All of these water service

providers are in the Phoenix metropolitan area. There is no variation in linked weather

conditions across water service providers because they are derived from a single weather

station. Weather related variables vary with the month of consumption.




19
  The only other reason a provider was deleted from consideration stemmed from the fact that they are not
required to report monthly consumption. The size of the water service provider’s service area determines
these reporting requirements.


                                                                                                       22
V. Results

        We present the estimates for the DCC model as well as our proposed alternative

framework. The findings for our model are presented first. Our alternative framework

does need to consider endogeneity of price, water consumption, and net income. Two

estimators are considered for our model. The first develops instruments for the log of the

average household’s expenditures on other utilities (taking account of the implications of

the block pricing structure for the virtual income available) and the average water

consumption by month using the predictions from first stage regression models that

include temperature degree days, total monthly precipitation, the percentage of houses

with pools, the average house value (as assessed by homeowners in the census), total

number of lots in the service area, and number of rental units. These GIS constructed

variables compromise the instruments in the first estimator. A simple model with fixed

effects for each water service providers together with the weather variables is the second.

The first stage estimates for the first of these estimators are given in Table 3.

        The estimates for the preference model parameters using each of the two sets of

instruments are given in Table 4. Both models specify the Z matrix as composed of a

vector of ones (for an intercept), our temperature measure, and the number of customers

the water service provider serves. q contains the percentage of pools in the service

provider area; and θ contains a constant and dummy variables identifying whether the

monthly consumption was during the summer and winter periods.20 The shoulder period

between summer and winter is the omitted category. We estimate equation (3.4) using

non-linear least squares with each set of instruments.


20
  Summer is defined as June, July, August and September where as winter is defined as December,
January, February and March.


                                                                                                  23
         The estimates based on the demographic, economic, and weather variable

instruments yield more precise results for the model. With instruments based on the

provider fixed effects we find the model attributes all the price variation to the provider

effects. This is important because differences in the price schedules along with the

variation in the average household’s water consumption in each provider’s residential

customer class provide the variation in marginal prices. With provider fixed effects used

to define instruments it appears that the variation in the price schedule is being captured

completely by these variables. As a result, it is not surprising that the parameter

estimates are not significant. A Hausman [1978] specification test decisively rejects the

fixed effects specification (χ2 = 115.83 with p-value = 0.00).21

         To evaluate these estimates further, we computed the price and “utilities

expenditures” elasticities at the sample mean for the price of water and for the virtual

utilities expenditures. These results are given in panel A of Table 5. Below each estimate

we report the Z-statistic based on the asymptotic standard errors. In addition, we

computed the elasticity for each month and water provider. A summary of these results is

given in panel B –with the mean, median and the minimum and maximum values across

the providers in the summer months.

         There are several caveats in interpreting these estimates. These measures are not

the estimates that would be implied with a change in the structure of the increasing block

rate structure. They apply to local changes. Our approach recovers estimates of all the

preference parameters that would be required to derive a response to a large change in the

price structure. Indeed, this is a key motivation for the model. We report these local


21
  We conducted this test with and without the intercept and the results in both cases favor the model using
the GIS constructed instruments over that based on provider fixed effects.


                                                                                                         24
price and expenditure elasticities because they are comparable to most of the literature

and are more comparable to the elasticities implied by the conditional demands estimated

with the DCC framework.22 In our case, measures of the demand responses to large

changes require computation of the solutions to the constrained optimization problems

associated with a baseline price structure and the proposed change.

        Our estimates are also conditioned by the maintained separability assumption we

discussed at the outset. This restriction influences how the estimates can be compared

with findings from the existing literature. For the income elasticity, the relationship is

straightforward, provided we interpret the response to an income change as a marginal

change to a pre-existing optimal water consumption choice. σ wy = σ wsσ sy , with σ wy the

conventional income elasticity of demand; σ ws the utilities expenditure elasticity (i.e.

what we estimated); and σ sy the elasticity of the composite of utilities expenditures with

respect to household income. Using estimates for σ sy from the literature, we can adapt the

results in Table 4 to develop a measure of the income elasticity implied by our findings.

For example, Blanciforti and Green [1983] report an estimate of σ sy =0.62.23 This

implies our estimate for the income elasticity of demand for water using the measures for

σ ws of 0.63 (i.e. 0.62 * 1.02)

        The price elasticities also require some adjustment ( σ wp = η wp − σ wsσ mp ) where

η wp is our estimate for the price elasticity, holding the utilities expenditures constant and

22
   In their appendix, Olmstead et al. document the simulation methods used to develop measures for
elasticities for the unconditional demand.
23
   More recently Taylor [2005] has estimated income elasticities using the consumer expenditure survey.
His results range from 0.31-0.42 for 1999 cross specifications for a category he designates as utilities.
Water is not separately identified in the ACCRA price indexes he uses with the expenditure survey. Water
expenditure are included in the consumer expenditure survey. So strictly speaking his price index fails to
reflect the covariation in their prices


                                                                                                        25
σ mp is the elasticity of these expenditures with respect to the price of water, holding

income constant. Since we are expressing the price elasticities as in absolute magnitudes

these expressions imply the comparable “unconditional” price elasticity would be smaller

than our estimates.24

         As noted at the outset, we estimated the DCC model using a constant elasticity

specification of the conditional demand function to compare our results. We follow

Hewitt and Hanemann [1995], Waldman [2000] and Olmstead et al. [2007] in our

structuring of the model. Table 6 shows two sets of parameter estimates for DCC model

–using the expenditure on utilities as the income measure in the first column and average

income in the second. Several aspects of the results should be noted. First, applications

of the DCC model to date have used micro data. Our findings that the variance of the

optimization error is larger than the unobserved heterogeneity ( σ η > σ ε ), are likely due to

the structure of our data. Second, the price elasticity for the conditional demand elasticity

is comparable in magnitude to our estimate of the local elasticity using the preference

model. However, there is a striking difference in the income elasticity estimates. Under

the DCC model, there is an insignificant income effect. By contrast, our estimates of the

income elasticity using the preference function are close to unity.

         Comparisons of the local price elasticity measures (in Table 5) from our

preference model compared to the conditional elasticity estimates with the DCC model

indicate that they are quite consistent. While a statistical test for the difference between

these estimates is not possible, their relative proximity suggest, for practical purposes,

                                                                                                         26
they would not imply differences in local responsiveness to small changes in price. This

is not surprising since the two models are describing “average” responsiveness.

         The important feature of our proposed method is the ability to recover the

structural parameters required for evaluating large scale changes. Indeed, with micro

data and greater detail on swimming pools, landscape infrastructure and variables

describing other large water using capital decisions we could relax the assumption that

the share of expenditures on utilities varies on with income and expand the range of

structural parameters estimated with the framework.



VI. Summary and Implications

         This paper argues that the conventional approach for analyzing commodity

demand in the presence of kinked budget constraints cannot evaluate the implications of

large changes in the pricing structure for water. Moreover, it relies on the assumption of

a constant conditional demand function across different marginal price segments in an

increasing block rate structure. We proposed an alternative that uses a preference

specification as the primitive in estimation. It allows us to consider welfare changes to

large scale changes in the price structure. The data available for our application, while

comparable to the most common information available for characterizing water demand,

describes the “average” response rather than the individual household response.

Aggregate data for all residential customers served by 43 water service providers in the

Phoenix area are used to estimate our preference based model and a version of the DCC

model.




                                                                                            27
       An application to the “average” residential customer based on aggregate data is of

interest because these data are what is readily available for most water demand

applications. To date, the DCC model has been exclusively associated with applications

with access to extensive household level water consumption data as well as sufficient

price variation to recover demand responsiveness. When these data do not exist, policy

analysts are forced to adapt existing (and often old estimates) to describe how

household’s water demand responds to changes in the block rate pricing structure.

       Our strategy exploits the economic and demographic diversity of households

along with GIS techniques to characterize the demographic and economic features of the

spatially delineated service areas for the water providers included in our sample. In

addition, rather than derive an estimator that uses the preference function to predict the

facet of the budget constraint selected and then the amount of the commodity demanded,

we focus on developing instruments for the choice variables and estimating parameters of

the separable sub-function of preferences. With detailed micro records, our framework

could be extended using the two error framework and logic comparable to Zabalza’s

work to develop a maximum likelihood estimator. These are the types of estimates

needed to address the challenge of designing price structures that encourage water

conservation by reflecting the full costs of complementary, water using, capital goods.
