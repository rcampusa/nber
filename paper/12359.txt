Agency Conflicts, Asset Substitution, and Securitization

JEL No. D8, G2, G3, L2

                                             ABSTRACT

Asset-backed securities represent one of the largest and fastest growing financial markets. Under
securitization, agents perform functions (for fees) that would alternatively be performed by a
vertically integrated lender with ownership of a whole loan. We examine how outsourcing impacts
performance using data on 357 commercial mortgage-backed securities deals with over 46,000
individual loans. To alleviate agency conflicts in managing troubled loans, underwriters often sell
the first-loss position to the special servicer, the party who is charged with handling delinquencies
and defaults. When holding the first-loss position, special servicers appear to behave more
efficiently, making fewer costly transfers of delinquent loans to special servicing, but liquidating a
higher percentage of loans that are referred to special servicing. Special servicers are also more likely
to own the first loss position in deals that require additional effort (deals with higher delinquencies).
Market pricing reflects the existence of agency costs. Despite the apparent reduction of agency costs,
the first-loss position is increasingly owned by a party other than the special servicer. We pose a
number of explanations, including conflicts between junior and senior securities holders (the asset
substitution problem) and risk aversion among special servicers. Consistent with asset substitution,
we show that special servicers delay liquidation when they hold the first-loss position in deals with
more severe delinquency problems.

Asset-backed securities are one of the most important financial innovations in recent decades.

According to the Federal Reserve, as of the end of 2005, the value of outstanding of mortgage-

and other asset-backed securities was $6.7 trillion, about $1.7 trillion larger than outstanding

amount of non-ABS corporate bonds. About one-half of mortgages, one-third of trade

receivables, and one-fourth of consumer credit are securitized in the US.1 The asset-backed

securities (ABS) market has developed along many dimensions. Once dominated by residential

mortgages, this market now includes securities backed by loans on cars, manufactured homes,

credit cards, trade receivables, commercial real estate, leases, franchise debt, student loans, and

even securities from previous securitizations (CDOs).


In a typical securitization, a large numbers of assets are grouped together in a single pool.

Claims to the cash flows from the pooled loans are sold as securities, where the economic claims

to cash flows are divided (or “tranched”) based on a strict priority system. Parties pay a

premium to buy the most senior tranches, whose capital is protected by the existence of more

junior securities that absorb initial losses. This structure is similar to that of dividing up claims

to a firm’s cash flows between equity holders, junior creditors, and senior creditors. Equity

holders are paid only after the claims of all the creditors are satisfied. If the firm’s assets do not

generate enough cash flow to pay-off its debt, the equity position is wiped out. Similarly, senior

creditors are paid in full before junior creditors receive any cash flow. Some securitizations may

have as many as twenty separate tranches in their capital structure.


The growth of ABS has resulted from a series of economic, legal, and regulatory developments.

ABS are publicly-traded and rated by independent rating agencies, resulting in the generation of


1
    Flow of Fund Tables L1, L4, L125, L126, L212, for 4Q, 2005, Federal Reserve Board, released March 9, 2006.
a great deal of public information about the performance and valuation of the underlying assets

and the traded securities. Regulators give insurance companies highly preferential capital

treatment when they hold investment grade ABS instead of less transparent whole loans.2 The

legal system also provides relatively strict protection for the cash flow priorities inherent in the

bankruptcy-remote entities that are a fundamental part of securitization. 3 In addition, the

creation of a wide variety of claims to debt securities has helped to complete capital markets,

allowing investors to purchase positions all along the risk/return frontier.4 Specialized parties

have emerged to perform many functions that were previously performed by vertically integrated

lenders, possibly allowing for increased efficiency and specialization. Finally, ABS are typically

more liquid than whole loans.


Yet securitization also creates important (and previously unexplored) organizational costs

associated with the separation of ownership and control of assets and the parsing of equity

interests into a large number of relatively thin ownership tranches. Traditionally, a bank or an

insurance company would own and manage all of the loans it originated, collecting payments

and making all decisions in the event of delinquency and default.5 With securitization, a third-

party (the special servicer) takes over responsibility for managing troubled loans. Special

servicers usually receive a fixed fee for monitoring the entire pool of loans, plus a percentage of

the outstanding balance of any loans that are in special servicing. These fees are paid before

investors receive the proceeds from a workout or foreclosure of a troubled loan.

  See Kopcke (1996), for example. Previous papers reject the hypothesis that securitization has grown purely due to
regulatory arbitrage in residential mortgages (Ambrose et. al. 2006) and credit cards (Calomiris and Mason 2004).

remote structure used in ABS typically ensures that the strict prioritization of cash flows holds for financial firms.

  For larger loans, a lender might syndicate a portion of a loan to multiple parties, but retain control of servicing. Of
course, problems might still arise when originators sell loans to less-informed parties. (See Ciochetti, et. al. 2003)


                                                            2
Of course, fee-based special servicers may not always behave in the best interest of the investors.

To better align the interests of the special servicers and investors, special servicers sometimes

hold the first loss position (the so-called the “B-piece”), which is the residual claimant in a

securitization. The procedure of having the special servicer own the first loss position is

intended to ensure that the special servicer exerts optimal effort in maximizing the value of the

collateral. The fees and losses attributable to the most problematic loans as well as the benefits

from effective loan management come from the pockets of the B-piece holder.


Yet such arrangements create a new set of conflicts. First, special servicers may be risk averse

and require additional compensation for bearing the risk of holding the first-loss position in

every deal.6 In addition, special servicers face the classic asset substitution problem associated

with equity holders in highly leveraged firms. The first-loss position often represents three

percent or less of the entire ABS capital structure. When an increasing number of loans in a

securitization face potential losses, special servicers have an incentive to extend loans or take

other risks as the value of their equity position falls. This is analogous to the decisions made by

savings and loan executives to extend loans when large losses on real estate loans impaired their

capital in the late 1980s.


Yet, with less than three percent ownership in a deal, special servicers often have the equivalent

of less capital than S&Ls held prior to the downturn of the late 1980s. Some commentators have

expressed concern with the rapid growth in ABS and the lack of previous experience with a large

number of defaults. They have worried that the ABS structure might perform less efficiently



6
  Typically, special servicers must maintain an investment grade rating or face possible removal. Such a rating
requires a lot of costly capital when holding a concentrated loss position across many deals, especially as it is
virtually impossible to hedge these securities.

than banks in handling troubled loans, potentially slowing the recovery of the economy from a

recession.


We examine the performance of securitizations utilizing data on 357 commercial mortgage-

backed securities (CMBS) deals with over 46,000 individual loans. Previous papers examine

default and prepayment decisions without accounting for these conflicts of interest.7


We demonstrate the existence of appreciable principal-agent conflicts in the securitization

process. Special servicers appear to put additional effort into identifying and efficiently

managing the most troubled loans when they own the first-loss position. Special servicers are up

to 14 percent less likely to transfer a delinquent loan to special servicing in deals where they hold

the B-piece. Conditional on special servicing, special servicers are five percent more likely to

foreclose and liquidate a loan when they own the B-piece. These results hold when we include

fixed effects for individual special servicers, suggesting that special servicers have a different

evaluation process for deals based on whether they own the first loss position.8 We also address

the possibility that experienced special servicers might choose to hold the B-piece only in deals

with high quality loans. In fact, the opposite is the case. Deals in which the special servicer

owns the B-piece experience worse delinquency and default behavior, conditional on observable

loan characteristics. These findings suggest that CMBS underwriters are well-informed about

ex-ante loan quality and use high-powered incentives when the marginal returns to incentive

alignment are strongest.

  See Ambrose and Sanders (2003), Chen and Deng (2003), and Deng et. al (2004). Other work examines loan
default, or subordination levels (Downing and Wallace 2005).

  One industry participant conceded to the authors that some servicers used the “A” team on deals in which they
owned the first-loss position, but the “B” team on deals in which they received only fees.


                                                         4
Evidence from initial bond prices for CMBS securities also supports our agency cost

interpretation. Prices are higher (yields are lower) for junior securities in deals in which the

special servicer owns the first-loss position, even though these deals have worse delinquency

experiences. Junior securities are the most likely to be positively impacted by superior

performance of the special servicer. Spreads on the most senior (investment-grade) securities

appear unaffected by the ownership of the B-piece, which is consistent with the view that such

securities are rarely impacted by losses from defaults.


Despite the seemingly important alignment of interests, the special servicer does not own the B-

piece in more than one-third of all CMBS securitizations in our data, a percentage that has grown

over time. We suggest two possible reasons. Risk aversion among special servicers may play a

role. Special servicers own the B-piece in a smaller percentage of deals when total issuance of

CMBS securities is highest. We also find evidence of conflicts of interest between equity

holders and creditors (asset substitution). In deals with higher delinquencies, special servicers

who own the B-piece appear to slow the foreclosure process for loans in special servicing. This

pattern suggests that special servicers may be susceptible to the same kinds of problems that

characterized undercapitalized banks when losses rose.




I.     Theory and predictions


Securitization accentuates agency conflicts resulting from the separation of ownership and

control of assets. The discussion of managerial incentive problems dates back as far back as

Adam Smith’s “The Wealth of Nations.” Articles such as Jensen and Meckling (1976), Harris

and Raviv (1978), and Fama and Jensen (1983) suggest that, even with elaborate (and costly)


                                                  5
contracts between managers and shareholders. Other market mechanisms such as the threat of

takeover and “ex-post settling up” do not fully discipline managers (Fama 1980). Laffont and

Martimort (2002) discuss these issues extensively.


Information asymmetries are a second important factor impacting the benefits of securitization

and the liquidity of loans as an alternative vehicle for hedging risk. Gorton and Pennacchi (1995)

show that contract mechanisms such as implicit guarantees or partial sales of loans can mitigate

moral hazard problems in which lenders do not exert enough effort investigating the risk

associated with loans that they intend to sell. In a similar vein, DeMarzo (2005) argues that

securitization allows sophisticated intermediaries with special skills in valuing assets to mitigate

the “lemons” problem when selling assets to the market. However, for many securitizations,

including the CMBS we examine in this paper, these mechanisms do not appear to operate.

Originators and underwriters almost never hold the risks from loan failures once securities have

been issued, possibly due to regulatory capital rules.9 Neither paper examines the incentive

misalignment between investors and managers once securitizations are created.


In the face of unobservable effort by managers and asymmetric information about the firm’s

prospects, shareholders cannot obtain the first-best outcome for the firm. Similar problems exist

in most securitizations. While junior security holders (who are equivalent to equity holders in a

corporation) have the right to choose and change the special servicer, they often lack the ability

to monitor managerial effort and deal quality. In the face of principal-agent conflicts, high-

powered (outcome-based) compensation can often provide better incentives for the agent

(Eisenhardt 1989). However, if agents are more risk averse than the principals and their actions


9
 Often, the servicer can require the originator and/or the underwriter to repurchase loans in the case of material
misrepresentations of loan information. However, this is a very strict standard that is rarely used.


                                                           6
are not observable and verifiable, such high-powered compensation will not obtain the first-best

outcome (Shavell, 1979).


Special servicers may well be more risk averse than other potential investors in low-rated CMBS

tranches and have a lower willingness to pay than outside investors for the B-piece. Special

servicers in CMBS face a heavy exposure to commercial real estate markets that is difficult to

diversify. The B-piece usually represents about three percent or less of the capital in CMBS

deals, but bears all of the losses from any loans in the securitization. The top 10 special servicers

cover more than 80% of the CMBS market, which totals hundreds of billions of dollars of

outstanding loan balances. While CMBS special servicers are experts in assessing and managing

troubled commercial real estate loans, this expertise may not extend to other types of assets.

Holding a highly concentrated loss position in every CMBS deal creates the potential for large

losses in the event of a real estate downturn. Even worse, new transactions volume in a real

estate downturn would likely fall, further harming near-term profits and cash-flow. Finally,

rating agencies require all servicers to have an above-investment-grade rating in order to perform

their function, so special servicers must hold a large amount of (costly) capital if they hold the B-

piece on every deal. Other potential purchasers of low-rated CMBS securities do not face similar

capital requirements and can better diversify themselves from exposure to commercial real estate.


The usual CMBS securitization is created by an underwriter that chooses the management

structure (in conjunction with the rating agencies) and markets the securities to investors.

Underwriters, usually large banks, want to maximize the profits from each securitization, but

also want to maintain their reputation for future securitizations. Underwriters may have

additional information about loans than investors and the rating agencies, especially since

underwriters originate many of the loans in their portfolios. Thus, an underwriter trades-off


                                                 7
possibly lower revenue associated with the special servicer purchasing the B-piece against the

benefits of better-aligned incentives when the special servicer owns the B-piece. The

underwriter should sell the B-piece to the special servicer in circumstances when the incremental

benefit from a high-powered incentive scheme is especially large.


The optimal (second-best) compensation scheme employs higher-powered incentive schemes

when: 1) an agent’s effort has a larger effect on profits, 2) when asymmetric information

problems make effort more difficult to observe by outsiders, 3) and when agents are less risk-

averse. Conditions 1 and 2 naturally lead to our first hypothesis:


H1: The special servicer is more likely to hold the B-piece in deals with (1) a higher expected

delinquency rate and (2) greater asymmetric information.


High-powered incentive schemes are more valuable in deals that require greater effort by the

agents; i.e., in deals with loans that have a higher expected delinquency. A loan delinquency

occurs when the borrower is late in making payments or violates one or more terms of the initial

loan agreement. Delinquencies are usually unrelated to actions by lenders or servicers. However,

effort by the lender or special servicer becomes much more important in handling loans once

they become delinquent. Thus it becomes more important to align incentives between the

principal and the agent in deals with greater potential delinquencies.


Of course, not all delinquencies are equal. Agency theory shows that information curbs agent

opportunism. (Fama 1980 and Fama and Jensen 1983). Thus the outcome-based compensation

is more attractive when the asymmetric information is greater. We proxy for asymmetric

information using the extent to which deals differ in realized delinquency rates after controlling

for observable variables. Investors are able to assess the risks associated with well-known


                                                 8
quality indicators such as the loan to value ratio (LTV) and the debt service coverage ratio

(DSCR). However, when a seemingly high-quality loan (low LTV and high DSCR) gets into

trouble, investors may have a harder time understanding and predicting the loss recovery.

Underwriters should be more likely to sell the first-loss position to the special servicer when

private information about the likelihood of delinquency suggests that a deal will have a higher

delinquency rate.


Of course, it is important to examine whether having the special servicer hold the first-loss

position is effective in alleviating agency problems as theory predicts. Ideally, we would

examine the effectiveness of aligning interests by measuring whether investors obtain smaller

losses when the special servicer owns the B-piece. Unfortunately, we do not observe actual

losses. Instead we have data on whether a loan is transferred into special servicing and,

conditional on special servicing, whether or not a loan is liquidated (either thru foreclosure or the

special servicer acquiring ownership of the real estate). We also observe initial prices of

securities for a small portion of the CMBS deals in our sample, allowing us to see how the

market values different deal structures. The combination of these variables allows us to examine

the efficiency of the special servicer’s actions even without data on monetary losses from default.


We begin with the first stage of the loan management process:


H2: Controlling for loan quality, fewer loans will be transferred into costly special servicing

when the special servicer holds the B-piece.


As an agent, the special servicer is conflicted. She receives fees based on the number and dollar

value of loans that are in special servicing, creating an incentive to transfer more loans into

special servicing than is optimal from the perspective of the investors. In addition, the agent


                                                  9
must exert costly effort to determine which loans have severe enough problems to justify the

additional cost and attention. Recognizing this conflict, most securitizations have a master

servicer who oversees each deal. The master servicer, whose primary function is to monitor the

timely collection and distribution of principal and interest, must agree with any proposed loan

transfers into special servicing. Nonetheless, the special servicer has discretion in deciding

whether and when to transfer the delinquent loans. Neither investors nor the master servicer are

sufficiently well-informed to fully discipline the special servicer.


If the special servicer owns the first-loss position, she is the residual claimant and thus pays all

costs associated with transferring loans into special servicing. In this circumstance, the special

servicer will choose the first-best solution. Thus the special servicer should transfer fewer

delinquent loans into special servicing when she owns the B-piece. When the special servicer

does not own the first-loss position, she has incentives to shirk in investigating potentially

troubled loans and to transfer “too many” loans into costly special servicing to earn higher fees.

In fact, Fitch, a major rating agency, expressed concern that some special servicers in the

commercial mortgage securities market unnecessarily transfer assets into special servicing

(Mortgage Banker Association 10/2/2003).


Next, we consider the work-out stage when loans are in special servicing. Special servicers have

wide discretion on how they handle a troubled loan. Their options include doing nothing,

extending the payment period, waiving loan terms, restructuring the loan, possibly forgiving

some portion of the principal amount, and ultimately foreclosing on the loan and liquidating the

underlying collateral. Here we point out that the efficiency of the special servicer’s actions

depends critically on the size of potential losses in a given CMBS deal. Thus securitzation does




                                                  10
not align interests as would occur if a single lender owned all of the loans in a securitization and

made all foreclosure decisions.


H3A: When potential losses are relatively small, the special servicer will liquidate loans in

special servicing more quickly when holding the B-piece.


When the special servicer acts as the agent (as opposed to being the principal when she owns the

B-piece), we would expect that she will liquidate fewer loans than is optimal for the investors.

Foreclosure is lengthy and involves costly effort for the special servicer, including intensive

research in looking for potential buyers, negotiations with sophisticated players, and expensive

legal procedures. Ciochetti and Riddiough (1998) report that the average elapsed time from the

beginning of the foreclosure process to the date at which title to the property is obtained by the

investor (or is sold by the courthouse) is approximately 9 months. By postponing this decision,

the special servicer receives two benefits: she collects additional fees associated with a loan

spending more time in special servicing and 2) there is some chance that the loan will become

current without the special servicer exerting any effort. In the same report mentioned above,

Fitch expressed concern that some special servicers use “excessive litigation” to retrieve unpaid

borrower funds, effectively extending the special servicing period. However, if the loan does not

become current and has to be liquidated later, the recovery rate in present value terms may be

lower because owners of severely distressed real estate are likely to take additional risks and to

postpone necessary capital improvements and renovations. Therefore, under these conditions,

the special servicer who does not own the B-piece will be slower to liquidate than is optimal for

investors and than a single lender would. Of course, when the special servicer owns the B-piece,

she pays all of the costs in special servicing out of her own pocket and should make first-best

decisions.


                                                 11
H3B: When potential losses are large, a special servicer who owns the B-piece has an additional

incentive to delay liquidation.


As potential losses in a given securitization grow, the special servicer faces conflicting incentives.

At some point, total losses would exceed the value of the B-piece. As such, when the special

servicer owns the B-piece and potential losses are large enough, the special servicer might

optimally choose to extend troubled loans rather than foreclosing and ensuring that the losses

eliminate the value associated with the B-piece. (Riddiough 1997) This is the well-known asset

substitution problem. The incentive to extend loans grows with the size of potential losses for

the B-piece. A special servicer who does not own the first-loss position faces no such additional

incentives to extend loans and thus may actually foreclose more quickly than a special servicer

who owned the B-piece if the deal faces large enough possible losses.


Finally, we use data on securities prices to measure the effect of incentive alignment on the

anticipated efficiency of the special servicer’s actions. Securities prices should reflect the

benefits of incentive alignment.


H4: Securities based on deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece should sell at

higher prices. The price effects should be most pronounced for the lowest rated tranches that are

most likely to suffer losses if the special servicer does not perform efficiently.


All else equal, if having the special servicer own the B-piece aligns incentives, as we argue

above, we should expect securities prices to reflect these benefits. Thus prices should be highest

for securities in which the special servicer owns the first-loss position.




                                                 12
Of course we should be concerned that we are unable to perfectly observe loan quality and prices

might reflect factors such as loan quality or deal structure in addition to incentive alignment. We

take several steps to address this problem. First, we examine prices (yields) within a given rating

class. Rating agencies are quite concerned about the quality of loans in a pool and their ratings

directly reflect the impact of loan quality on defaults and losses. Yet rating agencies do not

know whether or not the special servicer will eventually own the B-piece (ratings are determined

at an earlier time period), even as investors know this information when a deal is taken to market.

Thus investors should be willing to pay a premium for securities of a given ratings class in a deal

if they think that the special servicer will perform more efficiently relative to another deal in

which she does not own the B-piece.


Second, we examine prices within each ratings class. If deals in which the special servicer owns

the first-loss position are more attractive for reasons that are unrelated to losses (say these deals

have better marketing or a superior underwriter), we would expect that prices of all securities in

these deals would be higher. Instead, if the reason for differential pricing is optimal effort by the

special servicer in dealing with delinquencies and defaults, prices of lowest-rated securities--

those with the greatest likelihood of suffering losses due to defaults--should be most impacted by

whether the special servicer owns the B-piece.


We address the question of adverse selection in deal quality by examining the ultimate default

behavior of loans. We do not directly observe ex-ante loan quality. An alternative hypothesis

that might be a concern is that special servicers use their superior knowledge of loan quality such

that they only choose to purchase the B-piece in deals in which their private information says

that loans are above-average quality. Fortunately, such an alternative hypothesis is testable in

the data. If adverse selection were an important feature of this market, we would expect that,


                                                  13
conditional on observable data, deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece would have

better-than-average delinquency and default experience. We reject this hypothesis in the data

that follows.


III.     Data


The data for this study comes from two main sources: Trepp Data Feed and Commercial

Mortgage Alert (CMA) CMBS Data. Trepp is the leading data provider in commercial

mortgage-backed securities and is used by most major investors in the CMBS market. Trepp

Data Feed consists of four separate files: a property file, a loan file, a deal file, and a bond file.

Each file includes annual, end-of-year performance data, including cash flow, for all properties,

loans, deals, and bonds. We obtain a number of important variables from Trepp, including loan

delinquency status, the date on which a loan was transferred to the special servicer, the date on

which a loan was returned back to the master servicer, the date on which a loan was foreclosed

or transferred to REO (Real Estate Owned by the special servicer), the loan-to-value ratio (LTV),

and debt service coverage ratio (DSCR). The DSCR is the ratio of property cash flow to total

debt payments. Thus a ratio of 1.25 implies that property cash flow is 1.25x required debt

service payments, or that property cash flow could fall by 20% and still allow the debtor to cover

his loan payments from existing cash flow.


CMA is a weekly newsletter. It provides historical data on all new CMBS issuances and the

initial prices of many bonds sold to investors at the time of the securitization. CMA lists the

owner’s name for many junior pieces10, enabling us to identify the most important variable in our

analysis: whether the special servicer (SPS) owns the B-piece. Initial bond prices include the

10
  There is no such as data field “B-piece buyer” in the data base itself. However, there is a short paragraph note for
each deal and in many deals the B-piece buyer’s name is listed. We add this field by going over all the notes.

The Trepp data consists of an unbalanced panel of 839 deals with up to six years of observations

(1998-2003), depending on when the deal was originated. We merge the files from Trepp and

CMA by issuer name and serial number, successfully matching 702 of the 839 deals. Of these

702 deals, 588 have the name of the special servicer and 360 have B-piece ownership. Overall,

our final sample has 357 deals (with 46,492 loans) that have both the B-piece ownership and

special servicer information. Table 1 lists these deals by the year that the deal closed. In recent

years, the average deal size has varied between $786 million and $1,164 million, while the

average number of loans per deal ranges from 105 to 232. Total CMBS issuance peaked in 1998

and again in 2003 at the end of our sample.


Table 2 summarizes the percentage of deals that the special servicer owns the B-piece for all

fifteen special servicers that service at least 5 deals in our sample. These special servicers

manage deals that account for 89% of the number of deals and 92% of the loan balances in our

sample, suggesting that the special servicing industry is moderately concentrated. Among the

317 deals that these special servicers manage, the special servicer owns the B-piece in 203 (64%)

deals. Although most special servicers own the B-piece in at least some portion of their deals,

some special servicers show a strong “preference” for one type of structure or the other. This

fact is especially true for the top 6 special servicers. We include special servicer dummies in all

default and delinquency specifications to control for possible differences in preferences or

expertise across special servicers.

IV.    Results


A. When do special servicers hold the B-piece? (Hypothesis H1)


We begin by comparing the characteristics of deals based on whether or not the special servicer

holds the B-piece (Table 3). The results are clearly consistent with our first hypothesis, H1. Ex-

ante observable characteristics do not vary economically or statistically in deals based on

whether the special servicer holds the B-piece. We examine the most commonly used measures

of deal size or performance: loan balances, number of loans, LTV, DSCR, Weighted Average

Coupon (WAC), and AAA subordination (percentage of the deal that is rated AAA by the rating

agencies).


Yet, ex-poste, the deals in which the special servicer owns the low-rated tranche have

appreciably higher delinquency rates. For delinquencies of greater than 30 days, these

differences are statistically significant at the 5% level. Note that delinquency is a relatively

objective measure of a troubled loan, with delinquencies typically being triggered by late

payments or in some cases, cash flow falling to very low levels. Effort by the special servicer

should have little effect on a loan becoming delinquent. This evidence also suggests that special

servicers do not have superior information relative to the underwriter that allows them to

“cherry-pick” (purchase) the B-piece in only the best (unobserved) quality deals.


Of course, these are just unconditional means. To systematically explore this point, we examine

the likelihood of delinquency in a deal in year t conditional on observable information in year t-1.

The results are presented in Table 4. The dependent variable is the delinquency rate for each

deal; that is, the ratio of the outstanding balance of loans in delinquency to the total outstanding

of balances for the deal. Explanatory variables include measures of observable quality (LTV,


                                                 16
DSCR, controls for different property types), year dummy variables, and whether the special

servicer (SPS) owns the B-piece.


In all specifications, the coefficient on the dummy variable indicating that the special servicer

owns the B-piece is positive and statistically significant at conventional confidence levels,

implying that special servicers hold the B-piece in lower quality deals, after controlling for

observable characteristics. Investors almost surely have a difficult time monitoring

delinquencies that are uncorrelated with observable measures of quality such as DSCR and LTV.


Other coefficients in the regression are either insignificant or have the expected sign. The lack

of importance of LTV in predicting delinquency is not surprising given that originators and

underwriters have more information than these characteristics and should be expected to use this

information when deciding which loans to include in a pool.11 High LTV loans in the pool may

have other hard-to-measure attributes indicating that such loans face a lower delinquency or

default rate. (e.g., the property that serves as collateral for a high LTV loan may have a long-

term lease with a credit-quality tenant.) The simultaneity of many loan and pool characteristics

just highlights the importance of unobserved quality in this market and thus the important role of

servicers in managing loan delinquencies and defaults.


Other columns provide additional controls to ensure that our results are not driven by functional

form. To account for the strong non-linearity in the effects of LTV and DSCR, we use dummy

variables instead of the numerical values in columns 2, 4, and 6. In the first two columns, we



11
   Archer, Elmer, Harrison and Ling (2002) argue for the endogeneity in commercial mortgage underwriting in
terms of LTV ratio, which would imply no empirical relationship between default and LTV because lender would
require lower LTVs for high risk mortgages. They examine 495 multifamily mortgages securitized by the Resolution
Trust Corporation (RTC) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and find no evidence of LTV effect
on default.


                                                      17
include only a sparse set of covariates, including whether the special servicer owns the B-piece,

LTV, and DSCR. Columns 3 and 4 add year dummies and property type controls.


Most strikingly, the last two columns include dummy variables for each special servicer and thus

rely on variation in deals for individual special servicers based on whether or not they own the

B-piece. Despite the potential loss of variation, the coefficient on whether the special servicer

owns the B-piece rises in magnitude.


The results in this sub-section are consistent with hypothesis H1. Deals in which the special

servicer holds the B-piece are more likely to be delinquent, but do not differ on observable

characteristics. This finding is consistent with our expectation that an underwriter who has

superior information on the true quality of deals will choose to align incentives through having

the special servicer own the B-piece in deals with a higher expected delinquency rate.


B. Agency conflicts in transferring loans to special servicing (H2)


Next, we investigate whether holding the B-piece mitigates agency problems by examining when

the special servicer transfers loans to special servicing. Special servicing is costly. Hypothesis

H2 predicts that the special servicer will be less likely to transfer a delinquent loan to special

servicing when she owns the B-piece for two reasons: first, she exerts more effort in identifying

the right loans to transfer; and second, the special servicer is the residual claimant and thus she

does not benefit from additional fees paid while loans are in special servicing. Table 5 reports

the results of a probit model in which the dependent variable equals one when a delinquent loan

is transferred to special servicing within certain period of time. Independent variables are

whether the special servicer owns the B-piece and other explanatory variables. We examine

transfers of delinquent loans that occur between two and six months after delinquency.


                                                  18
The estimated coefficients on the dummy variable indicating that the special servicer owns the

B-piece are negative and highly significantly different from zero. The coefficients are large,

suggesting a 7.5 to 13.8 percent lower likelihood of transferring loans into special servicing

when the special servicer owns the most junior tranche. As the time period for action gets longer

and special servicers have time to investigate troubled loans, the coefficient on special servicer

owning the B-piece grows in magnitude. Industry analysts suggest that low cash flow (low debt

service coverage ratio) is the most troubling indicator of eventual default so, not surprisingly,

low DSCR loans are more likely to be transferred into special servicing. The negative

coefficient on high LTV loans is a bit surprising. For seasoned loans, however, true property

value is usually hard to measure, unlike cash flow. These findings confirm our prediction that

the alignment of interests helps to alleviate the agency problem at the transfer stage.


C. Agency conflicts in working out troubled loans (H3A and H3B)


Once a loan reaches the special servicing stage, the special servicer must now exert additional

effort to quickly and accurately decide how to manage the troubled loans. Her choices include: 1)

acquiring the property from the borrower through the foreclosure or bankruptcy process and

liquidating the asset or 2) negotiating with the existing borrower, possibly extending the loan,

lowering the interest rate, and/or writing down a portion of the loan principal. As discussed in

Section II, we expect that the alignment of interests will cause the special servicer to liquidate

sooner under ordinary circumstances (Hypothesis H3A). Delaying action allows the special

servicer to avoid exerting costly effort in identifying loans that are good candidates for

liquidation as well as earn additional fees when loans spend a longer time in special servicing. In

addition, a longer liquidation process is often costly for loan investors because collateral values

can decline rapidly over time, as property owners typically cut back on maintenance and take


                                                 19
additional risk on highly-leveraged properties. When the special servicer is the residual claimant

as owner of the B-piece, she internalizes these costs and has incentives to act more quickly.

However, as a larger percentage of the loans in a deal get in trouble, the likelihood grows that

potential losses will exceed the size of the junior piece. At that point, having the special servicer

own the B-piece creates conflicts between the junior and senior securities holders. As potential

losses grow, a special servicer who also holds the junior piece may choose to delay liquidation in

the hope that property cash flow or values will rise (Hypothesis H3B).


In Table 6, we run a probit regression estimating the likelihood that a loan is liquidated within a

fixed period of time--6 months or a year. We define a property as being liquidated if the records

indicate a foreclosure, a REO transaction, or a bankruptcy. As in other regressions, we control

for other observable quality variables, including LTV, DSCR, deal type dummies, property type

dummies, dummy variables for origination year, and special servicer dummies. As predicted,

loans in deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece are between three and five percent

more likely to be liquidated within six months or a year, a result that is statistically significant

with at least 90 percent confidence in all specifications. As before, the magnitude of the

coefficients rises when we include special servicer dummy variables, although the standard error

increases as well. These results suggest that a given special servicer behaves differently

depending on whether she owns the B-piece, a strong indication that agency conflicts are

important in this market.


The coefficients on other controls are consistent with expectations. LTV has a positive

coefficient, consistent with previous literature. Specifications using dummy variables for LTV

instead of the continuous value show that the main impact of LTV is for loans with an LTV




                                                  20
higher than 80%. The coefficients on DSCR have the expected negative sign, although they are

significant only in columns 4 to 6.


Next we examine whether the special servicer’s actions change when the percentage of seriously

delinquent loans rises in a pool. We define the extent to which a deal faces serious delinquency

based on whether the sum of all delinquent loan balances in a deal exceeds various thresholds.

We include the measure of serious delinquency in the regression directly, as well as including an

interaction term between this dummy variable and whether the special servicer owns the B-piece.

We expect the interaction term to be negative if conflicts between securities holders are material

in seriously delinquent deals.


Table 7 presents evidence of conflicts between senior and junior tranches when a deal gets into

serious trouble (H3B). The coefficient on the interaction term denoting that a deal has serious

delinquencies and the special servicer owns the most junior tranche is negative and statistically

different from zero with at least 93 percent confidence in all specifications. The coefficient on

whether the special servicer owns the B-piece is positive and statistically significant. Putting

these two coefficients together suggests that special servicers who own the first-loss position act

differently when aggregate potential losses rise. For deals with a relatively small percentage

delinquent loans, the special servicer liquidates more quickly when she owns the most junior

tranche. Yet when the percentage of delinquencies rises, the special servicer appears to delay

liquidation. The coefficient on the dummy for serious delinquency is also positive and

significant in most columns, suggesting either that the special servicer becomes more aggressive

when many loans in a deal are in serious trouble, possibly due to concern with reputation, or that

unobserved quality is worse when many loans in a deal get in trouble.




                                                21
D. Unobserved quality for deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece


Lower transfer rates into special servicing and higher liquidation rates once in special servicing

for deals with small potential losses in which the special servicer owns the B-piece are consistent

with the hypothesis that the special servicer exerts more effort in identifying the right loans to

transfer. Yet we are still concerned that deals may differ in unobserved quality in ways that

might bias at least some of our findings. In particular, we are concerned that the special servicer

might own deals with higher unobserved quality loans. Table 2 shows that the special servicer

owns the B-piece in deals with a higher delinquency rate. Now we examine liquidation,

conditional on delinquency. By conditioning on delinquency rather than special servicing, we

remove the impact any actions taken by the special servicer in special servicing. If the exertion

of the effort is the only reason for differences in the timing of liquidation, we would expect that

the eventual liquidation of loans would be similar whether or not the special servicer owns the B-

piece.


The results, presented in Table 8, show that, conditional on delinquency, liquidation rates are

higher, not lower, for deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece. Thus, if anything,

deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece have worse unobserved quality. This

suggests that the special servicer is especially accurate when referring loans to special servicing

when she owns the B-piece. However, these findings are statistically different from zero in the

first two columns based on whether a delinquent loan is liquidated in 6 months. In the last two

columns, when we examine liquidation within one year, the coefficients drop in half and are not

significantly different from zero. As above, these findings suggest that the special servicer

handles additional delinquencies more quickly when she owns the B-piece.




                                                 22
E. Market prices of securities and agency conflicts (H4)


Finally, we take advantage of initial bond pricing data from CMA to examine whether bond

investors pay a premium for deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece. The reasoning

is straightforward: if there is value created from this incentive enhancing structure, the market

should require lower yield in deals with this structure than in deals in which the special servicer

does not own the B-piece, ceteris paribus. This finding would be especially striking given that

deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece have higher delinquency and liquidation

rates.


In the regressions, we examine spreads within each bond rating class. Controlling for bond

ratings provides for an alternative way of dealing with the issue of unobserved quality. After all,

the ratings agency’s primary role is to provide a more informed view about default probabilities.

Discussions with the rating agencies confirm that while collateral quality and capital for special

servicers are critical in determining bond ratings, they do not consider whether the special

servicer owns the B-piece. In part, rating agencies do not know this information when they

determine bond ratings, which must occur prior to the actual sale of the bonds. Also, ownership

data on bonds is not available for all deals and there is often no guarantee that the special

servicer will maintain ownership of the B-piece. Of course, selling the B-piece after a deal has

gone public is likely quite difficult given the information asymmetry between the special servicer

and any potential buyers of the first-loss position.


Hypothesis H4 predicts that investors should be willing to pay a premium for bonds in deals in

which the special servicer owns the lowest rated tranche and that this premium should be most

pronounced for the lowest rated tranches that face the greatest risk of losses. Regression results



                                                 23
in Table 9 are consistent with this hypothesis. The dependent variable is the spread over the

benchmark yield as reported in the CMA pricing data set (measured in basis points, or 0.01%).

In addition to whether the special servicer owns the most junior tranche, we include a complete

set of dummy variables for each bond ratings category and year and quarter dummies. Since

most of the deals are rated by more than one rating agency, we use the best rating from among all

ratings.12 We also restrict the sample to bonds which have a fixed rate and thus are easier to

evaluate. This cuts our sample of bonds by about 10 percent.


With all bonds (column 1), the coefficient on the special servicer owning the B-piece is negative

and fairly small (about 8 basis points), and also not statistically different from zero at

conventional confidence levels. However, these regressions include all rated tranches, while

most of the benefits associated with the special servicer owning the B-piece go to the junior

security holders who bear most of the credit risk. (Note: As of the date on this draft, there have

never been any losses to CMBS securities with investment-grade ratings of BBB or above.)


In column 2, we examine only the tranches with non-investment-grade ratings (below BBB-).

The sample drops appreciably to 78 observations. Most junior pieces are privately placed and

are not publicly priced, so the regression sample mainly consists of senior tranches. For example,

almost 97% of all tranches in our data have investment-grade ratings. Nonetheless, the

coefficient on deals in which the special servicer owns the B-piece becomes much more negative

and is highly statistically significant. In the bottom row of the table, we list the average spread

for each regression sample. When all the tranches are included, the average effect of aligning the

interests is fairly small, because the majority of tranches are senior securities that bear very little

12
  Previous versions of the paper also reported results that used the worst rating among all ratings assigned and
results that included adjustable rate securities. Coefficient estimates and standard errors were similar, although they
varied across specification. Results are available upon request.


                                                          24
credit risk. When focusing only on the tranches with below investment-grade ratings in column

2, the estimated effects are much larger in magnitude. For the lowest rated tranches, the

evidence suggests that the underwriter is able to sell securities at a spread that is 29% percent

lower when the special servicer holds the B-piece.


These findings are consistent with underwriters facing a tradeoff in which they are able to sell

securities at a lower yield when the special servicer owns the B-piece, but that the special

servicer requires a premium to be willing to hold the B-piece.




V.     Conclusion


The asset-backed securities market has exploded in recent years. Benefits of ABS include

completing the market for securities, enhanced liquidity, transparency, and specialization.

Nonetheless, this paper demonstrates that securitization also involves potentially serious moral

hazard and agency conflicts associated with the separation of ownership and control of assets and

conflicts of interest between junior and senior securities holders. These conflicts are similar to

those faced by firms that finance with equity and debt, but are more pronounced given the large

number of debt tranches in most ABS securitizations and the stricter priority claims that are

enforced by courts in securitizations. Our findings suggest that securitization results in a second-

best solution in dealing with troubled loans relative to a situation in which there is a single entity

that owns a whole loan and manages potential delinquencies and defaults. The special servicer,

the agent in charge of the workout strategy for delinquent assets, may not always behave in the

best interests of security holders. To curb the agency problem, the special servicer often holds

the most junior tranche (the so-called B-piece).


                                                   25
Using data on 357 CMBS deals involving over 46,000 loans, we find that the special servicer

holds the B-piece in worse quality deals, with a greater percentage of realized delinquencies and

liquidations after controlling for observable loan and deal attributes. Thus underwriters who

have superior information appear to mitigate information asymmetries between investors and

managers (special servicers) by aligning ownership and control in deals where this structure is

most valuable. The special servicer appears to behave more efficiently in most situations when

she owns the B-piece, transferring a smaller percentage of delinquent loans to costly special

servicing and liquidating troubled loans more quickly. The market recognizes these benefits;

spreads for non-investment grade bonds are 29 percent lower in deals in which the special

servicer owns the B-piece. All of these findings are consistent with the predictions of agency

theory.


However, the structure is not flawless. When deals face a larger percentage of delinquent loans,

a special servicer who is also the B-piece holder reverses behavior by delaying liquidation,

possibly because the downside loss can be shared with senior security holders. Together, these

results show that securitization involves tradeoffs that may lead to a second-best outcome when

handling troubled loans.


These findings still leave a large remaining unresolved puzzle: why doesn’t the special servicer

purchase the B-piece in all deals. After all, as the most informed party and the party in control of

most decisions, the special servicer should have the highest willingness-to-pay. We provide two

potential answers. First, the underwriter (and other investors) may be wary of the asset

substitution problem. To the extent that special servicers delay liquidation when they suffer

larger losses in a pool, the special servicer’s high willingness-to-pay may be more than offset by

expected losses in value for other tranches. Nonetheless, our bond pricing results suggest asset


                                                26
substitution is not a big concern, at least during a time when real estate markets have been strong

and losses low.


A second potential explanation is that special servicers may be more risk averse than other

investors, which may offset their potentially higher valuation for the B-piece. Special servicers

in the CMBS market have unique skills that limit their ability to diversify into other areas. In

addition, special servicers must hold capital and retain strong credit ratings in order to remain in

business. Times when losses in existing CMBS securities are high may also correspond to times

when profits from future deals may fall if credit if investors are wary of making new loans. Of

special interest to this analysis, Figure 1 compares aggregate issuance to the percentage of deals

in which the special servicer owns the B-piece. The percentage of deals in which the special

servicer owns the B-piece in a given year (measured by either by dollars or number of deals)

appears inversely related to the total issuance of CMBS securities. This observation is consistent

with the view that special servicers face a tradeoff between their exposure to CMBS risk and the

extent to which special servicers own the B-piece, although with eight years of aggregate data,

this analysis is hardly definitive.


From a policy perspective, our finding that having the special servicer own the B-piece alleviates

agency and moral hazard conflicts only when delinquency rates in a pool are relatively low is

also a potential warning. Regulations for insurance companies and new risk-based capital

requirements for banks allow institutions to hold less capital to protect against losses in securities

than for losses in whole loans. Yet we still do not know how the ABS market would perform in

a recession with appreciable declines in asset values. Our results surely do not generalize to such

a situation. The recent growth in the private ABS market does not provide the data to address

this question. Nonetheless, this is an issue that is worthy of additional attention as regulated


                                                 27
institutions rely more heavily on rated ABS securities to fund future lending activities.

This table compares some basic characteristics of deals in which the special servicer (SPS)
holds the B-piece or does not hold the B-piece. The fourth column presents t-statistics for the
test of whether the means of each variable are equal in columns 2 and 3. All delinquency
measures are the percentage of outstanding balance of delinquent loans over outstanding
balance of all loans in a deal.

    Table 7 Liquidation Conditional on Special Servicing for Serious Delinquent Deals

Serious delinquency equals 1 if there are more than X% of the deal in delinquency and 0
otherwise. The regressions also include an interaction term of SPS owns B-piece and deal is
seriously delinquent. Estimates control for correlation across loans within each deal and
heteroskedasity. The table reports partial effects.

Dependent variable: Dummy that equals to 1 if a loan was liquidated in the 6 months after
transfer to special servicing and 0 otherwise.
