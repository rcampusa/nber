Can Variation in Subgroups' Average Treatment Effects Explain Treatment Effect Heterogeneity?

                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we assess whether welfare reform affects earnings only through mean impacts that are
constant within but vary across subgroups. This is important because researchers interested in treatment
effect heterogeneity typically restrict their attention to estimating mean impacts that are only allowed
to vary across subgroups. Using a novel approach to simulating treatment group earnings under the
constant mean-impacts within subgroup model, we find that this model does a poor job of capturing
the treatment effect heterogeneity for Connecticut’s Jobs First welfare reform experiment using quantile
 treatment effects. Notably, ignoring within-group heterogeneity would lead one to miss evidence that
the Jobs First experiment’s effects are consistent with central predictions of basic labor supply theory.

1     Introduction
    In previous work we estimated quantile treatment eﬀects using data from a randomized ex-
periment to evaluate the labor supply impact of Connecticut’s welfare reform program Jobs First
(Bitler, Gelbach & Hoynes (2006)). In that context, labor supply theory predicts that the reform
should cause heterogeneous treatment eﬀects across the earnings distribution. The data revealed a
pattern consistent with these predictions, which, roughly speaking, are that there should be mass
points at zero earnings in both the treated and control distributions, positive earnings eﬀects in
the middle of the earnings distribution, and negative earnings eﬀects at the top of the earnings
distribution. We found exactly this pattern of results, as Figure 3 of our earlier paper shows, using
estimated quantile treatment eﬀects (QTE) of Jobs First on the earnings distribution. Moreover,
the range of QTE was quite broad, from -$300 to $500, far above the mean impact of $82.
    Our QTE-based approach to measuring treatment eﬀect heterogeneity diﬀers from the conven-
tional one. One common approach involves estimating mean treatment eﬀects but allowing the
treatment eﬀects to vary across subgroups based on demographic or other covariates. One then
evaluates whether the subgroup-specific diﬀerences in treatment eﬀects appear to vary importantly
(for a review within the welfare reform literature see Grogger & Karoly (2005)).1 Because this
conventional approach is very simple and is widely followed, it is important to assess whether it is
adequate to the task of measuring real-world treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. A natural question is
whether the heterogeneity revealed by QTE could somehow be explained using only mean impacts
allowed to vary across judiciously chosen subgroups.2
    We address this issue in the present paper. In particular, we return to the Jobs First experiment,
with its powerful and heterogeneous labor supply predictions, and seek to estimate the earnings
distribution that would prevail under experimental treatment under the null hypothesis that a
“mean-impacts-only” model was adequate to characterize Jobs First’s eﬀects. While estimating
mean impacts over a finite set of subgroups is a simple parametric problem, constructing this null
distribution is not, because only the mean impacts are parametrically specified. All other features
of the null earnings distribution under treatment must be left nonparametric.
    To deal with this challenge, we construct an estimate of what we term the “simulated earnings

   1
     Kline & Tartari (2013) also use the Jobs First experimental data and apply restrictions implied by labor supply
theory to develop bounds on intensive and extensive margin responses to reform.
   2
     Our paper is related to work on the eﬀects of changing the distribution of explanatory variables on quantiles of the
unconditional distribution (Firpo, Fortin & Lemieux (2009)) or of changing either the distribution of covariates or the
conditional distribution of the outcome given covariates on the marginal distribution (Chernozhukov, Fernandez-Val
& Melly (Forthcoming)).
distribution under treatment.” We construct an estimate of this simulated distribution in a few
basic steps. First, we estimate the program’s mean impact on earnings for each subgroup of interest;
we do so in the usual way, by subtracting the control group’s sample mean from the treatment
group’s sample mean. Second, we estimate each control group woman’s “simulated earnings level
under treatment” by adding the relevant subgroup-specific mean impact to her actual earnings
level. The result is an estimate of the woman’s simulated earnings under treatment, given that the
mean-impacts-only model is correct. We use these individual estimates to construct an estimate of
the simulated earnings distribution under treatment and compare it to the actual observed earnings
distribution under treatment to evaluate the predictive power of the mean impacts approach.
   For example, suppose the subgroups are high and low education women. For high and low edu-
cation women in each time period, we calculate the mean diﬀerence in earnings between treatments
and controls. We then add this subgroup- and time-specific mean treatment eﬀect to the earnings
of each woman in the control group. The empirical distribution of simulated earnings across all
control group women is then our estimate of the earnings distribution under treatment that would
prevail if the mean-impacts-only model were correct for subgroups defined by education. We eval-
uate the performance of various mean-impacts-only models by comparing earnings QTE estimated
using the actual treatment and control earnings distribution to simulated QTE estimated using the
simulated earnings under treatment and the actual control group distribution.
   We consider three mean-impacts-only statistical models. In the first, we assume that there
is a single mean impact within each subgroup over the entire post-random assignment period
we consider. Since the period is relatively long—seven quarters—we then relax the approach by
allowing the subgroup-specific mean impact to vary by the quarter after random assignment. We
find that the simulated earnings distributions under treatment generated by these mean-impacts-
only models do a very poor job of replicating the pattern of estimated actual QTE. Furthermore,
the presence of large mass points at zero in both the control group distribution and the actual
treated distribution are, by themselves, suﬃcient reason to reject these two mean-impacts-only
models (Heckman, Smith & Clements (1997)). To avoid rejecting solely on this basis, we consider
a third mean-impacts-only statistical model, which imposes equal mass points at zero in the actual
and simulated earnings distributions under treatment. The simulated earnings QTE based on this
third, “participation-adjusted” mean-impacts-only model look much closer to the actual QTE. Even
so, they fail to exhibit the negative earnings eﬀects at the top of the distribution that we observe in
the actual QTE estimates. As we discuss, since these negative eﬀects are a key prediction of labor


                                                  2
supply theory, we believe this is an important failure of (even our most flexible) mean-impacts-only
model. Finally, we apply distributional statistical tests and find they, with few exceptions, reject
the null hypothesis that this third mean-impacts-only model is correctly specified.
    In sum, we find compelling evidence against the null hypothesis that any of three “mean-
impacts-only” models can explain the important features of the treatment eﬀect heterogeneity
evident using QTE, shown in Bitler et al. (2006). But, importantly, we find that not all subgroups
fare equally poorly in generating simulated QTE. We consider a rich set of covariates to assign
subgroups including standard demographics (education and marital status of the woman, number
and ages of children) as well as variables capturing earnings and welfare participation prior to
the experiment. We also consider interactions of these variables, such as education by earnings
history. We find that groups defined based on pre-treatment earnings do considerably better than
groups based on demographics (as might be expected given Heckman, Ichimura, Smith & Todd
(1998)). Given that, it is important to point out that analyses of standard survey data (such as
the Census or Current Population Survey) do not allow for the measurement and use of these most
predictive variables–instead allowing only for the standard demographic variables which we find
provide comparatively little ability to capture treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. With the growing
use of administrative data, these limitations of survey data will likely become less important.
    In addition to its substantive findings, which we believe are quite important, this paper makes
a methodological contribution (if an informal one), by complementing some important work in
the program evaluation literature. For example, Crump, Hotz, Imbens & Mitnik (2008) develop
convenient nonparametric tests of the null hypothesis that average treatment eﬀects are zero, or
non-zero but constant, across subgroups. By comparison, we test the null hypothesis of constant
within-group treatment eﬀects while allowing average treatment eﬀects to vary arbitrarily across
subgroups. In addition, one can regard our simulation-based method as an application of Abadie’s
(2002, p. 289) suggestion that one might be able to test the null hypothesis of a constant treatment
eﬀect using distributional equality tests, applied to many subgroups.3
    To our knowledge, ours is the first paper in the applied literature to construct and test a non-
parametric null hypothesis under which all heterogeneity is driven by treatment eﬀects that are

    3
      An interesting direction for future work involves work on program evaluation as a statistical decision problem
accounting for eﬀects on distributions, like Manski (2004) and Dehejia (2005), and Bhattacharaya & Dupas (2012).
If there is substantial within-group heterogeneity, then it might be possible to improve program assignment decisions
more by accounting for this heterogeneity, rather than using only information on within-group mean impacts.

constant within, but vary across, a large number of identifiable subgroups.4 Since many applied
researchers use subgroup-specific mean impacts to assess the presence of treatment eﬀect hetero-
geneity, this is an important addition to the program evaluation testing toolkit.

2        Experimental Setting
        Concerns about welfare dependency and low employment rates led many states to reform their
Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) programs during a wave of reform in the 1990s.
This movement, which initially involved state-level waivers from federal welfare AFDC rules, cul-
minated in 1996 with the enactment of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act
(PRWORA). PRWORA eliminated AFDC and replaced it with Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families (TANF). Under TANF, welfare recipients face lifetime time limits for welfare receipt,
stringent work requirements, and the threat of financial sanctions. PRWORA also allows states
substantial flexibility in designing their TANF programs, and some states decided to provide greater
financial incentives for participants to combine welfare and work. One such state was Connecticut,
which chose to convert its existing, waiver-based Jobs First program into its TANF program. Be-
cause Jobs First started out as a demonstration program under federal waiver rules, Connecticut
ran a random assignment experiment to evaluate the program. We used MDRC’s public use data
from this experiment in our earlier paper, Bitler et al. (2006), and we use the same data here.

2.1       The Jobs First Program and Labor Supply Theory
        We discuss the Jobs First experiment and its likely incentive eﬀects in considerable detail in
Bitler et al. (2006).5 Here we simply summarize the experiment’s main features and explain why it
is a good choice for our present analysis. The experimental participants were either assigned to the
pre-existing AFDC program (control) or Jobs First (treatment). Jobs First includes a lifetime time
limit of 21 months, compared to no time limit under AFDC. The maximum monthly benefit level
received by a program participant in a family of 3 was $543 in 2001 under both programs. Under
AFDC assignment, a woman’s benefit payment would be reduced by 67 cents for each dollar she
earned during her first four months on aid, and by 100 cents thereafter (a 100% implicit tax rate).
By comparison, the Jobs First program disregards all earned income below the federal poverty
guideline in determining benefit levels. As a result, the implicit marginal tax rate under Jobs First

    4
     Importantly, Koenker & Xiao (2002) lay out an approach to such testing for iid data, extending Khmaladze’s
approach to testing in the location scale and other related models.
   5
     For a detailed description of the Jobs First experiment and the evaluation results MDRC provided under contract
to the state of Connecticut, see Bloom, Scrivener, Michalopoulos, Morris, Hendra, Adams-Ciardullo & Walter (2002).



                                                         4
program assignment is 0% for all earnings up to the poverty line, at which point there is a cliﬀ
(in principle, another penny of earnings above the federal poverty line would cause the state to
terminate the entire benefit payment for women assigned to Jobs First). Thus, the two programs
present women with starkly diﬀerent budget sets.
   In this paper, we focus on each experimental subject’s first 21 months following random assign-
ment. We do so because the time limit cannot yet bind during this period, so that static labor
supply theory makes especially clear predictions concerning Jobs First’s eﬀects on earnings. As we
discuss in Bitler et al. (2006), these predictions are heterogeneous. First, Jobs First should cause
employment to rise, reducing the share of women with zero earnings. Second, by substantially
reducing the implicit tax rate on earnings, Jobs First should cause hours worked to rise for women
who would have had both welfare income and earnings under AFDC (provided that substitution
eﬀects dominate income eﬀects). Since women could receive AFDC only if they had quite low
income to begin with, such women will tend to be located low in the earnings distribution in the
relevant quarters. Thus, Jobs First should cause an increase in earnings over the lower part of the
income distribution.
   Third, by extending eligibility for cash assistance to women with earnings right below the federal
poverty line—which is considerably greater than the level of earnings at which women would lose
eligibility for AFDC payments—Jobs First creates incentives for some women to reduce earnings.
For women whose earnings would be less than the federal poverty line were they assigned to AFDC,
Jobs First assignment provides a lump-sum transfer of income, which will reduce a woman’s optimal
earnings in the presence of any income eﬀect. In addition, the cliﬀ nature of the Jobs First budget
set creates an incentive to gain Jobs First eligibility by reducing earnings to just under the federal
poverty line, among those women whose earnings would not exceed the federal poverty line by
more than the maximum benefit payment. Further, even some women who would earn more than
the sum of the federal poverty level and the Jobs First benefit payment might choose to reduce
earnings to become eligible for Jobs First, due to the disutility of labor supply. Finally, among
women whose earnings under AFDC would be suﬃciently above the sum of the federal poverty
level and the maximum benefit payment, Jobs First assignment will have no eﬀect on earnings,
since these women would choose not to receive cash assistance under either program assignment.
   In sum, static labor supply theory predicts changes to extensive and intensive margins of labor
supply: (i) both the AFDC and Jobs First earnings distributions will have mass points at zero,
with the mass being larger among those assigned to AFDC (Job’s First should increase extensive


                                                  5
margin labor supply); (ii) earnings will be greater under Jobs First over some range of the earnings
distribution above zero; (iii) higher up in the distribution, Jobs First may lead to reduced earnings;
and (iv) there might be a range in the distribution even further up where there will be no impact
of Jobs First assignment.

2.2     The Jobs First Evaluation Data
      The Jobs First evaluation was conducted by MDRC, which made public-use data available for
outside researchers upon application. The data include information on 4,803 cases; 2,396 were
assigned to Jobs First, with 2,407 assigned to AFDC. There are administrative data on quarterly
earnings and monthly welfare payments,6 available for most of the two years preceding program
assignment as well as for at least 4 years after assignment. Our outcome variable of interest is
quarterly earnings, and as noted above, we restrict attention to the first 21 months, or seven
quarters, following each woman’s random assignment. In all analyses, we pool the seven quarters
of data for each woman, so that there are a total of 4, 803 x 7 = 33, 621 quarterly observations
in our estimation sample. In addition to the administrative earnings and welfare data, the public
use data set contains demographics collected at the experiment’s baseline, including each woman’s
number of children, education, age, marital status, race, and ethnicity.
      An advantage of the Jobs First data is that it includes pre-random assignment data on earnings
and welfare use. These data allow us to construct variables related to pre-experiment earnings
and welfare history—variables that are not available in standard survey data such as the Current
Population Survey. Using the earnings and welfare history, we can then construct subgroups that
are plausibly more likely to map to the theoretical labor supply predictions discussed above. If the
mean-impacts-only model fails here, where we can create unusually well designed subgroups, it is
unlikely to succeed elsewhere.

2.3     Defining Subgroups
      As discussed above, the Jobs First program is predicted to aﬀect extensive and intensive labor
supply. Static labor supply theory implies that variation in the impact of the policy intervention
will depend on a woman’s earnings opportunities, her preferences for market work versus home
time, and her fixed costs of work. Good subgroup choices will proxy for one or more of these
elements. Available variables that might proxy for wages include education, earnings and welfare

  6
    For confidentiality purposes, MDRC rounded all earnings data. Earnings between $1–$99 were rounded to $100,
so that there are no false zeros. All other earnings amounts were rounded to the nearest $100. Welfare payments
were also rounded, though with $50 rather than $100 increments.



                                                      6
history, age, and marital status. Variables that might proxy for preferences related to market work
versus home time include number and ages of children, as well as welfare and earnings history. Age
of youngest child is an important predictor of fixed costs of work (child care).
    The primary subgroups we use in this paper are based on educational attainment, which is
available in standard survey data settings, and earnings and welfare-use history, which are not
usually available in such data sets. We also consider other demographics such as age and number
of children and marital history as well as interactions of these demographic variables and earnings
or welfare history. Our primary interest in choosing subgroups is to find covariates that are useful
in separating our samples into women likely to have earnings in the bottom, middle, and top of
the earnings distribution when assigned to AFDC. Variables that do a good job of separating the
sample this way are more likely to exhibit mean impacts that track the predictions made by labor
supply theory, which we discussed above.7
    In Figures 1a and 1b, we provide descriptive analyses using our Jobs First sample to help assess
the likely performance of candidate subgroup variables in capturing heterogeneity of labor supply
responses. Within a figure, each line shows the share of observations with earnings at the qth
percentile of the earnings distribution that are in the given subgroup relative to the subgroup’s
overall population share. We use the control group for this analysis. Consider first Figure 1a,
which examines two education subgroups: the solid line plots this ratio for high school graduates,
including those with a GED, and the dashed line plots this for high school dropouts (we have
omitted from the graph a line for the “education missing” subgroup which corresponds to about
6% of the control group). We include a horizontal line at 1 indicating parity and subgroups’ overall
shares in the sample are provided in the legend. To take one concrete example, around 62% of
the observations at the 60th percentile (of the post-treatment control group earnings distribution)
are high school graduates, and high school graduates are 62% of the control group, thus the value
for the 60th percentile high school graduates (solid line) is about 1. To accommodate the large
share of the sample with zero earnings, we truncate the x-axis at the 50th percentile. We treat the
mass point with zero earnings slightly diﬀerently; the value reported is the total share of the zero
earnings observations in the subgroup relative to the total share of the subgroup in the population.8

   7
     We have also used combined demographic variables to estimate a “single index” subgroup measure. We estimated
a standard wage equation for a sample of low educated single female heads of household in the CPS. We then used
the equation’s estimated coeﬃcients to create subgroups based on predicted wages. The qualitative results involving
this subgroup were similar to those based on the educational attainment subgroups.
   8
     We define centile Q’s share of a subgroup as the share of observations with earnings between the (q) and (q + 1)
quantiles, where q = Q/100. Thus, for example, if Q = 75, then the shares plotted in the figure for the 75th centile


                                                         7
    The figure shows, unsurprisingly, that high school graduates (relative to high school dropouts)
have earnings shifted toward the top of the (control group’s) post random assignment earnings
distribution. It also shows that high school dropouts have a greater share of quarterly observations
with zero earnings. The fact that education leads to “sorting” along the earnings distribution,
combined with strong labor supply predictions along the “potential” earnings distribution, suggest
that mean impacts calculated using subgroups defined by educational attainment might reflect the
treatment eﬀect heterogeneity predicted by static labor supply theory.
    We consider other demographic based subgroups in online Appendix Figure 1. These show that
subgroups based on age of youngest child (online Appendix Figure 1a) and marital status (online
Appendix Figure 1b) do not show much “sorting” along the post-treatment earnings distribution,
but instead are fairly evenly (although noisily) spread out across the control group. We found similar
results, not shown here, for number of children and age of the woman as well as interactions of
these demographic variables. This suggests the mean eﬀects for these other demographic subgroups
will not be helpful in uncovering treatment eﬀect heterogeneity.
    We also take advantage of our earnings and welfare history data to construct additional sub-
groups. As discussed above, we observe earnings and welfare participation, at the quarterly level,
for seven quarters prior to random assignment. Because a large fraction of the sample is in the
middle of a welfare spell at random assignment (RA), our main measure uses the earnings for the
most distant measure from random assignment(7th quarters prior)—thus minimizing the influence
of “Ashenfelter’s dip” (Ashenfelter (1978)). Figure 1b shows the relative shares for this subgroup.
In particular, we split the sample into three groups: those with no earnings 7 quarters prior to RA
(67% of the sample), those with earnings at or below the median (among nonzero earnings), and
those with earnings above the median (the median being $1600). We label these zero, low, and high
earnings history groups. Figure 1b shows that those with high prior earnings are disproportionately
likely to be at the top of the earnings distribution post-treatment, while those with no earnings and
low earnings 7 quarters prior to RA are concentrated in the bottom and middle of the post-random
assignment control group earnings distribution.
    Online Appendix Figures 1c and 1d show two other similar measures using earnings and welfare
history data. Online Appendix Figure 1c uses the full 7 quarters of earnings prior to RA and
constructs three groups: those with zero quarters with positive earnings, those with median or

concern observations with earnings ≥ 75th and < 76th percentile. We normalize by the total share in the population
to make it easier to plot diﬀerent sized subgroups on the same graph.



                                                        8
below median number of quarters among those with some earnings history, and those with above
median number of quarters. We label these zero (40% of the control group), low (32%, 1–4 quarters)
and high (28%, 5–7 quarters). This shows a similar result to Figure 1b—those controls with more
earnings history are more likely to exhibit higher earnings in the post-random assignment period
while those with no earnings history are more likely to have zero earnings post-RA. Finally, in
online Appendix Figure 1d we use welfare history to define subgroups, based on whether a woman
had any welfare income in the seventh quarter prior to RA (47% did, 53% did not). This graph
generally shows (less strikingly and more noisily than the earnings history graphs) that women
with no welfare history are disproportionately located at the top of the control group earnings
distribution post RA.
       We conclude from this analysis that educational attainment and earnings history represent
the most promising candidates for revealing treatment eﬀect heterogeneity. Women with lower
education and less prior earnings should be more likely to have positive mean impacts while those
with high education and more earnings history will be the most likely ones to exhibit the negative
eﬀects related to program entry and income eﬀects. Welfare history also holds some promise. Other
demographics, including marital status and number and ages of children are expected to be less
eﬀective. Thus, for the balance of the paper, we will focus primarily on subgroups defined by
educational attainment and earnings or welfare-use history (and their interactions).

2.4      Covariate Balance Across Treatment and Control Groups
       Exploratory work in Bitler et al. (2006) shows that observed variables generally are well balanced
across the Jobs First treatment and control groups. In that paper, we report means of the baseline
characteristics between the two groups and test for statistically significant diﬀerences. As described
there (and in Bloom et al. (2002)), there were some small but statistically significant treatment-
control diﬀerences in average values for a small number of these characteristics.9 However, the
standard test for joint significance of the diﬀerences fails to reject the null hypothesis that the
vector of covariate means is equal across program assignment (p = 0.16). We thus use simple
treatment-control diﬀerences in this paper.10

   9
     The Jobs First group is statistically significantly more likely than the AFDC group to have more than two children
and has lower earnings and higher welfare benefits for the period prior to random assignment.
  10
     In Bitler et al. (2006), we presented QTE using inverse propensity score weighting (Firpo (2007)) to account for
the (small amount of) imbalance in pre-random assignment variables. Weighting does not change our qualitative
conclusions in our earlier paper or here.

3     Results
3.1    Mean Impacts
    To begin, we explore whether subgroup-specific mean impacts are consistent with the heteroge-
neous labor supply predictions discussed above. In Table 1, we report estimated mean treatment
eﬀects for the full sample and the subgroups discussed in section 2.3. Each panel presents mean
diﬀerences for a diﬀerent set of subgroups, with the estimated mean treatment eﬀects in column 1,
their 95 percent confidence intervals in column 2, and the (AFDC) control group means in col-
umn 3. Note that we fully stratify the sample and estimate mean impacts within each subgroup.
An approach which is probably more common in the broader empirical literature is to estimate
regressions which include the treatment dummy as well as interactions of the treatment dummy
and subgroup indicators. We view these as alternative models that both fit under our rubric of
‘mean-impacts-only’ estimators. The first row in the table shows the overall number of observations
in the control (NC ) and treatment (NT ) groups in columns 4 and 5, while the other rows show
the share of the control and treatment groups in each subgroup (within the panel) in columns 4
and 5. At the bottom of the panel for each set of subgroups, we present an F -statistic (column 1)
and p-value (column 2) for testing the null that the subgroup means are equal (where the standard
errors account for correlation within individuals).
    The first row of Table 1 shows that overall Jobs First is associated with a statistically insignifi-
cant increase in quarterly earnings of $34, representing a 3% increase over the control group mean
of $1,139. The next four panels of the table present estimates for demographic subgroups defined
using the woman’s education, number and ages of children, and marital status. The results show
some diﬀerences in the point estimates across groups, with larger mean impacts for those with
lower education levels, those with older children and more children, and for those who had ever
been married. These diﬀerences in mean impacts are broadly consistent with labor supply theory’s
predictions of smaller impacts for those likely to have higher wages or high fixed costs of work or
lower taste for work.
    Notably, however, none of the mean impacts among subgroups defined based on demographic
variables exhibit the negative impacts that labor supply theory predicts should occur for at least
some women. Moreover, there is no demographic-variable-based subgroup for which the mean
impacts vary significantly across subgroups. For example, we cannot reject the equality of the mean
treatment eﬀects of $105 for high school dropouts and $42 for women with high school graduates



                                                  10
(F = 0.52, implying a p-value of 0.47). The same is true for the subgroups based on number and
ages of children, and marital status (see the table for F -statistics). These small mean impacts on
earnings and a lack of heterogeneity across demographic subgroups in the underlying mean impacts
for welfare reform is not unique to the Connecticut experiment. In their comprehensive review
of the welfare reform literature, Grogger, Karoly & Klerman (2002) conclude that “the eﬀects of
reform do not generally appear to be concentrated among any particular group of recipients” (p.
231).11
    The remainder of Table 1 provides similar analyses for subgroups based on pre-random assign-
ment earnings and welfare history. In contrast to the results for demographic subgroups, the results
using earnings history show striking and statistically significant diﬀerences across subgroups.
    Table 1 shows that for the earnings history subgroupings, the cross-subgroup pattern of mean
impacts reflects the labor supply theory predictions we discussed in section 2.1. Among those
with no earnings 7 quarters prior to RA, the mean impact is $157, which is a substantial eﬀect by
comparison to the mean control group earnings level of $762. Among those with low earnings 7
quarters prior to RA, the mean impacts are positive but smaller ($35) and statistically insignificant.
Strikingly, the mean impacts for women with high earnings 7 quarters prior to RA are negative and
nontrivial (-$361). A similar pattern is found using the number of quarters of earnings pre-RA:
the means are $212 for zero quarters, $103 for a low number of quarters, -$137 for a high number
of quarters. The F -test results show that for both measures of earnings history, the mean impacts
vary statistically significantly across the three subgroup members. These results, together with
the patterns in Figure 1b and online Appendix Figure 1c concerning the control-group earnings
distribution location of women in diﬀerent subgroups, suggest that the earnings history subgroups
do a respectable job of reflecting the pattern of eﬀects that basic labor supply theory predicts.
    Finally, the results using presence of AFDC income in the 7th quarter before random assignment
show an $83 mean impact for those with AFDC income in the seventh quarter prior to random
assignment, compared to a small negative eﬀect (-$9) for those with no AFDC income in that
quarter. However, neither mean impact is significantly diﬀerent from zero. More tellingly, the
F -statistic p-value of 0.33 shows that we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equal mean impacts

  11
     A very small subset of the sample has missing values for these demographic variables. If we include these
observations and form separate mean impacts for the “missing data” subgroups, we still fail to reject that the means
are equal across any of these sets of subgroups. Note that in constructing the simulated earnings variables used
below, we treat women with missing data as a separate category, so that we use the same sample of women for all
comparisons.



                                                        11
for these two subgroups. In light of online Appendix Figure 1d, this pattern is not surprising.
    All in all, these estimates are notable for their consistency with labor supply predictions, given
the subgroup-specific patterns of women’s locations across the post-RA earnings distribution ex-
plored above. Subgroups that have a high likelihood of having zero post-RA earnings under control
group assignment tend to have larger positive mean earnings impacts. Subgroups whose members
are concentrated toward the top of the control group earnings distribution are the ones most likely
to have negative mean earnings impacts. And subgroup definitions that are not successful in pin-
pointing women’s locations in the post-RA control group earnings distribution tend not to have
significant diﬀerences in, or uniform patterns of, mean earnings impacts.

3.2     Quantile treatment eﬀects by subgroup
    In this section we provide another exploration of the adequacy of the mean-impacts-only esti-
mator. In particular, we present quantile treatment eﬀects by subgroups (since they are estimated
within subgroup, they are termed “conditional” QTE). We adopt the usual potential outcomes
model notation. Let di = 1 if observation i is assigned to the Jobs First rules facing the treatment
group and 0 if i is assigned to the AFDC rules facing the control group. To account for multiple
quarters of data per individual, we let Yit (d) be the value of Y that i would have in quarter t if
i were assigned to program d (Y in our setting is earnings). The treatment eﬀect for person i
in period t is equal to the diﬀerence between her period-t outcome when treated and untreated:
δit ≡ Yit (1) − Yit (0). We calculate sample quantiles, within program assignment d, using the pooled
sample of observed earnings values, {Yit (d)}. Let Fd (y) be the population earnings CDF for women
when they are assigned to program group d. The q th -quantile of Fd is the smallest value y such that
Fd (y) ≥ q. Then the q th QTE is the simple diﬀerence between the q-quantiles of the treatment and
control distributions: ∆q = yq1 − yq0 . Finally, we can estimate subgroup-specific QTE (conditional
QTE) using the cross-program diﬀerences in the sample q-quantiles within the sample of women
who belong to the subgroup in question. In the figures below, we plot the QTE estimates at 99
                         ˆ 1, ∆
centiles, i.e., we plot (∆    ˆ 2, . . . , ∆
                                           ˆ 99 ).12

    We present QTE within education group categories in Figure 1c (bottom left). These are
estimated analogously to the full sample QTE, but each on a sample that is restricted to one of

  12
     Here, the QTE are related to linear quantile regression (e.g., Koenker & Bassett (1978))–the unconditional full
sample QTE may also be obtained by running a quantile regression of earnings on a treatment dummy. Note that
the QTE are not the same as the distribution of treatment eﬀects (DOTE). The DOTE are unidentified without
strong assumptions such as constant treatment eﬀects or rank-invariance, involves features of the joint distribution
of potential outcomes. See Abadie, Angrist & Imbens (2002) for a discussion of the usefulness of the QTE despite
this, and for more on QTE, see Heckman et al. (1997) or Djebbari & Smith (2008).


                                                        12
the various education groups. We then plot these on the same X-axis. The solid line represents
estimated conditional QTE for high school graduates, while the dashed line is for high school
dropouts. For high school graduates, the QTE are zero through quantile 43, because quarterly
earnings are 0 for 43% of person-quarters in the high school graduate treatment (Jobs First) group
and for 49% of the control group (i.e., the treatment leads to a positive extensive margin labor
supply response). For quantiles 44–74, Jobs First-group earnings for high school graduates are
greater than control group earnings, yielding positive QTE estimates. From quantiles 78–98, Jobs
First group earnings are lower than control group earnings, yielding negative QTE estimates.13
The QTE plot for high school dropouts diﬀers a bit, in that it exhibits larger mass points at zero
earnings for both the treatment and control groups and has a smaller range with negative eﬀects
at the top of the distribution. Note that some part of this diﬀerence is driven by the fact that we
have plotted the graphs with a common X-axis of centiles, but the values of the q th centiles are not
equal across groups; the 75th percentile of earnings for high school dropouts in the control group
is $600 while the 75th percentile of earnings for high school graduates is $2100.
      For both groups, the heterogeneity in Jobs First’s impact across the earnings distribution is
unmistakable. The pattern of estimated QTE for the high school graduate subgroup mirrors the
pattern for the full sample, which we described above and reported in Figure 3 of Bitler et al.
(2006): the QTE are zero at the bottom of the distribution, rise in the middle, and then fall in
the upper part of the distribution. These results match the labor supply predictions we discussed
above. For high school dropouts, it seems plausible that the reason we do not see a clear negative
eﬀect at the top of the distribution is that relatively few dropouts would have high enough earnings
when assigned to AFDC that the Jobs First program would cause them to reduce their earnings. It
is very important to note that each education subgroup’s QTE profile shows substantial variation
in QTE across quantiles. This finding hints strongly that no mean impacts only model is likely to
be adequate to explain the pattern of QTE we observe in the overall sample of women.
      In Figure 1d, we plot the within-group QTE among earnings history subgroups (earnings 7
quarters prior to RA). These figures show substantial within- and across-group heterogeneity in
estimated QTE. The dotted line concerns women with no earnings 7 quarters prior to RA and for
these women, the estimated QTE are zero for more than the half of the earnings distribution, have
large positive eﬀects higher in the earnings distribution, and then return to smaller positive or zero
values at the very top of the distribution. A reasonable interpretation is that these women would

      To avoid clutter, we omit confidence intervals from the conditional QTE plots.


                                                          13
have lower earnings when assigned to AFDC, so that Jobs First is likely to cause them to increase
earnings along the extensive and intensive labor supply margins.
         The solid line shows estimated QTE for women with high earnings 7 quarters prior to RA. These
estimated QTE are zero only for the first 30 percentiles of the distribution and are negative for
the rest of the distribution. In general, these women would likely have had relatively high earnings
even under assignment to the control group: Table 1 shows that average quarterly earnings are
$2,524 for members of this subgroup when they are assigned to the control group—nearly twice
the level for those with positive but low earnings in the seventh quarter before random assignment,
and more than three times the level for those with no earnings in that quarter. Thus, these women
are relatively more likely to be located in the part of the control group earnings distribution for
which Jobs First will likely cause earnings reductions due to entry and income eﬀects.14

4         The Mean-Impacts-Only Model and Simulated Earnings QTE
         Thus far, we have established the heterogeneity revealed by the QTE and its consistency with
labor supply predictions and shown that only non-standard variables such as earnings history are
likely to explain the results. Here we develop a method to assess the adequacy of the mean-
impacts-only model in explaining the QTE. To do so, we construct an estimate of the earnings
distribution that would prevail if Jobs First (i) had heterogeneous mean impacts across subgroups,
but (ii) had the same eﬀect on each woman within a given subgroup. A bit of notation will help us
be more precise. Let δ gt be the population mean impact for subgroup g in period t (t can be either a
particular quarter or the whole time period).15 Let Yigt (d) be woman i’s period-t earnings when she
is assigned to program group d, given that she is a member of subgroup g. As above, this woman’s
actual earnings level when she is assigned to the treatment group is thus Yigt (1) = Yit (1). We define
her simulated earnings level when assigned to the treatment group, or “simulated earnings under
treatment” to be Yigt
                   ∗ (1) = Y (0) + δ gt . If the mean-impacts-only model is correct, then for each
                            igt

i, t, and g, simulated earnings must equal actual earnings: Yigt
                                                              ∗ (1) = Y (1). This is precisely the
                                                                       it

null hypothesis we wish to test.

    14
     We find qualitatively similar results when we define subgroups based on the share of positive-earnings quarters
over the seven quarters preceding random assignment, shown in online Appendix Figure 2c. On the other hand, QTE
based on welfare-use history are more similar across subgroups (see online Appendix Figure 2d), perhaps reflecting the
fact that the welfare-use subgroup definition does less well in separating women across diﬀerent parts of the AFDC
earnings distribution than do the two earnings history subgroup definitions (see figures discussed in section 2.3).
  15
     While in our setting we estimate δ separately for each subgroup (e.g., high education), in many quasi-experimental
settings subgroup mean impacts are obtained by pooling subgroups and interacting the key treatment variable with
indicators for subgroups. The ideas here carry over to that alternative specification.



                                                          14
   We construct an estimate of the simulated earnings distribution implied by the mean-impacts-
only model as follows:

  1. Calculate the sample mean impact, δ�gt , for each subgroup g and period t.

  2. For each woman actually assigned to the control group, calculate an estimate of her simulated
     earnings in period t, given that she is a member of group g, as Y�igt          �gt .
                                                                        ∗ = Y (0) + δ
                                                                             it


  3. The estimated simulated earnings distribution under treatment is then given by F̂1∗ (y) ≡
         �         �∗
     n−1
      0    i,g,t 1[Yigt ≤ y], the empirical distribution of simulated earnings.


   Under the null hypothesis that the mean-impacts-only model is correct, this estimated simulated
earnings distribution will converge to the true simulated earnings distribution. This convergence is
a consequence of the Glivenko-Cantelli Theorem, as extended to deal with estimated parameters
(see, e.g., van der Vaart (1998)).
   We use our empirical simulated earnings distribution to evaluate the performance of the mean-
impacts-only model. In so doing, it will be more convenient to work with quantiles, rather than
distribution functions, since we have a clear understanding of the predictions labor supply theory
makes for the quantiles of the earnings distribution. We thus calculate the sample quantiles of
the estimated simulated earnings distribution F̂1∗ , or “sample simulated quantiles” for short; we
call these y�q1
             ∗ . Our main measure is then the “simulated QTE under treatment” defined as the


diﬀerence between the sample simulated quantiles and the sample actual quantiles for women in
                   ˆ ∗ ≡ y�∗ − y�q0 . If the mean-impacts-only model captures Jobs First’s actual
the control group: ∆ q     q1
                                                                                  ˆ ∗ }99 , should
eﬀects on the earnings distribution, then the graph of the set of simulated QTE, {∆ q q=1
                                                              ˆ q }99 . Note that we use the control
look almost identical to the graph of the actual sample QTE, {∆    q=1

group’s sample earnings quantiles in constructing both the simulated and actual QTE. Thus any
diﬀerences across the QTE reflect diﬀerences in the estimated quantiles of the true treatment group
and simulated earnings distribution under treatment.
   We begin in Figure 2a, where we plot the simulated QTE generated by the educational at-
tainment subgroups alongside the actual QTE. In this figure, we construct our estimate of the
simulated QTE by assuming that Jobs First’s mean impacts are constant across all 7 quarters
post-random assignment within each education subgroup (δ�gt = δ�g ); thus it is labeled “Education:
Time invariant.” We use the two estimated mean impacts for those with at least a high school
degree or no high school degree reported in Table 1, plus the estimated mean impact for a third


                                                15
subgroup of women whose educational attainment level is missing. The figure’s dashed line presents
the simulated QTE, while the solid line presents the actual QTE.16 The simulated QTE shown in
Figure 2a do a very poor job of replicating the actual QTE. They do not exhibit the substantial
range of treatment eﬀects, and their pattern bears no resemblance to the theoretical labor supply
predictions. For example, there is essentially no range of negative QTE at the top of the distribu-
tion. We found qualitatively similar results for subgroups based on the age of youngest child and
marital status; we omit these results for brevity.
    One candidate explanation for the poor performance of the simulated QTE in Figure 2a is
that they were constructed under the assumption that subgroup treatment eﬀects are constant
across time. If mean impacts vary not only across education subgroups, but also across time
within subgroups, then the simulated QTE in Figure 2a will have been based on a mis-specified
model. We therefore consider a second version of the mean-impacts-only model, which allows mean
impacts to vary across both quarter and education subgroup (labeled “Education: Time varying”
in Figure 2b). In this more flexible model, which we call the time-varying mean-impacts-only
model, we have 21 estimated mean impacts (three education subgroups for each of seven quarters).
Figure 2b shows that results for the time-varying mean impacts only model are hardly better than
those for the time-constant one. In Figures 2c and 2d we plot simulated QTE from the time-varying
mean-impacts-only model implemented using subgroups based on earnings history (defined using
earnings seven quarters prior to random assignment) and welfare history. Simulated QTE based
on these subgroup definitions also do poorly in replicating the actual sample QTE.
    One striking diﬀerence between the actual and simulated QTE involves the mass point at zero
earnings. The percentage of person-quarters with zero earnings is 55 percent in the control group
and 48 percent in the (actual) treatment group. As a result, sample actual QTE equal zero for all
q ≤ 48. The simulated QTE do not have this feature. The reason why is simple. Estimated mean
impacts are nonzero for all subgroups (this is true regardless of whether we use the time-constant or
time-varying mean impacts). When we construct “simulated earnings under treatment” for the 55
percent of quarterly control group observations that have zero earnings, we therefore add something
nonzero to zero. The result is necessarily nonzero, so that the simulated earnings distribution under
treatment has no mass at zero. This key problem with focusing only on mean impacts when both

   16
      The full sample QTE included here are directly comparable to Figure 3 in Bitler et al. (2006). The sole diﬀerence
is that there we adjusted for observables using inverse propensity score weighting but we do not do so here; this
adjustment does not substantively aﬀect the results.




                                                          16
the treatment and control groups have mass points is not new (e.g., Heckman et al. (1997)) and
leads to interest in evaluating impacts on the extensive margin. It suggests that the mean impacts
only model must be modified to allow for mass points at zero if it is to reproduce the Jobs First
earnings distribution.
   To account for the mass points at zero, we introduce a third version of the mean-impacts-only
model. In this version of the model, we calculate simulated earnings under treatment diﬀerently
from the first two versions. First, define δ gt+ as the treatment-control diﬀerence in mean earnings
conditional on positive earnings within subgroup g and quarter t. That is, δ gt+ ≡ E[Yigt (1) −
Yigt (0)|Yigt (1) > 0 and Yigt (0) > 0]. Second, let p0gt be the probability that a subgroup-g woman
would have zero earnings in quarter t when assigned to the control group, and define p1gt analogously
for treatment group assignment. Using this, we calculate estimated simulated earnings under
treatment as follows:

  1. Calculate δ�gt+ , the sample diﬀerence in mean earnings within subgroup g and quarter t,
     conditional on having positive earnings. Also calculate p�0gt and p�1gt , the sample shares of
     observations with zero earnings in quarter t among subgroup-g women actually assigned to
     the control group and the treatment group, respectively.

  2. For each woman actually assigned to the control group, set simulated earnings in quarter t
     equal to zero if her actual earnings level is zero. If her actual earnings level is nonzero, set
     simulated earnings equal to the sum of her actual earnings and the sample diﬀerence in mean
     earnings conditional on having positive earnings. Thus, simulated earnings under treatment
                    ∗ (1) = (1 − Z )[Y (0) + δ
     are given by Yigt            it  it
                                             �gt+ ], where Zit = 1[Yit (0) = 0].

  3. Next, reweight each woman in the control group to ensure that the share of zero earners is
     the same for the treatment group and the simulated earnings distribution under treatment
     for those in the control group. This weight for control group woman i (who is in subgroup g)
                                        p0gt + (1 − Zit ) · (1 − p�1gt )/(1 − p�0gt ).
     in quarter t is wit ≡ Zit · p�1gt /�
                                                                                         �
  4. The estimated simulated earnings distribution is then F̂1∗ (y) ≡ n−1
                                                                       0                 i,g,t wit   · 1[Y�igt
                                                                                                            ∗ ≤ y].



   By construction, the share p�1gt of subgroup-g, quarter-t observations in the control group in
this third mean-impacts-only model will have simulated earnings equal to zero, as there are p�0gt
such women, each with a weight of p�1gt /�
                                         p0gt . Consequently, the overall share of zero-earnings
observations will be the same in the actual and simulated treatment group earnings distributions.

                                                       17
Thus, our third mean impacts only model eﬀectively removes the share of zeros as a reason for the
simulated earnings distribution to fail to mimic the actual treatment group’s earnings distribution.
If this “participation-adjusted” mean-impacts-only model is correct, then, the conditional actual
and simulated earnings distributions must be the same, where the conditioning is on being in the
set of person-quarters with positive earnings. We return to this point below when we discuss formal
testing of our third model. For the moment, we observe that when the participation-adjusted mean-
impacts-only model is correct (under the null), the actual and simulated QTE must be the same
up to sampling variation.
   We report actual QTE and simulated QTE based on the participation-adjusted mean-impacts-
only model in Figure 3. As in previous graphs, we plot the actual QTE using a solid line and
the simulated QTE using a dashed line. Figure 3a plots simulated QTE for subgroups defined
by education; Figure 3b plots simulated QTE for subgroups defined using earnings in the seventh
quarter before random assignment; Figure 3c plots simulated QTE for subgroups defined using the
share of pre-random assignment quarters with positive earnings; and Figure 3d plots simulated
QTE for subgroups defined using the presence of welfare income in the seventh quarter prior to
random assignment.
   Overall, these graphs show a much closer resemblance between the simulated and actual QTE
than do those presented in Figure 2. But there remain some notable diﬀerences. First, there
are negative simulated QTE at the bottom of the simulated distributions. These eﬀects occur
because some women in the control group have positive but very low earnings and are members of
subgroups with negative conditional on working mean treatment eﬀects. As a result, these women’s
simulated treatment group earnings estimates are negative, so they wind up at the very bottom of
the simulated treatment group earnings distribution. With the exception of this minor diﬀerence,
both the actual and simulated QTE equal zero for nearly all of the first 48 quantiles in all panels
of Figure 3. Of course, this result follows mechanically from the participation adjustment.
   Over quantiles 50–80 or so, the simulated QTE do a reasonably good job of replicating the
general shape of the actual QTE. However, they fail to achieve the amplitude of the actual
QTE, which suggests that the mean-impacts-only model fails to capture some important within-
subgroup/within-quarter variation. Moreover, in every case the simulated QTE fail to fully replicate
the negative QTE at the top of the earnings distribution. This result is a potentially serious mark
against even the participation-adjusted mean-impacts-only model.
   Notably, the subgroups diﬀer in their ability to capture this important result predicted by


                                                18
labor supply theory. The simulated QTE using demographic variables—education (in Figure 2a);
age of youngest child (in online Appendix Figure 3a), and marital status (in online Appendix
Figure 3b)—show little evidence of negative simulated QTE at the top of the earnings distribution.
By contrast, the simulated QTE using earnings history subgroups show more evidence of negative
simulated QTE.

5    Testing
    The results and discussion above has focused on point estimates and does not address the issue
of whether we can statistically reject the null hypothesis that the participation-adjusted mean-
impacts-only model is correct. Perhaps the simulated QTE in Figure 3 diﬀer from the actual ones
only because of sampling variation. We thus turn to formal tests of the participation-adjusted
mean-impacts-only model.17
    We test the null hypothesis that for those with positive earnings, within each subgroup g and
time period t, eﬀects are constant across the distribution. This is exactly the null hypothesis
implied in the participation adjusted time varying mean-impacts only model above. There are
many tests developed in the literature for testing equality of distributions. Unfortunately, there
are two complications in applying existing tests to our setting. First, our estimate for the empirical
simulated earnings distribution depends on estimated nuisance parameters (the vector of estimated
subgroup-specific treatment-control diﬀerences in mean earnings). The second issue is that our data
cannot be treated as iid. Women are randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups, but we
include seven quarterly earnings observations for each woman, so there is likely to be within-person
dependence in earnings across quarters.18 In the absence of a single test statistic with appropriate
critical values that incorporates estimation of multiple nuisance parameters and non-iid data, we
instead test the null of constant eﬀects within each of our subgroups and time periods. As stated
above, we limit our testing to our most flexible model–with time varying-means and participation
adjustment–and we apply one testing approach. We make use of a result in Praestgaard (1995)
which is also suﬃcient to solve the issue of estimated parameters. He shows that the permutation-
based critical values for the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test statistic are asymptotically valid even in the
presence of estimated parameters under a condition that we have verified our simulated earnings

  17
     We do not bother testing the two mean-impacts-only models that do not account for the mass points at zero
earnings (e.g., Figure 2). As Heckman et al. (1997) have pointed out, such models cannot be correct when there are
diﬀering mass points (e.g. share with positive earnings) in the two groups. Thus, we regard these two models as
already formally rejected,
  18
     Koenker & Xiao (2002) lay out this problem and propose an approach for testing this location-scale model for
the case of iid data.


                                                       19
satisfy (available at the authors’ websites). A recent paper by Ding, Feller & Miratrix (2014) also
considers a setting very much like ours. We are applying what Ding et al. (2014) term the Fisher-
randomization test using the plug in method. We present the results of these permutation tests
carried out within each quarter and subgroup.19
    If the mean impacts model is correct, it is suﬃcient to test that the actual treatment group
earnings distribution and simulated earnings distribution (conditional on positive earnings) are the
same within each subgroup-quarter. Thus to reject the null hypothesis that all of these distributions
are the same for each subgroup-quarter within a family of subgroups (e.g., education by quarter),
it is suﬃcient that we reject the null of equal actual and simulated treatment distributions for at
least one of the subgroup-quarter combinations. Such an approach, however, runs into a multiple
testing issue; for example the education subgroups shown in Figure 3 consist of 7 time periods by 3
education groups or 21 tests. Even a test by quarter alone (for the full sample) yields 7 tests. We
resolve this by implementing a familiar procedure that controls the family wise error rate (FWER).
(The family wise error rate is the probability of making one type 1 error or falsely rejecting one
of the family of nulls.) This approach which controls the FWER is the Bonferroni correction,
which adjusts the p-value for multiple testing and is obtained by multiplying the unadjusted p-
value by the number of tests (here 7 time periods multiplied by the number of subgroups). The
Bonferroni correction for p-values has limitations, and in particular is known to be conservative
as it is the upper bound of true p-values. We also explore the results of tests which control for
the false discovery rate (FDR) (control the proportion of the rejections that are false discoveries),
producing q-values (adjusted p-values) that still guard against false rejections of the null with more
power than the FWER. (See Anderson (2008) for an application that compares the results of tests
adjusting for multiplicity via approaches controlling both the FDR and FWER.)
    We take the following approach to the testing within each subgroup and time period. We follow
Praestgaard’s permutation method to generate critical values for the KS test via permutations of
the data within each subgroup and time period. Recall that the KS statistic is given by: KS =
sup |F� 1 − F�0 |. For our permutation test, for each subgroup-time period, we start by calculating
the real data estimate of the KS statistic for comparing the distributions of our true treatment

  19
     Chernozhukov & Fernandez-Val (2005) also prove the validity of a subsampling-based test for distributional
equality and Linton, Maasoumi & Whang (2005) have a framework for stochastic dominance tests that allows for
estimated parameters. We have also implemented tests of constant eﬀects within subgroups and time periods using
the approach of Chernozhukov & Fernandez-Val (2005) and Linton et al. (2005), adjusting for the multiple testing as
above. Either of these alternative approaches leads to similar conclusions to we show here.



                                                        20
group earnings and our estimate of the simulated treatment group earnings. (Recall also that
our estimate of the simulated treatment group earnings are created by adding the subgroup-time
specific mean treatment eﬀect to the control group value of earnings for that subgroup and time
period.) This real data KS statistic is the test statistic that will be used to decide if the two
distributions diﬀer in a statistically significant fashion. We then simulate the critical values for the
KS statistic as follows. First, we pool the treatment and control groups. Then, we create a random
treatment indicator that separates this pooled distribution into two samples, the first having the
same number of observations as the true treatment group and the second having the same number
of observations as the simulated treatment group (the control group). Using this random treatment
indicator, we create the simulated treatment group earnings as above by adding the mean treatment
eﬀect for the subgroup and time period to the “random” control group. Because this treatment
indicator is random, the KS statistic for this permutation should be zero up to sampling noise.
Third, we calculate the permuted value of the KS statistic 2999 times. Finally, the true data KS
value is compared to the simulated distribution of KS statistics as follows. We sort the resulting
KS statistics. The unadjusted p-value for the null for this subgroup and period is calculated as the
rank of the true data KS value in the overall distribution divided by 3000 (2999 bootstrap replicates
plus the actual data). If the true data value is the largest (rank 1), then we can only bound the
p-value as < 1/3000 = 0.0033.20
    Next, we account for multiple testing within each subgroup. We compare the Bonferroni-
adjusted p-value for a family of subgroup-quarter tests to the desired significance level. For example,
when we use education subgroupings, there are 7 time periods by 3 education groups = 21 test
statistics. With 21 test statistics, the Bonferroni-adjusted p-value is obtained by multiplying the
unadjusted p-value by 21. If any of the 21 education-quarter subgroupings has an adjusted p-value
below the desired significant level (e.g., 0.05), then we reject the null hypothesis that the simulated
distribution of treated earnings equals the actual one.
    Table 2 reports the results of these tests. Each row contains the results from tests for a particular
set or family of subgroups. The first column reports the number of test statistics involved (7 for
the overall pooled results labeled “Full sample”, 21 for the education-quarters). Column 2 reports
the smallest unadjusted p-value for the family of tests. Without the necessary adjustment for the
multiplicity of tests, one would conclude that the constant treatment eﬀect within subgroup models

  20
     Note that 2999 resamples permits the real data value to be anywhere from the smallest to the largest in the
simulated distribution of the test statistic under the null in increments of 1/3000.



                                                      21
fail miserably. Columns 3–5 report the results after adjusting for the multiplicity of tests within
the families of subgroups using the Bonferroni correction. Column 3 reports the number of the
permutation tests for each subgrouping that reject the null of equality of the within subgroup-
quarter distributions after a Bonferroni adjustment at the 10% level while Column 4 reports the
number of adjusted tests that reject at the 5% level. Column 5 reports the minimum Bonferroni
adjusted p-value (the level at which the test of equality can be rejected for the test with the lowest
p-value).
   Starting with the first row which tests the quarter-only (or full sample) subgrouping, we see
that 4 of 7 of the full sample permutation tests reject at the 5% level after Bonferroni adjustment,
while 5 of 7 reject at the 10% level. This result indicates that when we do not use any socioe-
conomic information to form simulated earnings, equality of the actual earnings distribution and
the simulated distribution of treated earnings is strongly rejected. The next rows present tests
for demographic groups; education, age of youngest child, and marital status; each of which have
21 tests within the “family”. For education, one of twenty-one tests rejects at the 5% level after
adjustment while 3 of the tests reject at the 10% level. For the 21 subgroup-quarter tests for age
of youngest child and marital status, 2 of the 21 tests reject at the 5% level after adjustment. This
suggests that we can easily reject the null of the mean-impacts only model for the demographic
variables, even after allowing for time-varying means and the participation adjustment. (Recall
that we reject the null of constant eﬀects within subgroup-quarter if we reject even 1 of the tests
for that subgroup-quarter family).
   Next consider the results when we create subgroups based on a woman’s earnings in the 7th
quarter before random assignment. Because we use three such subgroups—zero, low, and high
earnings—we again have 21 total groups (3 earnings subgroups by 7 quarters). Of the 21 subgroup-
quarters tests, 1 rejects the null at the 5% level and 2 reject at the 10% level, after adjustment.
This means we reject the suﬃciency of our subgrouping based on earnings in the 7th quarter before
random assignment: this subgrouping yields a simulated distribution of treated earnings that diﬀers
significantly from the actual distribution. When we instead use groups based on the number of
quarters with any earnings before random assignment, we also reject once at the 5% level after
adjustment. Finally, groups based on welfare history reject at the 5% level 3 (of 14) times using
the adjusted permutation test.
   Overall, Table 2 shows that we can resoundingly reject the null of equality of distributions
within each demographic and earnings/welfare history by time subgroups, even using the relatively


                                                 22
conservative Bonferroni adjustment for our permutation test approach. In the remainder of the
table we report the results of tests for interactions of the various subgroups (e.g., education group
by number of quarters of positive earnings pre-RA by quarter after random assignment). Here,
the number of groups is much larger, and the Bonferroni correction potentially more restrictive.
For example, for the interaction of education with age of youngest child, there are 49 tests. Some
of the subgroupings yield as many as 63 tests. Yet despite this, of the 15 “families” of three-way
groupings in the table, we reject the null for 6 at the 5% level and 9 at the 10% level, using the
adjusted p-values from the permutation tests. Further, as suggested by Figures 2 and 3, the bulk
of the subgroupings where we fail to reject include the pre-random assignment earnings measures.
Fully 5 of the 6 subgroupings for which we fail to reject at the 10% level, and 5 of 9 at the 5% level
include the earnings history measures among the 3-way interactions.
    We also discuss here but for brevity do not show in the table the results of alternative adjust-
ments to the tests which control the FDR (so-called q-values). These results which control the
FDR have higher power but oﬀerless strict control of type 1 errors. Thus, they imply we reject the
null for 10 of the 15 families of three way groupings at the 10% level.
    Given how conservative the Bonferroni correction can be, the evidence we have shown in Table
2 resoundingly rejects the constant mean impacts within subgroup model in this setting, even with
participation adjustment and time-varying mean impacts. And note that when we stay within
the realm of 2-way interactions between subgroup and time which is the level of much testing of
heterogeneity in applied work, we always reject the constant treatment eﬀects within subgroup
model.

6    Conclusion
    A common approach to explore treatment eﬀect heterogeneity is to estimate mean impacts by
subgroups (e.g., Angrist (2004)). These subgroup-mean impacts may come from estimating the
mean impact for each subsample of interest (e.g., a fully stratified model) or in a pooled model
by adding interactions of the treatment with subgroup indicators (or other parametric models).
Another approach is to examine heterogeneity using quantile treatment eﬀects (QTE), which we
previously used to examine the eﬀects of welfare reform on earnings (Bitler et al. (2006)). In that
setting, we found the QTE revealed striking heterogeneity consistent with labor supply theory.
Here we return to that data and setting and explore whether estimating mean impacts by subgroup
reveals the observed heterogeneity found in the QTE. The Jobs First experiment and data that we
use here are well suited to examine this issue due to the randomization, the substantial changes to

                                                 23
labor supply incentives introduced by the treatment, and the access provided to extensive data on
pre-random assignment earnings and program participation.
   We construct an estimate of the “simulated earnings distribution under treatment” which is
the earnings distribution for the control group that would result under the assumption that all
heterogeneity is contained in diﬀerential mean impacts across subgroups. Under the null of the
constant mean impacts within subgroup model, the treatment group distribution and the simu-
lated earnings distribution under treatment are the same. We then evaluate the performance of
the mean-impacts-only model by comparing earnings QTE estimated using the actual treatment
and control earnings distribution to the “simulated QTE” estimated using the simulated earnings
under treatment and the actual control group distribution. The graphical comparison of the actual
and simulated QTE shows that the mean impact only model does a poor job in capturing the
heterogeneity evident using QTE. This is true when we pool the time periods and estimate one
mean eﬀect per subgroup for the entire 21 months of data; when we allow the mean eﬀects to vary
across time; or even we allow the heterogeneity to be such that the share of non-participants in the
labor market is the same within the treatment and control groups. This finding is confirmed by
statistical tests that reject the null hypothesis of equality between the actual treatment earnings
and the earnings under treatment simulated under the mean-impacts-only models.
   Importantly we find that not all subgroupings fare equally well or poorly in generating simulated
earnings under treatment under the mean impacts only model. We find that groups defined based
on earnings history (pre-treatment) do considerably better than groups based on demographics or
welfare history. Taken together, these results suggest that even estimating subgroup-specific mean
eﬀects for a wide range of subgroups may not reveal all important treatment eﬀect heterogeneity.
This is merely one example of such treatment eﬀect heterogeneity, but should raise concerns about
relying on mean impact analysis when heterogeneity is of interest.

group for those with nonzero earnings. For those with zero earnings, the graph shows the ratio of
the share of women with zero earnings in each subgroup over the total share in the subgroup. A
value of 1 means the share within the percentile is the same as the overall share. Label reports
mean shares in the control group. Values reported for centiles 45–98 of the control group earnings
distribution. As earnings are zero for all centiles below 45, there is no variation in the group shares
within these centiles, so we omit them. Bottom panel show conditional QTE within each education
subgroup (left graph) or earnings during the 7th quarter before random assignment (right graph).

Notes: In each figure, the solid line plots the actual QTE, and the dashed line plots the simulated
QTE. In all figures, we allow for either time invariant or time varying program eﬀects on mean
earnings within subgroup. -In the top graphs, subgroups are based on education. In the bottom
graphs, subgroups are based on earnings 7 quarters before RA (left) or welfare history before
random assignment (right). In the left top figure, simulated earnings are calculated under the
constraint that subgroup-specific treatment eﬀects are constant across quarter. In the right top
and bottom two figures, we allow the subgroup-specific treatment eﬀects to vary across quarters.

This table reports treatment-control diﬀerences in quarterly earnings in the full sample and various subgroups during the first 7
quarters after random assignment for the sample of 4803 women. Column 1 shows the mean diﬀerence in earnings by subgroup
and column 2 the 95 percent CI for this mean diﬀerence. For the subgroup member in each row, Columns 3—5 contain the
control group mean and the number of observations in the treatment and control groups (top panel) or share of observations
in that subgroup member for the treatment and control groups (other panels). At the bottom of each panel, we report the
F-statistic and p-value for the test that the mean treatment eﬀects are the same across the subgroups within the panel. The
reported F-statistics exclude from the test the coeﬃcients on variables for a small number of observations missing some of the
demographic characteristics (not reported here). The F-statistics [p-values] for tests including the missing data categories are
0.84 [0.4320] for education, 1.74 [0.1755] for age of youngest child being less than 5, 1.99 [0.1370] for the number of children in

Notes: Table reports the result of tests of the nulls that simulated and actual CDFs are equal
for those with positive earnings within each subgroup and quarter for diﬀerent set of subgroups.
p-values adjusted using the Bonferroni adjustment, and represent the upper bound of the p-value.
Thus the adjusted p-values for the full sample subgroup where seven tests are carried out (1 for
each quarter) are the unadjusted p-values times 7. Test results reported in columns 2–5. are the
results of permutation tests of the KS statistic, following Praestgaard (1995). Each family of tests
for a number of mutually exclusive subgroups tests the null that the CDF for earnings for workers
in the treatment group is equal to the distribution obtained from adding time varying conditional
mean earnings for those working in the control group to the control group values, within each period
and subgroup. The first column reports the number of tests for each family of subgroups. The
second colulmn reports the smallest unadjusted p-value for the family of tests. The third and fourth
columns report the number of tests where the Bonferroni adjusted p-value for the permutation KS
test rejects at the 10% level and 5% level, respectively. The fifth column reports the smallest of the
Bonferroni adjusted p-values for this family of tests. The values in column 5 have ∗∗∗ if the smallest
unadjusted p-value allows rejection at the 1 percent level, ∗∗ if the smallest adjusted p-value allows
rejection at the 5 percent level, and ∗ if the smallest adjusted p-value allows rejection at the 10
percent level. The values in column 5 have ∗∗∗ if the smallest adjusted p-value allows rejection at
the 1 percent level, ∗∗ if the smallest adjusted p-value allows rejection at the 5 percent level, and ∗
if the smallest adjusted p-value allows rejection at the 10 percent level. For more details, see text.

Notes: Figures for subgroups defined by age of youngest child (top left), marital status (top right),
number of quarters with earnings pre-RA (bottom left), and welfare use 7 quarters pre-RA (bottom
right). Each group shows the relative share of women in each subgroup within various centiles of
the control group distribution compared to the overall population share of women in each subgroup.
Graph shows ratio of share of women in each subgroup with earnings ≥ qth quantile but less than
the q + 1st quantile over the share of women in the control group for those with nonzero earnings.
For those with zero earnings, the graph shows the ratio of the share of women with zero earnings
in each subgroup over the total share in the subgroup. A value of 1 means the share within the
percentile is the same as the overall share. Label reports mean shares in the control group. Values
reported for centiles 45–98 of the control group earnings distribution. As earnings are zero for all
centiles below 45, there is no variation in the group shares within these centiles, so we omit them.

Notes: In each figure, the solid line plots the actual QTE and the dashed line plots the simulated
QTE. In all figures, we allow for time-varying program eﬀects on conditional mean earnings within

the mean treatment-control diﬀerence in earnings the same. In the left graph, subgroups are based
on age of the youngest child. In the right graph, subgroups are based on marital status.
