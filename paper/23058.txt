                                           ABSTRACT

Ad blockers allow Internet users to obtain information without generating ad revenue for site
owners; and by 2016 they were used by roughly a quarter of site visitors. Given the ad-supported
nature of much of the web, ad blocking poses a threat to site revenue and, if revenue losses
undermine investment, a possible threat to consumers' access to appealing content. Using unique,
proprietary, and site-specific data on the share of site visitors using ad blockers at a few thousand
sites, along with Alexa traffic data, we explore the impact of ad blocker usage on site quality, as
inferred from traffic ranks, 2013-2016. We find that each additional percentage point of site
visitors using ad blockers raises (worsens) its traffic rank by about 0.6 percent over a 35 month
period, with stronger effects at initially worse-ranked sites. We provide additional evidence of
causality by showing that the relationship between traffic trends and eventual ad blocking does
not predate ad blocking. Plausible instruments for ad blocking also deliver consistent results.
Effects of ad blocking on revenue are compounded by the fact that ad blocking reduces visits,
while also generating less revenue from remaining visitors employing ad blockers. We conclude
that ad blocking poses a substantial threat to the ad-supported web.

        Copyright protection is an important theoretical determinant of incentives for creation of

new products, and recent research documents the relationship between legal intellectual property

regime and the quality and quantity of new output.1 Beyond legal rules alone, intellectual

property is in general protected by a combination of law and technology that may together allow

sellers to appropriate enough of consumers’ willingness to pay to finance the creation of new

products. The development of various digital technologies over the past few decades has

undermined sellers’ ability to appropriate consumers’ willingness to pay, raising the possibility

of a diminished supply of new information and entertainment products. For example, new

digital technologies have challenged traditional revenue models through direct piracy (e.g.

Napster), diversion of attention to aggregators rather than the underlying information sources

(e.g. Google News), and pure-play advertising platforms such as Craigslist, which divert revenue

from newspaper classified ads.2


        Despite these and related challenges, much of the commercial information on the web is

provided under ad-financed business models. While a growing number of newspaper sites have

moved behind paywalls (Chiou and Tucker, 2013), most other commercial information sources

rely on advertising. The finance of information production with ad revenue has come under

threat with the development of ad blocking technologies. Ad blockers, such as Ad block Plus,

are browser extensions that allow users to browse the web without having to see sites’ ads. As a

among others. Ad blocking is not the first technology that allows consumption without compensation to rights
holders. Digital video recorders such as TiVo allowed users to fast forward through ads, threatening their revenue
generating potential. See Wilbur (2008). In 2012 Aereo created a service distributing broadcast television online
without paying rights holders transmission fees. ABC sued and won, shuttering Aereo. See

result, many site visitors obtain information without seeing ads, clicking through to advertisers'

sites, or otherwise generating revenue for site owners. The use of ad blockers has grown sharply

in recent years. By some estimates, roughly a quarter of site visitors used ad blockers by 2016, a

magnitude of ad blocking that may produce a serious threat to site revenue and, if revenue losses

undermine investment, a possible threat to consumers' access to appealing content.3 This is the

question this paper seeks to explore.4


        The mechanism we have in mind, as in the traditional literature on the relationship

between intellectual property revenue appropriation and supply, is that reduced revenue may

undermine a site's ability to invest, which could then manifest itself as a diminished site that is

less appealing to potential visitors. Web users might then visit the degraded sites less, reducing

the sites’ traffic. While getting data on the relevant issues - site traffic and site-specific measures

of ad blocker usage - is challenging, we have put together a dataset that allows us to explore this.

Using unique, proprietary, and site-specific data on the share of site visitors using ad blockers at

a few thousand sites, matched with Alexa traffic data, we explore the impact of ad blocker usage

on site traffic between 2013 and 2016.

        Aggregate ad blocking has grown rapidly between 2013 and 2016, and during this period,

we find that sites with a high proportion of ad blocking visitors experience deterioration in their

traffic ranks, relative to sites with fewer ad blocking visitors. In our main analyses, we find that

each additional percentage point of site visitors using ad blockers raises (worsens) a site’s traffic

rank by about 0.6 percent over a 35 month period, with the effects concentrated in sites that are

initially lower ranked. We have two ways of dealing with possible concerns about unobserved

 Anderson and Gans (2011) develop a theoretical model of ad-blocking showing the possibility of a downward
spiral in which ad blocking leads websites to carry more ads, further reducing their appeal.

heterogeneity. First, in contrast to our basic result – worsening ranks at sites whose users block

ads – those same sites did not experience worsening ranks prior to when we would expect ad

blocking to directly impact content investment decisions. Second, when we employ instrumental

variable techniques to address bias arising from either measurement error or possible

endogeneity concerns, we find consistent results. Given our basic result, if 20% of a website’s

users employ an ad blocker, then between 2013 and 2016, the site’s rank worsens by about

12.5% relative to the counterfactual ranking it would have if none of its users blocked ads.

Because we find close to a one-to-one relationship between ranks and traffic, the impact on site

traffic is proportionally similar. Effects on revenue are compounded by the fact that ad blocking

reduces visits, while also generating less revenue from ad blockers among the remaining visitors.

For example, if revenue is proportional to traffic, a twenty percent ad blocking share could

reduce revenue by about 30 percent.5


        The paper proceeds in six sections after the introduction. In Section 1, we present some

basic facts about advertising as a means of financing content online, we describe ad blockers and

their growth, and we provide a simple theoretical framework for organizing our thinking about

the possible effect of ad blocking. The second section describes the data. Section 3 describes

our empirical strategy and results on the relationship between ad blocking and site ranks.

Section 4 translates the effects on ranks into effects on traffic and revenue. A concluding

discussion follows in Section 5.

I.       Background

        Ad-supported content delivered online is an important mechanism for informing

consumers and citizens in the US and elsewhere. In practice, advertising provides far more

revenue than access fees (paywalls) for such content. Take, for example, newspapers, which

perhaps are the most aggressive users of paywalls and therefore derive a greater share of revenue

from consumer payments than do sites in other categories. Notable examples include the Wall

Street Journal and the Financial Times, whose sites are available only to subscribers. Still, the

share of digital revenue from users as opposed to advertisers remains small for newspapers

generally. In 2013 the Newspaper Association of America reported digital ad revenue at US

newspapers totaling $3.49 billion, while digital subscription revenue was roughly $0.75 billion.6

In other words, even for newspaper websites, ad revenue was over four times their subscription

revenue.

        As recently as 2012, ad blockers were rarely used. Since then, their use has risen sharply.

A joint report by Adobe and PageFair followed the number of active ad blocker installations by

measuring periodic downloads of “blocklists,” lists used by ad blockers to determine what to

block. The information, in Figure 1, shows only 39 million installations worldwide in January

2012. By June 2015, there were 198 million, 45 million of which came from the US. Dividing

this number by the number of internet users in the US suggests that as many as 16% of US

internet users may use ad blockers. Analogous calculations suggest higher numbers in Europe:

25.5% in Germany, 21.1% in the UK, and 16% in Spain. Comparable statistics from a separate

data source, a ComScore panel of monitored internet users, found similar but slightly lower

percentages: 24% for Germany, 14% for Spain, 10% for the UK, and 9% for the US. However,

the ComScore data also found that users of ad blockers appear to spend more time on the

internet, leading to higher percentages for the fraction of website page views which have their

ads blocked: 28% in Germany, 16% for Spain, 13% for the UK, and 12% for the U.S. Moreover,

its use will likely grow as consumer awareness increases. A recent study found that only 41% of

respondents were aware of ad blocking, but among those who were aware, 80% used an ad

blocker.7


        There is substantial controversy surrounding ad blockers. As the Internet Advertising

Bureau (IAB) puts it, “As abetted by for-profit technology companies, ad blocking is robbery,

plain and simple – an extortionist scheme that exploits consumer disaffection and risks distorting

the economics of democratic capitalism.”8 At the same time, many industry participants

acknowledge that web advertising has become unwieldy, a problem exacerbated by the fact that

obtrusive ads and targeted ads have each been shown to be more effective, (Goldfarb and Tucker

2011a, 2011b, 2015), particularly when consumers’ privacy has unwittingly been violated.

(Goldfarb and Tucker 2011b, Tucker 2014). As a result, loading a site and its ads consumes

substantial bandwidth, which is a particular challenge for mobile users. A 2015 study by the

New York Times found that advertising and other data blocked by ad blockers on 50 news

websites’ main mobile homepages accounted for more than half of the sites’ data, more than

doubling the time it took to load.9 Moreover, “malvertisements,” or malicious ads designed to

expose vulnerable computers to viruses, have yielded over ten billion impressions in some recent

years.10


         The IAB has itself argued that “ad blocking is a crucial wakeup call to brands and all that

serve them about their abuse of consumers’ good will. Ad blockers are also exploiting a real

vulnerability: the erosion of stimulating consumer experiences online. For this, the marketing-

media ecosystem bears real responsibility. IAB research shows ad block use is caused by a

general disdain for advertising and concern about the safety of user information.”11


         The rise of ad blocking raises a number of research questions. A first possible question –

analogous to the first generation of piracy research following Napster – is simply whether the

growth of ad blocking reduces advertising revenue. At first glance this seems like estimating an

identity rather than a behavioral relationship since ad blocking disables ads and therefore

prevents the generation of ad revenue.12 But it is possible that some users of ad blocking

software would forgo visiting sites if forced to view ads. If so, then the ad blocking visitors

would not represent lost revenue. Rather, they would reflect additional, albeit unpaid, users who

would not have made site visits absent their ability to block ads.

         While revenue is of course important to advertisers and publishers, revenue is not by

itself a clear matter of concern for public policy. A more important indicator is whether, because

of reduced revenue, the quality and appeal of sites declines. Revenue and quality do not

   According to the President of Ad block Plus, the most popular ad blocker, “Before the page is rendered, ad block
plus modifies it, strips off the request to the ad service or tracking scripts and injects CSS to repair the site so it
doesn't look broken” http://www.computerworld.com/article/2487367/e-commerce/ad blockers--a-solution-or-a-
problem-.html. Hence, ad blockers prevent the request for ads – no transaction takes place - implying websites are
not paid for blocked ads.

necessarily go hand in hand. In other contexts, most notably the recorded music industry, the

collapse of revenue has not brought about a reduction in the quantity or apparent quality of new

recorded music. Instead, falling costs have prevented revenue reduction from undermining the

production of content.13


           These nuanced considerations suggest a second research question – addressed here – of

whether ad blocking leads ad-supported websites to degrade their sites in response to declining

revenue. That is, do they reduce their expenditures on content and produce less, or lower-

quality, content? This question is inherently difficult to study, at least directly, for a few reasons.

First, we cannot observe sites’ expenditures on content. Second, while we could conceivably

measure the amount of content, measuring its quality is difficult to do directly. Some media

products, such as music and movies, are evaluated by large cadres of professional critics, and

their evaluations can be useful for assessing the quality of those products. Nothing like this

exists systematically across web sites, however.

           Instead, we infer “product quality” from the traffic at a website, an indirect method

frequently employed by industrial economics in demand estimation. It is reasoned that

consumers are attracted to a product by its various horizontal and vertical attributes that manifest

themselves for consumers in the “mean utility” of the products. The econometrician infers this

mean utility, in turn, from the products’ market shares, along with their prices. If a product’s

market share falls, then all else equal we can infer that its mean utility (i.e. quality) has fallen

relative to alternatives. Hence, if websites that experience more ad blocking eventually have

larger reductions in traffic, compared to sites experiencing less ad blocking, we can infer that

their quality has fallen.




    a. Theoretical Framework: Short vs. Long Run

        A simple model is helpful for analyzing the possible effects of ad blocking technology on

the market for ad-supported online content. Users, denoted by 𝑖, differ in the value that they

attach to the experience of visiting a site, and the demand curve shows the distribution of these

valuations across users. Prior to the advent of ad blocking, users “pay” for site content in the

sense of enduring the nuisance cost of advertising, along with the users’ perceptions of the cost

of lost privacy. Figure 2 depicts the situation. Users attaching a valuation (vi) to the site that

exceeds the nuisance cost of the ads (n) visit the site. As a result, the site attracts q0 visitors.

Ads generate revenue of p per user visit, so the site generates revenue of pq0.

        The advent of ad blocking changes the “price” of visiting the site, and the impact of ad

blocking can differ between the long and the short run. In the short run, users can choose, by

installing ad blockers, to face a lower price of visiting the site. In the longer run, it is possible

that the site quality will change, prompting a shift in the demand curve. This shift could,

potentially, more than offset the reduced nuisance cost.

        We begin with the short-run impact. Users employing ad blockers, freed of the nuisance

cost, now face a zero cost of visiting the site. This has different effects depending on whether

the user’s valuation exceeds the former nuisance cost “price” of visiting. Users whose valuations

exceeded the nuisance cost continue to visit. Users whose valuations fall short of the nuisance

cost will now visit the site, if they have installed an ad blocker. Suppose a share α of users


                                                    8
installs ad blockers and that those visitors generate no revenue for the site. For simplicity,

assume that the ad blocking visitors are drawn uniformly across the site valuation distribution.

Then the number of visitors rises from q0 to q0 + α(q1-q0). Revenue declines from pq0 to (1-

α)pq0. Thus, the short run effect of ad blocking on the market will be an increased quantity of

visitors, along with a reduction in revenue (if at least some of the ad blocking visitors were

previously visitors).

        In the longer run, which we define as the period after which the site can adjust its

investment in content and therefore site quality, content investments may decline, reducing the

resultant desirability of the site, and giving rise to the leftward shift in the demand curve. The

longer-term impact of ad blocking on site visits is now ambiguous. To see this, consider some

special cases. First, suppose that all users install ad blockers and that site quality declines, giving

rise to the left-shifted demand curve in Figure 3. Then the visit quantity will rise, in the long run,

from q0 to q2. Of course, if demand had shifted farther to the left, so that the new demand curve

hits the quantity axis at a quantity below q0, then our conclusion would have been reversed: if all

users installed ad blockers, then their long run impact would be to reduce the number of site

visitors.

        The short run and long run comparison is helpful for guiding our analysis. Absent any

quality changes, ad blocking leads to an unambiguous increase in traffic, by lowering the

nuisance cost of visiting the site. Thus we would expect non-negative (and possibly positive)

impacts of ad blocking on website traffic in the short run. Moreover, if traffic does decrease

over a longer-term horizon at sites experiencing more ad blocking, we can infer the demand

curve has shifted to the left, i.e. site appeal at those sites has declined. This is a simplified analog

of the downward circulation spiral modelled in Anderson and Gans (2011).

                                                   9
     b. The Complication of Direct Ad Sales

            The foregoing analysis embodies the assumption that site revenue is proportional to the

number of non-ad blocking page impressions, and this is a reasonable approach for

“programmatic” ads, such as those sold in ad exchanges. But some sites also have an in-house

sales team selling “direct” ads, whose contracts promise a particular number of impressions.

Direct ads typically generate five times as much revenue per impression than do programmatic

ads.14 The use of direct of ads, generally in conjunction with programmatic ads, can mute the

effect of ad blocking.

            To see this, consider the following setup. A site has total traffic of 𝑇 per period. Of

these 𝑇 impressions, the site has sold 𝐷 impressions directly at a price of 𝑝𝑑 per impression. The
                                                                           𝑝𝑑
remaining impressions (𝑇 − 𝐷) are sold at one fifth the price,                  per impression. Hence, site ad
                                                                           5

                           𝑝𝑑                                         𝑝𝑑
revenue is 𝑝𝑑 𝐷 +               (𝑇 − 𝐷), or more simply, 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒 =         (4𝐷 + 𝑇). Now introduce ad
                            5                                          5

blocking. If one more impression is blocked, so that 𝑇 falls by 1, then as long as the total

number of impressions that are not blocked exceeds the direct sales quantity 𝐷, the direct sales

revenue is unaffected. Instead, only programmatic ad revenue is affected. Overall, revenue falls
     𝑝𝑑          𝑝𝑑
by        , to        (4𝐷 + 𝑇 − 1). However, when the number unblocked impressions falls below 𝐷,
     5           5

additional blocked impressions reduce revenue by 𝑝𝑑 . Hence, the effect of ad blocking on
                                                                                                        𝑝𝑑
revenue at sites with direct ad sales has a kink: each lost impression reduces revenue by                    until
                                                                                                        5

the number of blocked impressions reaches (𝑇 − 𝐷); thereafter each lost impression reduces

revenue by 𝑝𝑑 , i.e. at five times the rate. See Figure 4.

          Note that an additional blocked impression at a site without direct ads reduces revenue by
𝑝𝑑
     , or by the same absolute amount as at a site that also uses direct ads. The proportionate

reductions differ, however. If a small share 𝜋 of impressions are blocked, so only programmatic
                                                 𝑝𝑑
ads are blocked, then revenue falls by 𝜋𝑇             . The percentage reduction in revenue is then
                                                 5

      π𝑇𝑝𝑑 /5          𝑇𝜋
                  , or 4𝐷+𝑇. For sites not selling direct ads, this simplifies to 𝑇𝜋/𝑇, so that if a share 𝜋
(pd /5)[4𝐷 + 𝑇]


of impressions is blocked, then revenue falls by 100𝜋 percent. If a site has directly-sold ads, the

percent reduction in revenue is smaller, at least initially. Eventually, however, if ad blocking

grows enough, the marginal impact of ad-blocking will become far more severe.

          Selling direct ads requires a direct sales force; only high-traffic sites have sufficient

revenue to engage in direct sales. Hence, we will look below for evidence of smaller impacts of

ad blocking on site quality for initially-larger sites.




II.        Data

          Because the possible effects of ad blocking on traffic might take time to operate, we

would ideally have data on both the number of visitors and the share using ad blockers, by time

and website, over a period beginning prior to the appearance of ad blockers. We would then ask

whether the sites experiencing larger growth in ad blocking experienced declines in quality, as

inferred from the long run tendency for consumers to visit the sites. Our actual data deviate from

the ideal setup, while still offering some promise for measuring the impact of ad blocking on site

success. We have a fairly long (three year) panel on site traffic, but we have only intermittent

data on the share of site visitors blocking ads at particular sites.

         We have site traffic data from Alexa, a company that provides website traffic ranks, for

April 2013 through June 2016. The data cover roughly 34 million websites, and the ranks are

calculated based on the last 3 months of page views.15 16 Our data on the share of site visitors

blocking ads are from PageFair (https://pagefair.com/), a company that provides software that

site owners can use to monitor the share of their site visitors using ad blockers. PageFair’s site-

specific data on ad blocking and traffic are available intermittently between 2013 and 2016, for

different time spans depending on the site. While it would be desirable to have a website-level

panel with information on traffic and the extent of ad blocking by their visitors, the available

data do not consistently cover a long enough span of time corresponding to the growth in ad

blocking, because many website owners elect to use the software on a temporary basis. The

median duration of ad blocking that we observe at our sites is 16.7 weeks (see Figure 5). The

site monitoring episodes begin in different months between 2013 and 2016, but the majority of




15
   Engineers at PageFair found that Alexa’s toolbar extension, which measures site traffic, does in fact count traffic
from users of ad blockers, even when using an aggressive ad blocker, uBlock Origin. Moreover, we ran several
(unreported) statistical tests relating Alexa’s ranks to true total traffic levels measure directly by PageFair, during
periods of overlap. We found no evidence that websites with higher (or increasing) rates of ad blocking had worse
ranks than expected from their true, overall traffic levels measured by PageFair (including traffic from users of ad
blockers). Additionally, we found the Alexa traffic rank of Bild.de, the website of a major tabloid newspaper in
Germany, worsened substantially after it banned ad blockers from visiting their site. See Figure 12. This worsening
in ranking would only be expected if users of ad blockers were counted in Alexa’s traffic data.
16
   Alexa’s traffic ranks are computed using two sources of traffic data, traffic meters installed at sites that participate
in Alexa’s monitoring and individuals’ web browsing data collected from Alexa’s toolbar extension and other
undisclosed toolbar extensions. See https://support.alexa.com/hc/en-us/articles/200449744-How-are-Alexa-s-
traffic-rankings-determined-. From Alexa’s summary pages for individual websites (e.g.
http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/cbs.com), we were able to deduce that the latter source (toolbar-measured traffic) is
used exclusively to compute ranks for 99% of the websites in our data; the text “Is this your site? Certify your
metrics” appears only for websites that have not installed Alexa’s monitoring.


                                                            12
PageFair’s monitoring episodes begin after June 2015. We match Alexa traffic data with 2,574

sites that appear in PageFair.

       Because the PageFair panel data on site-specific ad blocking cover only short time

periods, we effectively have only a cross-sectional measure of ad blocking for each site, mostly

for a period starting after mid-2015. We use the data to measure each site’s ultimate shares of ad

blocking visitors (see below). Putting some details of implementation aside for the moment, if

we have each site’s ultimate ad blocking share, along with an assumption that ad blocking was

negligible prior to 2013, then our measure of each site’s ultimate share also provides an estimate

of the site’s change in the share of its visitors using an ad blocker.

       We explore a few different specific methods for calculating the site-specific eventual

extent of ad blocking. First, we take the simple approach of dividing the total number of ad

blocking visitors at a site by their total number of visitors, over the time period monitored by

PageFair. The ratio of ad blocking visitors to total visitors is then our measure of the propensity

for the site’s visitors to use ad blockers. Define this ratio as 𝑃𝑖1 . Figure 6 shows the density of

𝑃𝑖1 . The median and mean ad blocked shares are 10.1 and 14.6 percent, respectively. The inter-

quartile range runs from 5.2 to 18.4 percent.

       Our second approach accommodates the disparate timing of different sites’ monitoring.

We begin by calculating a monthly site-specific share of visitors employing ad blockers, 𝑠𝑖𝑡 ,

where i indexes site and t indexes month. We then regress the log odds ratio of this measure on

site and time fixed effects:

                                            𝑠𝑖𝑡
                                   ln (           ) = 𝛿𝑖 + 𝜙𝑡 + 𝜖𝑖𝑡 .
                                          1 − 𝑠𝑖𝑡



                                                    13
Based on the regression, we can predict the percent of ads blocked at any arbitrary time 𝑡, even if

the website was not present in PageFair’s dataset that period. We define 𝑃𝑖2 for the final period

in the PageFair dataset Feb 2016, as:


                                                   exp(𝛿𝑖 + 𝜙𝐹𝑒𝑏,2016 )
                                 𝑃𝑖2 = 100 ∗                                   .
                                               (1 + exp(𝛿𝑖 + 𝜙𝐹𝑒𝑏,2016 ))


This is an estimate of the eventual ad block rate. As it turns out, our two measures are highly

correlated.17 𝑃𝑖1 has the virtue of greater simplicity, so it is our preferred approach to measuring

eventual ad blocking shares. We verified that all reported results that we obtain using 𝑃𝑖1 also

arise when using 𝑃𝑖2 .

         What sort of sites appear in the PageFair data? We have 2,574 sites in PageFair for

which we have an Alexa rank in June of 2013. Of these sites, the median site is ranked 210,000

in Alexa. The inter-quartile range runs between Alexa ranks of 38,000 and 1.4 million. Figure 7

shows the density of log Alexa ranks for June 2013. One notable feature of the figure is the

truncation of the distribution at e17, which corresponds to the 34 million cutoff for inclusion in

Alexa.

         What else do we know about the PageFair sites? First, we have the domain suffixes,

shown in Table 1. Most of the websites have “com” as their suffix, but a substantial number

have other suffixes, including those that indicate different country locations. For example, 158

have “uk,” 76 have “de,” and so on. Second, for most websites, we have the percent of visitors

from each country, for up to the top five countries at each site (reported by Alexa). The 25 most




17
  Most websites were observed by PageFair in later years, after ad blocking’s rise had already commenced. Only
about a tenth of the sites joined before 2014, and only a third before 2015.

                                                       14
frequently observed countries are shown in Table 2. One thousand websites with low ranks at

time of data collection (July 2016) had fewer than five countries listed. For nearly 500 of these,

no information about visitors’ geography was available.

          Summing up, we ultimately have monthly measures of Alex traffic ranks for PageFair

sites between June 2013 and April 2016. In addition, we have measures of the eventual share of

visitors blocking ads at their sites, mostly drawn from the period after early 2015. Lastly, we

have some information on the geographic location of sites (from suffixes) and origins of visitors.




III.       Empirical Strategy and Results

       1. Empirical Strategy

           We employ three separate empirical strategies for measuring the causal impact of ad

blocking on site traffic. Our first approach regresses the change in site rank, 2013-2016, on our

measure of the change in the site’s share of ad blocking users. This would support reasonable

causal inference if the variation in eventual ad blocking varied exogenously across sites. This

approach would be undermined, for example, if users made site-specific decisions about whether

to block ads; in that case, a site with falling quality might effectively invite increases in ad

blocking. But we understand ad blocking to be a user, and not a site-specific, decision. Hence

websites are exposed to different rates of ad blocking based on their user composition prior to ad

blockers’ growth, irrespective of their own traffic trends. For example, we cited evidence above

that the use of ad blockers varies across countries, and hence sites catering to different

geographic regions face disparate exposure.




                                                  15
       Despite its plausibility, our basic approach could be vulnerable to a concern about

unobserved heterogeneity, in particular that the sites with high eventual ad blocking shares were

already declining, or destined to decline, prior to the advent of ad blocking. This leads us to two

approaches for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity in site rank trends that may be correlated

with ad blocking, a longitudinal approach and instrumental variables.

       First, we verify that the relationship between rank degradation and eventual ad blocking

rates appears only when we would expect it to, and not before. Recall that use of ad blockers

was negligible prior to 2013, then started growing quickly. Since our proposed mechanism is

expected to take some time to operate, we would not expect ad blocking to have a large direct

impact on site quality during 2013. Hence we can test for pre-existing trends by comparing

regressions of rank changes after 2013 on eventual ad blocking with the relationship between

rank changes during 2013 and eventual ad blocking. This allows us to see whether the effect we

attribute to ad blocking arises prior to the time when we would expect widespread ad blocking to

have a direct impact on content investment decisions.

       While the longitudinal approach deals with possible pre-existing rank trends that are

correlated with eventual ad blocking, it leaves open the possibility of an unobserved factor that

raises ad blocking and worsens page traffic coincident with the widespread adoption of ad

blocking after 2013. We explore this with an IV strategy based on the geographic diffusion of ad

blockers.




   2. Graphical Evidence




                                                 16
        Before turning to regression-based approaches, it is instructive to simply ask how the

change in website ranks, 2013-2016, relates to the extent of their visitors’ ad blocking. Figure 8

does this with a graph of the smoothed changes in log ranks against the sites’ ad blocking visitor

shares.18 As the percent of site users blocking ads runs from 10 to 30 percent, the percent change

in site rank rises from 0 to about 25 percent. We perform somewhat more sophisticated tests

below, but Figure 8 presents the basic relationship documented in the paper, that sites with

proportionally more ad blocking users experience greater worsening in their ranks between 2013

and 2016.

        The damaging long-term effect of ad blocking on web traffic ranks apparently operates

when we would expect it to operate. But does it fail to operate when we would expect it not to,

prior to the widespread use of ad blocking? As Figure 1 shows, usage of ad blockers is low prior

to 2013, then rises quickly. Our proposed mechanism should take some time to operate, so if we

look at the relationship between the ultimate ad blocking share and rank degradation during

2013, we should either see a positive effect of ad blocking on web traffic (negative impact on

rank) – the short-run effects described in the theory section – or less of a negative effect than we

see in the long run.

         Figure 9 reproduces Figure 8, with two separate smoothed representations of the change

in log ranks (on the vertical axis). The blue line shows the change between December 2013 and

April 2016. The red dashed line shows the change between June 2013 and December 2013. The

rank worsening associated with ad blocking appears clearly for the latter period, but it does not



18
  The figure shows a smooth lowess regression of change in log rank on the site specific measure of ad blocking
between June 2013 and April 2016, for approximately the bottom 95% of ad blocking (websites with less than 40%
ad blocking). Websites with censored Alexa ranks were assume to have a rank of 34 million.


                                                      17
appear for the second half of 2013. Hence, the relationship between ad blocking and traffic that

we attribute to ad blocking does not appear to reflect pre-existing trends.




   3. Regression Evidence

   a. Direct cross-sectional evidence

       Our basic cross-sectional empirical approach is to regress the change in log rank at each

site on the site’s measure of the share of visitors blocking ads:


                              ∆ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 ) = 𝛼 + 𝛾∆𝑃𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖           (1)


In this regression 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 is the Alexa rank for site 𝑖, ∆𝑃𝑖 is the (change in the) share of visitors to

site 𝑖 blocking ads, and 𝜀𝑖 is an error term. Under the empirically reasonable assumption that ad

blocking was negligible as of 2013, the site specific measure 𝑃𝑖1 is therefore also a measure of

the change in the tendency of visitors to use ad blocking between 2013 and 2016, i.e. Δ𝑃𝑖 = 𝑃𝑖1 .

       Some sites have missing ranks in the final period, either because their traffic was too low

to be included in Alexa’s rankings, or, in some cases, because they had shut down. Hence, for

these sites, we do not observe the dependent variable in equation (1), the change in log rank.

However, because a missing rank means that the post rank exceeds 34 million, if the initial rank

is, say, 5,000, then we know that the change in log rank is at least ln(34,000,000) – ln(5,000) or,

more generally, that the change in log rank ≥ln(34,000,000) – ln(initial rank for site i). Thus, we

can include these observations, on sites with missing rank, using censored regression. In

particular, we assume normality. Then these observations enter the likelihood function reflecting

the probability that ∆ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 ) ≥ 𝑙𝑛(34,000,000) – 𝑙𝑛(𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑖). Non-



                                                  18
missing observations enter the likelihood as the probability that

∆ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 )=𝑙𝑛(𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑖) – 𝑙𝑛(𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑖).

           Table 3 reports various regression specifications for the full period (June 2013 – April

2016) on our basic measure of ∆𝑃𝑖 , i.e. 𝑃𝑖1 . Column (1), using the OLS approach that treats a site

with missing rank as one with rank of 34,000,000, shows that an increase in the share of visitors

blocking ads from 0 to 1 (100%) raises the change in log rank by about 0.54, or, said another

way, an increase (i.e. worsening) in final rank by roughly 54%. Column (2), which uses the

interval regression approach, yields a higher coefficient of roughly 0.63.

           Although we report parsimonious specifications in Table 3, one might prefer regressions

with controls out of concern that some potentially observable factor is correlated with both ad

blocking and traffic trends. For example, suppose that site suffix, a rough proxy for country, is

correlated with declining interest in the Internet. Then sites appealing to members of the

corresponding group could have declining traffic, and the same users losing interest in the web

might be more prone to use ad blockers (because they are no longer willing to suffer through ads

to get to content). To address these concerns, we also explore specifications using website suffix

dummies as a control.19 We obtain similar results. Censored regression with these controls

gives a coefficient of 0.63, with a standard error of 0.20.

           Based on the analysis in Section 2b, we might expect ad blocking to have a dampened

effect at websites that sell direct ads, which we understand to be more common at high-traffic

websites. We explore this possibility by running a censored regression of log rank change over

the period on a website’s ad blocking rate, a “high-traffic” indicator variable equaling one for



19
     We assign suffixes that appear fewer than 25 times to an “other” group.

                                                           19
websites in the top quintile of initial rank, and their interaction. The regression specification,

estimates, and standard are shown below.



   Δ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖 ) = −0.17 + 0.79 𝑃𝑖 + 0.49 ∗ 𝐼(ℎ𝑖 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑓𝑖 ) − 0.91 ∗ 𝑃𝑖 𝐼(ℎ𝑖 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑓𝑖 ) + ϵi
                  (0.05) (0.23)    (0.10)                (0.46)


The interaction coefficient is significant. Hence, we can conclude ad blocking had a

significantly smaller impact at high-traffic websites. Due to large standard error for the

interaction term, the overall impact of ad blocking on premium websites’ rankings is statistically

indistinguishable from zero. Repeating this analysis, but instead defining premium websites as

those in the top 10% of initial rank, yields similar results. These results are consistent with the

idea that high traffic sites, which are likely to derive revenue from direct sales, have so far

experienced smaller effects of ad blocking.

       Finally, because some websites have relatively few visits in the PageFair data, our ad

blocking variable P may be measured with error, biasing coefficient magnitudes towards zero.

Table 4 explores this possibility by re-running the basic OLS and censored regressions (the first

two columns of Table 3) dropping observations which compute ad block rates from few visits.

When we drop these observations, the coefficient estimates rise somewhat, from 0.55 to 0.82

with OLS and from 0.63 to 0.91 with the censored approach.




   b. Pre-existing trends

       We can supplement the evidence in Figure 9 with regression evidence that the

relationship between ad blocking share and rank worsening does not hold before we would




                                                  20
expect it to. If we have multiple periods of observations on the change in site ranks, we can

estimate the following equation:


                           ∆ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 𝛿𝑡 ∆𝑃𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡         (2)


where 𝛿𝑡 is an indicator that takes the value of 1 in the corresponding period. The coefficient 𝛾1,

corresponding to the first time interval, shows the relationship between eventual ad blocking and

the rank changes in the period before we would expect ad blocking to reduce investments in

content. We have data on a 35-month period running from June 2013 to April 2016, which we

divide into five equal-size periods of seven months, denoted t=1,…,5.

       Table 5 reports estimates of (2) using both OLS and the censored approach, in columns

(1)-(4). In all specifications 𝛾1 (the coefficient for the first time period) is negative and

significant, indicating that the sites with higher eventual ad block penetration experience

improvements in traffic during the early period. This is consistent with our short run theoretical

prediction that ad blocking would improve traffic prior to its possible effects on the site appeal.

We also see that the relationship between rank changes and eventual ad blocking changes for

periods after the first. Columns (2) and (4) show the evolution of the 𝛾𝑡 coefficients, and they go

from negative and significant in the initial period to positive and significant in subsequent

periods. Columns (1) and (3), which constrain 𝛾𝑡 to be the same in all periods beyond the first,

allow for a direct test of whether 𝛾𝑡 differs from 𝛾1 for t>1. We reject the equality in both linear

and censored specifications.

       We can take this approach one step further to explicitly eliminate the time-constant

unobserved heterogeneity. Rewrite equation (2) as


                         ∆ ln(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘𝑖𝑡 ) = 𝛼𝑡 + 𝛾𝑡 𝛿𝑡 ∆𝑃𝑖 + 𝜇𝑖 +𝜔𝑖𝑡          (3)

                                                  21
where the error 𝜀𝑖𝑡 has two explicit components: 𝜇𝑖 +𝜔𝑖𝑡 . The term 𝜇𝑖 represents time-constant

unobservable determinants of the change in ranks (including a pre-existing trend in traffic that

may be correlated with the tendency for site users to employ ad blockers), while the term 𝜔𝑖𝑡 is a

site-and-time idiosyncratic error. The inclusion of a site fixed effect in (3) purges time-constant

unobserved heterogeneity but precludes the estimation of 𝛼1 and 𝛾1, the coefficients showing the

relationship between eventual ad blocking and rank changes in the period prior to widespread

diffusion of ad blockers. Instead, we can estimate 𝛾𝑡 , for t=2,…,5, which shows how the

relationship between rank changes and eventual ad blocking evolves with the diffusion of ad

blocking. As columns (5) and (6) in Table 5 show, the 𝛾𝑡 coefficients for the periods after the

initial period are significantly larger than for the initial period. These results are consistent with

the idea that the diffusion of ad blocking reduces site traffic.




   c. Instrumental Variables Approaches
       The remaining endogeneity threat, referring to equation (3), is that the contemporaneous

error 𝜔𝑖𝑡 is itself endogenous. This would arise, for example, if site 𝑖 grew unappealing in a

period 𝑡 of widespread ad blocker adoption, prompting both (a) rank degradation and (b) user

unwillingness to view a site without an ad blocker enabled. Put another way, a third unobserved

factor could be driving both the ad block share P and the site’s log rank. We can address this

somewhat remote possibility via instrumental variables if we can find a source of variation in

eventual ad blocking that does not affect site ranks except via its effect on ad blocking.

       The geographic distribution of visitors to each site provides an appealing instrument for

the extent of ad blocking, since the fraction of internet users eventually gaining the capability of

blocking ads (i.e. installing blocking software) varies substantially across countries, and websites

                                                  22
catered to different territories prior to the growth in ad blocking. Hence, sites with different

visitor origin shares are subjected to different extents of ad blocking for reasons unrelated to site

appeal. Instrumental variables address this concern, as well as allow us a possible remedy for

measurement error in the extent of ad blocking, P.

         We pursue a two approaches to the geographic IV approach. First, we use the website

suffix, which indicates the country in which the domain name is registered. For example, a site

ending in “.uk” is registered in Great Britain. Because many suffixes are infrequently observed

(see Table 1), we assign all suffixes with less than 25 observations to the “other” category, which

leaves us with twelve suffix dummies. A regression of P on this set of site suffix dummies

yields and F-statistic of 9.85. The resulting second-stage regression is shown in column (3) of

Table 3, and the coefficient on P is similar to the magnitude when using OLS, although the

standard error is larger (s.e.=0.92).

         Our second geographic approach to instrumenting for P uses the percent of visitors from

each of up to five countries, reported by Alexa. Alexa typically reports the top five countries

generating visitors to each website, but for less popular websites they report fewer. For nearly

500 websites, none are reported.20 We include this latter set of instruments in two ways. First

we use them directly, dropping websites for which Alexa has no information on visitor origins,

and we restrict attention to the visitor countries with at least 25 observations. The first stage is

thus a regression of P on 43 variables such as the percent of site visitors from the US. The

resulting F-statistic for the first stage is 5.70, and the second stage regression is reported in

column (4) of Table 3. The coefficient of interest increases from 0.54 under OLS to 0.86, with a


20
  For 460 websites, no country data were available. For an additional 36 websites, only data on visitors from
obscure countries (countries with fewer than 25 observations) were available. Both sets, 496 in total, are considered
missing.

                                                         23
standard error of 0.61.

        Recall, however, that we are completely missing the visitor geography data for about 20

percent of sites with the lowest site traffic when the data were collected, in June 2016 – the end

of the time period. Hence, we are systematically dropping sites that substantially deteriorated.

The remaining sample hence only includes the heavily ad blocked websites which were fortunate

enough to remain viable despite the impact of ad blocking. Such selection could yield estimates

which understate the true effect. To explore this, we impute traffic origin shares for the websites

with no origin data reported, by setting the missing origin country visitor percentages equal to

the averages at websites with the same suffix.21 Using this imputation, the coefficient rises to

1.43. The resulting F-statistic is 3.02. Imputation complicates standard error calculation. We

use a bootstrapping approach, taking 1,000 draws from the observed distributions of the

percentage measures, conditional on each suffix.22 The resulting standard error is 0.49.

        In summary, the IV approaches give larger but less precise estimates of the impact of ad

blocking on traffic rankings. For the sake of conservatism we employ the smaller but more

precisely estimated OLS estimates as our baseline approach.




    d. Additional Robustness: Regression to the Mean
        Our sampling scheme involves watching ranks evolve, 2013-2016, for a sample of sites

that participate in PageFair’s monitoring program. While it’s a bit hard to generalize about the

PageFair sample, we can say that most of these are firms that opt into this program in 2015 or


21
   To remain consistent with the non-missing observations, we only include the five countries with largest imputed
visitor percentages at each website.
22
   The bootstrapping procedure repeatedly resamples websites (with replacement). For each drawn sample, we redo
the imputation of origin visitor shares for the websites in the sample missing such data, using the average visitor
shares at websites with the same suffix in the drawn sample, and then re-run the IV regression. The reported
standard errors are the standard deviations of the coefficients from these 1,000 redrawn and re-imputed samples.

                                                        24
later. That is, the sites are healthy enough nearly two years after the start of the rank monitoring

to seek to participate in the program. Given that the PageFair sites may be sites whose traffic is

systematically rising or falling relative to other sites, it is possible that their ranks would change

over time in the absence of ad blocking.

        We explore this in Table 6 by relating the change in log ranks to the initial rank. The first

two columns regress the change in log ranks on the ad blocking share (P), along with the initial

Alexa rank and, in column (2), its log. Both are statistically significant predictors of the change

in log rank. The third column includes dummies for the initial rank decile. In this flexible

specification, the coefficient of interest (on P) is 0.65, very close to the value (0.63) of the

coefficient in the analogous regression in column (2) of Table 3. We conclude that our estimate

is robust to the inclusion of controls for the initial rank.




IV.     Effects on Site Traffic and Revenue

        While the relationship between ad blocking and a website’s rank shows an important

directional impact of ad blocking on the relative appeal of a site, it is difficult to interpret the

economic impact without more information. Using cross-sectional data on site ranks along with

measures of traffic, we can translate the changes in rank we document above into changes in

traffic. The calculation is different depending on whether a site sells direct ads. We begin with

the case of a site with only programmatic ads, so that are revenue is proportional to non-ad-

blocked impressions.

        For the calculation we need a traffic quantity measure along with a rank, for a range of

websites. In addition to the historical traffic ranks employed above, Alexa also reports a current


                                                   25
measure of usage, the percent of global page views. Alexa maintains a list of the top million

sites based on the most recent month’s traffic.23 We drew, from this list, the top 2000 websites

along with every thousandth site, by rank, from 2,000 to 1,000,000. For each, we then found the

three-month rank and page view measure. The resulting three-month ranks ranged from 1 to

2,166,542. Figure 10 summarizes the relationship, and Table 7 presents a regression of log page

views on log ranks. The coefficient on log rank is −1.06 and fairly precisely estimated.

        We can now translate our estimates into effects of ad blocking on traffic, i.e. quantity.

                            𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘)                                     𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐)
Above we showed that                    ≈ 0.6327. Here, we see that                      ≈ −1.06. Hence, our
                               𝑑𝑃                                          𝑑𝑙𝑛(𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑘)


estimate of the impact of P on site traffic is the product of these two estimates, or about −0.67.

That is, an increase in ad blocking from 0 to 100 percent would decrease site visits by 67 percent.

Given the mean ad blocking share in the sample is about 12 percent, ad blocking at the average

site reduces overall traffic by about 8%.24


        If, as we have argued, ad blocking reduces the number of visitors, then the impact of ad

blocking on revenue has two parts. First, holding constant the number of visitors, ad blocking

reduces revenue because some of the visitors – those blocking ads – do not generate revenue.

Second, ad blocking appears to reduce the number of site visitors. Hence, ad blocking has a dual

impact on revenue.

        If share P of visitors block ads, then according to our estimates, the site will experience a

0.67 ∗ 𝑃 share reduction in its number of visitors. Equivalently, the number of visitors is

reduced to share equal to (1- 0.67*P) of its initial visitors count. Moreover, revenue is

24
  Any impact on content quality may be compounded by declining visibility. As site quality declines, traffic will
decline, causing their search engine rank to worsen, reducing traffic even further.

                                                        26
generated only from the share of visitors who do not block ads, i.e. share (1 – P) of visitors.

Hence, the number of visitors continuing to generate ad revenue for the site at the end of our 35

month period equals (1-P)(1- 0.67P) times the initial number of visitors. If we assume all traffic

yields the same expected ad revenue, then revenues are likewise (1-P)(1- 0.67P) times the initial

revenue. Hence, when P=0.12, the average, revenue declines by nearly 20 percent. See Figure

11.

           If a site has direct ads, then while the absolute loss in revenue will be the same as at sites

with only programmatic ads, the proportional impact on revenue will be substantially smaller as

long as the number of non-ad-blocked impression exceeds their direct sales quantity. Thereafter,

increases in ad blocking would have larger – and more than proportional – impacts on revenue.




V.          Concluding Discussion


           The Internet has delivered a variety of positive and negative shocks to appropriability of

the value of products in content industries. Just as digitization has delivered strong negative

shocks to revenue in recorded music and newspaper industries, digitization – in the form of ad

blocking - is also likely having substantial effects on the revenue for a variety of sites delivering

ad-supported content online. Digitization-induced revenue reduction does not in all

circumstances undermine investment incentives. In the cases of music, movies, and books,

falling costs of bringing products to market seem to have more than offset any negative impacts

of revenue reduction on creative incentives.25 But what we have presented here is not simply

     See, for example, Waldfogel (2012).

                                                     27
evidence of reduced revenue. Indeed, we have no direct evidence on revenue. Rather, our

results show that sites with more users who block ads experience reductions in traffic which we

presume arise from the sites’ loss of revenue. Our interpretation of the result is that revenue

reductions undermine investment which, in turn, compromises site quality, making consumers

less interested in visiting in the first place. Our interpretation is lent some credibility by industry

participants such as ArsTechnica, a popular site among technology enthusiasts. The site’s

owners report that:

           Most sites, at least sites the size of ours, are paid on a per view basis. If you have an ad blocker
           running, and you load 10 pages on the site, you consume resources from us (bandwidth being only
           one of them), but provide us with no revenue. Because we are a technology site, we have a very
           large base of ad blockers. Imagine running a restaurant where 40% of the people who came and
           ate didn't pay. In a way, that's what ad blocking is doing to us. Just like a restaurant, we have to
           pay to staff, we have to pay for resources, and we have to pay when people consume those
           resources. ... It [Ad blocking] can result in people losing their jobs, it can result in less content on
           any given site, and it definitely can affect the quality of content. 26



Our results provide quantitative evidence consistent with the concerns raised. Ad blocking

appears to have a large and meaningful impact on the quality of content created.

           In the period studied, the impact of ad blocking appears most pronounced for websites

that were not initially among the most highly ranked. This is consistent with the idea that higher-

traffic sites rely at least partly on direct ad revenue. Even if they are somewhat shielded from

effects of ad blocking, major sites do not seem immune to concern about ad blocking; and some

site publishers have taken action to reduce the impact of ad blocking. Facebook, the 3rd ranked

website globally, began implementing technology which disguised their ads in August 2016,

allowing the ads to bypass ad blockers. Public statements suggested these actions may have

raised desktop ad revenues by nearly 10%.27 As of this writing, Forbes bans visits by ad

blocking users, a move which may be designed to stem revenue losses now or in a future of more

widespread ad block usage.

         One potential solution to ad blocking by site visitors is to deny access to visitors who are

using ad blockers. A user running an ad blocker has two choices in the face of a site that forbids

ad blocking visitors. The user can disable his or her ad blocker, or the user can leave the ad

blocker running and forgo visiting the site. The relative appeal of these two decisions

presumably depends on the distinctiveness of site content.

         The experience of the Bild.de site in 2015 is instructive. According to Alexa, Bild was

the 15th-ranked site in Germany and the 436th ranked site in the world (as of July 12, 2016). Late

in 2015, Bild began to prevent ad blocker users from visiting their site (see Figure 12). Their

traffic rank quickly worsened over a three month period, rising 10 percent relative to comparable

sites, before leveling off.28 Since Alexa ranks include the last three months of traffic, this is the

pattern we would expect if some users substituted toward other sites, perhaps to those not

preventing ad blocking visitors. Similarly, Forbes.com, the 220th most popular website globally

(as of September 14, 2016), ran an analogous experiment on a subset of users, finding 58% of ad

blocker users decided to leave the site rather than disengage their ad blocker.29 These

considerations have led some publishers to contemplate coordination in their efforts to deny

access to ad blocking users. The Financial Times reports that “90 percent of Sweden’s

   Alexa defines “related sites” using the following data: keyword traffic, audience demographics, frequently of co-
citation on other webpages, co-ownership, domain name similarity, and category overlap. Comparable sites for
Bild.de were: faz.de, focus.de, spiegel.de, stern.de, taz.de, transfermarkt.de, web.de, welt.de, xing.com, and zeit.de.

publishers (about 20) plan to collectively block the ad blockers during the month of August” of

2016.30 As of September, 2016, the experiment had not materialized.


        If ad blocking undermines ad supported business models online, market failure – in the

sense of sites not being able to generate revenue to cover their costs - is not inevitable. Some

newspapers have successfully turned to paywalls so that they can generate revenue directly from

users. This solution has two problems. First, paywalls have proven somewhat difficult to

implement, except for the most distinctive products. Just as users can substitute one site that

does not block ad blockers for another that does, they can substitute a free site for a paid site.31

While not a perfect substitute for a local news site, the free cnn.com provides an attractive source

of news that probably limits the ability of other news sites to charge. Second, even if sites

succeed in instituting paywalls, doing so may introduce another market failure. Information is a

zero marginal cost product, so a positive price will prevent some socially valuable consumption

(in which consumers’ valuations exceed cost).

        Furthermore, users may turn to ad blocking because websites, when choosing the extent

and invasiveness of ads, do not internalize an externality imposed on other websites. As Ken

Fisher, the Founder of Ars Technica, explained, “the majority of people blocking ads on our site

were doing it because other sites were irritating them … It’s the worst players in the web

publishing world that’s driving this.”32


        One last point is in order. If our results are correct, they point to an interesting distinction

between behavior that is beneficial for an individual consumer as opposed to what is beneficial

for consumers as a whole. While an individual web user might enhance his or her experience by

blocking ads, when many users do so, the effects on revenue and investment can undermine the

quality of ad supported content, leaving all consumers worse off. Unless technology offers a

solution, the possibility of an ad blocker’s dilemma raises a question of whether regulation – or

even coordination among publishers – might enhance the welfare of site visitors along with the

sellers of advertising.

    Note: these estimates relate the change in sites’ log ranks to the sites’ eventual ad blocking (P).
    The specifications include five seven-month time periods. The first time period runs from June
    2013 through January 2014 and is considered the period prior to widespread ad blocking. The
    first four columns report linear regressions (cols 1 and 2) and the censored approach explained in
    the text (cols 3 and 4). The last two columns use the include site fixed effects in linear
    regressions.

Notes: The dependent variable is the change in log site rank, June 2013-April 2016, and the
independent variable is our measure of the eventual share of site visitors using an ad blocker.
Column (1) uses OLS, while column (2) uses a censored approach, since site rank is top-coded at
34 million. Columns (3)-(5) implement IV approaches discussed in the text. Bootstrapped
standard error reported in column (5). The bootstrapping procedure repeatedly resamples
websites (with replacement). For each drawn sample, we redo the imputation of origin visitor
shares for the websites in the sample missing such data, using the average visitor shares at
websites with the same suffix in the drawn sample, and then re-run the IV regression. The
reported standard errors are the standard deviations of the coefficients from these 1,000 redrawn
and re-imputed samples.

    Note: these estimates relate the change in sites’ log ranks to the sites’ eventual ad blocking (P).
    The specifications include five seven-month time periods. The first time period runs from June
    2013 through January 2014 and is considered the period prior to widespread ad blocking. The
    first four columns report linear regressions (cols 1 and 2) and the censored approach explained in
    the text (cols 3 and 4). The last two columns use the include site fixed effects in linear
    regressions.
