                                              ABSTRACT

To study the effects of the dramatic economic reforms undertaken in India in the early 1990s on inequality,
this paper examines Theil inequality as well as other inequality measures constructed using Indian
household expenditure survey data from 1988-2005. Overall inequality shows some variation over
the period, falling between 1988 and 1994, rising between 1994 and 2000, but falling again by 2005.
The evolution of inequality in the post reform period is thus non-monotonic. A similar inequality trend
is seen within most Indian states over this time period. Finally, the change in inequality across households
within states is found to be uncorrelated with the change in state-level measures of tariff and non-tariff
protection.

1.       Introduction



A central aspect of the public debate over the economic policy reforms undertaken
in India in the early 1990s 1 was the anxiety that the greater market orientation of
the economy and its openness to international trade would widen the inequality
between regions, states, urban and rural areas and households across the country. 2,3


Basic international trade theory predicts that trade will increase the returns to the
abundant factors in an economy: For the unskilled‐labor abundant countries like
India, this could be good news—the implication is that trade will raise the incomes
of low‐skilled workers, thus generating a reduction in poverty and likely in income
inequality as well. However, it is sometimes argued that this outcome may not
obtain for a number of practical reasons. First, different regions may have different
levels of access to international trade—lagging regions may not benefit from trade
because transportation and other trade costs may be too high for these regions to
interact with international markets. Second, an important source of the gains from
trade comes from the improvement in the allocation of productive resources in the
economy. However, this improvement in production efficiency may be diminished if
factors of production, such as labor and capital labor are not mobile across sectors.
Specifically, factors of production that are stuck in declining sectors may be hurt by

1 For detailed discussion of the post independence history of the Indian economy and the context in which these
reforms were eventually undertaken, see Bhagwati (1993) and Panagariya (2008).
2 Income inequality here refers simply to differences in incomes. As Kuznets (1953) stated, this is “without

regard to their desirability as a system of reward or undesirability as a scheme running counter to some type of
equality.” It is important to note, as Atkinson (1983) does, that “in order to assess the implications of differences
in income, we need to first establish that the people involved are comparable in other relevant respects” and
that “once we have established that people have comparable circumstances, the inferences depend upon the
underlying principles of social justice.” Different ideas about social justice can lead to quite different views
regarding inequality. Separately, the question of whether trade liberalization (or economic globalization more
generally) has benign or malign effects on the distribution of income has been widely debated. See Bhagwati
(2004) for a comprehensive discussion.
3
  It is, of course, possible that openness to a global economy alters the patterns of income mobility in society as
well, a question that we do not study in this paper. See, however, recent work on this interesting topic by
Hnatkovska, Lahiri and Paul (2010), Jalan and Murugai (2009) and Munshi and Rosenzweig (2009).
trade liberalization. Third, insights from the literature on economic geography
suggest that increases in regional disparities may be a natural feature of the
economic development process. Specifically, if production is subject to economies of
scale, market forces may induce production to agglomerate in a few areas. In this
case, the economic development process can be a lumpy one—with some regions
growing faster than others do. Trade itself may affect agglomeration patterns and
the location of economic activity. Trade liberalization may lead to an increase in the
geographic concentration of economic activity—thus, possibly increasing (or
decreasing) the extent of regional differences within a country. Thus, despite the
aggregate benefits that openness to international trade and a greater market
orientation are expected to bring, there remains the theoretical possibility that
inequality is widened as a result.


Nearly two decades after the introduction of market‐oriented economic reforms in
India, the consequences of these reforms for inequality are being vigorously
debated, with different empirical studies reaching different conclusions concerning
the evolution of inequality subsequent to the reforms. For instance, Bhalla's (2003)
study of inequality trends between 1983 and 1999 concludes that "the claim that
inequality has worsened" over this time period is "somewhat erroneous," while
Singh et al. (2003) find evidence of modest increases of regional and within‐state
inequality. 4


One reason behind these equivocal findings is that the different studies that have
examined inequality have studied quite different sample aggregates. For instance,
Bhalla (2003) examines within‐state inequality in rural and urban areas separately
while Singh et al. (2003) study the overall within‐state inequality without separately
considering the rural and urban components. Comparing inequality measures using
data obtained at different levels of aggregation is especially problematic as the

  For comparative discussions of the evolution of inequality subsequent to the reforms and prior to the
1999-2000 period survey of household incomes by the Indian National Sample Survey, see Pal and Ghosh
(2007) and Panagariya (2008, Chapter 8).
inequality measures used in the vast majority of inequality studies, such as the Gini
coefficient, are subject to the disadvantage that they are not additive across sub‐
groups. For instance, the total Gini coefficient of a society is not equal to the sum of
the Gini coefficients for its sub‐groups.

Our interest is in the evolution of total inequality as well as inequality within and
across sub‐groups (such as states or urban and rural areas within states). It would
therefore be desirable to use an inequality index that is additively decomposable,
i.e., it can be neatly expressed as the sum of across‐group inequality and within‐
group inequality. Conceptually, the across‐group component would be the value of
the inequality index when all within group inequalities were zero due to the
hypothetical assignment of the group average to each member of the same group.
Similarly the within‐group component would be the value of the inequality index
when all the across‐group inequalities are suppressed by a hypothetical
equalization of group means to the overall mean (by the equi‐proportionate change
for every unit within each of these groups). The particular measure of inequality
that we will use is Theil's entropy index, which, as is well known, is characterized by
its property of additive decomposability. 5 Furthermore, as we will discuss, the Theil
index has less stringent data requirements and is particularly useful when only
group data are available rather than individual data or when individual data are
subject to random measurement error (which average out in larger samples). The
Theil index enables us to explore in a consistent manner the evolution of inequality
over different levels of aggregation.


This paper measures inequality using Theil’s inequality index constructed using
Indian household expenditure survey data from 1988‐2005. Our findings are as
follows. The extent of inequality between states or between urban and rural areas is
much lower than the inequality across households within these aggregates, which
accounts for more than 90% of overall inequality and persists in this magnitude

Theil index over other indices measuring income inequality.
throughout the period of our study. Overall inequality shows some variation over
the period, falling between 1988 and 1994, rising between 1994 and 2000, but
falling again by 2005. A similar pattern is observed when inequality is measured
using other inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient and the variance of log
expenditures. Furthermore, a similar inequality trend is seen within most Indian
states. Thus, the evolution of inequality in the post reform period has been a non‐
monotonic one. Finally, the change in inequality across households within states is
found to un‐correlated with the change in state‐level measures of tariff and non‐
tariff protection.


The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data that we use in
our paper. Section 3 describes the Theil Index and its use in inequality
measurement. Section 4 presents results on inequality and its association with
international trade. Section 5 concludes.


2. Data


2.1 Consumer Expenditure Surveys


The Indian National Sample Survey (NSS) is the primary source of information on
household level expenditures in India. The NSS provides household level
information on expenditure patterns, occupation, industrial affiliation (at the 3‐digit
NIC level) and various other household and individual characteristics. The surveys
cover all Indian states, with urban and rural areas within states identified
separately. Data are collected on about 75,000 rural and 45,000 urban households.
Furthermore, within a state, the surveys indicate the region, district, and urban
block or rural village within which the surveyed households are located. For our
analysis, we use data from the 1987‐88, 1993‐94, 1999‐2000 and 2004‐05 rounds of
the NSS.
The household expenditure surveys conducted by the NSS contain detailed
information on consumption expenditures undertaken by the household. The
surveys include information on food consumption, non‐food consumption on items
such as energy and transportation, consumer durables expenditures and housing.


The monetary estimates of total consumption for a household must be adjusted to
reflect the different prices that different households face. The price variations that
we are concerned with are less temporal than spatial: people who live in different
parts of the country pay different prices for comparable goods. For example, prices
tend to be lower in rural than in urban areas, at least for some goods and services.
Such spatial differences can be quite large in both absolute and relative prices and
so it is important to take them into account. In our analysis, we use household‐level
price data (obtained from the NSS consumption surveys) on a core set of
consumption items (food items and energy) to determine a price index which is
then used to deflate household expenditures to make them comparable across
households. Specifically, our price index (Paasche) is constructed as a weighted sum
of price ratios of different commodities:


                                                   −1
                                     ⎡    h ⎛ pk ⎞
                                               0
                                                    ⎤
                                 P = ⎢∑ wk ⎜ h ⎟ ⎥ ,
                                   h

                                     ⎣⎢ k   ⎝ pk ⎠ ⎥⎦


where k denotes commodities, ph denotes the price faced by household h, p 0
denotes the reference price, chosen to be the median price for the commodity in our
sample and wkh , the weight, is the share of each household’s budget that is devoted

to the particular good. Clearly the budget shares vary across households, implying a
different weighting of the price ratios for each household. But, as Deaton and Zaidi
(2002) argue, this formulation better reflects welfare changes than an index that
uses the same weights across households (such as the Laspeyeres index).
One final point regarding the data on household consumption merits mention. As
Deaton (2003) and others have noted, the design of the NSS survey questionnaire
for the year 1999‐2000 (the 55th round) was different from that in earlier rounds
raising questions regarding the comparability of the data from this survey with
previous surveys. The comparability problem arises because the 55th round of the
NSS required households to report their expenditure levels over different recall
periods than the previous rounds. 6


To account for the effect of the discrepancy in recall periods, we implement the
solution suggested by Deaton (2003). Specifically, we exploit the fact that there
were a subset of goods (accounting for more than 20% of consumer expenditures)
for which the survey questionnaire had the same recall period (30 days) across all
rounds of the NSS and the expenditure on which is highly correlated with total
expenditure. Assuming that the Engel curve relating the logarithm of expenditures
per‐capita on 30‐day goods to the logarithm of total household expenditures per
capita is stable over time, the total expenditures of the households can be backed
out of expenditures on the 30‐day goods. While the validity of this assumption
cannot be checked, Deaton (2003) confirms the robustness of the adjustment
procedure.




6
  More specifically, as Deaton (2003) notes, the issue is a follows: The 55th Round differed both from
earlier rounds and from either of the Schedules in the experimental rounds. For the high frequency
items, households were asked to report their expenditures for both recall periods. The
questionnaires were printed with the list of goods down the leftmost column, with the next four
columns requesting quantities and expenditures over the last seven days and over the last 30 days
respectively. Such multiple reporting periods are often used in household expenditure surveys, and
may well produce excellent estimates in their own right. But the results are unlikely to be
comparable with those from a questionnaire in which only the 30‐day questions are used. For
example, when they are asked both questions, respondents are effectively being prompted to
reconcile the rates of consumption across the two periods. Indeed, there is some evidence that is
consistent with this sort of reconciliation.
2.2 Trade Protection


We use Hasan, Mitra, and Ural’s (2007) data on state‐level measures of trade
protection. In particular, industry‐level tariff rates and non‐tariff barrier (NTB)
coverage rates for agricultural, mining, and manufacturing industries are weighted
by state‐ and sector‐specific employment shares as follows:


                                      Tariff it = ∑ γ ik ,1993 * Ind _ Tariff kt
                                                    k




                                        NTBit = ∑ γ ik ,1993 * Ind _ NTBkt
                                                    k




where γ j ik ,1993
                     is the employment share of industry k in state i derived from the 1993

employment survey. Ind _ Tariff kt and Ind _ NTBkt are industry specific tariff rates and
non‐tariff coverage rates that are measured at the 2‐digit level for each year t.


3. Measuring Inequality


We measure inequality using Theil’s “T” statistic, which, when used in the context of
individual data, is given by: 7


                                      n ⎧
                                          ⎪⎛ 1 ⎞ ⎛ c p     ⎞     ⎛ c p ⎞ ⎪⎫
                                 T = ∑ ⎨⎜ ⎟ * ⎜            ⎟ *ln ⎜ ⎟ ⎬
                                          ⎪⎝ n ⎠ ⎝ μc
                                     p =1 ⎩                ⎠     ⎝ μc ⎠ ⎭⎪


where n is the number of individuals in the population, cp is the real consumption of
the person indexed by p, and μ c is the population’s average consumption. If every
individual has exactly the same consumption level, T will be zero; this represents
perfect equality and is the minimum value of Theil’s T. If one individual has all of

7
 Our discussion in this section of Theil index methodology is based on the more detailed description of the
Theil index and its use provided by Conceição and Ferreira (2000).
the consumption, T will equal ln(n); this is the highest level of inequality and is the
maximum value of Theil’s T statistic.


If members of a population can be divided into mutually exclusive and completely
exhaustive groups, then Theil’s T statistic is made up of two components, the
between‐group element (Tbg) and the within‐group element (Twg).


       T = Tbg + Twg

When aggregated data is available instead of individual data, Tbg can be used as a
lower bound for the population’s value of Theil’s T statistic. The between group
element of Theil’s T can be written as:




             m ⎧
                  ⎛ p ⎞ ⎛c ⎞     ⎛ c ⎞⎫
      Tgb = ∑ ⎨⎜ i ⎟ * ⎜ i ⎟ *ln ⎜ i ⎟ ⎬
            i =1 ⎩⎝ P ⎠ ⎝ μ ⎠    ⎝ μ ⎠⎭


where i indexes the groups, pi is the population of group i, P is the total population,
ci is the average consumption in group i, and μ is the average consumption across

the entire population. Tbg is bounded above by the natural logarithm of the total
population divided by the size of the smallest group (a value that is attained when
the smallest group consumes all the resources).


As Conceição and Ferreira (2000) note, when data are hierarchically nested (e.g.,
every district is in a state and each state is in a country), Theil’s T statistic must
increase or stay the same as the level of aggregation becomes smaller (i.e., Tpopulation
> Tstate > Tdistrict). Theil’s T statistic for the population equals the limit of the between
group Theil component as the number of groups approaches the size of the
population.
The additive decomposability of our inequality index, which allows us to neatly
express inequality as the sum of between‐group inequality and within‐group
inequality enables us to examine inequality at different levels of aggregation in our
study. Furthermore, the Theil index has less stringent data requirements and is
particularly useful when only group data are available rather than individual data or
when individual data are subject to random measurement error (which average out
in larger samples). In our case, inequality measures may be biased by the infrequent
household consumption of durable goods or other lumpy expenditures (such as on
weddings and funerals). As we will discuss in greater detail, we will sometimes
group households into centiles and use consumption levels averaged across
different centiles of the sample to construct the Theil index, thus exploiting the
advantages of using the Theil index with aggregated data.



Finally, to ensure the robustness of our findings, we also measure inequality other
well known inequality measures such as the Gini Coefficient and the Variance of log
consumption.



4. Results



We use household survey data from four NSS rounds—1987‐88, 1993‐94, 1999‐
2000 and 2004‐05—to construct measures of per capita expenditure inequality that
may be compared over time and which, exploiting the decomposability of the Theil
index, convey information about the contribution of the different sub‐national
aggregates (states and urban and rural areas within states) to overall inequality.
Since the Theil index is sensitive to a changing number of sub‐groups (and thus a
changing number of households in the sample), comparability of inequality over
time requires that we work with aggregated groupings of the data while fixing the
number of sub groups. Thus, we aggregate household expenditures into percentile
groups within each sub‐group. For instance, we aggregate households into 20,000
percentile groups to calculate overall inequality.    For the decompositions, we
aggregate households into 300 percentile groups within each state and 150
percentile groups with each rural or urban area within each state. 8 This also allows
us to smooth consumption of durables and other lumpy expenditures and to also
smooth out any random measurement error in the survey data. We present here
results using only data on expenditures on non‐durable goods (food items, energy
and transportation, education, medical and housing). Additional findings, not
reported here, for overall consumption expenditures (including durables good
consumption) are very similar to the findings presented below.


4.1 Inequality Overall


We compute first the values of overall inequality over time. As mentioned in the
previous section, in order to compare the evolution of inequality over time, we must
use a fixed number of final elements, thus necessitating the use of percentile groups
in our analysis.


Figure 1A plots overall Theil inequality levels for the years 1988, 1994, 2000 and
2005. For each of these years, we also obtain bootstrapped estimates of the
sampling variances associated with the inequality estimates. This is done using the
methodology suggested and implemented in the statistical package STATA by Jollife
and Krushelnytskyy (STATA command ineqerr). Specifically, the chart indicates the
inequality estimate along with a two standard deviation height (reflecting a 95%
confidence interval band) marked above and below this mean estimate. Figure 1A
reveals an interesting pattern in the data. Inequality rises after the implementation
of the economic reforms until 2000 but falls back by 2005 to being slightly above
the pre‐reform 1988 level. Figure 1B provides a corresponding set of estimates
using the Gini inequality measure and Figure 1C provides inequality estimates using
the variance of log expenditures as the inequality measure instead. Clearly, the

8
 Changing the number of sub-groups has no material effect on the results. We want to maximize the
number of subgroups to get a more accurate estimate of household inequality while at the same time
maintaining the same number of subgroups over time to make comparisons.
different inequality measures provide a rather similar picture: While inequality rose
in the immediate post reform period, there is a drop in inequality between the years
2000‐2005. Thus, inequality has not risen monotonically since the economic
reforms.


For the results presented in Figures 1A, 1B and 1C, we have used the Deaton (2003)
“adjusted” measure of inequality for the year 2000 (see the discussion in Section
2.1). Figures 2A, 2B and 2C present the corresponding inequality trends (for the
Theil, Gini and Variance of log expenditure measures respectively) without
adjusting the inequality measure for the year 2000. The Deaton (2003) adjustments
clearly raise the measured inequality in the year 2000, as can be seen by comparing
Figures 1A with 2A, 1B with 2B or 1C with 2C. Without the adjustment, the rise in
inequality between 1994 and 2000 is therefore smaller. Nevertheless, the overall
inequality trend without the adjustment to 2000 consumption seems to be roughly
as it was before. The point estimate of inequality falls between 1988 and 1994, then
rises between 1994 and 2000 and then falls again by 2005, again implying a non‐
monotonic evolution of inequality over time. 9


4.2 Inequality Decomposition


Next, we decompose the Theil index to assess the contribution of various sub‐
national aggregates to overall inequality. We consider several decompositions. We
begin by decomposing overall inequality into the sum of inequality across urban and
rural areas and inequality across household percentile groups within these urban
and rural areas. Next, we consider inequality across states and across household
percentile groups within these states. We then consider a more detailed
decomposition with overall inequality split into inequality across states, across rural
and urban areas within states and across household percentile groups within these
urban and rural aggregates. Finally, in an even more detailed decomposition,

9
 Having noted the similarity in inequality trends with and without the Deaton (2003) adjustment to the data
for the year 2000, we used unadjusted data for the remainder of the analysis.
inequality within urban and rural aggregates (within states) is now decomposed
into inequality across different first‐stage units (FSUs) that are either villages or
collections of urban blocks and inequality across households within FSUs.


4.2.1   Inequality Across Urban and Rural Areas


Figure 3A presents the evolution of inequality decomposed as the sum of inequality
between urban and rural areas and across household percentile groups within these
areas. Figure 3B is similar but presents the shares of across group and within group
inequality where the groups are urban and rural. From Figure 3A, we see that urban
–rural inequality has increased from 1994 onwards. However, both figures clearly
depict that most of the inequality lies at a level below that of the urban/rural
aggregate. Indeed, the decomposition in Figure 3B tells us that much of the
inequality seen here is inequality with rural or urban areas, accounting for more
than 90% of overall inequality.


4.2.2   Inequality Across States


Next, we decompose overall inequality into across‐state and within‐state inequality.
Figure 4A presents the evolution of this decomposition and Figure 4B presents the
decomposition in shares. As Figure 4A indicates, inequality across states rose
between 1994 and 2000 and again between 2000 and 2005. However, again, most
of inequality lies within states.    Hence, as wide as is the gap in per capita
expenditures between Indian states, inequality within states is much larger,
accounting for more than 90% of overall inequality in all years.


Figures 5A and 5B add one level of disaggregation to figures 4A and 4B, respectively.
Inequality within states is further disaggregated into inequality across urban and
rural areas within states and within these urban and rural areas within states. Once
again, most of the inequality lies at a level below that of the urban and rural areas
within states. An even more detailed decomposition is presented in Figure 6, where
inequality within urban and rural areas (within states) is now decomposed into
inequality across different FSUs and inequality across households within FSUs. As
Figure 6 indicates, more than 60% of the overall inequality is accounted for by
inequality across households within FSUs, with significant inequality also between
FSUs within urban and rural areas within states. Consistent with earlier figures,
most of the inequality is observed below urban and rural areas within states.


4.2.3 Inequality within States


Table 1 presents within‐state inequality measures calculated for each state—overall
and separately for urban and rural areas. We note first that the inequality ranking of
states is quite similar, although not identical, to the inequality rankings (measured
using the variance of log expenditures) reported by Deaton and Dreze (2002). From
Table 1, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh appear in the top
third of states with the highest rural inequality in 1994. This is consistent with
Deaton and Dreze (2002). Likewise, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal, and
Orissa appear in the bottom third, with the lowest levels of rural inequality. For
urban areas, again as in Deaton and Dreze (2002), Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra,
and Himachal Pradesh appear in the top third of the group while Rajasthan, Jammu
and Kashmir, and Assam appear within the bottom third. 10


Turning to changes in overall inequality, we can see from Table 1 that inequality
trends within states mirror the national experience. Thus, inequality seems to have
risen between 1994 and 2000 in the vast majority of states, but also fallen between
2000 and 2005 in most states. Indeed, between 2000 and 2005, only four states,
Mizoram, Maharashtra, Orissa and Haryana show significant increases in inequality.
The picture is almost exactly the same for rural and urban areas within states, with

10
  We should note that the Deaton and Dreze (2002) study reported inequality estimates for 15 states in
contrast to the 25 reported on in Table 1. Our comparison of inequality rankings with those reported in
Deaton and Dreze (2002) is therefore just an indicative one. We should also note that a major exception is
Punjab which indicates reasonably high levels of urban inequality in our study while appearing at the
bottom of the list in Deaton and Dreze (2002).
the majority of states experiencing rising inequality between 1994 and 2000, but
falling inequality between 2000 and 2005.


4.3 Distribution of Consumption Expenditures


To study in greater detail the evolution of the overall level of inequality reported in
Section 4.1, we examine next the distribution of growth in household per capita
consumption over the time period 1988‐2005. Figures 7A, 7B and 7C illustrates the
growth in real per capita consumption by centile groups across the years 1988‐94,
1994‐2000 and 2000‐05 respectively. Figure 7A, spanning the initial reform period,
clearly indicates a slightly higher per capita consumption growth rate for the lower
centiles. This corresponds to the reduced inequality in 1994 relative to 1988 that we
have discussed earlier. Figure 7B reveals the opposite trend, with a slightly higher
per capita consumption growth rate for upper centiles corresponding to increasing
inequality over the 1994‐2000 period. Finally, in Figure 7C, representing the period
2000‐05, we see a higher growth rate for lower centile households as well as for
households in the upper half (above median) of the distribution. This corresponds
to the slight fall in inequality from 2000‐05.


4.4 Trade Openness and Inequality


We turn, finally, to the links between exposure to international trade and inequality.
Our analysis is conducted at the level of the state. As discussed in Section 2.2, we use
measures of tariff and non‐tariff protection constructed by Hasan, Mitra and Ural’s
(2007). Specifically, the state level measures for protection are constructed by using
industry‐level tariff rates and non‐tariff barrier (NTB) coverage rates for
agricultural, mining, and manufacturing industries, weighted by state and sector
specific employment shares.
To this end, we would like to compare how trade reforms during the 1988‐94 period
affected inequality in the subsequent 1994‐2005 period.          Figure 8A plots the
changes in inequality within states over the time period 1994‐2005 against changes
in state level tariff protection between 1988 and 1994. No pattern can be discerned
between the magnitude of tariff reductions and the changes in inequality. Figure 8B
plots the changes in inequality within states (for the time period 1994‐2005)
against changes in state level non‐tariff protection between 1988 and 1994. Once
again, there is no clear pattern that can be discerned in the data.


Nevertheless, to test formally for the presence of a statistically significant
association between changes in inequality and trade policy changes, we examine
regression estimates from the following econometric specifications:


                            ΔInequality2005−1994 = α + β (ΔTariff1994−1988 ) +ε


and

                           Δ Inequality 2005 −1994 = α + β ( Δ NTB1994 −1988 ) +ε


Table 2 presents the results from ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of the
specifications above. As suggested by the scatter plots in Figures 8A and 8B, OLS
estimates of the parameter β measuring the association between changes in
inequality and trade policy changes are insignificantly different from zero. 11


The finding of the lack of any significant association between trade openness and
inequality is robust to many changes to the econometric specification we have
considered above. Specifications involving levels rather than differences of the
dependent and independent variables and the use of different lag structures all yield
essentially the same outcome, a statistically insignificant association between trade
openness and inequality. Furthermore, considering income inequality changes over
different time periods rather than the 1994‐2005 period and focusing separately on
urban and rural inequality do not materially alter the results. Thus, the hypothesis

11
  Kerala and Assam, outlier states due to the magnitude of the change in their trade barriers, have been
dropped from these figures and the regression results. However, our results are robust to adding Kerala and
Assam to the regression; β is still statistically insignificant from zero.
of an association between trade and inequality does not find support in our analysis
of the data.




5. Conclusions


The consequences of the economic reforms in India for inequality have being
vigorously debated. To study the evolution of inequality subsequent to the economic
reforms, we have used the Theil inequality index and other inequality measures
using household expenditure data from the Indian National Sample Survey. As we
have discussed in this paper, the Theil index has the merit that it is additively
decomposable so that it can be expressed as the sum of across‐group inequality and
within‐group inequality, thereby enabling a consistent examination of inequality at
different levels of aggregation.


Our main findings are that overall inequality varied modestly over the period of our
study, falling between 1988 and 1994, rising between 1994 and 2000, but falling
again by 2005.     Hence, the evolution of inequality since 1994 has been non‐
monotonic. Furthermore, a similar non‐monotonic inequality trend has been seen
within most states. While rural‐urban inequality and across state inequality have
risen slightly from 1994‐2005, they constitute an extremely small portion of overall
inequality. More than 60% of overall inequality is found at the micro‐level within
urban blocks and rural villages. The change in inequality across households within
states is found to uncorrelated with the change in state‐level measures of tariff and
non‐tariff protection. Considered alongside the evidence concerning the reduction
in poverty in this time period, our findings should allay concerns regarding the
adverse impact on equity of the economic reforms undertaken in India.
