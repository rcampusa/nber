                                         ABSTRACT

We examine the relationship between social media activity, such as Google searches and tweets,
related to teen pregnancy and the airing of the MTV program 16 and Pregnant. In contrast to
Kearney and Levine's (2015) claim of a positive relationship, we find that the association is
statistically insignificant or negative, when the analysis includes periods when new episodes of
the program were not being broadcast. The results are also sensitive to using the total number of
tweets, which were growing exponentially, as weights. Our results cast substantial doubt on
social media as a link in the causal chain between reality television and fertility.

A data appendix is available at http://www.nber.org/data-appendix/w25446
         In a recent study of teen pregnancy in the American Economic Review, Melissa Kearney

and Philip Levine (2015, henceforth KL) found that the MTV show 16 and Pregnant was

associated with a 4.3 percent decline in teen birth rates between July 2009 and December 2010.

We have recently cast doubt on KL’s interpretation of this association as causal (Jaeger, Joyce,

and Kaestner 2018). In this paper we re-examine KL’s evidence using data from Twitter and

Google Trends in which they link the timing of broadcasts of 16 and Pregnant to increased use of

phrases related to birth control and abortion on these platforms, in an effort to establish a causal

link between the show and fertility behavior.1 The use of social media to support traditional

econometric analyses is a major focus of their study and part of a growing trend in social science

research (see, for example, Choi and Varian 2012 and Stephens-Davidowitz 2017).2

         We first replicate KL’s analysis of the Google and Twitter data, which is limited to periods

around the first broadcasts of episodes of 16 and Pregnant. We show that these results are

unaffected by correcting for minor mistakes KL made in the coding of broadcast dates.                      We then

use the full sample of tweets available in the data KL posted on the American Economic Review

website and re-evaluate their evidence. We continue to show that, not surprisingly, broadcasts of

new episodes of 16 and Pregnant are associated with increased tweets about and Google searches

for the phrase “16 and Pregnant.” In not limiting the periods in the analysis, however, we find that

broadcasts of new episodes did not increase tweets about or Google searchers for terms related to

birth control and abortion relative to the pre-16 and Pregnant period or relative to periods in which

 KL write, “In all of these approaches using high frequency data, we believe that the results plausibly provide causal
estimates of the impact of the show” (p. 3621).
2
  Kearney and Levine’s description of the social media analysis as “secondary and suggestive” (Kearney and Levine
2016) and “peripheral” (Kearney and Levive 2018) is surprising, given that fully half of the data analysis in KL is
devoted to social media. In Kearney and Levine (2014a), which garnered much attention from the national press, they
argue that the analysis of social media and its effect on attitudes was a primary contribution.



                                                                                                                    1
new episodes of the show were being broadcast. In addition, we show that KL’s results are

sensitive to their choice of weights. We conclude that KL’s social media analyses do not support

the causal link to fertility behaviors that they claim.



I.       Data



         KL use data from Google Trends and Twitter to assess interest in 16 and Pregnant, birth

control, the contraceptive pill, and abortion. KL regress tweet rates and Google Trend indices on

indicators for broadcasts of 16 and Pregnant as well as the Google Trend index and tweets about

16 and Pregnant in an attempt to establish a causal link from the show to potential behavioral

changes that would plausibly explain the decline in teen birth rates that they claim was related to

the show’s broadcast. Most of the data used in our analysis was included in the files made available

by the American Economic Review when KL was published. KL’s “do” files refer to one data file

that was not included in the replication package and we obtained this file directly from Phillip

Levine. 3

         KL purchased Twitter data from Topsy Labs, a social media company that was founded in

2007 and acquired by Apple in 2013 before closing in 2015. These data contain information about

tweets regarding 16 and Pregnant, birth control, abortion, and adoption, as well as the total number

of tweets, on each day from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012. KL create daily rates (per 1

  We use the data files topsy-trend-daily.dta, googletrends-state.dta, topsy-state-daily.dta, topsy-state.dta from
https://www.aeaweb.org/aer/data/10512/20140012_data.zip. We acquired the file googletrends.dta directly from
Phillip Levine on 28 August 2016. All files are included in our replication files along with the “do” file to generate
all of the results in this paper.


                                                                                                                    2
million overall tweets) mentioning “abortion,” “birth control,” or “16 and Pregnant.”                 They also

provide data from Topsy that gathered the same information, disaggregated by state.

           KL use data from Google Trends to measure the relative frequency for searches for “16

and Pregnant,” “how get birth control,” “how get abortion,” and “how get birth control pill” at a

weekly frequency over 209 weeks from January 2009 to December 2012. Google Trends creates

an index of query shares, and queries can be specific to a time-period, geographic region or both.

The index for a search of a specific query is constructed by dividing the number of searches for

the specific term by the total number of searches conducted over the time-period or geography and

then assigning a value to 100 to the time-period-geography with the largest share. All other period-

geography units are normalized using the largest value. Thus, an index value of 0.5 for a period-

geography search of “how to get abortion” is half as large as the share of the query that generated

the largest share in that period and geographic unit.4



Corrections to KL’s Data



           KL miscoded 11 of the 53 days on which a new episode of 16 and Pregnant was

broadcast.5 Each miscoding was off by one day, and these obviously affect the lagged indicators

for broadcast days as well as the characterization of periods in which “in season” (i.e. the period

  We checked broadcast dates from the official 16 and Pregnant website (http://www.mtv.com/shows/16-and-

relevant    to    KL’s       analysis   (http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/16-pregnant/episodes-season-1/304110/,

between broadcast of the first show in the season and the last).6 In addition, in the analysis where

KL focus only on the days that are “in season,” they incorrectly programmed the variable

indicating the day after a new episode of 16 and Pregnant was broadcast.7 Neither of these

mistakes has a large impact on the qualitative interpretation of KL’s results, and we note for the

record that we were able to replicate all of KL’s results using their (incorrect) dates and variable

coding.8



II.      Replication and Extensions



National Twitter Analysis



         KL define tweet rates as the total number of tweets with the specified terms each day per

1 million total tweets made that day. They graphically show (KL Figure 8) that the time daily

time series of the tweet rate for “16 and Pregnant” has clear spikes on the day after a new episode

of the show was broadcast, as well as elevated tweet activity during the weeks in which new

episodes of 16 and Pregnant was airing (KL Figure 7). In Figure 1, we provide a similar graph

of daily tweet rates for “16 and Pregnant” in 2010, but also include the tweet rates for “birth

control” (Panel A) and “abortion” (Panel B). Other years exhibit similar properties and are

6
 The corrected “in-season” periods are 11 June 2009 to 30 July 2009 (Season 1), 16 February 2010 to 20 April 2010
(Season 2 part 1), 26 October 2010 to 4 January 2011 (Season 2 part 2), 19 April 2011 to 28 June 2011 (Season 3),
and 27 March 2012 to 5 June 2012 (Season 4). The first episode of season 5 of 16 and Pregnant was not broadcast
until 14 April 2014, outside of our analysis period.
7
  KL first dropped the observations that were not “in season” and then used the x[_n-1] construct in Stata to create the
lagged variable. This works when each observation is temporally contiguous to the observation, but not when there
are breaks in the time series.
8
  Because KL did not make available daily-level data across states for the state-level Twitter analysis in Table 4 below,
we are not able to evaluate how the miscoding of the “in-season” periods affects the results. We use their dating of
the 11 periods in this analysis.

                                                                                                                       4
available from the authors by request. In both panels the vertical lines represent the broadcast

dates of 16 and Pregnant. While there are clear spikes in the tweet rate for “16 and Pregnant,” we

find no similar pattern for the tweet rate of “birth control” or “abortion.”

        KL formally test for an association between 16 and Pregnant and tweets for “birth control”

and “abortion,” by regressing the natural logarithm of the tweet rate for each term on indicators

for the day a new episode of 16 and Pregnant was broadcast. KL limit their analysis to the 336

days during weeks in which a new episode of 16 and Pregnant was broadcast, although their data

include all 1,461 days between 1 January 2009 and 31 December 2012.

        Limiting the periods of analysis in this way is potentially problematic for several reasons.

First, re-runs of 16 and Pregnant are shown throughout the year and at numerous times during the

day, leading to potentially constant exposure to the show’s messages since its inception. Second,

the available Twitter data includes five months prior to any broadcasts of 16 and Pregnant. KL

omit these data from their analysis, even though they provide a useful baseline of tweeting of “birth

control” and “abortion” in the months leading up to the show’s debut. Lastly, including tweets

from the periods when new episodes of 16 and Pregnant are not broadcast is more comparable to

their Twitter analyses across states and time, as well as to the Google Trend analyses that use all

available weekly data from January 2009 to December 2012. KL provide little justification for

difference in focus from the full period (using Google data and state × time variation with tweets)

to only the periods that are “in season” (using national-level Twitter data).9 We feel that the more

appropriate approach, and the one that KL themselves use when analyzing Google searches and


9
  KL state (p. 3620): “When we use Google Trends data, we consider the entire time period between January 2009,
the beginning of the year in which the show began, and December 2012, and focus on weekly variation, distinguishing
between the weeks in which a new episode was in season relative to other weeks of the year…. When we use Twitter
data, we restrict our attention just to those weeks in which the show is ‘in season’ (which we listed previously) and
take advantage of daily variation in outcomes.”


                                                                                                                   5
tweets across space, is to include all periods and contrast the prevalence of tweets and searches

about “birth control,” “abortion,” and the name of the show itself between those periods when new

episodes are being broadcast and those periods prior to any broadcast of 16 and Pregnant or when

only re-runs are being shown.

        We present our re-analysis of the association between 16 and Pregnant and tweets about

birth control and abortion in Table 1. In column (1) we show estimates of the association between

the broadcast of new episodes on the tweet rate for “16 and Pregnant” during the whole period

from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012.10 As in KL’s model, we include indicators for days

when a new episode was broadcast and the subsequent days. We also include an indicator for the

pre-16 and Pregnant period and the days after 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting that are “out

of season,” except for the day immediately succeeding a broadcast of a new episode. The reference

category is therefore “in season” excluding days on which a new episode is broadcast and the day

after. The bottom part of the table shows the difference between the “Day of” and “Day after”

coefficients and the “Pre-16 and Pregnant” and “Out of Season” coefficients. Following KL, we

also include a quadratic time trend. The regression is unweighted and we present Newey-West

(1987) standard errors with one lag. As demonstrated in Figure 1, there is a huge increase in the

“16 and Pregnant” tweet rate on the day of, but especially the day after, the broadcast of a new

episode, relative to the pre-16 and Pregnant period as well as relative to the “out of season”

periods.

        In column (2) we replicate KL’s results from their Table 3, column (4), using the tweet rate

for “birth control” as the dependent variable, but correcting the coding of indicators for the date of



10
  Days with zero tweets are dropped. These occur predominantly in the period before 16 and Pregnant began
broadcasting.


                                                                                                       6
a new episode and its lag. The differences between these results and KL’s published results are

trivial and we find a significant and positive relationship between new episodes and tweets about

birth control.11 In column (3) we estimate the same model but we correct for KL’s miscoding of

some days the show was broadcast. Correcting the dates of broadcasts reduces the “in-season”

periods by 3 days, and the coefficient on the “day of” indicator is no longer statistically

significantly different from zero. In both columns, following KL, we weight the regressions using

the total number of tweets occurring on that day. In column (4) we do not weight, but the results

are similar to those in column (3)

         KL use “in-season” days that are not the day of or day after the broadcast of a new episode

as the reference category. But there are two other, potentially better, “control” periods available

in the data that can be used as the baseline for tweets about birth control and abortion, namely the

period before 16 and Pregnant was first broadcast (the period between 1 January 2009 and 10 June

2009, inclusive) and the “out of season” periods after 11 June 2009 during which new episodes of

the show were not being broadcast. In column (5), we estimate the same model as in column (1),

with the log tweet rate for birth control as the dependent variable, using all of available data from

1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012. As in column (1), we include the “Pre-16 and Pregnant,”

and “Out of Season” indicators, maintaining the same reference category, “in season” days on

which a new episode is broadcast or the day after, as in column (3) and KL’s analysis. All four

variables (“Day of New Episode,” “Day after New Episode,” “Pre-16 and Pregnant,” and “Out of

Season”) are mutually exclusive and along with the reference category cover all days in the

analysis.



11
   Using KL’s incorrect coding of this variable, we were able to exactly replicate their results: the coefficient on the
“Day of” indicator is 0.1204 (standard error of 0.0468) and the coefficient on the “Day after” indicator is 0.2287
(standard error of 0.0579)

                                                                                                                      7
           We find in column (5) that tweets about birth control actually declined by about 45 percent

relative to the pre-16 and Pregnant period.12 Similarly, relative to the “out of season” days,

tweeting about birth control declined by about 18 percent on the days a new episode was broadcast.

We see no reason (and KL provide no justification) for preferring “in-season non-broadcast days”

as the baseline for tweets about birth control and abortion. Recalling that the model includes a

quadratic time trend, we argue that the cleanest reference categories is the pre-16 and Pregnant

period followed by those periods in which new episodes of 16 and Pregnant were not being

broadcast. There is no evidence that broadcasts of 16 and Pregnant increased twitter activity about

birth control relative to the pre-16 and Pregnant period. We find essentially identical results in

column (6) when we estimate the model without weighting by the total number of tweets but

calculate the standard errors using the Newey-West procedure with one lag.

           We repeat the analysis of columns (2) through (6) using the log tweet rate for abortion as

the dependent variable in columns (7) through (11). As in column (2), we are able to replicate

closely KL’s result from Table 3, column (5).13 The results here are quite analogous to those using

the log tweet rate for birth control. In columns (10) and (11), we again find that, relative to both

the pre-16 and Pregnant period and the “out of season” periods, tweeting about abortion decreases

in response to broadcasts of the show.

           It is worth noting here that although KL include audience viewing of Teen Mom and Teen

Mom 2 in defining the treatment in their analysis of the impact 16 and Pregnant on birth rates,

they include none of the broadcast dates in these shows in their social media analysis. Exclusion


12
     exp(0.369)-1=0.446.

13
   If we use their incorrectly-coded lagged day of broadcast indicator, we can exactly replicate the coefficients on
“Day of New Episode” (0.142 with a standard error of 0.036) and “Day After New Episode” (0.212 with a standard
error of 0.046).


                                                                                                                  8
of these shows potentially induces measurement error in our (and KL’s) analyses that use the full

period of data available. This measurement error would be expected to bias the coefficient of the

impact the broadcast of 16 and Pregnant towards zero, however. Our finding of a statistically

significant and negative coefficient relative to both the pre-16 and Pregnant period and the “out

of season” periods is therefore all the more striking.

         KL also correlate the tweet rate for “birth control” and “abortion” with the tweet rate for

the phrase “16 and Pregnant,” again limiting their analysis to the “in season” periods. We replicate

their estimates in columns (1) and (5) of Table 2.14 In both cases the coefficient on the tweet rate

for “16 and Pregnant” is nearly identical to KL’s estimates and positively associated with the tweet

rate for “birth control” and “abortion.”            In columns (2) and (6), we re-estimate these models

without weighting by the total number of tweets. The coefficients are smaller by a factor of three

or more and are no longer statistically significant. KL (footnote 25) suggest that weighting serves

to correct for heteroskedasticity, although they also employ robust standard errors to address the

issue. Angrist and Pischke (2009) have raised questions about heteroskedasticity as a rationale for

weighting when the form of heteroscedasticity is unknown. Solon, Haider, and Wooldridge (2015)

have recently suggested that researchers compare weighted and unweighted estimates, and the

differences between the weighted and unweighted results here suggests misspecification or

heterogeneous effects. Weighting in this context seems dubious, at best.

         Twitter became available for public use in July 2006 and subsequent growth was

exponential. In Figure 2 we plot the weighting variable that KL use, the total number of tweets

per day. The shaded areas indicate the “in-season” periods that KL analyze (and that correspond


14
  As in Table 1, we can exactly replicate the coefficients on log tweets about 16 and Pregnant in the birth control
regression (0.077 with a standard error of 0.034) and the abortion regression (0.064 with a standard error of 0.025) if
we use KL’s incorrectly-coded lagged broadcast indicator.


                                                                                                                     9
to columns (1), (2), (5), and (6) in Table 2. Differences between the weighted and unweighted

results come from a 12-fold increase in the average daily volume of tweets from the first “in-

season” period in 2009 to the last “in-season” period in 2012.15 To the extent that KL find an

effect in the weighted results, it is largely driven by the last two “in-season” periods in 2011 and

2012, the latter being after the period of their analysis of relationship between 16 and Pregnant

and fertility.

         In columns (3) and (7), we re-estimate KL’s model but include all available data between

the show’s inception on 11 June 11 2009 and 31 December 2012.16 The coefficient on the tweet

rate for “16 and Pregnant” in the birth control regression in column (3) is 60 percent smaller and

marginally statistically significant and the coefficient on the tweet rate for “16 and Pregnant” in

the abortion regression in column (7) becomes negative and statistically insignificant. In columns

(4) and (8), we re-estimate the models from columns (3) and (6) without using weights and using

the Newey-West (1987) procedure to correct for serial correlation and heteroskedasticity in the

error terms. In neither case do we find a statistically significant association with the tweet rate for

“16 and Pregnant.” These results are consistent with the lack of a visual association between

tweeting about 16 and Pregnant and tweeting about birth control and abortion in Figure 1.



State-Level Twitter Analysis



         KL also analyze the tweet rate for “birth control” and “abortion” at the state level over

time, creating a panel dataset with 11 (unequal length) time periods from January 2009 to


15
   The average volume of daily tweets in the five “in-season” periods from 2009 to 2012 are 5.08 million, 10.47
million, 12.56 million, 23.88 million, and 60.66 million, respectively.

   There are 1,294 days for this period but two days with a tweet rate of zero for “16 and Pregnant” are dropped.


                                                                                                                    10
December 2012. These periods consist of the pre-16 and Pregnant period followed by alternating

“in season” and “out of season” periods, as discussed in footnote 8. We present our exact

replication of KL’s results in Table 3. Our columns (1) and (3) replicate KL’s results from their

Table 4, Panel B, columns (4) and (5). When conditioning on period and time fixed effects, KL

find a positive and statistically significant association between tweets about 16 and Pregnant and

birth control, but a negative and not statistically significant association with tweets about abortion.

       As in all of their analyses using Twitter data, KL weight the observations by the total

number of tweets in a state × period. In columns (2) and (4) of Table 3 we re-estimate the models

from columns (1) and (3) without using weights. We find that the significant coefficient in the

birth control regression is now 64 percent smaller and no longer statistically significant while the

coefficient in the abortion regression remains not statistically significantly different from zero. As

with the national-level analysis, the rationale for weighting seems unjustified, and may also

exacerbate measurement error.       KL (footnote 41) acknowledge that assigning a geographic

location to a tweet is “a work in progress…and it is prudent to interpret our reported results using

geographic Twitter data with some caution.” Given the possibility of measurement error with

respect to the location of tweets and the lack of any covariates besides the two-way fixed effects,

the lack of robustness to weighting is not surprising. We conclude that there is little to infer about

the causal link between 16 and Pregnant and fertility behaviors from these results.




                                                                                                    11
National Google Analysis



        We present our results using KL’s national Google data in Table 4. In all columns we

follow KL and present conventional standard errors in parentheses and do not use weights.17

Although the Google search indices for “16 and Pregnant,” “How get birth control”, “How get

birth control pill,” and “How get abortion” are uninterrupted time series, KL do not correct for

serial correlation in the disturbances. We present Newey-West (1987) standard errors (employing

one lag) in square brackets. As above with our analysis of national Twitter trends, in column (1)

we first show that new episodes of 16 and Pregnant strongly predict Google searches for “16 and

Pregnant.” A week in which a new episode is broadcast is associated with a 38-point increase in

the Google Search index for “16 and Pregnant” relative to weeks without a new episode.

        The remaining columns replicate results from KL’s Tables 3 and 4. Results on the

association between weeks with a new episode in columns (2), (4), and (6) replicate KL’s Table

3, columns (1) through (3), respectively, and results on the association between searches for “16

and Pregnant” in columns (3), (5), and (7) replicate KL’s Table 4, Panel A, columns (1) through

(3), respectively. We are able to replicate their results exactly. Both new broadcasts of 16 and

Pregnant and searches for “16 and Pregnant” are unrelated to searches for “how get the birth

control,” how get birth control pill,” or “how to get abortion.” In each case the Newey-West

standard errors are larger than the unadjusted ones resulting in t-ratios that are less than one for

each coefficient. Like our results using Twitter, including the full time series of information from

  Despite reporting robust standard errors in the Twitter analysis, KL report conventional standard errors when
analyzing national Google search indices.


                                                                                                                  12
January 2009 to December 2012 yields no association between Google search activity on

behavioral terms (“birth control” and “abortion”) and measures of interest in 16 and Pregnant.18



III.     Conclusion



         KL’s analyses of social media data played an important role in their argument that 16 and

Pregnant lowered teen birth rates. By linking phrases associated with preventing or terminating

pregnancy with the timing of broadcasts of 16 and Pregnant, KL attempted to provide evidence

for a potential causal change from reality TV to fertility. This evidence was crucial for their

argument because KL were evaluating a point-in-time national policy change (see footnote 2). We

have shown elsewhere (Jaeger, Joyce, and Kaestner 2018), however, that a causal interpretation of

KL’s results based solely on their identification strategy is implausible.

         Our reassessment of KL’s social media analysis shows that these results, too, are extremely

fragile and, at best, inconclusive. Although we were able to replicate their published results

exactly, and although coding and data gathering mistakes by KL had relatively minor impacts on

their results, their choice of reference period for the Twitter results is questionable. When we

expand their analysis to cover all of the available data, it is clear that there is little or no positive

association between 16 and Pregnant and tweets about birth control and abortion. KL’s original

research showed little evidence that Google searches related to birth control and abortion are


18
   We were also able to replicate KL’s state-level Google search results in their Table 4, Panel B, columns (1) and (3).
We view these results as being uninformative about the relationship between Google searches for “16 and Pregnant”
and those for “How to get birth control” and “How to get abortion”. The regressions are rudimentary: a pre-/post-
treatment analysis with 12 or 15 states, two broad time periods (January 2005-May 2009 and June 2009-December
2010), and no comparison group during a period of rapid growth in Internet activity. We note for the record, however,
that although KL’s equation (9) includes the state- and period-specific unemployment rate, their replication programs
did not include this variable in either the state-level Twitter or Google analyses, and we were able to replicate their
results exactly without including the unemployment rate in any analysis.


                                                                                                                     13
related to measures of exposure to the or searching for “16 and Pregnant” and we confirm those

results.

           The fragility of KL’s results raises general questions about using social media data. The

potential for data mining and selective presentation of results in such a rich data environment is

great, and clear justification should be given for selecting a limited number of search phrases and

subjective periods to search. Pre-analysis plans should be used to minimize the appearance of

“cherry picking” results that support authors’ claims.

Note : Each column is from a separate regression. The period of analysis is 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2012, with restrictions as noted in the table. All regressions include a quadratic trend. Estimates from columns (2) and (7) replicate those
from Kearney and Levine Table 3, columns (4) and (5), respectively, except that the lagged indicator for a new episode is correctly created (see text). Estimates in columns (3)-(6) and (8)-(11) also correct Kearney and Levine's dates of broadcast
for 16 and Pregnant . Estimates in columns (1), (5), (6), (10), and (11) use all of the available data from the replication files provided by Kearney and Levine to the American Economic Review website. The pre-16 and Pregnant indicator is equal
to one for all dates from 1 January 2009 to 10 June 2009. 16 and Pregnant began broadcasting on 11 June 2009. There are 1,461 possible days, but following Kearney and Levine, we drop those where the tweet rate is zero. All models estimated
by OLS. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are shown in columns (2) through (7); Newey-West standard errors with one lag are shown in columns (1), (5), and (9). * indicates statistical significance at the 10 percent level, ** indicates
statistical significance at the 5 percent level, and *** indicates statistical significance at the 1 percent level.
