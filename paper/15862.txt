The Trend of Mean BMI Values of US Adults, Birth Cohorts 1882-1986 Indicates that the
Obesity Epidemic Began Earlier than Hitherto Thought

                                            ABSTRACT

The trend in the BMI values of the US population has not been estimated accurately because time
series data are unavailable and because the focus has been on calculating period effects. In contrast
to the prevailing strategies, we estimate the trend and rate of change of BMI values by birth cohorts
stratified by gender and ethnicity born 1882-1986. We use loess additive regression models to estimate
age and trend effects of BMI values of US-born black and white adults measured between 1959 and
2006. We use all the NHES and NHANES survey data and find that the increase in BMI was already
underway among the birth cohorts of the early 20th century. The rate of increase was fastest among
black females; for the three other groups under consideration, the rates of increase were similar. The
generally persistent upward trend was punctuated by upsurges, particularly after each of the two World
Wars. That the estimated rate of change of BMI values increased by 71% among black females between
the birth cohorts 1955 and those of 1965 is indicative of the rapid increases in their weight. We infer
that transition to post-industrial weights was a gradual process and began considerably earlier than
hitherto supposed.

       Introduction

       While descriptive statistics pertaining to the increasing prevalence of obesity among the US

population have been extensively reported (Ogden et al., 2004, 2008; Flegal et al., 1998), the

long-run trend in BMI values has yet to be identified convincingly. The extant studies tend to imply

that the epidemic appeared suddenly, but tend to be imprecise on its beginnings. Troiano and

Flegal (1998) reflect the mainstream view well in suggesting that, “Overweight prevalence

increased over time, with the largest increase between NHANES II and NHANES III,” surveys, that

is to say, in the 1980s (Anderson et al., 2003; Rashad et al., 2006).1 Moreover, as dozens of

studies, Ogden et al. (2006) point out that, “between 1980 and 2002, obesity prevalence doubled

in adults aged 20 years or older.”2 In short, the emphasis has been on the 1980s as a pivotal point

in the history of the obesity epidemic.

       To be sure, there are some indications that the roots of the obesity pandemic do reach

further back in time than the 1980s (Carson, 2009, Cuff, 1993; Coclanis and Komlos, 1995;

Komlos, 1987). Flegal et al. (2002, p. 1724) suggest that recent developments “may also be

viewed as part of a longer-term trend for increases in body size in affluent and well-nourished

societies.” They infer from the first national survey that the epidemic must have begun earlier than

the common wisdom supposes: “Even as long ago as 1960, almost 50% of men and more than

40% of women were overweight, and 11% of men and 16% of women were obese (p. 1727,

Carson 2009).“ Nonetheless, in our view such snapshots hardly permit an unambiguous depiction

of trends.3

       However, note that all these studies refer to period effects (measurement years) and

overlook birth-cohort effects. Insofar as it is not at all clear from the cross-sectional evidence when

the measured weight status was reached, the focus on period effects does not lead to convincing

trend estimates. Weight gains could have accumulated at anytime between birth and


3
measurement. To be sure, current BMI values reflect current nutritional status, but the current level

may have been reached prior to measurement and then retained unchanged. In fact, it could have

been acquired at an early age (in terms of z-score), putting the individual on a trajectory that led to

her current status.

       In contrast to the consensus in the literature, we estimate trends by birth cohorts, because

BMI at the time of measurement reflects the cumulative weight gains during the life course. After

all, birth cohorts experienced similar social, economic, and technological changes; this cannot be

said of measurement cohorts. For example, those measured in 1960 have been exposed to

television viewing for different lengths of time during their lives. In contrast, all those born in 1960

have had access to TV viewing all their lives, regardless of when they were measured. Another

reason to consider birth cohorts is that life-style habits and weight status acquired early in

childhood tend to persist into adulthood (Freedman et al., 2005).

       Actually, one can consider period effects as the upper bound for the time when the weight

gains occurred, whereas birth-cohort effects provide the lower bound. Thus, neither approach can

be considered to be superior to the other. In the absence of longitudinal data, that is to say, with

cross sectional data sets such as the ones we are about to analyse, both approaches have a

legitimate place in scientific inquiry, even if neither approach is fully specified because of

collinearity (period – age = cohort). However, a considerable technical advantage of the birth-

cohort approach is that instead of having only 5 data points from the cross-sectional surveys

(1959-2006), from which merely 4 differences can be calculated, we obtain data continuously for

the 104 years from 1882-1986.4 Furthermore, the birth-cohort approach also enables us to

calculate the annual rate of change of BMI values, whereas the period-effect approach does not.

       However, several studies broke new ground recently in the analysis of obesity trends.

Burkhauser, Cawley, and Schmeiser (2009) analyzed an alternative measure of obesity (skin-fold


4
thickness) and infer that an increase in obesity is already evident among cohorts measured in the

1970s, that is to say, earlier than generally supposed. Komlos et al. (2009, p. 158) using birth

cohorts to analyze trends in children’s BMI values, go further, concluding that “it appears highly

unlikely that the obesity pandemic appeared suddenly in the 1980s among American children as

conventional analysis would suggest…but has rather manifested itself slowly and persistently for

an extended period of time beginning at least …in the 1950s, but possibly earlier.“ This conclusion

is in line with the fact that many of the technological and life-style innovations that are frequently

associated with an obesogenic environment -- fast-food restaurants, automobiles, TV, radio, and

labor-saving household devices -- predated the 1980s, in some cases by many decades.

       In addition to the period trends reported up to now, and the cohort trends about to be

estimated, a third approach to the analyses is the age-period-cohort models (Hobcraft, Menken,

Preston 1982; Holford, 1992). This class of models attempt to solve the problem of collinearity (as

age, period, and cohort are linearly related: period – age = birth cohort). Reither et al. (2009) use

such a model on data from the National Health Interview Surveys. They “demonstrate that both

secular change and birth cohort membership have independently contributed to elevated odds of

obesity.” Their study differs from ours in several ways: a) they analyze obesity while we analyze

mean BMI values; b) in order to decompose the trend into a period and cohort effects in spite of

the identification problem and the concomitant collinearity they need to make several crucial

assumptions, the plausibility of which is difficult to ascertain independently. It is not clear the extent

to which their results are sensitive to these assumptions; c) they use a sample that relies on self-

reported weight and height, while we use measured values. Although they adjust for the

inaccuracies associated with such data by increasing BMI values by about 1 unit, the possibility

that errors remain cannot be ruled out. This is particularly the case, because the extent of mis-

reporting varies by education, and because their dependent variable is dichotomous, namely


5
individuals with BMI>30. Consequently, errors in the individual BMI values can lead to mis-

classification of individuals into the obese/non-obese category. Another example of such models is

provided by Sassi et al. (2009). They also use the same data set as Reither et al. (2009) and

arrive at similar conclusions, without, however, controlling for race or correcting for the fact that the

data are self-reported.

       We do not use an APC (Age, Period, Cohort) model because we have little faith in their

validity. It is not clear which one we should choose (frequentist or Bayesian), and with no

guarantee that their results would be consistent. The Bayesian approach tries to solve the

indeterminacy in the data by imposing prior assumptions on the model which appears somewhat

arbitrary (the validity of the conditions remains an open question). We prefer the simpler approach

we employ here – cohort effects share an attribute with period effects in that they provide an

accurate bound estimate of the trend in BMI values (lower and upper bounds respectively). Thus,

our main goal is to fill a lacunae in the literature by estimating the lower bound trend, i.e., trends of

the BMI values by birth cohorts of US adults stratified by gender and ethnicity in greater detail and

somewhat more convincingly than has been done up to now. A considerable advantage of this

approach is that it enables us to calculate the rate of change of the trend.

Data and Method

     We estimate for the first time the long-term trends in the BMI values (kg/m2) of adults

continuously for the birth cohorts 1882-1986 stratified by gender and ethnicity on the basis of

surveys collected between 1959 and 2006 by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).

We concatenate all the National Health Examination and National Health and Nutrition

Examination Surveys.5 We recalculate the survey weights provided in the data sets according to

the formula given in Korn and Graubard (1999)6 and use these weights throughout the analysis.

We limit the analysis to US-born adults - those above the age of 19 - (white male, white female,


6
black male, and black female are fitted separately). In order to ensure comparability over time

and to reduce uncontrolled heterogeneity7 (Rosenbaum 2005) (through immigration, for example)

we confine our analysis to non-Hispanic blacks and non-Hispanic whites. (Henceforth, we drop

the designation non-Hispanic for the sake of brevity.) (N =4976 Black Women, 14,083 white

women, 4,135 black men, and 12,651 white men).8

      We estimate the following additive semi-parametric loess models, which enable us to

estimate the shape of the trend flexibly by the data, rather than determining it ex ante:9

                                                                           3

    (1) BMIik  k  lok  Ageik   lok Birth _ yrik   lok PIRik    m Eimk    ik
                                                                          m 1

where: BMI      ik   is the BMI value for the i-th individual of k-th stratum (k=1, 2, 3, 4 corresponding to

white males, white females, black males, and black females). lo k .  is the smooth nonparametric

term (Wood, 2006). It is estimated by (locally linear) loess, for each stratum separately via

backfitting algorithm (as is usual in the context of GAM, or generalized additive models, Hastie

and Tibshirani, 1990; Wood, 2006). Actual fitting was done in R.10 PIR is the poverty-income

ratio11 (Fisher, 1992). E imk is the level of education in three categories: without a high-school

degree, with a high-school degree, and with some college education.  ik is a random term with

zero mean and variance given by survey weights (as their reciprocals).12

      Admittedly, there is a limitation to estimating trends by birth cohorts, insofar as ages are not

evenly distributed during the period considered. At the beginning of the period we have only older

ages in the sample, while toward the end we have mainly younger adults. In other words, cohort

and age effects are correlated, making attempts to attribute changes to one or the other variables

fragile. This sample composition implies that we should consider the estimates particularly at the

ends as preliminary, and subject to revision as more data become available. Furthermore, this

hurdle prevents us from testing for interaction effects. Nonetheless, we have chosen to include

these observations at the beginning and end of the period under consideration insofar as they do
7
enable us to provide some conjectures regarding past and future developments. Our reference to

dates pertain to dates of birth rather than to dates of measurement.

Results

      We estimated model (1) after selecting it among several possibilities based on

crossvalidation optimization (with respect to the span parameter) and checked its performance

using residual analysis and 1000 bootstrap resamples (each having the same number of

observations as the original data set).13 We report the estimated functions of eq. (1) graphically

(calibrating the levels for a person of age 50 with a high-school degree and PIR value of 2). For

some of the estimated functions we also report their annual rate of change.14


      The trend of increasing BMI values, which began among those born in the late-19th and

early-20th centuries, has been most rapid among black females (Figure 1) throughout the century.

We calculate the derivative of the BMI function in Figure 1 to obtain Figure 2. The results indicate

a quite synchronous acceleration after World War I among three of the four groups considered.

Black females are the exception whose BMI values was already increasing more rapidly than that

of the other three groups even at the beginning of the period considered. The upswing among

black females, which began somewhat later (in the late 1920s), was smaller and shorter, but their

rate of change remained above that of the other three groups throughout the century. Moreover,

the rapid increase in the rate of change tended to be temporary and was reversed during the

Great Depression and World War II. However, the reversal was also delayed among black

women. During the war the rate of change was only slightly above zero among men, both black

and white. However, among women, both white and black, the rate of change remained at about

0.1 and 0.14 points per annum, even during the war. A decade after the end of the war, black BMI

values begun to accelerate extremely rapidly. Among black females the rate of change of BMI

values increased from circa 0.14 points per annum in 1955 to circa 0.24 points by 1965 (a 71%
8
jump), while among black men it almost quadrupled, from about 0.04 points per annum c. 1950 to

0.15 in 1965. However, by c. 1965-1970 the rate of change leveled off in all groups although

among black females the level was at an extremely high level of 0.25 points; in fact, the only

further change in BMI values was a decline among black men (Figure 2).

                                    Figures 1 and 2 about here

      The age effects are quite substantial, and are largest among black females (Figure 3). The

peak is reached near age 60-70 in all four groups; after that a decline is evident except among

black males, whose BMI values stagnate after reaching a plateau.15 The income (PIR) effects

differ the most among the four groups (Figure 4). Black females in the low- and medium-income

ranges are the heaviest group, but a rapid weight decline accompanies an increase in income.

The BMI values of white males increases to about a PIR value of 3 or so and then declines

somewhat. The BMI of black males differs from that of white males only in that, after having

reached a PIR value of about 3, it does not decline. Among white females, the BMI value

decreases from the very beginning of the income range, but not linearly. Lastly, the education

effect is small and not as anticipated: BMI does not decline systematically with level of

educational attainment (Figure 5). The possible reason is that these effects are net of income.


                                         Figures 3 - 5 about here

      Iso-BMI lines depict combinations of age and birth cohorts with a constant BMI value at

increments of one unit (Figure 6). Their advantage is that they enable us to see simultaneously

the effect of two of the independent variables on BMI, rather than only one of them as in the other

figures. We note that both age and cohort effects are important even if the latter appear to be

more influential. For instance, a 30-year-old black women born in 1920 had a BMI value of 21,

whereas by about 1940 this would become the BMI value of a 20-year-old. A comparison of white

9
and black women’s contour maps indicates that the “hill of obesity” is much steeper among the

latter as the closer are the lines the more rapidly do the BMI values rise. One also notes the

substantial differences in the age effects. Thus, such two-dimensional contour maps do provide

visual insights that are not easily gained by one dimensional ones.

                                    Figures 6 and 7 about here

       In an alternate specification (as a sensitivity analysis) we divide the white male sample into

two groups, in order to estimate eq. (1) separately for those who were born before and those who

were born after 1940. We report only the graph for the estimated time trend, which indicates that

the degree of difference between the two models is not substantial (Figure 8). The estimate of the

function is shifted up slightly after 1940. The only major difference appears in the period prior to

1900: the second model estimates constant BMI values for those two decades.

                                        Figure 8 about here

Discussion

       Our primary goal has been to estimate long-run trends in mean BMI values of US adults by

birth cohorts between 1882 and 1986 stratified into four ethnic and gender groups (net of age

effects).16 This is the first analysis of BMI trends in which all the NHANES samples have been

concatenated, thereby providing a long-range perspective by birth cohort. The NHANES BMI data

are the most accurate insofar as they are based on measured values rather than self reported

ones as in most other surveys.

       The lack of longitudinal data renders the determination of the secular trend in BMI values

rather difficult. The lack of clear idea of when the obesity epidemic began renders the analysis of

its causes challenging. The disadvantage of cross-sectional data is that a person’s weight at a

point in time, does not reveal when that weight was reached. Insofar as current BMI is a

cumulative measure of weight gains from birth to date of measurement, period effects arguably


10
provide an upper bound for the time when the current weight was reached, whereas birth-cohort

effects provide a lower bound insofar as the weight status could have been reached at any time

between birth and measurement. Just when the weight gains actually occurred during the life

cycle, however, remains uncertain. So far research has concentrated on the (upper bound) period

effects. Our aim has been to fill the lacunae in the literature by estimating the (lower bound) birth

cohort trends.

       Our birth-cohort approach indicates that the transition to a post-industrial BMI values

occurred gradually throughout the 20th century and possibly started much earlier than hitherto

supposed, with black women outpacing the other three groups from the very beginning (Figures 1

and 2). However, the rate of change in BMI values was anything but continuous. Rather, the

general upward trend was punctuated by upsurges, particularly after each of the two World Wars.

The birth cohorts of the 1920s experienced a rapid increase in BMI values. Notably, this

generation was among the first to experience the introduction of radio broadcasting and the rapid

spread of automobiles. During the Great Depression and World War II, however, the rate of

increase decelerated and reached almost zero among men, both black and white. Indicative of

the rapid increases after the war, in striking contrast, among black females the rate of change in

BMI values increased by 71% between 1955 and 1965, while among black men it nearly

quadrupled between ca. 1950 and 1965. However, by circa 1965-70 the rate of change reached

a plateau, although among black women the plateau was at a very high level of 0.25. The only

subsequent change was a decline in BMI values among black men (Figure 2).17

       The limitation of the our study is that we do not control for period effects. However, similar

limitations apply to all studies published hitherto which calculated trends using measurement

years, i.e., period effects: they failed to control for birth cohort effects. To be sure, some

researchers recently have become aware of this issue and explore birth cohort effects of the


11
obesity epidemic using an alternative statistical strategy, by attempting to decompose age,

period, and cohort (APC) effects. However, this approach is based on hard-to-verify assumptions.

In this sense, the decomposition of (originally perfectly collinear) the three effects comes at a

relatively large price. This well-known problem is particularly acute for the NHANES data sets

under scrutiny on account of the fact that not all combinations of birth year and age are available.

Therefore, we do not attempt to produce APC decomposition in which we do not place sufficient

trust to begin with.

       Sassi et al. (2009) and Reither et al. (2009) estimate such period-age-cohort models. In

spite of the considerable differences in estimation techniques employed, as noted in the

introduction, and in the different data set used, there are several similarities between their results

and ours. Both studies also find that cohort effects were substantial although they infer that their

significance declined during the first half of the 20th century. Reither et al. find that birth cohort

effects of the probability of obesity increased after 1955, and that they were particularly rapid

among black women, increasing by some 62% between the birth cohorts of 1955 and 1975.

However, there were differences as well. They find that overall period effects were more

important than cohort effects: they “are principally responsible for the obesity epidemic in the U.S.

population.”

       Sassi et al. (2009) do not stratify their results by ethnicity or gender. Nonetheless, they are

in agreement with the latter study in that they also argue that cohort effects of obesity were

declining in the first half of the 20th century (p. 24) without providing a convincing explanation for

this finding. They also find an upturn in the cohort effects but slightly later than Reither et al.

(2009) do. Sassi et al. also analyse trends in overweight (Reither et al. do not) and find that the

cohort effects have a similar trend to that of obesity with the difference that the upswing of the

early 1960s is much attenuated. However, we do not learn how sensitive their results are to the


12
various assumptions made.

       Our study, its limitations notwithstanding, demonstrates in the least that the widespread

belief that the American obesity pandemic appeared suddenly in the 1980s is based on weak

evidential basis and on its surface rather implausible. Rather, our analysis indicates that the

transition manifested itself gradually though persistently over an extended period of time,

beginning among those born immediately after the First World War. Thus, the transition to a post-

industrial lifestyle and the associated increases in BMI values may well have spanned the entire

20th century. The rate of change in the BMI values was punctuated by upsurges among the 1920s

birth cohort as well as among the generation born watching television.

      Evidently the BMI values of all four (gender/ethnic) groups considered here accelerated in

the 1920s as well as in the 1950s, at the time when calorie-saving technological changes were

most obvious. Of course, changes in dietary habits including the anchoring of a fast-food culture

in the social fabric reinforced and greatly acerbated the trend toward increasing weight. The

decade of the 1950s is particularly noteworthy, for the acceleration in BMI values of US children

and adolescents during this decade accompanied the introduction and rapid spread of television

and of fast food culture18 (Chou et al., 2004, 2008; Komlos et al., 2009, Powell et al., 2007).

      Identifying the causes of this long-run trend are outside of the scope of this study, but we

do note that the “creeping” nature of the epidemic, as well as its persistence, does suggest that

its roots have been embedded deep in the social fabric and are nourished by a network of

disparate sources, slowly changing as the 20th-century US population responded to a vast

irresistible impersonal socio-economic and technological forces. The most obviously persistent

among these were the major labor-saving technological changes of the 20th century, chiefly the

industrial processing of food and with it the spread of fast-food eateries and the associated

culture of consumption, the rise of an automobile-based way of life, the introduction of radio and


13
television broadcasting,19 the increasing participation of women in the work force, and the IT

revolution which taken together virtually defined American society in the 20th-century (Anderson,

Butcher, and Levine, 2003; Bleich et al., 2008; Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro, 2003; Lakdawalla,

Philipson, and Bhattacharya, 2005; Lakdawalla, Philipson, 2009; Philipson and Posner, 2008;

Popkin, 2004). The decline in the rate of increase in BMI values during the Great Depression of

the 1930s and World War II reflects the decline in income which slowed the adoption of the labor

saving technologies and must have induced people to eat less often away from home.

      Moreover, psychological aspects of what has been called "the age of Milton Friedman"

(Shleifer, 2009), featuring an increase in income inequality and a decrease in economic safety

nets, put additional stress on the population that was conducive to weight gain (Ulijaszek and

Offer, 2009). To make matters worse, government policy favored corporations over the public

interest implying that consumer protection was limited (Ruskin and Schor, 2005). The food

industry spent trillions to convince people to consume and there was insufficient countervailing

power to offset this psychological program. Combined with increasing affluence, a sedentary

lifestyle, changes in dietary habits that included eating more outside of the home and eating

unhealthy foods such as snacks, multitasking that meant eating ready-made food while watching

television, these developments reinforced one another and led to the cultural transformation

associated with the post-industrial nutritional revolution (Cutler et al., 2003; Hamermesh, 2010,

Philipson and Posner, 2003, 2008; Lin et al., 2001). For example, the share of total food

expenditures spent on eating outside of the home increased from 24% in 1950 to 45% in 1995

(Offer 2001, 2006, pp. 147, 149; Guthrie et al., 2002).20

      As the BMI values of the four ethnic/gender groups considered here are distinct from one

another to some extent, so too the technological, dietary, and lifestyle changes enumerated

above seem to have had distinctly different effects on each of the four groups. The reasons for


14
these differences are outside of the scope of the current study as is the deep analysis of the

causes of the trend. While the early increases in BMI probably brought about an improvement in

biological well-being for a large portion of the population, the rapid increases after the Second

World War soon raised too many BMI values into the danger zone.

      Insofar as BMI values have been increasing gradually over a century, researchers

attempting to understand the causes of the pandemic need to redirect their focus from the 1980s

and thereafter to much longer run processes of social, technological, economic and cultural

change. The finding also implies that policies to attenuate or reverse the trend will have to reach

deep into the social fabric and take into consideration that such socio-economic forces generally

     The upswing in excess weight is said to have begun in Australia in the 1970s (Norton et al.,

     2006).
2
      See also http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hestat/overweight/overweight_adult.htm.
3
     It is also seldom mentioned that the BMI values in the US are among the highest in the

     developed world (Komlos and Baur 2004).
4
     NHANES Continuous is counted in this regard as one survey insofar as the number of

     observations 1999-2006 is similar to that of NHANES III.
5
     National Health Examination Surveys: (NHES I: 1959-62, and the National Health and

     Nutrition Examination Surveys: (NHANES I: 1970-75, NHANES II: 1976-80, NHANES III:

     1988-94, and Current NHANES 1999-2006). Heights and weights in the surveys are actual

     measurements. Four surveys were conducted between 1959 and 1994 and another 4 between

     1999 and 2006. Because the latter 4, composing the Current NHANES, were so close in time

     and because the number of observations are we consider the Current NHANES as one survey,

     making a total of 5 effective surveys.
6
     The survey weights were recalculated separately for the four ethnic/gender combinations

     using formula 8.2-4 (p. 282).
7
     The US-born criterion cannot be applied to NHES I. For NHES II and III we assume that those

     with a birth certificate were US-born. Information on Hispanic ethnicity is available only for

     NHANES III and Current NHANES. Lack of information in earlier surveys does not constitute a

     major problem, though, inasmuch as Hispanics were not oversampled before NHANES III.
8
    About 4-5% of individuals with missing values are excluded from the analysis.
9
    Hence, there is no need to assume, for example, that the BMI values increased linearly or as a

polynomial (Yatchew, 1998). The loess smoother is not fully determined, as the span has to be

29
set. The larger the span, the smoother the fit and vice versa, as in kernel smoothing. In fact, the

span determines how many of nearest points are used in smoothing a particular observation, as a

proportion of the sample size. The span was optimized over a set of discrete values via

crossvalidation. Crossvalidation uses sums of squared residuals obtained from model fitted

without an observation in question across all observations. The optimum span is 0.45, close to

the default value of 0.5 provided in R. (Cleveland, 1979; Cleveland and Devlin, 1988). The same

span was used for all of the estimates. We use the Akaika information criterion for model

selection. AIC works better with GAM than does such alternatives as Nagelkerke’s coefficient of

determination. We also do bootstrapped estimation of confidence intervals (pointwise), although

we do not report these for lack of space.

10
      (http://cran.at.r-project.org/), using the GAM package written by T. Hastie. GAM models have

been used extensively in biology as a search in the pub med data base reveals. See, for

example, Reolants, Hauspie and Hoppenbrouwers (2009). However, we were not able to find any

publications that used GAM to estimate BMI trends.

11
     Admittedly PIR is not a perfect measure of real income insofar as it, for example, does not

control for regional variation in housing prices and does not include such government transfers as

food stamps. Nonetheless, it does control for household size and for inflation.
12
     We proceed as if it were distributed normally, without actually insisting on its normality. This

leads to quasi-likelihood estimation (or generalized estimation equation).
13
     Residual RMSE was 4.6, 5.7, 5.7 and 7.3 for white male, white female, black male and black

female strata, respectively. To be sure, the way we bootstrapped the data leads to a slight

underestimation of the variability. In particular, in the bootstrap process, we took into

consideration the survey weights, i.e. heteroscedastic variances, but not the correlations implied

by the hierarchical, that is to say, the complex survey design. We believe that the major features
30
of the standard error are captured by our bootstrap procedure and hence that its results are

suitable for the visual appreciation of the magnitude of the estimation error.

14   We also estimated the model without the PIR and education effects to find that the difference in

      the results from the ones reported here is inconsequential. Hence, these are not included here

      for lack of space.

15   In order to obtain a notion of the accuracy of the estimates, note that the bootstrapped

     estimates of the confidence interval was about 0.3 BMI points at age 30. We do not report these

     for the lack of space.

16   Although we control for income and education in the results reported above, we also did the

      analysis without these variables and found only minor changes in the results. We do not report

      these results for lack of space.

17   Ogden et al. (2007, 2008) have also noted that BMI values have not changed significantly in the

      most recent surveys.

18   To Illustrate the spread of fast food culture consider that White Castle, the first drive-in

      restaurant, was founded in 1921. McDonald started operation in the late 1940s, Kentucky

      Fried Chicken in 1952, Burger King in 1954, Pizza Hut in 1958, Taco Bell in 1962, and Subway

      in 1962.
19
     Television viewing has an additional effect because food and drink commercials increase food

     and drink consumption, and therefore obesity rates (Chou et al., 2007; Powell et al., 2007).
20
     “The per-capita number of fast-food restaurants doubled between 1972 and 1997” (Chou et al.,

     2004, 568), and the calories available for consumption increased by some 20% in the late

     1980s and 1990s. In turn, the consumption of high-calorie foods was associated with the

     increase in the number of hours worked by mothers (Anderson, Butcher and Levine, 2003).
