Intertemporal Tax Discontinuities

                                             ABSTRACT



        This paper defines an intertemporal tax discontinuity (ITD) as a circumstance in which
different tax rates are applied to gains and losses realized at one point in time versus some other point
in time, and studies the effects of ITDs on market behaviors at the time of disclosures of firm
performance. The results show that ITDs either depress or amplify trading volume at the time of
disclosure, depending upon whether the disclosure is “good news” or “bad news,” repectively, and
lead to “overreactions” in price changes independent of the “news.”
