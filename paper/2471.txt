                 The Dynamics of Housing Demand by the Elderly:
                   Wealth, Cash Flow, and Demographic Effects




                                        ABSTRACT




      Using Waves one through fifteen of the PSII) data set, we investigate the pattern of
housing mobility amongst the elderly. We focus especially on two issues: (1) Deterinin-
ing which household characteristics tend to increase the probability of a move; and (2)
Whether elderly households systematically move to smaller, less expensive dwellings
when they do move, and, if so, which characteristics make such "downsizing" particularly
likely. We find that wealthier households are less likely to move and to downsize, and
that changes in family composition or retirement status significantly increase the
likelihood of a move. We do not find much evidence of imperfections in the housing
market, or of pervasive liquidity constraints. Finally, we develop a Lagrange Multiplier
test for unobserved heterogeneity amongst elderly households, and strongly reject the null
hypothesis of homogeneity.

I. INTRODUCTION


      The stereotype of the housing problem of the elderly is the following case:

        Mrs. R is a 74 year old widow who continues to live alone in the four bedroom family
        home. She has difficulty paying the utilities on this dwelling, and has been unable to
        adequately maintain the property. Because of arthritis, she has increasing difficulty with
        the stairs. Mrs. R's house is fully paid for. If she were to sell it, she could easily afford
        the rent on an apartment in a nearby elderly housing complex. However, despite the
        urging of her children, she has resisted moving, claiming the alternative is 'oo ex-
        pensive" and she is "not sure she would like it".

      The main question we will address is whether this stereotype is accurate. Is there a sig-

nificant elderly population living in housing that appears to be inappropriate in terms of physical

needs and financial resources? Are the elderly constrained by illiquidity of assets, and therefore

forced to move to smaller properties or rentals to dissave? If so, does the market fail to provide

alternatives, or through some imperfection create barriers to moving? Or, is lack of mobility a

 rational" manifestation of tastes?

      The appropriateness of policy initiatives in the elderly housing market depend on the ans-

wers to these questions. If the stereotype is pervasive, then market-wide policies may be called

for; otherwise, it may be more appropriate to concentrate on programs directed to individuals in




                                                —2—
trouble. If there are significant imperfections in the housing market the elderly face, then initia-

tives that reduce imperfections by providing information, insurance, risk pooling, or licensing

should be considered. If tastes are the source of the problem, then the question is whether one

can, or should, modify tastes through promotional campaigns. If intervention appears ap-

propriate, should it be directed to programs that permit the elderly to stay on in their homes, such

as reverse annuity mortgages and home care services? Or, is it better to encourage trading

down to more suitable facilities, freeing larger dwellings for the market, by policies such as defer-

ral of capital gains taxes, assistance in searching for housing, and reverse annuity mortgages ap-

plied to trade-downs?

       This investigation concentrates on the effects of wealth, cash flow, and changes in

household demographics on mobility and housing expenditure decisions of the elderly. We ex-

amine several issues. First, do mobility patterns suggest the presence of significant capital

market imperfections that prevent elderly owners from life-cycle dissaving? Second, are moves

closely associated with demographic shocks such as retirement, death of a spouse, or children

 leaving home, so that economic incentives (and policies that affect these incentives) impact

 elderly households through rather narrow windows? Finally, do these variables collectively pro-

 vide an adequate description of mobility amongst the elderly, or is there evidence of substantial

 remaining unexplained variation amongst households?

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section provides descriptive

 statistics of our data set, which is based on the PSID (Panel Study of Income Dynamics). Sec-

 tion Ill presents estimates of a series of models of mobility and changes in housing status

 amongst movers. Section IV provides a test for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity

 amongst households. Section V presents some conclusions, Section VI a discussion of potential

 future research, and an appendix provides some data details.

II. SOME DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS


      Using the PSID, we have summarized a few features of housing behavior of the elderly.

We have used the first 15 waves of the panel, from 1968 through 1962. We confine our attention

to households that in 1968 had either head or wife over 50 years of age; there are 1131

households meeting this condition. First, what is the mobility of the elderiy, and how is it Chang-

ing over time? FIGURE 1 shows mobility rates by age of head in each of three periods. Mobility

rates decline from the 55-64 age bracket to the 65-74 age bracket, but rise (insignificantly) in the

75+ age bracket. Mobility appears to be slightly higher after 1972 than before; FIGURE 2 shows

the mobility rate of households with heads over 65 by year. FIGURE 3 tables the patterns of

tenure changes with moves for households with heads over 65. The "other" category in this table

encompasses a variety of arrangements, such as living with relatives, living in a place of busi-

ness, or living on a working farm. The table shows 32.4 percent of moves result in tenure

changes. There is a modest net flow from owning to the remaining categories. Thus, the crude

evidence suggests Only weak disaccumulation of real assets by exiting ownership. This pattern

is consistent with that found by Merrill (1982) in the Retirement History Survey.

      How pervasive is occupancy of "inappropriate" housing by the elderly? Merrill (1982)

reports from Retirement History Survey data the following median ratios for a sample that were

between ages 66 and 71 in 1977, and who were homeowners in 1969, or 1977, or both:

        Home equity as a proportion of wealth                                       0.763

        Ratio of shelter costlincome                                                0.167

Consider the information on dwelling size in the PSID. Define, arbitrarily, excess size to be a

dwelling with a number of rooms exceeding the number of residents plus three. FIGURE 4

shows for three periods the proportion of households of each age living in dwellings of excess

size. First, note that the proportion of households in large dwellings is substantial. While this

may simply reflect tastes for consumption of housing services in a well-functioning market, it

nevertheless indicates the potential for substantial transfers of housing services to younger

families. The proportion in units of excess size increases with age. The pattern has not shifted

substantially over time.

        How pervasive is occupancy of "unaffordable" housing by the elderly? To answer this

question, we have compared income with out-of-pocket housing costs. Income is measured cur-

rent after-tax. Out-of-pocket housing costs for homeowners are the sum of utility costs, mortgage

payments, property taxes, and maintenance and insurance costs. Maintenance and insurance

costs are imputed to equal 2 percent of house value. This is based on a maintenance rate of 1.5

percent of house value, obtained from unit expenditures given in the U.S. Bureau of the Census

Construction Reports (Series C50). For renters, the housing cost variable is the sum of utility

cost and rent. Construction of these variables is detailed in the Appendix. Housing budget share

is defined as the ratio of out-of-pocket housing costs to current after-tax income. FIGURE 5

shows the average housing budget share for owners and renters in various age categories in

three periods. This figure excludes households in "other" living arrangements, and also excludes

"poverty-level" households with disposable income below $5000 in 1982 dollars. Renter budget

shares are comparable to those for owners. (Remember that these are cash flow shares, and do

not reflect capital gains to owners.) For the entire 1968-82 period, there is a decline in budget

share from the 55-64 age category to the 65-74 category, then a marginal increase to the 75+

age category. Over time, renter budget shares have been stable, while owner budget have in-

creased.

        FIGURE 6 gives the distribution of the share of out-of-pocket housing costs in income by

age bracket for homeowners and for renters. Note first that 8.8 percent of renters and 10.8 per-

cent of owners have budget shares exceeding 0.4. For owners, there are mitigating factors, in-

cluding capital gains in equity and the possibility of deferring maintenance. Nevertheless, there

is an economically significant elderly population for whom financing shelter costs from cash flow

is burdensome. Second, there is a clear pattern for owners of an increasing proportion of high-

burden households. This is not the case for renters. Third, there is no evidence of increasing

burden with age; the proportion of high-burden households in the 75+ age category is less than

that for households in the 55-65 category.

           The life-cycle theory of consumption implies that expenditures on housing services

should be determined by lifetime wealth (and life-cycle demographics) rather than by current in-

come or wealth composition, with transitory income fluctuations smoothed by asset changes.

The operation of this theory requires good capital markets, without credit rationing or wedges be-

 tween buying and selling prices for assets. In particular, for individuals whose assets are primari-

 ly an owner-occupied dwelling, life-cycle planning would often require the market to finance dis-

 saving by the elderly through borrowing secured by equity in the dwelling; e.g., reverse annuity

 mortgages. Alternatives are for the elderly to extract equity by trading-down to smaller owner-

 occupied housing, moving to a rental, or deferring maintenance and repair. On the other hand,

 bequest motives may encourage ownership as a convenient channel for holding assets.

            Using the PSID data, we have constructed a measure of wealth from age-specific in-

 come and assets, observed future wage and transfer income during the period of the panel, and

 projections of these income streams beyond the panel. The construction is detailed in the Ap-

iform pattern of mobility shifts with age within a wealth category. The figure indicates sharply

decreasing mobility with increasing wealth for renters, but relatively little effect of wealth on

owner mobility. With owners concentrated in higherwealth brackets, the mobility variation with

wealth for all households combined is a correlate of the differences of mobility between owners

and renters. To a considerable extent, tenure choice is endogenously related to the propensity

to move, with the transactions costs of ownership encouraging renting by highly mobile

households, and the lower costs of moving encouraging more frequent"fine tuning" of housing

 consumption by renters. Self-selection into the population of owners is likely to yield low-wealth

 households that have a low propensity to move. These results indicate that association of wealth

         For households with head aged 65+, FIGURE 9 shows mobility by current income and

asset class for various wealth classes. The evidence suggests no variation in mobility rates with

income or wealth composition once wealth is fixed. Thus, these data are generally consistent

         UI. SIMPLE MODELS OF ELDERLY HOUSING DYNAMICS


        In this section, we estimate simple models of a rational life-cycle household facing the

decision of whether to move, and if moving whether to "downsize" to a smaller or less expensive

dwelling. Economic theory indicates that the consumer will choose lifetime consumption profiles,

including choice of housing, by solving a dynamic programming problem to optimize an in-

tertemporal utility function subject to interlemporal budget constraints whose structure depends

on the capital market. Henderson and loannides (1984) have developed a model with this

structure; related models have been proposed by Artle and Varaiya (1978) and Hu (1980). In

principle, these models can explain joint choice of shelter consumption levels, moving, and

tenure. In practice, the models are intractable except for special cases, such as stationarity as-

sumptions that allow application of renewal theory. Consequently, these models must be used

primarily to motivate the qualitative features of empirical demand models. This problem is partic-

ularly acute when the assumption of a perfect capital market is relaxed to permit liquidity con-

straints and wedges between borrowing and lending rates.

        Consider the decision to move. The life-cycle model suggests that in each period, the

household starts from a state described by wealth (measured as the sum of home equity, other

assets, and the expected present value of future income flows), characteristics of current dwell-

ing, and demographic characteristics. For these state variables, the household calculates the

present value of remaining utility for optimal consumption plans with and without a current period

move, taking into account the cost of a move. A move is made if it yields the higher expected

utility. In a perfect capital market, the consumer's iritertemporal consumption plans, including

move decisions, depend only on total wealth, not on its composition. (We abstract from the im-

plications of portfolio composition for risk.) In particular, cash flow or holdings of liquid assets

should affect consumption decisions, once the effects of wealth are taken into account, only if

there are capital market imperfections. Capital market failure is most likely for low-income

households with limited assets other than home ownership. Welleld and Struyk (1978) have

pointed out that a significant number of elderly households below the poverty line have this

wealth configuration. The efficacy of the policy initiative to promote reverse annuity mortgages

depends on whether liquidity constraints are in fact binding on these households.

        In addition to wealth, and possibly cash flow and liquidity measures, the life-cycle model

suggests that housing choice behavior will depend on demographic characteristics of the

household, possibly interacting with features of the dwelling. Changes in household composition

that alter the need for housing services should be important, as should retirement decisions that

relax locational constraints. An interesting question for policy is whether these demographic

changes affect mobility only over a limited period of time, giving only a narrow window in which

programs to influence the destination of moves can be effective. The life-cycle model also sug-

gests that housing choices will be sensitive to prices, and in particular to the relationship between

the expected stream of net cost savings from a move compared to the direct and indirect moving

Cost. Housing prices are difficult to construct for the full panel of elderly households in the PSID,

and analysis of their effect is left for future research.

         An econometric model that captures the qualitative features of the life-cycle consumer

model can be defined in terms of the marginal probability that a household will move in a year

times the conditional probability, given a move, that various alternatives are chosen. The




                                                   —18—
marginal probability of a move is a function of the variables described above, and in general can

depend on previous state, including dwelling size, shelter expenditure, tenure, and dwelling type.

The alternatives available given a move range in principle over the lull set of features entering

the description of the households state. In particular, the set of alternatives includes both dis-

crete variables such as tenure, dwelling type, and number of rooms, and continuous variables

such as shelter expenditure. The current analysis will be limited to one aspect of dwelling choice,

an indicator for changes in shelter expenditure. This permits us to examine the phenomenon of

downsizing" to extract equity or reduce shelter cost. Other aspects of choice among housing

alternatives will be left for future research, and will examine the effects of housing prices on

choices. It will be of particular interest to estimate fully specified models for transitions between

alternative states that can be used in dynamic policy simulation of the housing behavior of the

elderly.

           In addition to dependence on demographic and housing state of mobility probabilities

and conditional probabilities for choice among housing alternatives, there may be unobserved

variations across households in tastes for moving, a mover-stayer" effect. The combination of

dependence on previous state and population heterogeneity creates the econometrically difficult

"initial values problem" discussed by Heckman (1981). In addition, statistical dependence across

states induced by the heterogeneity makes it necessary to model the probabilities of entire panel

decision sequences, which may be computationally burdensome. Further, the effect of

heterogeneity is to bias estimates of durations of spells between moves, due to seIf-selection

overtime of households more resistant to moving.

           In this paper, we do not attempt to deal with unobserved heterogeneity, and instead as-

 sume housing choice behavior can be modeled as an independent Bernoulli process over years

 (with time-dependent explanatory variables). This simplistic modeling assumption permits us to




                                                  —19—
examine some of the qualitative features predicted by the life-cycle model that are not particularly

sensitive to the time profile of mobility rates for a single household. However, it should be noted

that the resulting estimated models are likely to be badly biased for describing features that

depend critically on time dependence, such as duration of spells between moves or number of

moves. Some sense of the quality of the assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity can be ob-

tained by examining the numbers of multiple moves made in the PSID panel. FIGURE 10 com-

pares the observed number of moves with the numbers predicted by two simple models. The ob-

served counts display the classic long tail characleristic of heterogeneity. Model 1 is a

homogeneous Bernoulli model, estimated by maximum likelihood. A goodness of fit test strongly

rejects the Bernoulli model. Model 2 is a mixture of stayers and two Bernoulli populations, one

with a mobility rate of 12 percent and the second with a mobility rate of 42.4 percent, with the

mixing probabilities and mobility rates fitted by minimum chi-square. This model is accepted by a

goodness of fit test at the 95 percent significance level. This model corresponds very roughly to

a population of "owners' who are either stayers or have the 12 percent mobility rate, and a popu-

lation of "renters" with the 42.4 percent mobility rate. Neither model is a good test for unob-

served heterogeneity in the PSID sample, since variation in explanatory variables which will also

tend to produce rejections of simple Bernoulli models is not accounted for. However, the very

poor fit of Model 1, and the significant fraction of stayers in Model 2 suggest that unobserved

heterogeneity is likely to be significant. Later in this paper, we carry out a more precise Lagrange

Multiplier test for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity.

         Consider first the marginal move decision. Under the assumptions set out above, this

can be modeled as a discrete choice, independently for each household and each period of ob-

servation. We assume a probit functional form. We fit this model to the pooled PSID data, be-

ginning with lagged wealth (the household's assets as of last period) and head age as explafla-

tory variables, and then adding variables that may enter if liquidity constraints are binding or if

demographics influence consumption decisions. FIGURE 11 shows that wealth has a significant

negative effect on mobility. Mobility I ails with age of head until age 74, then increases. Mobility

is insensitive to changes in wealth.

        FIGURE 12 introduces cash flow and an indicator for liquidity to test for the significance

of capital market imperfections that introduce liquidity constraints. The new variables are LlQ-

LAG, indicating either that last period's after-tax income was above $10,000 or that non-dwelling

assets were above $20,000, in 1982 dollars, as of last period, and CASHLAG, measuring after-

tax income of the head and spouse last period, and CASHOTHERLAG, measuring after-tax in-

come of other household members last period (These variables are lagged, as is the wealth vari-

able, to avoid simultaneity biases in estimation.). The LIQLAG variable is found to have a sig-

nit cant effect on mobility rates, with mobility falling for liquid households; CASHLAG and

CASHOTHERLAG are insignificant. This provides mixed evidence that capital market imperfec-

lions may be a quantitatively significant constraint on behavior in the elderly population. How-

ever, there is some confounding of the effects of liquidity when owners and renters who face dif-

ferent moving costs are pooled. If liquidity is positively associated with ownership, and hence

lower mobility due to higher moving costs, then LIOLAG will display a negative coefficient for this

reason, and may not represent capital market imperfections. A significant liquidity effect for

owners or renters separately would be stronger evidence for capital market problems.

age are significant, as are LIOLAG and CASHLAG. The demographic shocks of a wife disap-

pearing or individuals moving into the household significantly increase mobility, as does a

decrease in the number of children living at home. Positive values of the variable MOVEOUT

usually occur because the husband disappears, the wife is gone, or a child moves out. Since the

latter two events are captured by the WIFEGONE and DELCHILDREN variables, the coefficient

on MOVEOUT primarily reflects the event of the husband disappearing. This event also in-

creases mobility, but not significantly.

        Merrill (1982) found that the event of retiring had a significant effect on mobility in the

Retirement History Survey, with a peak several years alter retirement. FIGURE 13 includes

dummy variables indicating whether the head or the wife have retired within the past three years.

Both husband and wife retirement dummies are found to significantly increase mobility. Hence,

there appears to be a window of relatively high mobility for several years after retirement, as

households optimize after being freed of the locational constraints imposed by workplace.

         The preceding models do not distinguish tenure state as a factor influencing mobility.

Since moving costs are considerably higher for owners than for renters, one expects the former

group to have lower transition probabilities. FIGURE 14 shows the basic model of mobility de-

pendence on head age and wealth, estimated separately for owners and for renters. In these

models, head age remains significant for owners, with mobility minimized at age 70. For renters,

mobility declines (insignificantly) until age 83. Wealth is not significant for either owners or

renters. Of course, this does not indicate wealth has an insignificant effect on the dynamics of

rental housing demand, since tenure choice is endogenous, and wealth is likely to strongly in-

fluence tenure choice conditioned on moves. The variables CASHLAG, LIOLAG, and

CASHOTHERLAG measuring liquidity are found to be insignificant for both owners and renters.

This supports the view that the significance found in FIGURE 13 for these variables is due to

their correlation with moving costs through the association of liquidity and ownership. While this

conclusion should be interpreted with caution in light of the issues of endogeniCityof tenure

choice and population heterogeneity, it has a potentially important policy implication that pro-

grams such as reverse annuity mortgages designed to allow the elderly to extract equity from

their homes are unlikely to be utilized by most of the elderly population.

        FIGURE 15 estimates separately for owners arid renters the model including family com-

position effects. The pattern of effects is similar to that observed in FIGURE 13 estimated on

owners and renters together, except that wealth and cash flow effects areboth insignificant. The

effects of family composition change are similar for owners and renters.

         Estimates of tenure choice of movers are given separately in FIGURE 16 for previous

owners and for previous renters. The effect of liquidity constraints or low cash income is to dis-

courage ownership, but the effects are statistically insignificant. Increasing wealth increases

 ownership for both previous owners and renters, as does a family composition change increasing

 household size. Retirement of the head significantly discourages ownership by previous owners.

         Next consider the conditional probability of changing consumption of housing services,

 given a move. We consider first a categorical variable (RECOST) that indicates whether ex-

 penditures on shelter falls more than 5 percent (-1) or not (0). FIGURE 17 gives the results of

 estimation, separately for owners arid renters. Wealth has a weak positive effect on maintaining

 expenditures by owners. The variable LIOLAG has a significant negative effect among renters,

 and both LIOLAG and CASHLAG are insignificant amongst owners. Head age is statistically in-

 significant, as are the family composition variables.

          Second, consider the conditional probability of reducing dwelling size, measured relative

 to family size, given a move. The dependent variable (DEXSIZE) is categorical, indicating

 whether number of rooms minus family size falls with the move (-1) or not (0). FIGURE 18 gives

nit icarit for both owners and renters, while the retirement dummies are insignificant. Among the

lagged liquidity variables, LIGLAG is positive and significant among owners and insignificant

among renters, while CASHLAG is insignificant.

        Finally, consider changes in equity given a move. We consider a categorical variable

(DEQUITY) that indicates whether equity falls (-1) or not (0). Figure 19 gives the estimation

results for owners. Wealth is again insignificant; the estimates indicate no significant effect of li-

quidity, suggesting either that most owners have sufficient cash flow or liquid assets to make ex-

traction of equity unnecessary, or else that existing capital markets provide adequate op-

portunities for extracting equity. Demographic and retirement variables are insignificant.




IV. TEST FOR UNOBSERVED HETEROGENEITY



         As mentioned above, all of the models in this paper have been estimated under the as-

sumption that there are no unobserved household effects. If such effects are present, they in-

validate our assumption that the conditional probability of a household moving in any particular

year is independent of that household's prior mobility decisions (though it may depend upon pre-

vious year household characteristics through time-dependent explanatory variables). Since

 estimating models which allow for unobserved household effects is quite complicated and com-

 puter intensive, we have developed a Lagrange Multiplier test for the presence of unobservedef-

 fects which is based upon the estimates derived from models which assume no such effects. We

 assume a random effects formulation in which the probability of a move may be written:




                                                   —34—
           F(Xtnb + zag)


        where Xtfl is the vector of time-dependent explanatory variables for household n in period

I, Zn S the household effect, assumed to be drawn from an arbitrary distribution q(z) which has

mean 0 and finite variance, and g measures the impact of the household effect on the

households mobility decision. The null hypothesis is that g equals zero, and it is assumed that

the vector b has been previously estimated under this assumption as in the last section, figures

11-15). Next we construct a test statistic for the hypothesis that g is zero. The derviation, which

is presented in McFadden and Feinstein (1987), is complicated by the tact that the score for g is

singular at the value g equal to zero (due to the fact that the distribution q(z) is mean zero), an

issue which has been previously discussed by Breusch-Pagan (1980), Chesher (1984), and Lee

and Chesher (1986) in other contexts. The appropriate test is therefore based on the second

derivative of the log likelihood function. The test statistic is:


         LM2 = [(1/sqrt(N)) lm] 2 / [CN - BN'AN1BNJ

         lmn        atndtnhtnmtn +       dtndsnhtnhsnrfltnmsn

               = xinb

           dtn = 1 is the household moves, -1 if not

           htn = f(dtn(xtnb))/F(dtn(Xtnb))

           mtn = I is data is present, 0 it it is missing

                                                   —35—
        where there are N individuals (1131 in our case) and T time periods (15 in our case).

LM2 is asymptotically distributed as chi-squared with 1 degree of freedom.

           We have calculated LM2 for the model of figure 13. The calculated value far exceeds

the 5% critical value and decisively rejects the null of no heterogeneity. This finding indicates

that future efforts to model elderly mobility must come to grips with the statistical issues involved

in estimating models which allow for household effects.




V. CONCLUSIONS


        This paper has given a preliminary analysis of the effects of wealth, cash flow, and

demographic shocks on decisions of the elderly on whether to move, whether to adjust housing

consumption up or down when moving, and whether to extract equity when moving from an

owner-occupied dwelling. The analysis of price effects has been left for future research. The

current paper makes the simplistic assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity. Consequently,

the resulting models are unlikely to be reliable predictors of the life-cycle dynamics of mobility of

the elderly. In particular, the models are unlikely to predict accurately the number of moves or

the durations of spells between moves for households observed through time. However, it is

more reasonable to use these models to draw conclusions on the qualitative impacts of wealth,

cash flow, and demographic shocks on mobility and housing consumption levels.

        The models suggest that with the possible exception of downsizing decisions by renters,

conditioned on a decision to move, there is no evidence that housing choice behavior is affected

by capital market imperfections. Wealth has a generally strong effect on housing choices, as

predicted by the life-cycle model. Mobility and consumption level decisions are both strongly in-




                                                 —36—
fluenced by some demographic shocks, notably recent retirement or changes in household size

or composition (disappearance of husband or wife).

        To assess some of the policy implications of our results, we have calculated the changes

in mobility rates associated with changes in various explanatory variables. FIGURE 20 shows

mobility rates by age of head for the model given in FIGURE 13, with all other explanatory vari-

ables set to sample means. (Note that this is not the same as calculating the sample average of

the individual household probabilities, with ages varied parametrically and remaining variables

set to actual values for the household, since the probit model is non-linear.) Mobility falls with

age until age 72, and then rises slightly.

        FIGURE 21 shows the effects on mobility of different wealth levels, and of demographic

shocks. These calculations again use the model in FIGURE 13, and set all remaining variables

to sample means. The demographic shocks of disappearance of the wife or individuals moving

into the household have a substantial effect on mobility, as does recent retirement. The other

demographic variables, changes in number of children and persons moving out, have modestef-

fects. While wealth is an important determinant of mobility, small changes in wealth have small

mobility effects.

        In summary, we conclude from the analysis of housing behavior of the elderly completed

to date that this population group does not appear to be substantially disadvantaged by capital

market imperfections that limit the ability to extract equity or dissave, and that mobility is strongly

concentrated in windows opened by demographic shocks, particularly recent retirement, or

 recent changes in family composition.

         This paper is an initial progress report in a multi-year program of research into the

dynamics of housing behavior of the elderly. Future research plans can be divided into exten-

sions of the simple mobility and housing consumption level models described above to incor-

porate population heterogeneity and model other aspects of choice of housing state, and exten-

sions to incorporate the effects of price and health.

         Extensions of the analysis of the effects of wealth, demographics, and liquidity will con-

centrate, first, on removing the assumption of unobserved population homogeneity. Parametric

and 'non-parametric" models with heterogeneity will be estimated. To manage the computational

problems, McFadden's method of simulated moments estimation will be used. We do not have a

fully satisfactory method for handling the initial values problem when both unobserved

heterogeneity and state dependence are present, but propose to employ a non-parametric

("flexible") estimator for the initial value distribution, with dimensionality restricted by plausible

conditional independence assumptions.

        A second part of these extensions will concentrate on refining the explanatory variables,

particularly the lag structure of demographic shocks, the description of the housing state, and

nonlinearities in the effects of wealth and wealth composition. The third part will concentrate on

developing a complete transition model between housing states, including tenure choice and

housing consumption level, measured by real expenditure and dwelling size. These extensions

will be limited by the PSID data.

        The final area of future research will concentrate on the effects of housing prices and on

the effects of health. The PSID does not provide adequate information to construct housing

prices. Henderson and laorinides (1984) confine attention to PSID households living in identi-

fiable SMSAs, and use Annual Housing Survey data to calculate housing prices in these loca-

tions. We have not done this because it would substantially reduce the smaller sample of elderly




                                                   —40—
households, and will instead use hedonic price equations estimated from Annual Housing Survey

data. Health status is also poorly measured in the PSID. We will attempt to use limited data on

hospftalization, which is available in only one year, and self-rated level of disability.

                                       Description of the Data

         Our primary data source is waves one through fifteen of the PSID study, comprising
 years 1968 through 1982. We restrict ourselves to elderly households, defined as those
 households which satisfy at least one of the following criteria:

              (1) The head of household, his "wife" (a term which refers to both wives by mar-
              riage and cohabitors), or both are aged 50 or above in 1968.

              (2) The identity of the head of household, the 'wife, or both changes during the
              years 1969-82, and the new head, wife, or both, were aged 50 or above in 1968.

          1901 households fulfill at least one of these criteria. Of these, 770 are splitoffs', and
most of these splitoff s refer to young persons who leave a family in which the parents satisfy one
of criteria (1) or (2): 668 refer to households for whom, once the splitoff occurs, the new head is
aged 30 or less, and another 60 to households whose new head is aged 30 to 50. We eliminate
all splitoffs, which leaves us with 1131 observations.

       The PSID variables which we use are listed in Table Al, identified by their 1983 PSID
code number; the variables' means as of 1983 are also listed.

        We have used the PSID variables to construct a number of additional variables, which
we now describe. An important variable in our models is the present discounted value of
household wealth, which is our measure of permanent income. Set PERMI,t to be household i's
present discounted wealth as of year t, t=1 968,...,1 982. PERMit is defined to be:

                                 1982
                                                         +   Y2is)/DISCOUNT(t,s)
                                             (Y11,5
                                   s=t

                         1988
                  +                                 +
                      s=1983
                                  (Y1PROJi,s            Y2PROJ±,s)/DISc0UNT(t,s)

                  +    ASSETIt           +   EQUITYit

where the first term refers to the future horizon up to the end of the PSID data, 1982, the second
term refers to an extension of the household's horizon to 1988, using projections based on the
PSID of earlier years, and the last two terms to the household's financial assets and home equity
in year t. Yl and Yl PROJ refer to the household head, and Y2 and Y2PROJ to his "wife" (if




                                             —44—
there is no wife Y2 and Y2PROJ are zero). Y1 and Y2s are constructed as follows. If the
head is working in years (5 < 1983), Y115 is his wage income; similarly for Y2i5. If both head
and wife are retired, Yl ,s and 2i,s each equal one half of the household's total retirement in-
come, If the head is working and the wife is retired, Yl i,s is the head's wage income and Y215 is
the household's total retirement income; similarly if the head is retired and the wife working.
Yl PROJs and Y2PROJi,s are constructed as follows. If the head retires prior to 1982,
Vi PROJi is his retirement income as of 1982; and similarly for the wife (if both are retired each
of these is one half of total retirement income as of 1982). If the head has not retired as of 1982,
he is assumed to retire at age 70, or, if above age 70 as of 1983, at 1983. Until age 70,
Y1PROJ1,s is equal to his wage income as of 1982; after age 70, Y1PROJ1s is 0.35 of his wage
income. Similarly for the wife.
          To construct a measure of financial assets, ASSETi,t, we add up the separate asset in-
come measures for business income, farm income, garden income, roomer income, and interest,
dividends and rental income provided by the PSID, and divide by year t's treasury bill rate
(described below), which provides a measure of the wealth generating the year t asset income.
EQUITVj,t is just house value minus the outstanding mortgage.
          Finally, DISCOUNT(t,s) is the discount rate: for s < 1983, it is the nominal rate on trea-
sury bills, while for s> 1983, it is the nominal t-bill rate minus the consumer price index (to allow
for the fact that real income post 1982 is in 1982 dollars). Some ambiguity attaches to the choice
of DISCOUNT, as arguments can be made for choosing it to be the real rather than the nominal
 rate; however, we have felt that the majority of non-wage income is likely to derive from bank ac-
counts, in which case the nominal rate is appropriate. [Source for these numbers is the DRI publi-
cation Review of the US Economy.]
          Our measure of cash flow income, CASHIt, is defined to be: the household's gross year
   income, which includes husband and wife's taxable income, the taxable income of other
 household members, husband and wife's transfer income, the transfer income of other household
 members, husband and wife's social security income, and the social security income of other
 household members; minus the husband and wife's federal taxes, and the federal taxes of other
 household members.
          The share of cash flow income devoted to shelter costs is defined as follows. Shelter
 costs are the sum of property taxes, mortgage payments, utilities, 2% of the house value (for
 maintenance) [Source for this value is the U.S. Statistical Abstract], and rent. The share of cash
 flow is then simply this sum divided by CASHt.
