Medicare Part D's Effects on Elderly Drug Costs and Utilization

NBER Working Paper No. 14326

JEL No. H42,I11,I18

                                               ABSTRACT

We analyze Medicare Part D’s net effect on elderly out-of-pocket (OOP) costs and use of prescription
drugs using a dataset containing 1.4 billion prescription records from Wolters Kluwer Health (WKH).
These data span the period December 2004-December 2007 and include pharmacy customers whose
age as of 2007 is greater than 57 years. The outcomes we examine are OOP cost per day’s supply of
a medication, the days of medication supplied per capita, and the number of individuals filling prescriptions.
We compare outcomes before vs. after January 2006, for those over age 66 years vs. for those age
58-64 years, adjusting for the under-reporting of certain cash-only transactions in the WKH data. Our
results indicate that from 2005-2007, Part D reduced elderly OOP costs per day’s supply of medication
by 21.7%, and increased elderly use of prescription drugs by 4.7%, implying a price elasticity of demand
of -0.22. These effects occurred primarily during the first year of the program. An age- and time-standardized
comparison of our quantity results with previous estimates from Walgreens data shows that our findings
are 2.6 times as large. We conclude that Part D lowered elderly patients’ OOP costs substantially and
increased utilization modestly, and note that in comparing results across studies on this topic, magnitudes
may vary substantially due to differences in data and methods.

       After Medicare Part D was implemented in January, 2006 it covered 53 percent of

the elderly by mid-20061 and 54 percent of the elderly by January 2007.2 Despite

substantial interest from policymakers and researchers alike, few large scale studies of its

effects exist. In this paper we utilize a nationwide sample of prescriptions filled from

December, 2004 through December, 2007 to consider how prescription drug utilization

and out-of-pocket costs changed for the elderly relative to the near elderly during the first

and the second year of Medicare Part D. By using all elderly as the treatment group, we

study the aggregate impact caused by Part D. This captures the direct effects experienced

by those who added Part D as new coverage, substitution effects for those for whom Part

D replaced other coverage and indirect effects for those not on Part D but whose

coverage was affected by Part D’s existence. Studying the aggregate effect is also the

same approach adopted by the two existing peer-reviewed studies. Both prior studies

used data from a single pharmacy chain (Walgreens.)3 Yin et al. (2008) used data

covering September 2004-April 2007 for those aged 66 to 79 years, and use the

experience of those aged 60-63 as a control group.4 They find that Part D increased use of

medications by 1.1 percent and OOP costs fell by 8.8 percent during the initial open

enrollment period (January-May 2006.) During the following 11 months (June 2006-

April 2007), they found that utilization increased 5.7 percent and OOP costs decreased by

13.1 percent. Lichtenberg and Sun (2007) also used Walgreens data to compare drug use

among those aged 65 and over to those aged under 65 from September 2004 to December

2006;5 they find an increase of 12.8 percent in quantity and a 18.4 percent reduction in

out of pocket costs. In this paper we reconcile the seemingly disparate findings from




                                              2
these two studies and compare them with our own results, paying attention to the various

strengths and weaknesses of each data source and method.

       Studies on the effect of Part D on access to medications have also been conducted

with survey data. Levy and Weir (2008) used the Health and Retirement Study and found

that although there was substantial take-up of Part D by the uninsured, prescription

consumption did not appear to increase.6 Neuman et al. (2007) conducted a survey of

Medicare beneficiaries in Fall 2006 and report that relative to employer coverage, out of

pocket costs are higher under Part D.7 Prior to the implementation of Part D, Pauly

(2004)8 forecasted that Part D would reduce elderly patients’ OOP costs by 14 percent

overall, by halving costs for the 25 percent who were uninsured. Using a 0.4 price

elasticity of demand measure, he estimated a 6 percent increase in utilization as a result

of Part D. In discussing our results, we compare magnitudes and implied elasticities with

Pauly’s assumptions and predictions.

Data

       We analyze a large data set of prescriptions covering the period December, 2004

through December, 2007 from Wolters Kluwer Health’s (WKH) “Source Lx” database.

Our dataset is comprised of 1,417,366,769 prescriptions filled by 34,198,008 unique

patients, whose age as of 2007 is 58 years or above. McKesson Corporation (formerly

Per-Se Technologies, and NDCHealth before that) collects these data primarily from their

switches that transmit electronic claims between pharmacies and third parties (e.g.,

insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers) that help pay for prescriptions.

Source Lx covers all 50 states and includes approximately 31 percent of the nation’s

prescriptions, filled at approximately 32,000 pharmacies (not restricted to any particular




                                             3
pharmacy chains), including retail, mail order, and hospital pharmacies and other

institutions that fill prescriptions such as long term care facilities.9 The dataset includes

prescription-fill level information on patient age, out-of-pocket costs vs. third party

payment amounts, number of days’ supply, the pharmacy’s ZIP Code, pharmacy type,

and an encrypted patient identifier that can track usage over time. Descriptive statistics

are provided in Appendix 1.

Methods

       We first present nationwide difference-in-difference (DD) comparisons of the

aggregate change from January, 2005 to December, 2007 comparing two consistent

cohorts: a group who are always age-eligible for Medicare since January, 2006 (over 66

years as of 2007) vs. a group who are always age-ineligible for Medicare (age 58-64 as of

2007).10 The use of a control group is important to separate Part D’s effects from the

effect of other factors that changed over time. For example, several large products such as

Zoloft lost patent protection in 2006. To the extent that the near elderly also experienced

the effects of these other changes, our method identifies Part D’s effects better than a

simple comparison of 2005 and 2006 among the elderly. In addition to showing the

aggregate effects of part D for the first and second years of the programs, we also report

monthly estimates to consider how Medicare’s effects varied during the initial open

enrollment and transition period in early 2006, early in the calendar years before patients

had met their deductibles, and later in the year when some entered the donut hole. To

justify the use of our control group, we used data prior to the implementation of Part D to

validate the underlying assumption that the pre-part D time trend did not significantly

differ between the two age groups.




                                              4
       We present results for three main outcomes: days’ supply, number of patients

filling prescriptions, and patient OOP costs per prescription. We also analyzed total

prescriptions filled, but we do not report it separately because the results were virtually

identical to those for days supply. Because our two utilization outcomes (days supply and

number of patients with prescriptions filled) are compared in terms of totals for the two

cohorts over time, we must adjust for different rates of mortality for the two cohorts or

we could find relative decreases in total use occurring for the older cohort simply due to

more deaths. To do this, we normalize our totals by the size of the national population

estimated or projected by the US Census Bureau for each cohort at each point in time and

report per capita changes.11,12 We report the percent changes over time in three outcomes

to calculate the DD impact of Medicare Part D.

       Part D can affect elderly patients’ net prescription drug utilization through several

pathways. First, Part D enrolled some elderly who previously lacked drug coverage;

assuming non-zero price elasticity of demand, new coverage would increase the quantity

of drugs consumed through lower OOP costs. To examine this extensive margin, we

report changes in the number of elderly filling any prescription before and after January

2006. Utilization could have also increased at the intensive margin for those previously

covered if their coverage under Part D is more generous than their previous coverage, for

example due to lower patient OOP costs or fewer supply-side restrictions such as prior

authorization requirements. Conversely, net utilization could have decreased if prior

coverage was more generous than Part D or if employers responded to Part D’s

introduction by reducing the generosity of retiree coverage.




                                              5
       Certain features of our data set pose hurdles to estimating the impact of Part D on

elderly use of prescription drugs and need to be explained upfront. For one, our data

largely but not exclusively track the same pharmacies over time. This unbalanced panel

nature could bias our results if the pharmacies that enter or leave the data cater to one of

the age cohorts disproportionally. To address this concern, we test the robustness of our

results on a panel of retail pharmacies that consistently reported data during our study

period. These include 77.4 percent of the total days supply in the full dataset.

       The next three features of our data create biases with predictable signs for our

utilization estimates. First, our data under-report “pure cash” transactions (where there is

no third party to receive a claim), since they represent only 3.7 percent of our

prescriptions but are thought to comprise approximately 12 percent of nationwide

prescriptions for our age groups.13 Cash transactions for purchasers with drug discount

cards, claims filled before deductibles were met, and rejected claims by insured people

for uninsured (off-formulary) drugs are not subject to this under-reporting issue. This

under-representation of pure cash transactions could cause us to overestimate the effects

of Part D to the extent Part D disproportionately shifted elderly patients’ 2005 cash pay

purchases not observed in our data to insured purchases observed in our data in 2006 and

2007. Second, mail order pharmacies are under-represented in the WKH data; they

represent 2.1 percent of scripts in our data while they are 13.8 percent for all ages

nationwide in 2007.14 This would cause us to underestimate Part D’s utilization effects if

it disproportionately increased elderly patients’ use of mail order pharmacies. Third,

prescription sales data omit free samples by definition, causing an overestimate in Part

D’s effects on actual drug utilization if Part D caused free sampling to decrease. Thus,




                                              6
there are three sources of drug procurement that are under-reported or absent in these data

(pure cash, mail order and free samples) that may have systematically changed as a result

of Part D, causing us to over- or under-estimate the true impact of Part D on the actual

quantity of medications used by seniors.

       To correct the bias due to missing pure cash prescriptions, we used age and year-

specific estimates of the fraction of prescriptions filled that were pure cash when

prescriptions with all payment sources are fully represented, as reported by Wolters

Kluwer Health from other datasets.15 Comparing the two numbers tells us by how much

we need to multiply the volume of pure cash observed in our data to make up for the

fraction that we are missing. We perform this correction for quantity of days supply for

each age cohort and year. Likewise, we adjust our estimated effects on overall OOP cost

by adding in the missing pure cash observations. In so doing, we assume that the average

prices of missing pure cash transactions are similar to the average prices of the observed

pure cash transactions, i.e. that the missing transactions are missing at random.

Unfortunately, age-specific data on mail order use are not available to implement a

similar correction for their under-representation. In the discussion section we present

some evidence that this might not bias our results because the available data suggest that

mail order did not change systematically over time.

       Finally, we compared our corrected results with prior estimates of the first year

utilization effect from Walgreens data. Compared to WKH Source Lx, Walgreens data

have advantages and disadvantages. Walgreens data fully report their pure cash

prescriptions, but their disadvantages include:




                                             7
       (i)Walgreens does not randomly locate its stores, so their records are not likely to

be representative of the entire population of US elderly. While our data contain

pharmacies from more than 80 percent of US counties, Walgreens pharmacies are located

only in about 30 percent of US counties,16 and Part D’s effects could have differed in

those areas. For example, the results would be an underestimate if the locations of

Walgreens are skewed towards areas where the elderly had more generous coverage prior

to 2006.

       (ii) Walgreens implemented marketing efforts to take advantage of Part D’s

availability and anticipated large increases in their sales to the elderly by attracting

customers away from other pharmacies.17,18 There is also evidence that the pharmacy

benefits management arm, Walgreens Health Services may have played a role in

channeling patients into Walgreens pharmacies.19,20 If these activities caused customers

to switch away from other pharmacies to Walgreens after the implementation of Part D,

the existing results overestimates the general increase in utilization among the elderly due

to Part D.

       (iii) Finally, Part D might have altered the extent to which elderly patients use

multiple pharmacies, and this could create unpredictable effects on estimates using only

data from Walgreens.

       We replicated our analysis limiting our sample to just the ZIP Codes that include

Walgreens pharmacies to understand how the first factor may affect a comparison

between our results and Walgreens results.21 We also standardized the estimates (by

using comparable age groups and time frames) from the two existing Walgreens studies

to compare with similarly-standardized estimates from the WKH data.




                                               8
Results

        Table 1 reports descriptive nationwide DD results for the total days of medication

supplied, reported on a per capita basis to adjust for mortality differences between control

and treatment groups over time. Table 1 estimates were not adjusted for under-reported

pure cash claims. To assess whether the unbalanced pharmacy panel nature of our data

set affects our results, Section A presents the nationwide results, while Section B is

restricted to the set of consistently-represented retail pharmacies. The results for elderly

patients’ quantity of days supply in 2006 show an increase of 8.10 percent over the 2005

level relative to the change for the near-elderly. Results from the consistent panel of retail

pharmacies in Section B are similar but slightly smaller. The changes from 2006 to 2007

are much smaller; the relative increases in elderly patients’ utilization is in the range 1.0-

1.4 percent. Comparing 2007 with 2005, the results indicate that elderly patients’ use was

9.0 to 9.6 percent higher in 2007 than 2005, depending on whether we use all pharmacies

or just the subset of those consistently reporting data to WKH.

        In Table 2 we report changes in the number of elderly filling any prescription (as

a percent of the population) and elderly patients’ average OOP per day’s supply relative

to the near elderly. Looking first at the top half of the table, we see that there is a 4.8

percent relative increase in the number of distinct elderly individuals filling any

prescription in the first year of the program. This increase in number of prescription

recipients is almost two thirds of the magnitude of the increase we observed for days

supply, suggesting that a substantial share of Part D’s benefits in its first year accrued at

the extensive margin to those previously not filling prescriptions. However, this




                                               9
represents an overestimate of the number of new individuals filling prescriptions if Part D

caused relative reductions in pure cash claims among elderly patients as indicated by the

ancillary data provided by WKH. This results because it includes both those who did not

use any prescriptions in 2005 but did do so in 2006 due to the availability of Part D

coverage, as well as those who previously filled only pure cash prescriptions that were

not reported in our data. In the second year of the program, we actually see a small (1.4

percent) relative reduction in the number of elderly filling prescriptions,22 although the

overall change from 2005-2007 remained above 3 percent.

       The results in the bottom half Table 2 indicate that between 2005 and 2006,

elderly patients’ OOP costs decreased both absolutely and relatively (15.8 and 17.2

percent, respectively), with the implied price elasticity of demand being 0.47. Between

2006 and 2007, the change in OOP prices was an additional 5.8 percent relative

reduction. The change from 2005-2007 implies a price elasticity of 0.44, although the

change from 2006-2007 alone suggests an elasticity of only 0.24. This could have

happened if, for example, there had been a relative increase in supply-side controls

between 2006 and 2007 among drug insurance plans that cover elderly patients.

       The results above tell us how changes occurred from one year to the next. To

study the pattern of changes over time within the year, we report the total days’ supply in

the Figure 1a and the average OOP cost per days’ supply by month for each age cohort in

Figure 1b. January was typically the calendar month with the highest use among elderly

patients, resulting in the largest differences between them and the near elderly. The

difference increased at the onset of Part D and continued to rise through the initial open

enrollment period. For the rest of 2006 and 2007, these initial gains were sustained but




                                             10
with little additional increase. In the latter months of both 2006 and 2007, elderly

patients’ relative utilization decreased somewhat, which is consistent with some entering

the donut hole and reducing their purchases. However, this pattern is evident to a lesser

degree in 2004 as well. The overall trend in Figure 1b shows that elderly patients’ OOP

costs exceeded those of the near elderly prior to Part D but immediately became lower

when Part D was implemented and remained lower for the rest of our study period.

Figure 1B shows increases in elderly patients’ OOP costs for August-November 2006 and

for May-October 2007,23 consistent with the approximate timing of the donut hole. The

figure also shows increases in OOP costs early in the year when spending for elderly and

near elderly are likely to be under the plan deductible.

        In Table 3 we report the utilization and OOP cost results with the correction for

the under-representation of pure cash claims as described in the methods section. The

corrected increase in days supply is virtually identical to the unadjusted results for 2006

(8.1 percent) but decreased by 3.5 percent from 2006 to 2007. The relative changes in

out-of-pocket costs are smaller for 2006 (15.6 percent) but larger in 2007 (7.2 percent),

with a reduction from 2005-2007 virtually identical to the uncorrected results (21.7

percent.) The implied elasticity estimates are -0.52 for 2005-2006 and -0.22 for 2005-

2007.

        We compared our corrected 2006 utilization results with those from other studies,

after we first reconciled the two Walgreens studies with each other. Table 4 presents a

summary. Yin et al. found a 1.1 percent increase in days’ supply of those age 66 to 79

relative to those age 60-63 during open enrollment (January-May, 2006), and a 5.9

percent increase during June 2006-April 2007, for a weighted average after Part D of 4.4




                                             11
percent and a weighted average for 2006 of 3.9 percent (assuming the effects were equal

across months.) Lichtenberg and Sun reported a gain in 2006 of 12.8 percent relative to

those age 18-64. However, using the results for the increases by each age group reported

in Lichtenberg and Sun’s working paper Figure 4,24 and weighting by the US population

in each age group,25 we estimate that they would have found an increase of 3.7 percent if

they conducted the comparison implemented by Yin et al. Thus, an important observation

is that the two Walgreens results are virtually identical once the comparison is

standardized, despite different empirical methods. We cannot generate perfectly-

comparable results from our data because they begin in December rather than September

of 2004 and because WKH does not identify specific ages of the oldest patients to

preserve their anonymity. Thus we generated the DD comparison of the changes among

those age 60-63 vs. 66-77 in 2006 from the pre-Part D time period of December, 2004

through December, 2005 to all of 2006. As before, we adjust for changes in population

size and report utilization per capita. This exercise yielded a relative increase of 10.0

percent when not adjusting for under-reported pure cash prescriptions and 9.8 percent

when the adjustment was made. These are 2.6 times larger than the increase estimated

from Walgreens data. As an additional comparison, in Table 1 Section C we report

changes from the WKH data in ZIP Codes with Walgreens. The results are smaller than

our nationwide results. These results suggest that the estimates from Walgreens data

could be smaller than our results due to Walgreens store locations.



Discussion




                                             12
       After the implementation of Medicare Part D in January, 2006 elderly patients’

prescription drug utilization increased and out-of-pocket costs decreased substantially

relative to the near elderly. Studying 2005-2007 data without adjusting for the under-

reporting of pure cash prescriptions, we found that out-of-pocket costs experienced a 21.7

percent relative decrease while utilization experienced a relative increase of 9.0 percent.

A large majority of these changes occurred from 2005-2006. Because the number of

elderly filling prescriptions also grew during this time, these effects appear to result from

increased access by both the newly insured and by those previously covered. Adjusting

for the under-reporting of pure cash prescriptions yielded very similar results, with the

only notable difference occurring for the changes from 2006-2007. This is likely due to

changes in the pricing of generics at the pharmacies that reported all of their pure cash

claims to WKH. Our estimated increases in days supply for 2005-2006 are 2.6 times

larger than the most comparable results using Walgreens-only data. This is somewhat

surprising given Walgreens’ reported intentions to grow their Part D sales by attracting

elderly patients from other pharmacies. The differences might result from limitations in

either data source, the slight differences in the comparisons performed (age groups and

time periods, or our inclusion of other types of pharmacies), or methods (e.g. Lichtenberg

and Sun’s lack of adjustments for mortality rate differences, and the restriction by Yin et

al. to patients filling prescriptions at Walgreens in both years.) Both datasets share

several notable shortcomings as well. Both under-represent mail-order pharmacies, which

cause underestimates of Part D if it increased elderly patients’ use of mail order more

than the near elderly. Both also exclude free samples, which would cause overestimates

of the impact on actual procurement of prescription drugs if free samples were crowded




                                             13
out by Part D. While there are no studies that estimate how much mail order or free

sample volumes have changed over the last few years for elderly patients specifically, the

overall trends in both measures suggest that neither of these biased our estimates much.

The share of total days supply filled by mail order increased minimally, from 13.5

percent in 2005 to 13.8 percent in 2007.26 Similarly, Verispan data indicates that free

samples increased by 4 percent in both 2006 and 2007, well above the increases of 1

percent from 2003-04 and 2 percent from 2004-05.27

       Our results capture Part D’s net, aggregate effects on elderly patients, regardless

of whether they took up the new coverage or not. This is important to understanding the

efficiency of government expenditures on Part D. Part D could also have important

implications for equity given the pre-existing disparities in access to medical care under

Medicare and the specific policy goal of improving access among patients with lower

socioeconomic status.28,29,30 Part D has other potential benefits and costs that we have not

attempted to measure in this paper. These include spillovers of higher quantity or quality

prescription drug use to expenditures for other types of medical care,31,32 enhanced

wellbeing of elderly patients due to the insurance value of prescription drug coverage,

altered drug prices paid by other US consumers, and changed incentives to produce new

drugs.33,34 All of the possible net benefits must be weighed against the out of pocket costs

and the opportunity cost of the taxpayer’s bill for Part D to determine the economic

efficiency of this new government program.

     When age is mentioned here and elsewhere in the paper, we refer to a patient’s age as

of 2007. Note that our treatment group (age 67 and up) is always Part D eligible since

they turned 65 in the year before the program was implemented. Our control group (age

64 and under) are always under age 65 during the time period of our study. Our data

include the patients’ birth year but not month, so we exclude those who turned 65 during

either 2006 or 2007. Because a small fraction of elderly are not Medicare-eligible and

some under 65 are, our treatment-control group definitions may cause small

underestimates of the effects of Part D. See Lichtenberg FR, Sun SX. The Impact of

Medicare Part D on prescription drug use by the elderly. Health Aff. 2007;6:1735-1744.

     These other data are from pharmacies that report all transactions. However, these

pharmacies likely have higher proportion of pure cash than other pharmacies, so that

these corrected results rely on an upper bound estimate of the extent of pure cash while

our uncorrected results rely on a lower bound estimate.

     These ZIP Codes were provided by the National Council for Prescription Drug

Programs (NCPDP) The NCPDP assigns a Provider Identification Number to every

licensed pharmacy in the US. See http://www.ncpdp.org/provider.asp. There are some

ZIP Codes we are not able to identify precisely; to preserve pharmacy anonymity in the

WKH data, each identifiable geographic unit includes at least three pharmacies. Those

“pseudoZIPs” that, when aggregated, included at least three.

     We find this despite the fact our results are adjusted for mortality differences between

elderly and near elderly, because we divide by the estimated population.

with age defined as of 2007. These absolute values are underestimates because the WKH data cover
approximately 31% of prescriptions.

* Our estimated changes are per capita to net out changes due to mortality. Our estimates are for those age 60-63 vs. 66-77
because Wolters Kluwer Health does not identify exact ages for the oldest patients to preserve their anonymity. Also our
baseline time period begins in December rather than September of 2004.
