      The    dynamic       effects       of    aggregate        demand     on    output   and

inflation remain a theoretical puzzle for macroeconomists.                                 In

recent years, much of the literature on this topic has used a

model of time-contingent price adjustment.                            This model, often

called "the new Keynesian Phillips curve," builds on the work of

John Taylor (1980), Julio Rotemberg (1982), and Guillermo Calvo

(1983).      As the recent survey by Richard Clarida, Jordi Gali, and
Mark Gertler (1999) illustrates, this model is widely used in

theoretical analysis of monetary policy.                        Bennett McCallum (1997)

has   called       it    "the     closest       thing    there       is    to    a    standard

specification."

      Yet there is growing awareness that this model is hard to

square with the facts.            Laurence Ball (1994a) shows that the model

yields       the        surprising         result       that        announced,        credible

disinflations cause booms rather than recessions.                           Jeffrey Fuhrer

and George Moore (1995) argue that it cannot explain why inflation

is so persistent.          Gregory Mankiw (2001) notes that it has trouble
explaining     why       shocks   to     monetary       policy      have   a    delayed   and

gradual effect on inflation.                All of these problems arise from the

same source: Although the price level is sticky in this model, the

inflation     rate       can    change      quickly.           By    contrast,       empirical

analyses of the inflation process (e.g., Robert Gordon, 1996)

typically give a large role to "inflation inertia."

      This    paper       proposes     a      new   model      to   explain     the   dynamic




                                                1
effects of aggregate demand on output and the price level.                                 The

essence      of    the    model      is    that        information   about     macroeconomic

conditions diffuses slowly through the population.                                   This slow

diffusion         could    arise        because        of   either   costs     of    acquiring

information or costs to reoptimization.                          In either case, although

prices are always changing, pricing decisions are not always based

on current information.                 We call this a sticky-information model

to contrast it to the standard sticky-price model on which the new

Keynesian Phillips curve is based.

        To   formalize          these     ideas,       we   assume   that    each    period   a

fraction of the population updates themselves on the current state

of     the    economy          and   computes          optimal   prices      based    on   that

information.         The rest of the population continues to set prices

based on old plans and outdated information.                              Thus, this model

combines elements of Calvo's (1983) model of random adjustment

with     elements         of     Robert     Lucas's         (1973)   model     of    imperfect

information.

        The implications of our sticky-information model, however,

are closer to those of Stanley Fischer's (1977) contracting model.

As in the Fischer model, the current price level depends on

expectations of the current price level formed quite far in the

past.        In the Fischer model, those expectations matter because

they are built into contracts.                     In our model, they matter because

some price setters are still setting prices based on old decisions




                                                   2
and old information.1

        After introducing the sticky-information model in Section I,

we examine the dynamic response to monetary policy in Section II.

 In contrast to the standard sticky-price model, which allows for

the possibility of disinflationary booms, the sticky-information

model predicts that disinflations always cause recessions.         In

some ways, the dynamic response in the sticky-information model

resembles Phillips curves with backward-looking expectations.     Yet

there is an important difference: In the sticky-information model,

expectations     are   rational,   and   credibility   matters.    In

particular, the farther in advance a disinflationary policy is

anticipated, the smaller is the resulting recession.

        In Section III we make the model more realistic by adding a

simple yet empirically plausible stochastic process for the money

supply.     After calibrating the model, we examine how output and

inflation respond to a typical monetary policy shock.         We find

that the sticky-price model yields implausible impulse response
    1
      We should also note several other intellectual antecedents.
 Gabaix and Laibson (2000) suggest that consumption behavior is
better understood with the assumption that households update their
optimal consumption only sporadically; it was in fact a
presentation of the Gabaix-Laibson paper that started us working
on this project. Another related paper is Ball (2000), who tries
to explain price dynamics with the assumption that price setters
use optimal univariate forecasts but ignore other potentially
relevant information. In addition, Rotemberg and Woodford (1997)
assume a one-period decision lag for some price setters. Finally,
after developing our model, we became aware of Koenig (1997);
Koenig's model of aggregate price dynamics is motivated very
differently from ours and is applied to a different range of
questions, but it has a formal structure that is similar to the
model explored here.



                                   3
functions:    According   to    this    model,   the    maximum    impact    of   a

monetary shock on inflation occurs immediately.               By contrast, in

the   sticky-information       model,   the   maximum     impact    of   monetary

shocks on inflation occurs after 7 quarters.                This result more

closely matches the estimates from econometric studies and the

conventional wisdom of central bankers.

        Section IV then examines whether the models can explain the

central finding from the empirical literature on the Phillips
curve--namely, that vigorous economic activity causes inflation to

rise.     The standard sticky-price model is inconsistent with this

finding and, in fact, yields a correlation of the wrong sign.                     By

contrast,    the   sticky-information       model   can   explain    the    widely

noted     correlation   between    economic      activity    and    changes       in

inflation.

        Section V concludes.      We consider how our sticky-information

model relates to the broader new Keynesian literature on price

adjustment.     We also mention one piece of microeconomic evidence

that favors this new model over the alternatives.


I. A Tale of Two Models

        We begin by deriving the two models: the standard sticky-

price model, which yields the new Keynesian Phillips curve, and

the proposed sticky-information model.



A Sticky-Price Model: The New Keynesian Phillips Curve




                                        4
        Here we review the standard derivation of the new Keynesian

Phillips curve, as based on the Calvo model.          In this model, firms

follow time-contingent price adjustment rules.          The time for price

adjustment does not follow a deterministic schedule, however, but

arrives randomly.       Every period, a fraction λ of firms adjust

prices.     Each firm has the same probability of being one of the

adjusting firms, regardless of how long it has been since its last

price adjustment.
        We start with three basic relationships.        The first concerns

the firm's desired price, which is the price that would maximize

profit at that moment in time.            With all variables expressed in

logs, the desired price is:

                   p*t = pt + αyt.

This equation says that a firm's desired price p* depends on the

overall    price   level   p   and   output   y.    (Potential   output   is

normalized to zero here, so y should be interpreted as the output

gap.)     A firm's desired relative price, p*-p, rises in booms and

falls in recessions.

        Although we won't derive this equation from a firm's profit

maximization problem, one could easily do so, following Blanchard

and Kiyotaki (1987).           Imagine a world populated by identical

monopolistically competitive firms.           When the economy goes into a

boom, each firm experiences increased demand for its product.

Because marginal cost rises with higher levels of output, greater

demand means that each firm would like to raise its relative



                                      5
price.

        In this model, however, firms rarely charge their desired

prices, because price adjustment is infrequent.           When a firm has

the opportunity to change its price, it sets its price equal to

the average desired price until the next price adjustment.               The

adjustment price x is determined by the second equation:

                        ∞
                 xt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Etp*t+j
                       j=0


According to this equation, the adjustment price equals a weighted

average of the current and all future desired prices.                 Desired

prices farther in the future are given less weight because the

firm may experience another price adjustment between now and that

future date.     This possibility makes that future desired price

less relevant for the current pricing decision.                The rate of

arrival for price adjustments, λ, determines how fast the weights

decline.

        The third key equation in the model determines the overall

price level p:

                        ∞
                 pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j xt-j
                       j=0


According to this equation, the price level is an average of all

prices in the economy and, therefore, a weighted average of all

the prices firms have set in the past.           The rate of arrival for

price    adjustments,   λ,   also   determines   how   fast   these   weights



                                      6
decline.    The faster price adjustment occurs, the less relevant

past pricing decisions are for the current price level.

     Solving this model is a matter of straightforward algebra.

We obtain the following:

                 πt = [αλ2/(1-λ)]yt + Etπt+1

where πt=pt-pt-1 is the inflation rate.        Thus, we obtain the new

Keynesian Phillips curve.    Inflation today is a function of output

and inflation expected to prevail in the next period.       This model

has become the workhorse for much recent research on monetary

policy.



A Sticky-Information Model

     This section proposes an alternative model of price dynamics.

In this model, every firm sets its price every period, but firms

gather information and recompute optimal prices slowly over time.

In each period, a fraction λ of firms obtains new information

about the state of the economy and computes a new path of optimal

prices.    Other firms continue to set prices based on old plans and

outdated information.      We make an assumption about information

arrival that is analogous to the adjustment assumption in the

Calvo model: Each firm has the same probability of being one of

the firms updating their pricing plans, regardless of how long it

has been since its last update.

     As before, a firm's optimal price is

                 p*t = pt + αyt.



                                   7
A firm that last updated its plans j periods ago sets the price

                  xjt = Et-jp*t.

The aggregate price level is the average of the prices of all

firms in the economy:

                         ∞
                  pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j xjt.
                       j=0


Putting   these   three    equations       together    yields     the    following

equation for the price level:

                         ∞
                  pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j     Et-j(pt + αyt).
                        j=0


The   short-run   Phillips    curve    is    very     much    apparent    in     this

equation: Output is positively associated with surprise movements

in the price level.

      With some tedious algebraic manipulation, which we leave to

the   appendix,   this    equation    for    the    price     level     yields   the

following equation for the inflation rate:

                                            ∞
                  πt = [αλ/(1-λ)]yt     + λ Σ (1-λ)j         Et-1-j(πt + αgt).
                                           j=0


where gt=yt-yt-1 is the growth rate of output.                Inflation depends

on output, expectations of inflation, and expectations of output

growth.   We call this the sticky-information Phillips curve.

      Take note of the timing of the expectations.               In the standard

sticky-price model, current expectations about future economic




                                       8
conditions play an important role in determining the inflation

rate.     In this sticky-information model, as in Fischer (1977),

expectations are again important, but the relevant expectations

are   past    expectations       of     current    economic    conditions.      This

difference yields large differences in the dynamic pattern of

prices and output in response to monetary policy, as we see in the

next section.

        One theoretical advantage of the sticky-information model is
that it survives the McCallum critique.                       McCallum (1998) has

criticized the standard sticky-price model on the grounds that it

violates a strict form of the natural rate hypothesis, according

to which "there is no inflation policy--no money creation scheme--

that will keep output high permanently."                  Following Lucas (1972),

McCallum argues that "it seems a priori implausible that a nation

can   enrich   itself       in   real    terms    permanently     by   any   type   of

monetary     policy,   by    any      path   of   paper   money   creation."        The

sticky-price model fails this test because a policy of permanently

falling inflation will keep output permanently high.                   By contrast,

the sticky-information model satisfies this strict version of the

natural rate hypothesis.              Absent surprises, it must be the case

that pt=Et-jpt, which in turn implies yt=0.                    Thus, the McCallum

critique favors the sticky-information Phillips curve over the

more commonly used alternative.



II. Inflation and Output Dynamics in the Sticky-Information Model




                                             9
        Having presented the sticky-information Phillips curve, we

now examine its dynamic properties.                      To do this, we need to

complete the model with an equation for aggregate demand.                            We use

the simplest specification possible:

                       m = p + y.

where    m   is   nominal       GDP.      This     equation     can    be   viewed     as   a

quantity-theory          approach       to      aggregate     demand,       where    m      is

interpreted       as    the    money    supply     and   log    velocity       is   assumed
constant at zero.            Alternatively, m can be viewed more broadly as

incorporating          the    many    other     variables      that    shift    aggregate

demand.      We take m to be exogenous.               Our goal is to examine how

output and inflation respond to changes in the path of m.2

        As we proceed, it will be useful to compare the dynamics of

our proposed sticky-information Phillips curve with more familiar

models.      We use two such benchmarks.                 The first is the sticky-

price    model    presented          earlier,    which   yields       the   standard     new

Keynesian Phillips curve:

                       πt = βyt + Etπt+1
where β= [αλ2/(1-λ)] and the expectations are assumed to be formed

rationally.       The second is a backward-looking model:
                       πt = βyt + πt-1.
    2
       There are other, perhaps more realistic, ways to add
aggregate demand to this model. One possibility would be to add
an IS equation together with an interest-rate policy rule for the
central bank. Such an approach is more complicated and involves
more free parameters. We believe the simpler approach taken here
best illustrates the key differences between the sticky-
information model and more conventional alternatives.



                                              10
This backward-looking model resembles the equations estimated in

the empirical literature on the Phillips curve (as discussed in,

e.g., Gordon, 1996).      It can be viewed as the sticky-price model

together with the assumption of adaptive expectations: Etπt+1 = πt-

1.

         When we present simulated results from these models, we try

to pick plausible parameter values.        Some of these parameters

depend on the time interval.     For concreteness, we take the period

in the model to equal one quarter.       We set α=.1 and λ=.25 (and,

thus, β=.0083).     This value of λ means that firms on average make

adjustments once a year.     The small value of α means that a firm's

desired relative price is not very sensitive to macroeconomic

conditions.     Note that the firm's desired nominal price can now be

written as

                  p*t = (1-α)pt + αmt.

If α is small, then each firm gives more weight to what other

firms are charging than to the level of aggregate demand.3

         We now consider three hypothetical, policy experiments.   In

     3
      In the backward-looking model, the parameter β determines
the cost of disinflation. According to this model, if output falls
1 percent below potential for one quarter, then the inflation rate
falls by β if measured at a quarterly rate, or 4β if annualized.
If output falls by 1 percent below potential for one year, then
the annualized inflation rate falls by 16β. Thus, the sacrifice
ratio--the output loss associated with reducing inflation by one
percentage point--is 1/(16β). Our parameters put the sacrifice at
7.5.   For comparison, Okun's (1978) classic study estimated the
sacrifice ratio to be between 6 and 18 percent; Gordon (1997,
footnote 8) puts it at 6.4. Thus, our backward-looking model is
in the ballpark of similar models used the previous literature.



                                   11
each experiment, we posit a path for aggregate demand m.                We then

derive the path for output and inflation generated by the sticky-

information model and compare it to the paths generated by the two

benchmark models.     The details of the solution are presented in

the appendix.       Here we discuss the dynamic paths followed by

output and inflation.



Experiment 1: A Drop in the Level of Aggregate Demand

     The first experiment we consider is a sudden and permanent

drop in the level of aggregate demand.             The demand variable mt is

constant and then, at time zero, unexpectedly falls by 10 percent

and remains at this new level.

     The top graph in Figure 1 shows the path of output predicted

by each of the three models.            In all three models, the fall in

demand causes a recession, which gradually dissipates over time.

The impact of the fall in demand on output is close to zero at 16

quarters.     The   backward-looking      model    generates   a   oscillatory

pattern,    while   the   other   two     models    yield   monotonic    paths.

Otherwise, the models seem to yield similar results.

     Differences among the models become more apparent, however,

when we examine the response of inflation in the bottom of Figure

1.   In the sticky-price model, the greatest impact of the fall in

demand on inflation occurs immediately.            The other two models show

a more gradual response.          In the sticky-information model, the

maximum impact of the fall in demand on inflation occurs at 7



                                     12
quarters.   Inflation could well be described as inertial.



Experiment 2: A Sudden Disinflation

     The second experiment we consider is a sudden and permanent

shift in the rate of demand growth.          The demand variable mt is

assumed to grow at 10 percent per year (2.5 percent per period)

until time zero.      In period zero, the central bank sets mt the

same as it was in the previous period and, at the same time,

announces that mt will thereafter remain constant.       Figure 2 shows

the path of output and inflation predicted by the three models.

     According   to    the    sticky-price    model,   inflation   falls

immediately to the lower level.         Price setters, realizing that

disinflation is underway, immediately respond by making smaller

price adjustments.     Prices are sticky in the sticky-price model,

but inflation exhibits no inertia.        The response of output, of

course, is the other side of the coin.       Because inflation responds

instantly to the fall in money growth, output does not change.       As

in Phelps (1978), disinflation is costless.

     By contrast, the sticky-information model predicts a gradual

reduction in inflation.      Even after the disinflationary policy is

in place, most price setters are still marking up prices based on

old decisions and outdated information.          As a result of this

inertial behavior, inflation is little changed one or two quarters

after the disinflation has begun.        With a constant money supply

and rising prices, the economy experiences a recession, which



                                   13
reaches a trough 6 quarters after the policy change.                     Output then

gradually recovers and is almost back to normal after 20 quarters.

 These results seem roughly in line with what happens when nations

experience disinflation.4



Experiment 3: An Anticipated Disinflation

         Now suppose that the disinflation in our previous experiment

is announced and credible two years (8 periods) in advance.                     Let's

consider how this anticipated disinflation affects the path of

output and inflation.

         Figure 3 shows output and inflation according to the three

models.       The   predictions      for    the   backward-looking        model   are

exactly the same as in Experiment 2: The assumption of adaptive

expectations prevents the announcement from having any effect.

But the results are different in the other two models, which posit

rational expectations.

         In the sticky-price model, the announced disinflation causes

a boom.     As Ball (1994a) emphasizes, inflation in this model moves

in   anticipation     of   demand.         When   price   setters   anticipate     a

slowdown in money growth, inflation falls immediately.                    This fall

in   inflation,     together   with    continued      increases     in    the   money

     4
       Ball (1994b) examines disinflation for a number of
countries.   For the nine countries for which quarterly data are
available, he identifies 28 periods of disinflation.     In 27 of
these cases, the decline in inflation is associated with a fall in
output below its trend level.     This finding is related to the
acceleration phenomenon we document and discuss below.



                                           14
supply, leads to rising real money balances and higher output.

        By contrast, the sticky-information model does not produce

booms in response to anticipated disinflations.                In this model,

there     is    no   change     in    output     or   inflation    until       the

disinflationary policy of slower money growth begins.                Then, the

disinflation causes a recession.

        It would be wrong to conclude, however, that the announcement

has no effect in the sticky-information model.                 Because of the
announcement, many price setters have already adjusted their plans

in response to the disinflationary policy when it begins.                  As a

result, an announced slowdown in money growth leads to a quicker

inflation response and a smaller output loss than does a sudden

slowdown in money growth.            For these parameters, a disinflation

announced      and   fully    credible    8    quarters   in   advance   has    a

cumulative cost that is about one-fifth the size of the surprise

disinflation.

        In a way, the sticky-information model combines elements of

the other two models.         Like the backward-looking model (but unlike
the     sticky-price     model),      disinflations       consistently     cause

recessions rather than booms.            Like the sticky-price model (but

unlike the backward-looking model), expectations, announcements,

and credibility matter for the path of inflation and output.

These features of the sticky-information model seem consistent

with how central bankers view their influence on the economy.




                                         15
III. The Response to Realistic Monetary Shocks

        So far, we have compared how output and inflation respond to

hypothetical paths for aggregate demand.                 We now take a step

toward greater realism.           In particular, we assume a plausible

stochastic process for the money supply and then examine the

implied    processes    of   output     and    inflation.          As   Christiano,

Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999) discuss, economists have a good sense

of the dynamic effects of monetary policy shocks.                       One way to

gauge a model's empirical validity is to see if it can generate

plausible responses to such shocks.



The Stochastic Process for the Money Supply

        We model the growth in the demand variable m as following a

first-order autoregressive process: Δmt = ρΔmt-1 + εt.                     In this

environment, the price level is nonstationary, but the inflation

rate is stationary.

        To calibrate ρ, we looked at quarterly U.S. data from 1960 to

1999.      The variable m can interpreted as a measure of money

supply,    such   as   M1   or   M2,   or    more   broadly   as    a   measure   of

aggregate demand, such as nominal GDP.              The first autocorrelations

for these time series are 0.57 for M1 growth, 0.63 for M2 growth,

and 0.32 for nominal GDP growth.              Based on these numbers, we set

ρ=0.5.     The standard deviation of the residual is 0.009 for M1,

0.006 for M2, and 0.008 for nominal GDP, so we assume a standard

deviation of 0.007 (although this choice affects only the scale



                                        16
and not the shape of the dynamic paths).

         The positive value of ρ means that a monetary shock builds

over time.       That is, a positive shock ε causes m to jump up and

then to continue to rise.         With ρ=0.5, the level of m eventually

asymptotes to a plateau that is twice as high as the initial

shock.      This pattern for monetary shocks is broadly consistent

with that found in empirical studies.5



Impulse Responses

         Figure 4 show the response of output and inflation to a one-

standard-deviation contractionary monetary policy shock.                  In all

three models, output exhibits a hump-shaped response.                 The impact

on output at first increases because demand is building over time.

 It eventually decays because prices adjust.               The backward-looking

model yields oscillatory dynamics, while the other two models

yield a monotonic recovery from the recession.

         The impulse responses for inflation to the monetary shock

show      the   differences   between        the    sticky-price    and   sticky-

information models.        In the sticky-price model, inflation responds

quickly to a monetary policy shock.                In fact, the largest impact

on     inflation   comes    immediately.           By   contrast,   the   sticky-

information model displays some of the inflation inertia that is

built into the backward-looking model.                  For these parameters, a
     5
       For example, Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (1998)
conclude that an AR(1) process offers a good description of
monetary policy shocks when using M2 as the measure of money.



                                        17
monetary policy shock in the sticky-information model has its

maximum impact on inflation after 7 quarters.

         The   impulse       response     function      for    the    sticky-information

model is far more consistent with conventional views about the

effects of monetary policy.                   Economists such as Milton Friedman

(1948) have emphasized the long lags inherent in macroeconomic

policy.        In particular, a long lag between monetary policy actions

and inflation is accepted by most central bankers and confirmed by
most     econometric         studies.6        Figure    4     shows    that    the   sticky-

information model can explain a long lag between monetary policy

shocks     and    inflation,          while    the     standard       sticky-price    model

cannot.



Inflation Persistence

         In an important but cryptic paper, Fuhrer and Moore (1995)

argue     that    the    standard        sticky-price        model     "is    incapable   of

imparting the persistence to inflation that we find in the data."

(p. 127)         In the model, they claim, "the autocorrelation function

of     inflation...will         die     out    very    rapidly."       (p.    152)     This

contradicts the empirical autocorrelations of inflation, which

decay slowly.

         Motivated      by    these    arguments,       we    calculated       the   implied

autocorrelations of inflation in our three models.                             We maintain

     6
      See, for example, Bernanke and Gertler (1995) or Christiano,
Eichenbaum, and Evans (1999).



                                               18
the empirically realistic process for money growth used above: Δmt

= 0.5Δmt-1 + εt.          Table 1 presents the first eight autocorrelations

of    inflation       implied         by    the     models,     as   well     as    the    actual

autocorrelations of inflation using the GDP deflator, the consumer

price       index,   and       the    core     CPI.      (The   core    CPI    is    the    index

excluding food and energy.)                        Notice that inflation is highly

autocorrelated            in    all        three    models.          That    is,    given      the

empirically realistic process for the money supply, all the models

deliver plausible persistence in inflation.

        In the end, we are led to agree with Taylor (1999, p. 1040),

who responds to Fuhrer and Moore by observing that "inflation

persistence could be due to serial correlation of money."                                 This is

why all three models deliver high autocorrelations in Table 1.

Yet    we    also    agree      with       Fuhrer       and   Moore's   deeper      point: The

standard        sticky-price           model        does      not    deliver        empirically

reasonable dynamics for inflation and output.                               The key empirical

fact     that       is     hard       to     match,       however,      is    not    the       high

autocorrelations           of     inflation,            but   the    delayed       response     of

inflation to monetary policy shocks.



III. The Acceleration Phenomenon
        When    economists            want     to       document     the      Phillips      curve

relationship         in    U.S.      data     from      the   last    few    decades      of   the

twentieth century, a common approach is to look at a scatterplot

of the change in inflation and some level of economic activity,




                                                   19
such as unemployment or detrended output.                          This scatterplot shows

that when economic activity is vigorous, as represented by low

unemployment or high output, inflation tend to rise.                              We call this

correlation the acceleration phenomenon.7

          Panel A of Table 2 demonstrates the acceleration phenomenon

using       U.S.       quarterly      data    from       1960    to     1999.         For    these

calculations, output yt is the deviation of log real GDP from

trend,       where      trend    is     calculated         using      the     Hodrick-Prescott

filter.          We use three measures of inflation: the GDP deflator, the

CPI,       and    the    core    CPI.        We    use    two    timing       conventions:       We

correlate         yt    with    πt+2-πt-2,    the       one-year      change     in    inflation

centered around the observation date, and with πt+4-πt-4, the two-

year change in inflation.                 All six correlations are positive and

statistically significant. In U.S. data, high output is associated

with rising inflation.

          We now consider whether the models can generate the positive

correlation between output and the change in inflation.                                We assume

the       same    stochastic       process        for    the    money    supply       as    in   the

previous section (Δmt = 0.5Δmt-1 + εt) and the same parameters
(α=.1 and λ=.25).              Then, as explained in the appendix, we compute

the       population      correlation        between       output       and    the    change     in

inflation.
      7
      For some examples of economists using such a scatterplot to
demonstrate the acceleration phenomenon, see Abel and Bernanke
(1998, p. 457), Blanchard (2000, p. 155), Dornbusch, Fischer,
Startz (2001, p. 109), Hall and Taylor (1993, p. 217), and Stock
and Watson (1999, p. 48).



                                                  20
        Panel B of Table 2 shows the correlation predicted by the

models.      Not surprisingly, the backward-looking model predicts a

high correlation.          Because πt - πt-1 = βyt in this model, the

correlation is perfect for the one-period change in inflation and

only slightly lower for longer changes.                 In essence, the model

builds in the acceleration phenomenon through the assumption of

adaptive      expectations.        This   is   hardly   a   major   intellectual

victory: The appeal of the backward-looking model comes not from

its theoretical underpinnings but from its ability to fit this

phenomenon.

        We next look at the two models with better foundations.

Table 2 shows that the sticky-price model yields no association

between output and the change in inflation.                   For the one-year

change, the correlation between these variables is -0.13, which is

small and the wrong sign.             By contrast, the sticky-information

model yields a strong, positive association.                  According to this

model, the correlation between output and the change in inflation

is 0.43.8
        To   understand    these   results,    recall   the   impulse     response

functions.        In      the   sticky-price     model,     when    the   economy

experiences a contractionary monetary shock, output falls for a
    8
      Our finding that the calibrated sticky-price model predicts
a negative correlation between y and Δπ (in contrast to the
positive correlation in the data) is related to Gali and Gertler's
finding (1999) that econometric estimation of this model yields a
coefficient on output of the wrong sign.       Gali and Gertler's
proposed fix to the sticky-price model, however, differs
substantially from the sticky-information model proposed here.



                                          21
while.       Inflation    falls     immediately,     and   then    starts   rising.

Thus, low output coincides with falling inflation at first, but

then coincides with rising inflation for a long period.                       This

generates the small, negative correlation.

        By   contrast,    in    the   sticky-information      model,     inflation

adjusts slowly to a monetary shock.                When a contractionary shock

lowers output, it also leads to a prolonged period of falling

inflation.     This generates the positive correlation between output
and the change in inflation.

        Table 3 presents a sensitivity analysis of this correlation

to alternative parameter values.               Panel (a) of the table shows the

correlation     produced       by   the   sticky-price     model   for   different

parameter values.        Panel (b) shows the correlation produced by the

sticky-information model.             The sticky-price model consistently

generates a small correlation of the wrong sign, while the sticky-

information model typically yields a positive correlation between

output and the change in inflation.9



V. Conclusion
        This paper has explored a dynamic model of price adjustment.

 In particular, we have proposed a model to replace the widely
    9
       These simulated correlations are computed under the
assumption that all fluctuations are due to demand shocks. If we
were to append supply shocks to this model, the predicted
correlations would be driven down, because such shocks push
inflation and output in opposite directions. Thus, supply shocks
would make it even harder for the sticky-price model to match the
positive correlation in the data.

used "new Keynesian Phillips curve."                  In this model, prices are

always    changing,   but   decisionmakers           are     slow   to   update    their

pricing strategies in response to new information.

     Although the choice between the sticky-information model and

the standard sticky-price model is ultimately an empirical issue,

three of our findings suggest that the sticky-information model is

more consistent with conventional views of how monetary policy

works.    First, in the sticky-information model, disinflations are
always contractionary (although announced disinflations are less

costly than surprise ones).                 Second, in the sticky-information

model, monetary shocks have their maximum effect on inflation with

a substantial delay.          Third, the sticky-information model can

explain     the   acceleration         phenomenon          that    vigorous   economic

activity is positively correlated with rising inflation.

     The dynamic patterns implied by the sticky-information model

resemble those from the Fischer (1977) contracting model, although

long-term    contracts      have       no    role.         In     both   models,   past

expectations of the current price level play a central role in
inflation    dynamics.       In    a    sense,       the    slow    dissemination    of

information in our model yields a nominal rigidity similar to the

one Fischer assumed in his contracts.

     Critics of the Fischer contracting model (e.g., Robert Barro,

1977) have noted that it is hard to rationalize signing such

contracts ex ante or enforcing them ex post in light of the

obvious inefficiencies they cause.               Such critiques do not apply to




                                            23
the model proposed here.              The assumption of slow information

diffusion, perhaps due to costs of acquiring or acting on new

information,       leaves    no   apparent,    unrealized     gains    from    trade.

Thus, sticky information offers a more compelling rationale for

this type of nominal rigidity.

       Moving the theory of price adjustment away from sticky prices

toward sticky information may seem like a radical suggestion, but

we temper it with an important observation: Many lessons from the
"new Keynesian" literature on price adjustment apply as well to

our sticky-information model as they do to the standard sticky-

price model.

       An early lesson about price adjustment by firms with some

degree of monopoly power is that the private losses from sticky

prices are only second order, even if the social losses are first

order.    (Mankiw, 1985; Akerlof and Yellen, 1985).                 Thus, if firms

face small costs of price adjustment or are only near rational,

they     may   choose       to    maintain    sticky     prices,     even     if   the

macroeconomic effect of doing so is significant.                      When we move
from sticky prices to sticky information, this lesson applies in

somewhat modified form.             If there are small costs of acquiring

information or recomputing optimal plans, firms may choose not to

update     their     pricing      strategies.          The   private    loss       from

maintaining     old     decisions,     like   the   cost     of    maintaining     old

prices, is second order.

       Another lesson from the literature on price adjustment is




                                         24
that real rigidities amplify monetary non-neutralities. (Ball and

Romer, 1990)       Real rigidity is defined as a lack of sensitivity of

desired relative prices to macroeconomic conditions.                      Here, this

translates into a small value of the parameter α.                     Real rigidities

also play a role in our sticky-information model.                       Price setters

who   are   updating      their    decisions     are    aware    that    other   price

setters     are    not,   and     this   knowledge      limits    the     size   their

adjustments, especially when             α is small.            As a result, real
rigidity tends to exacerbate the effects of monetary policy.

      An advantage of sticky-information over sticky-price models

is that they more naturally justify the widely assumed time-

contingent    adjustment        process.        If    firms    have    sticky    prices

because of menu costs but are always collecting information and

optimizing in response to that information, then it is natural to

assume    state-contingent        adjustment.         Dynamic    models    of    state-

contingent        adjustment,     however,      are    often    yield     empirically

implausible results; Caplin and Spulber's (1987) conclusion of

monetary neutrality is a famous example.                  By contrast, if firms
face costs of collecting information and choosing optimal plans,

then it is natural to assume that their adjustment process is

time-contingent.          Price setters cannot react between scheduled

adjustments, because they are not collecting the information and

performing the calculations necessary for that purpose.

      Finally, we offer one piece of microeconomic evidence.                      Mark

Zbaracki et al. (2000) have studied in detail the costs associated




                                           25
with changing prices at a single large manufacturing firm.                  In

this extensive case study, the authors find that only a small

percentage of these costs are the physical costs of printing and

distributing price lists.       Far more important are the "managerial

and   customer    costs,"   which   include   the   costs   of    information-

gathering,     decision-making,      negotiation,     and     communication.

Whether our sticky-information model captures the macroeconomic

effects of such costs is an open question.          But this microeconomic
evidence, as well as the empirical problems associated with the

existing sticky-price models, suggest that macroeconomists need to

think   more     broadly    about   the   frictions    that      impede   price

adjustment.      This paper has taken a small step in that direction.

Appendix: Details of solutions

        This appendix explains the solutions of the three models

presented in the text.



I. The derivation of the sticky-price Phillips curve

        From the equations for the adjustment price xt and the price

level    pt,   breaking    the   sum   and   using   the   law   of   iterated

expectations, we obtain:

(A1)              xt = λ p*t + (1-λ) Etxt+1,

(A2)              pt = λ xt + (1-λ) pt-1.

But then solving for xt in (A2) and replacing in (A1) for xt and

xt+1, together with the definition of p*t = pt + αyt, yields the

desired expression for inflation presented in the text.



II. The derivation of the sticky-information Phillips curve

        Begin with the equation for the price level derived in the

text:

                            ∞
(A3)              pt = λ    Σ (1-λ)j Et-j(pt + αyt).
                           j=0


By taking out the first term and redefining the summation index,

this equation can be written as:
                                      ∞
(A4)              pt = λ(pt + αyt)+ λ Σ (1-λ)j+1 Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
                                     j=0


Analogous to equation (A3), the previous period's price level can

be written as:


                                       30
                          ∞
(A5)             pt-1 = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt-1 + αyt-1).
                         j=0


Subtracting (A5) from (A4) and rearranging yields the following

equation for the inflation rate:
                                     ∞
(A6)             πt = λ(pt + αyt)+ λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(πt + αgt)
                                    j=0

                                 ∞
                            - λ2 Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
                                j=0

Now equation (A4) can be rearranged to show that:

                                         ∞
(A7)             pt   - [αλ/(1-λ)]yt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(pt + αyt).
                                        j=0


We now use equation (A7) to substitute for the last term in

equation (A6).    After rearranging, we obtain
                                        ∞
(A8)             πt = [αλ/(1-λ)]yt + λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-1-j(πt + αgt).
                                       j=0

This is the sticky-information Phillips curve presented in the
text.




III. The response of output and inflation in the three policy

experiments

       The three policy experiments we undertake can be described as

follows:

       (E1) An unexpected fall in the level of aggregate demand by

       10% at date 0.   Thus, mt=-log(0.9) for t<0 and mt=0 for t≥0.



                                    31
        (E2) An unexpected drop in the rate of money growth _mt at

        date 0, from 2.5% per period to 0%.          Thus, mt=0.025(1+t) for

        t≤-1, mt=0 for t≥0.

        (E3) Same as (E2) but announced at date t=-8.

We focus on finding solutions for pt as a function of mt.                      The

solution for yt then follows from the aggregate demand equation.

        For   the   backward-looking       model,    the    solution     follows

immediately      once   the   aggregate    demand     equation     is   used    to

substitute out for y:

(A9)                pt(1+β) = 2pt-1 - pt-2 + βmt.

This is a second-order difference equation.             The associated roots

are [1±(-β)1/2]/(1+β), which are complex (since β>0), generating

the oscillatory behavior.

        For the sticky-price model, rewrite the Phillips curve, using

the aggregate demand equation, as:

(A10)               Etpt+1 - (2 + β)pt + pt-1 = -βmt.

This is an expectational difference equation, which can be solved

by     the    methods   explained   in     Sargent    (1986).      First,      take

expectations at t and express all expectations at t variables with

*. Then using the lag operator L, such that LEtpt=Etpt-1 and its
inverse,      the   forward   operator,     F=L-1    such   that    FEtpt=Etpt+1,

reexpress (A5) as:

(A11)         (F2 - (2 + β)F + 1)Lpt* = -βmt*.

The quadratic (x2 - (2 + β)x + 1), has two positive roots: θ and

1/θ, such that (1-θ)2/θ = β. Pick θ to correspond to the smaller




                                      32
of the roots. Then (A11) becomes:

(A12)           (1 - θL) pt* = (1 - θ)2 (1 - Fθ)-1 mt*.

But using the fact that θ < 1, the inverse on the right-hand side

is well defined and can be expanded. Finally, since pt and pt-1 are

part of date t information set, we obtain the final solution:


                                     ∞
(A13)           pt = θ pt-1 + (1-θ)2 Σ θi Etmt+i.
                                    i=0


        For the policy experiment E1, up to date 0, pt=mt=-log(0.9).

From 0 onwards, Etmt+i=mt+i=0, so the price level is given by the

recursion pt=θpt-1 with initial condition p-1=-log(0.9). For E2,

pt=mt until t=-1, and after again pt=θpt-1, but now the initial

condition is p-1=0. Thus pt=0, t≥0 and so yt=0 at all t. For E3, in

the period -8≤t≤-1, then the terms of the sum in the right hand

side of (A13) are Etmt+i=0.025(1+t) for -8≤t+i≤-1 and Etmt+i=0 for

t+i≥0. After that, for t≥0, pt=θpt-1.

        Finally, consider the sticky-information model, as captured

by the equation:
                       ∞
(A14)           pt = λ Σ (1-λ)j Et-j[(1-α)pt + αmt)].
                      j=0



The     price     level   at   time   t≥0    can   then   be   broken   into   two

components, where the first includes price setters aware of the

new path for aggregate demand, and the second those agents who

decided on their prices before the change:




                                            33
              t                            ∞
(A15) pt = λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)] + λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)].
            j=0                          j=t+1


Because    the   agents       represented      by   the   second    term   are   still

setting     prices   based       on    their    old    information     sets,     their

expectations are given by Et-jpt=Et-jmt =-log(0.9).                 As a result, the

second term reduces to -log(0.9)(1-λ)t+1. The agents represented by

the first term are responded to the new path of aggregate demand,

so Et-jmt = 0, and since we are solving for the perfect-foresight

equilibrium,     Et-jpt   =    pt.    Collecting      terms   and   rearranging,   we

obtain the solution:

(A16)        pt = [-log(0.9)(1-λ)t+1]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1-λ)t+1)].

This equation gives the solution for the price level in sticky-

information model under policy experiment E1.

        We can find the outcome under policy experiment E2 with

similar steps.       Under E2, however, Et-jpt = Et-jmt = 0.025(1+t) for

t-j<0.    Thus, the solution is:

(A17)        pt = [0.025(1+t)(1-λ)t+1]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1-λ)t+1)].
This equation gives the price level in the sticky-information

model under policy experiment E2.

        Finally, for E3, for t<0, the path is the same as expected by

all agents, so pt=mt=0.025(t+1) and yt=0. After date 0, pt is given
by (note the limit of the sums):
             t+8                           ∞
(A18) pt = λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)] + λ Σ(1-λ)jEt-j[(1-α)pt+αmt)].
            j=0                           j=t+9




                                          34
All else is the same as in E2.      The solution follows as:

(A19) pt = [0.025(1+t)(1-λ)t+9]/[1-(1-α)(1-(1 - λ)t+9)].

This equation gives the path of the price level for the sticky-

information model under policy experiment E3.



IV. Output and inflation when money growth is AR(1)

        Suppose Δmt = ρΔmt-1 + εt, where εt is white noise and ρ< 1.

It will prove convenient to write this in MA(∞) form:


            ∞                                ∞   ∞ j
(A20) Δmt = Σ ρj εt-j        or          mt = Σ   Σ ρ εt-j-k.
           j=0                               k=0 j=0


        Consider first the backward-looking model. First-differencing

both sides of (A9), multiplying through by (1-ρL) and rearranging

yields the following AR(3) for the inflation rate:

(A21)        πt = [1+β]-1 {[2+ρ(1+β)]πt-1 - (2ρ+1)πt-2 + ρπt-3 + βεt}.

From this equation, we can calculate impulse responses and all

moments of inflation.

        Consider now the sticky-price model. We find the general
solution of these rational expectation models by the method of

undetermined coefficients as outlined in Taylor (1985). Since the

money growth rate is stationary, it is a reasonable conjecture

that the inflation rate is also stationary and so can be expressed

in the MA(∞) general form:
               ∞                                   ∞    ∞
(A22)     πt = Σ φj εt-j           or         pt = Σ   Σ φj εt-j-k
              j=0                                 k=0 j=0




                                    35
where the φj are coefficients to be determined. Then realize that

Et{εt+i-j-k}=εt+i-j-k for i-j≤k and is zero otherwise.              Using the

solution   of the model in (A12):
      ∞    ∞             ∞ ∞                      ∞   ∞   ∞
(A23) Σ    Σ φj εt-j-k= θΣ Σ φj εt-1-j-k +(1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ   Σ ρj εt+i-j-k.
     k=0   j=0          k=0 j=0                  i=0 j=0 k=Max{i-j,0}



But then, since this must hold for all possible realizations of

εt-j, matching coefficients on both sides of this equation yields

for the coefficient on εt:
                     ∞     i
(A24)     φ0 = (1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ ρj              =   (1-θ)/(1-θρ).
                     i=0 j=0


And for a general v, the coefficient on εt-v:
          v       v-1            ∞   i+v
(A25)     Σ φj = θ Σ φj + (1-θ)2 Σ θi Σ ρj.
          j=0     j=0           i=0 j=0


This yields:
                 v-1
(A26) φv = (θ-1) Σ φj + [(1-θ)2/(1-ρ)][1/(1-θ) - ρv+1/(1-θρ)].
                 j=0


Equations (A22), (A24) and (A26) fully describe the stochastic
process of inflation. The impulse response of inflation for a unit

shock to aggregate demand is given by {φv}. The autocorrelation

coefficients of order j are then given by (see Hamilton, 1994, p.

52):
                   ∞           ∞
(A27)              Σ φv φv-j / Σ φv2.
                   v=j         v=0



        Consider   now   the   sticky-information       model.   Similarly   to



                                        36
(A22), conjecture the solution: πt = Σ γi εt-i or pt = Σ Σ γi εt-i-k,

where    the   sums     go   from   0   to    infinity.    Taking    the   relevant

expectations      and    substituting        in   (A8),   the   equation   for   the

Phillips curve, we obtain:
      ∞                        ∞    ∞         ∞     ∞
(A28) Σ γi εt-i = [αλ/(1-λ)].[ Σ ρi Σ εt-k-i - Σ γi Σ εt-k-i ] +
     i=0                      i=0 k=0         i=0 k=0

                       ∞                ∞            ∞
                   + λ Σ (1-λ)j [ (1-α) Σ γi εt-i + α Σ ρi εt-i ].
                      j=0              i=j+1        i=j+1


So, again matching coefficients:

(A29)     γ0 = αλ/[1-λ(1-α)],
                         k                  k-1     k         k
(A30)     γv = [1-λ(1-α)Σ (1-λ)i ]-1.αλ.[(1-Σ γi) + Σρi + ρk Σ(1-λ)i].
                        i=0                 i=0     i=1 i=0


This provides the full characterization of the stochastic process

for inflation.        For this, impulse responses, autocorrelations, and

cross-correlations can be easily calculated.



V. Impulse responses of output and population correlations between
output and the change in inflation.

        For the backward-looking model, corr(πt+2-πt-2,yt)=corr[πt+2-πt-

2,(πt-πt-1)/β],   which we can evaluate using (A21).              Corr(πt+4-πt-4,yt)

follows likewise.

        For the sticky-price model, note that output growth is given

from the quantity theory: Δyt = Δmt - πt = Σ (ρj-φj) εt-j.                       From

this, we can obtain the MA(∞) for output: yt = Σ ωjεt-j with the

recursion ωj = ωj-1 + ρj-φj, initiated by ω0 = 1 - φ0. The impulse



                                         37
response to a unit shock is given by the sequence {ωv}.              To solve

for the change in inflation πt+4-πt, start with πt = Σ φj εt-j; the

coefficients    in   the   MA(∞)   representation     for   the     change   in

inflation πt+4-πt = Σ ξjεt-j are then given by ξj = φj - φj-4 with ξ0

= φ0, ξ1 = φ1, ξ2 = φ2, and ξ3 = φ3.            Given these results, the

population cross-correlation between the change in inflation and

output, corr(πt+2-πt-2,yt), is:


                 ∞          ∞
(A31)            Σ φv ξv / (Σ φv2)(Σ ξv+22).
                 v=0        v=0




The   cross-correlation    corr(πt+4-πt-4,yt)   is   derived   in    the   same

fashion.

        The derivation of the population cross-correlations in the

sticky-information model is precisely the same, except we start

with πt = Σ γi εt-i as the process for inflation.
