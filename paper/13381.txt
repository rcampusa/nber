The pension landscape in the U.S. has changed dramatically over the past 25 years. Saving through
personal retirement accounts has become the principal form of retirement saving. We document the
transition from a defined benefit system to a personal account system and show the effect it has had
on wealth at retirement. We summarize results from other research we have done to project the growth
of retirement assets over the next three decades. Our projections suggest that the advent of personal
account saving will increase wealth at retirement for future retirees across the lifetime earnings spectrum.

       The leading edge of the baby boom generation will reach retirement age in

the next few years. Younger members of this generation will continue to retire

through about 2030. These retirees will face a very different pension landscape

than their parents. Persons retiring before the early 1980s relied heavily on

Social Security and employer sponsored defined benefit (DB) pension plans for

support in retirement. Those retiring since then have accumulated a mix of

wealth in Social Security, DB plans, and various personal retirement accounts,

including 401(k)s, IRAs, and similar plans. Balances in these personal account

plans for recent retirees are often modest because the retirees were only able to

avail themselves of these plans late in their careers.

       Future retirees will reach retirement with a very different mix of assets, as

DB plan coverage continues to decline and personal account plan coverage

continues to grow. This paper considers the effect of the changing pension

landscape on the wealth of future retirees. The paper is divided into six sections.

The first describes the changing pattern of contributions to pension plans over

the past 25 years. Section 2 tracks the enormous increase in pension assets

over this time period. The third section considers changing participation behavior

in pension plans. We emphasize in these three sections the growth of personal

retirement accounts and the decline in DB plans. In section four we discuss the

evolving features of 401(k)-like plans and how they compare with DB plans. We

also consider some of the more subtle changes within the 401(k) sector that have

occurred since the inception of 401(k) plans in the early 1980s. The fifth section

summarizes our recent work on projecting the wealth of future retirees. We




                                         2
project the 401(k) assets of future retirees and consider how the evolution of the

401(k) system is likely to affect the retirement wealth of future retirees with

different levels of lifetime earnings. There is a brief conclusion.



1. The Growth and Changing Mix of Pension Contributions

       We show first the growth and changing mix of dollar contributions to

pension plans and then consider contributions as a percent of wage and salary

earnings. We also distinguish contributions to private plans, to federal

government plans, and to state and local government plans. Contributions to

private sector plans between 1980 and 2004, measured in nominal dollars, are

shown in Figure 1-1. The appendix describes the data sources used to construct

this figure and all subsequent figures and tables. The figure distinguishes

contributions to DB plans and to personal account savings plans including

traditional DC plans, 401(k) plans, Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) and

Keogh plans. The most noticeable feature of the figure is the increase in

contributions to 401(k) plans, which now account for the bulk of contributions to

all personal retirement plans. In 1980 only 40 percent of private contributions

were to personal accounts and most of these contributions were accounted for by

traditional employer-provided defined contribution plans. Contributions to IRA

and 401(k) plans began in 1982. By 2000, about 87 percent of contributions

were to personal accounts, primarily to 401(k) plans. Contributions to 401(k)

plans have grown since 2000, attaining $204 billion in 2004, but the proportion of

total contributions accounted for by personal accounts has declined from 87




                                          3
percent in 2000 to 73 percent in 2004. This decline is attributable to an increase

in contributions to DB plans, largely driven by “catch-up” contributions following

the fall in the stock market in 2000.

       Figure 1-2 shows total contributions to all pension plans including private,

federal government, and state and local government plans. The nominal dollar

amount of contributions increased from about $130 billion in 1980 to about $535

billion in 2004. Between 1980 and 2004 total contributions increased by 488

percent in the private sector, 337 percent in the state and local sector, and 295

percent in the federal sector. In real dollars, converting 1980 dollars to 2004

using the Consumer Price Index, total contributions rose from $298 billion to

$535 billion, or by 80 percent. In both Figures 1-1 and 1-2, there is a clear rise in

total contributions between 1982 and 1986 – the years when the fully-deductible

IRA was available.

                   Total pension contributions have increased because of economic growth

and in particular because of growth in wage and salary earnings. It is therefore

natural to consider contributions as a percent of National Income and Product

Account (NIPA) wage and salary earnings. We begin with aggregate pension

contribution rates and then show detail by sector. Figure 1-3 shows total pension

contributions as a percent of total NIPA wage and salary earnings and private

pension contributions as a percent of private sector NIPA wage and salary

earnings for the 1980 to 2004 interval. The total contribution rate was about 10

percent in 1980, and again in 2004, but it ranged widely in the interim. The

highest rate was almost 12 percent in 1984, while the low was just over 8 percent

in 1990. As discussed in more detail below, this fluctuation is due largely to

changes in IRA contributions and contributions to DB plans.

       The private contribution rate was about 2 percentage points higher at the

end than at the beginning of the period, but it also fluctuated substantially. The

pension contribution rate was about 8.6 percent between 1982 and 1985 but

declined to 5.2 percent by 1990. Again, this decline was largely accounted for by

reductions in IRA contributions.

       The contribution rate differs greatly by sector and, within the private

sector, by plan type. Figure 1-4 shows contribution rates in the private sector by

plan type, all as a percent of NIPA private wage and salary earnings. There are

several noticeable features of this figure. First, the growth in 401(k) plan

contributions stands out. Contributions increased from 0.3 percent of wage and

salary earnings in 1982 to 4.6 percent in 2004. Second, contributions to all

personal retirement accounts increased from 2.6 percent of wage and salary

earnings in 1980 to 5.8 percent in 2004. Conversely, contributions to DB plans

were 3.8 percent in 1980 and fell to 2.1 percent by 2004. Third, the figure

suggests that curtailing the IRA program after 1986 affected the pension saving

rate in the ensuing years. Tax-deductible contributions to IRAs were 2.6 percent

of wage and salary earnings in 1986 but dropped to 1.1 percent in 1987 and to

only 0.7 percent by 1990. It seems likely that if the IRA program had not been

curtailed, the total private pension contribution rate today would have been

higher than it is.

       Fourth, the total private pension contribution rate reached a low of 5.2

percent in 1990 and then grew to nearly 8 percent in 2004. As a percent of wage

and salary earnings, DB contributions fell by more than non-IRA personal

account contributions increased between 1980 and 2000. DB contributions

declined from 3.1 percent to 0.8 percent and personal account contributions

increased from 2.9 percent to 4.9 percent. The depressing effect of changes in

DB funding rules, which Schieber and Shoven [1997], Ippolitto [2001], and

Poterba, Venti, and Wise [2004] discuss, swamped the positive effect of




                                          8
increasing personal account contributions. Fifth, aside from changes due to the

curtailment of the IRA program, the fluctuation in the total private pension saving

rate is due almost exclusively to fluctuation in the DB plan contribution rate.

       The contribution rate in the federal sector is much higher than the

contribution rate in the private sector. Figure 1-5 shows federal DB and DC

pension contributions a percent of federal NIPA wage and salary earnings. Over

the 1980 to 2004 period, the total federal contribution rate was around 40 percent

in most years, compared to an average of around 6.5 percent in the private

sector. The data for Figure 1-5 include both military and civilian pension

contributions. Figure 1-6 shows the contribution rate for civilian employees as a

percent of NIPA wage and salary earnings for federal civilian employees. The

total pension contribution rate for federal civilian employees was around 35

percent, roughly four times greater than the contribution rate in the private sector.

       Figure 1-7 shows the pension contribution rate of state and local

government employees as a percent of NIPA wage and salary earnings of these

employees. The data on state and local pensions do not allow us to distinguish

between DB and DC contributions. The state and local rate shows a substantial

decline, from about 16 percent in the early 1980s to around 12 percent by 2004.

The state and local contribution rate is about twice as high as the private rate.

                 The difference between the contribution rates in the private and public

sectors is likely explained in large part by differences in coverage and in plan

generosity. Coverage is nearly universal in the federal sector and over 90

percent in the state and local sector, but less than 50 percent in the private

sector. Thus, all else constant, the ratio of contributions to earnings should be

twice as high in the public sector as in the private sector. Moreover the

generosity of employer plans is much greater in the public sectors.

                 Table 1-1 shows monthly pension benefits by age in 2003, based on data

from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). Over all ages,

state and local government pension benefits are about 1.7 times as large as

benefits from private sector union or company pensions. Military retirement

benefits are almost 2.1 times as large as private sector benefits and federal



                                                       11
civilian benefits are over 2.2 times as large. These differences in generosity

may, in part, stem from differences in job turnover. Employee turnover is higher

in the private than in the public sector so, and given the back-loading of DB

pension accruals, many private sector workers may receive reduced benefits on

account of changing jobs. Differences in the number of years over which

benefits are collected will also affect employer contributions. DB pensions are

more prevalent in the public sector and are typically associated with earlier

retirement dates than private-sector DC plans.

       Another factor that affects contributions in a particular year is whether

employers are required to or choose to pay down unfunded liabilities. A spike in

contributions to private DB plans is clearly evident in Figure 1-4 for 2002 and

2003 as firms were legally obligated to increase contributions to offset the decline

in equity prices. Purcell (2003) explains that in the federal sector current

contributions must not only fund the "new" (fully funded) FERS program, but




                                              12
must also pay off obligations of the "old" CSRS program which has substantial

unfunded liabilities.

       The pension contribution rates in the private sector reveal the transition

from a pension system dominated by employer-provided DB plans to a system

composed primarily of personal retirement accounts of which the 401(k) plan is

the most important. The contribution rates also highlight the much greater

generosity of government plans compared to private sector plans. The pension

contribution rate for federal plans is perhaps four times as large, and that for

state and local governments twice as large, as that for private plans.



2. The Growth Pension Assets

       The foregoing evidence suggests that aside from the years of fully-

deductible IRAs, total pension contributions as a percent of wage and salary

earnings remained between 8 and 10 percent between 1980 and 2004.

However, private sector contributions as a percent of wage and salary earnings

increased from about 5 percent in 1990 to about 8 percent in 2004, and assets in

pension plans grew dramatically over this period. Figure 2-1 shows pension

assets by sector. Total pension assets, measured in nominal dollars, grew from

$464 billion in 1980 to $14,185 billion in 2005. In constant 2005 dollars, the 1980

pension assets would be valued at $1,100 billion. The drop in assets after 2000,

as well as the sharp increase after 2002, is directly related to fluctuating stock

market values.




                                         13
       Figure 2-2 shows assets as a percent of NIPA wage and salary earnings.

Total pension assets grew from 71.5 percent of wage and salary earnings in

1980 to 261.1 percent in 2005, a 3.65-fold increase. Assets in private pension

plans grew from 63.7 percent of private NIPA wage and salary earnings in 1980

to 234.0 percent in 2005. This increase in the "wealth-to-income" ratio describes

the rise in retirement asset accumulation over this period.

       Demographic changes between 1980 and 2005 complicate comparison of

the pension asset-to-earnings ratios in the two years. The U.S. population was

older in 2005 than in 1980, so even if the age profile of pension wealth was the

same in the two years, one could find a higher aggregate pension wealth to

earnings ratio in 2005. Yet demographic changes do not seem large enough to

explain the observed differences. The share of the population over the age of 55

rose from 20.9 percent in 1980 to 22.7 percent in 2005. The share between ages

45 and 54 rose from 10.1 percent to 14.3 percent, reflecting the presence of

many members of the Baby Boom cohort in this age range in 2005. Even this

increase of nearly forty percent in the population share in key pre-retirement age

groups is more modest than the increase in pension assets relative to earnings.

The increase in pension assets relative to earnings suggests that, on average,

the capacity to replace pre-retirement income has increased rather substantially

over the past twenty-five years although it does not mean that all current or future

retirees have sufficient retirement assets. Persons retiring in 2005 retire earlier

and live longer than persons retiring in 1980 so the "wealth-to-income" ratio




                                         14
required to replace pre-retirement earnings should be higher in 2005 than in

1980.

              This increase in retirement assets can also be seen in the micro data.

Table 2-1 shows mean assets in 2000 for all households age 63 to 67 in the

Health and Retirement Study. In this year the mean of DB pension assets,

defined as the present value of expected benefits, is $92,228; 401(k) assets in

this year were $26,098 and IRA and Keogh assets, which include rollovers from

401(k) plans, are $77,716. Poterba, Venti and Wise [2007c] show that the real

value of DB assets at age 65 was higher in 2000 than in 1980. Similarly, 401(k)

and IRA assets are much higher in 2000 than in 1980, indicating that the

accumulation of assets dedicated to retirement increased substantially between

1980 and 2000. For comparison, Table 2-1 also includes mean household Social

Security wealth of $181,373 in 2000. On average, the sum of DB, 401(k), IRA,




                                                            16
and Keogh assets exceeded the present value of future Social Security benefits

in 2000.

3. Pension Participation

       While assets in pension plans have grown dramatically since 1980, the

proportion of private sector employees participating in a pension plan has

remained roughly constant, according to estimates from the Current Population

Survey (CPS) described in Munnell and Perun [2006] and Purcell [2006]. Other

surveys, summarized for example by Sanzenbacher [2006], yield similar profiles

although some report slightly rising participation and others report slightly falling

participation. The percentage of public sector workers participating in a pension

plan has remained constant at nearly 100 percent between 1980 and 2004.

       The data from the Form 5500 reports that we have used to track

contributions and assets are not helpful for studying overall trends in

participation. They report the number of active participants in each pension plan

offered by each employer. Since many employers offer more than one pension

plan to their employees, most commonly a DB and a 401(k), the total number of


                                          17
active participants in the Form 5500 may double-count many employees.

Buessing and Soto [1996] have carefully attempted to adjust for double-counting

by making a number of assumptions to distinguish between primary and

supplemental plans. By eliminating supplemental plans they derive an estimate

of pension plan participants for each year between 1990 and 2003 for private

firms with at least 100 employees. Figure 3-1 shows their estimates. Over this

period the number of employees covered by a DB plan declined by about one-

third, while the number covered by only a DC plan (primarily 401(k)s) increased

almost three-fold. The number of employees participating in both a DB and a DC

plan remained roughly constant. Overall, participation increased from about 35

million in 1990 to nearly 52 million in 2003.

       To place these changes in perspective we graph participation as a percent

of private sector employment in Figure 3-2. In contrast to the results obtained

from the CPS, these results show an upward trend in the overall number of

private sector pension participants, from 38.2 percent in 1990 to 47.6 percent in

2003. The overall participation rate is slightly lower than the level found in the

CPS, probably because Buessing and Soto [2006] exclude small firms. Because

much of the recent growth in 401(k)s coverage is in small firms, these results are

likely to understate the growth in 401(k) participation.

        The double-counting problem does not prevent the use of the Form 5500

data to study trends in participation in each type of pension since employers

typically offer each worker at most one DB plan and one personal account plan.

Figure 3-3 shows the change in the number of active participants by plan type in

the private sector between 1980 and 2004. Unlike the previous two figures, IRA

and Keogh participants, many of whom also have employer-sponsored pensions,

are included here. Without any adjustment for double-counting, the total number

of participants increased from just over 50 million in 1980 to almost 80 million in

2004. The figure shows the large increase in the number of 401(k) participants

and the much smaller decline in the number of DB participants. Between 1982

and 2004, while the number of 401(k) participants grew by over 44 million, the

number of DB participants declined by about 10 million. Poterba, Venti, and

Wise [2004] show that there was very little replacement of DB plans by 401(k)

plans between 1984 and 1997. The majority of new 401(k) plans during this

period supplemented existing DB plans.

       Figure 3-3 also shows the decline in the number of traditional employer-

provided DC plans. It is likely that some of the growth in 401(k) plans is due to

the conversion of traditional employer-provided DC plans to 401(k) plans.

Benjamin [2003] estimates that about 30 percent of 401(k) assets in 1991 were

originally contributed to traditional DC plans. Gale, Papke and VanDerhei [2005]

estimate that between 23 and 41 percent of existing 401(k) plans in 1989 had

been converted from previously existing DC plans.

                Figure 3-4 shows the average contribution per participant in the private

sector. The estimate for DB plans is total contributions to DB plans divided by

Buessing and Soto’s [2006] estimate of the number of participants in these plans.

The estimate for "401(k) and traditional DC plans" is the sum of all contributions

to 401(k) plans and to traditional DC plans divided by the estimate of participants

in these plans. Contributions per participant to 401(k)-like plans increased from

$3,000 in 1980 to almost $5,000 by 1990.                           Between 1990 and 2000, 401(k) –

like plan contributions were between two and three times as large as DB

contributions per participant in most years. Contributions per participant to DB

plans exceed $3,000 only in the last two years when plan sponsors had to

"catch-up" as the result of the sharp decline in equity prices.

              The federal sector estimates, shown in Figure 3-5, are total DB

contributions divided by the number of federal DB participants and total

contributions to 401(k)-like plans also divided by the number of DB participants.

This calculation assumes that all federal sector 401(k)-like plans are

supplementary. The relationship between DB and 401(k)-like contributions per

participant in the federal sector is the opposite of that observed in the private

sector. The level of 401(k)-like contributions per participant in the federal sector

is very similar to the level of 401(k)-like contributions per participant in the private

sector. However, federal sector DB contributions are much larger than federal

sector 401(k)-like contributions. We do not present comparable estimates for the

state and local sector because we are unable to distinguish between DB and

401(k)-like plans in this sector and thus cannot correct for double-counting.

4. The Evolving Features of Personal Retirement Plans

              There has been a transition from employer-provided DB plans to personal

retirement accounts in the private sector. The proportion of personal accounts

has also grown in the federal and in the state and local sectors. We now

consider several other evolving dimensions of the transition and their

implications. The next section considers how the transition will affect the

retirement wealth of future retirees.

              There has been a great deal of concern in the press and elsewhere that

the rise of 401(k) plans exposes workers to financial market risks that they would

not face in a traditional DB system. Indeed, the perceived risk of 401(k)



                                                23
portfolios has been increasing in recent years.                    Figure 4-1 shows that the

proportion of 401(k) assets allocated to equities increased substantially between

1985 and 2005, from 42 percent to 63 percent. The percent of DB assets

invested in equities increased by almost the same amount.

              While the financial market risk of 401(k) plans has been widely

emphasized, the job change risk of DB plans has received little if any attention.

DB plans effectively penalize employees who change jobs; DC plans do not.

This job change or turnover risk of DB plans was emphasized by Kotlikoff and

Wise [1989]. Whether the transition from DB plans to DC-like plans increases

risk exposure depends on the relative magnitudes of job-change risk and market

risk. Several recent studies have directly addressed this question.




                                                       24
       Samwick and Skinner [2004] use a sample of pension plans from the

Survey of Consumer Finances to compare the risks associated with DB and DC

plans. They consider risks associated with both job change and financial market

returns. They conclude that the distribution of expected retirement income

provided by 401(k) plans is preferred to the distribution provided by DB plans for

all but the most risk-averse investors.

       Schrager [2005] uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to estimate a

life-cycle model of wealth accumulation that also incorporates both asset market

risk and job turnover risk. She finds that because of rising job turnover in the

1990's, DC plans provide a more desirable source of retirement income for many

workers. Her findings suggest that industries with the highest job risk have

experienced the largest increases in DC participation over the last 15 years.

       Aaronson and Coronado [2005] also suggest that the transition to DC

plans has been stimulated by increasing rates of worker mobility. Poterba, Rauh,

Venti, and Wise [2006b] analyze pension risk using actual earnings histories that

incorporate job changes. They conclude that the job change risk inherent in DB

plans outweighs the financial market risk of 401(k) plans. Thus the evidence

indicates that the transition to DC-like plans has not increased the overall level of

risk faced by workers and indeed may have reduced it. There is of course

substantial heterogeneity in the circumstances of different workers. For some

workers with very little risk of job turnover, for example, the transition from a DB

plan to a DC plan with significant equity exposure may increase overall risk.




                                          25
       The role of DC plans within the DC sector has also changed over the past

two decades. Early adopters tended to be large firms with pre-existing DB plans.

The data in Table 4-1 show that in the early years over three-quarters of 401(k)

participants also had a DB plan. As 401(k) plans spread to smaller firms, fewer

new participants were also covered by a DB plan; the 401(k) plan was the sole

plan. Perhaps the most important question about future 401(k) plan growth is the

extent to which 401(k) plans will continue to be adopted by small firms. The

projections discussed in the next section incorporate assumptions about the

future spread of 401(k) plans. The realized diffusion of these plans, however, will

depend importantly on government legislation and institutional arrangements that

might facilitate the adoption of plans by small firms.

       Future participation in 401(k) plans, given plan eligibility, may be aided by

recent legislation that makes it easier for firms to offer 401(k) plans containing

participation-enhancing features. The Pension Protection Act of 2006, for

example, makes it easier for employers to implement automatic enrollment, set

default contribution rates, and set default asset allocations in 401(k) plans. The

enormous influence that changes in these plan features may have on



                                         27
participation and the accumulation of assets has been extensively studied by

Choi, Laibson and Madrian [2004], Beshears, Choi, Laibson and Madrian [2006],

and Holden and VanDerhei [2005].

       Finally, the investment options available to 401(k) participants are evolving

rapidly. Recent legislation has greatly reduced the role of employer stock as an

investment option and encouraged plan sponsors to diversify investment

offerings. More and more plans are offering "life-cycle" or "target-retirement"

funds that maintain a well-diversified investment mix that is intended to be

appropriate for the participant's age or retirement date. Poterba, Rauh, Venti,

and Wise [2006a] suggest that these plans have the potential to either reduce

risk or increase returns for some participants, depending on the investment

options that otherwise would have been available. The PPA of 2006 enables

plan sponsors to offer such funds as "defaults" for participants.



5. Projections of Future 401(k) Wealth

       We now consider how the future spread of 401(k)-like plans will affect the

retirement wealth of future retirees. The results are drawn from Poterba, Venti,

and Wise [2007a,b,c,d], which explain our method and underlying assumptions in

detail. We project future 401(k) participation rates based on historical data from

the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). These data organized

into cohort format are shown for persons in selected cohorts in Figure 5-1, where

the cohort age "XX" in 1984 is identified as "CXX". Such data cannot be directly

extrapolated to project participation rates for a given cohort in subsequent years.




                                        28
We assume that participation continues to grow in the future, but that it grows

more slowly than in the past. The maximum participation rate attained is under

60 percent for all but the five cohorts that retire between 2035 and 2040. For

those groups, the latter cohorts the projected participation rate attains 75 percent

in some in instances.

                        We have projected the average 401(k) retirement assets of families who

will attain age 65 between now and 2040. We have also considered how the

advance of 401(k) plans will affect future wealth for families with different levels

of Social Security wealth. We group families by Social Security wealth because

a large fraction of households now rely primarily on Social Security benefits for

support in retirement and we want to understand how these families in particular




                                                         29
will be affected by the spread of 401(k) plans. The results reported here are

taken for the most part from Poterba, Venti, and Wise [2007d].

        For comparison, we tabulate the composition of household wealth for

households between ages 63 and 67 in 2000 in the HRS. We do not show the

detail here, but a striking feature of these data is the relationship of assets at

retirement to “lifetime earnings.” Figure 5-2 shows the ratio of dedicated

retirement assets (the sum of DB, 401(k), SS, IRA, and Keogh assets) to lifetime

earnings for households in each Social Security wealth decile. It also shows the

ratio of total wealth to lifetime earnings. There is little variation across deciles

and no systematic increase in total wealth with rising Social Security wealth.

        Over the next 35 years our projections show an enormous increase in the

401(k)-like assets of future retirees. Figure 5-3 shows the average 401(k) assets



                                           30
of all persons reaching age 65 in each decade between 2000 and 2040,

assuming that historical rates of return on equities persist into the future. By

2040, the projections suggest that the average 65-year old will have over

$450,000 (in year 2000 dollars) in personal retirement accounts. Figure 5-4

shows that if future equity returns fall 300 basis points below the historical

average, average 401(k)-like wealth at retirement will be almost $270,000.

       These projections are roughly in line with projections contained in other

studies that have modeled aspects of the retirement accumulation process.

Holden and VanDerhei [2002a, b] project 401(k) at retirement for persons who

are age 26 to 35 in 2000. They base their projections of future participation rates

on the 2000 cross-section by age and thus do not allow for younger cohorts to

have higher participation rates than older cohorts had at the same age. Their

results are presented in terms of the proportion of pre-retirement income that will

be replaced by 401(k) income after retirement. Although it is difficult to directly

compare their estimates to ours, their baseline estimates suggest that 401(k)

income will replace between 50 and 70 percent of pre-retirement income. Purcell

[2007] calculates 401(k) accumulations for young households in 2004 under the

assumption of 100 percent participation. He projects a median 401(k) balance at

age 65 of $844,000 in year 2004 dollars.

            To put these data in a broader economic context we show projected total

401(k) assets and projected DB assets relative to projected GDP. The projected

DB assets are from Poterba, Venti and Wise [2007c] and the GDP projections

are the "intermediate" forecasts from the Social Security Administration. Ratios

assuming historical equity returns are shown in Figure 5-5, while ratios calculated

under the assumption that equity returns average 300 basis points below the

past are shown in Figure 5-6. Under both of the equity return assumptions, the

sum of DB and DC assets continues to grow as a percentage of GDP and the

increase in 401(k) assets far outweighs the decrease in DB assets.

            The projections show a very large increase in aggregate 401(k)-like

retirement assets and in total retirement assets including both 401(k) and DB

pensions. Because it appears that 401(k) assets will be the dominant form of

retirement assets for most future retirees, we consider how these assets will

affect the wealth of future retirees. We first show our projections of 401(k) assets

for households in each decile of the Social Security wealth distribution and then

show projections of the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets.

            Figure 5-7 shows the ratio of projected 401(k) assets in 2040 (in year

2000 dollars) to 401(k) assets in 2000, by deciles of the Social Security wealth

distribution, for both of our rate of return assumptions. In both cases the

increase for the second decile is greater than expected because of the Social

Security coverage issues discussed in Poterba, Venti and Wise [2007c]. The first



                                             34
decile includes many households that worked at least part of their career outside

the Social Security system and thus accumulated substantial assets, but little

Social Security wealth. Ratios for the first two deciles are expected to be high

because these households held very little 401(k) wealth in 2000. For both equity

return assumptions, there is a large relative increase for all Social Security

wealth deciles. If historical returns continue, the projections suggest that

households in 2040 would have more than eight times the 401(k) assets held by

households in 2000. Households in 2000 only had at most 18 years to contribute

to a 401(k), and most contributed for fewer than ten years. In 2040, however,

401(k) assets will be based on as many as 40 years of contributions. A similar

pattern arises if equity returns are 300 basis points lower in the future. In this

case the ratio of assets in 2040 to assets in 2000 exceeds five for all Social

Security wealth deciles.

               Finally, for each Social Security wealth decile, Figure 5-8 shows the ratio

of the sum of Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets in 2040 (in year 2000

dollars) to the same sum in 2000. The figure shows the ratios assuming the

historical rate of return on equity, as well as the ratios assuming the return on

equity is 300 basis points less than the historical return. With the exception of

the lowest decile, retirees will have combined Social Security and 401(k) asset

balances in 2040 that are 2.2 to 3.8 times as great as those in 2000 if historical

rates of return prevail. If future returns on equity are 300 basis points lower than

historical returns, the ratio ranges from 1.7 to 2.6 for all but the lowest decile of

the Social Security wealth distribution. There is no systematic pattern across the

Social Security wealth deciles, although the very low level of 401(k) assets in

2000 for persons in the lowest decile makes the ratio very high. Thus our

projections suggest that the spread of 401(k) assets will result in a substantial

increase the retirement assets of persons with the lowest Social Security wealth,

and will result in a doubling or tripling of retirement assets for households in the

rest of the Social Security wealth distribution. Because Social Security wealth is

determined in large part by lifetime earnings, the ratios are similar if households

are grouped by lifetime earnings rather than by Social Security wealth.

6. Summary

               Over the past 25 years, personal retirement accounts have become the

principal form of retirement saving in the United States, especially for persons

who have entered the labor force during this period. While today most

contributions to pension plans are to personal retirement accounts, three

decades ago most contributions were to employer-provided defined benefit



                                                          37
plans. We have described these past changes in the pension landscape,

projected future changes, and considered how these changes will affect the well-

being of future retirees.

       We emphasize three key findings. First, the total value of assets in

retirement accounts has increased substantially since 1980. Assets in all

retirement accounts increased from about 71 percent of NIPA wage and salary

earnings in 1980 to 261 percent in 2005. Thus there has already been a very

large increase in the accumulation of saving for retirement. Although the

demographic structure of the population today is different from that in 1980, and

this means it is not possible to simply compare the aggregate ratio of retirement

wealth to labor income, the increase in the "wealth-to-income" ratio suggests an

increase in the capacity to replace pre-retirement income over this period.

       Second, the proportion of employees covered by at least one pension plan

has remained about the same over the past 25 years, but the proportion covered

by more than one plan has increased substantially. The future spread of 401(k)

plans and the participation rate of eligible employees will likely depend primarily

on the adoption of plans by small firms that currently do not offer pension plans

and by employers’ adoption of plan features such as automatic enrollment and

default options that encourage participation.

       Third, the projections of Poterba, Venti, and Wise [2007b] show that

401(k) assets will increase enormously over the next three decades. The sum of

Social Security wealth and 401(k) assets held by households that reach

retirement age in 2040 will be at least twice as large (in real dollars) as the sum




                                         38
of these assets in 2000. Moreover, retirement assets are projected to grow for

households all along the distribution of Social Security wealth. The advent of

personal account saving is projected to yield very large increases in the financial

assets of future retirees across the lifetime earnings spectrum.
