                   The Real Interest Rate: A Multi—Country

                               Empirical Study




                                   ABSTRACT



     How real interest rates behave over time is critical to our understanding

 of many macroeconomic issues, and much recent research has pursued this ques-

 tion. Very little of the research, however, has focused on real interest

 rates outside the United States. This paper is an empirical exploration of

 real interest rate movements in seven OECD countries from 1967—Il to 1979—Il.

 Further research is needed on real rates in other countries for several

 reasons. Not only are measures of foreign real rates of interest in their own

right, but extending an analysis of real rates to other countries also has the

f.ollowing additional benefits: it can generate more powerful statistical tests

of propositions previously tested on U.S. data and yield information on whether

results found for the U.S. hold up in other countries.

    This study pursues several questions that have arisen naturally from this

earlier work. IS the hypothesis that the real rate is constant rejected when

the analysis is extended to other countries? Does the real rate decline

with increased inflation and money growth in other countries besides the

United States? How reliable is the Fisher effect, in which nominal interest

rates reflect changes in expected inflation? Are movements in nominal interest

rates a reliable indicator of movements in real rates? What kind of variations

in real interest rates are there in different countries? Have real rates

declined from the '60s to the '70s for other countries besides the U.S.?

         How real interest rates behave over time is critical to our understanding

    of many macroeconomic issues, and much recent research has pursued this

    question.1. Very little of the research, however, has focused on real

    interest rates outside the United States.2 In contrast, this paper is an

empirical exploration of real interest rate movements in seven OECD countries

from 1967—11 to 1979—Il.

        Further research is needed on real rates In other countries for several

reasons. Not only are measures of foreign real rates of interest in their own

right, but extending an analysis of real rates to other countries also has the

following additional benefits: it can generate more powerful statistical

tests of propositions previously tested on U. S. data and yield information on

whether results found for the U. S. hold up in other countries.

        A previous paper, Mishkin (1981a), analyzed real interest rates in the

United States. This study pursues several questions that have arisen

naturally from this earlier work. Is the hypothesis that the real rate is

constant rejected when the analysis is extended to other countries? Does the

real rate decline with increased inflation and money growth in other countries

besides the United States? How reliable is the Fisher effect, in which

nominal interest rates reflect changes in expected inflation? Are movements

in nominal interest rates a reliable indicator of movements in real rates?

What kind of variations in real interest rates are there in different

countries? Have real rates declined from the '60s to the '70s for other

countries besides the U. S.?



                               II.   METHODOLOGY




     Each country's real rate of interest for a one—period bond is defined

from the Fisher (1930) equation3



    (1)                  rr+1t

where i =          the nominal interest rate earned on a one—period bond
                   maturing at time t—--i.e., it is the nominal return from

                   holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t.



              =    the rate of inflation from t—1 to t, expected at time t—1.




     All returns, inflation and interest rates in the empirical
     work are assumed to be continuously compounded so that the
     usual additional second order term is not necessary in the
     Fisher equation (1). Note that if holding period real
     returns are used in the empirical work here rather than
     continuously compounded returns, there is almost no change in
     the results. Note also that the definition ignores the
     taxation of nominal interest rates. As pointed out in
     Mishkin (l981a) it is extremely difficult to know what the
     appropriate marginal tax rate is for holders of these one
     period bonds. However, to the extent that the effective
     marginal tax rate is above zero, it will just strengthen some
     of the results found here, such as the negative correlation
     of real rates and inflation.
                                         —3—

             rr =     the   one—period real rate of interest expected for the bond

                      maturing at time t.



 Hence, the real interest rate, rrt, is just the difference between the nominal

 rate of interest and the expected rate of inflation: it is the real return

 from holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t which is expected at time t—

 1. Because the real rate is a return expected at the beginning of the period,

 it is also frequently referred to as the ex ante real rate. The more precise

 terminology is used to differentiate it    from the ex post real rate, namely,
 the   actual real return from holding the one—period bond from t—1 to t.      It
equals the nominal interest rate minus the actual inflation rate from t—1 to t
and can be written as



       (2)
                      eprr i —             rr   —   (it —


where                eprrt =   the one—period ex post real rate for the bond

                     maturing at time t,



                        =   the actual inflation rate from t—1 to t.


Note that for expositional convenience, the ex ante real rate is always

referred to as the real rate throughout this paper, while the ex post real

rate always refers to the variable defined in (2).

       The underlying assumption behind the methodology used here is rationality
                                           —4--


of inflation expectations in the bond market, which yields the condition4



                            =
      (3)
                                E(1rtIi)

where           =   all   available information at time t—1.



Note that the rationality of inflation expectations is necessary and

sufficient for the rationality of the ex ante real rate, implying that the ex

ante real rate equals the expected real return on the one—period bond,

conditional on available information: i.e.




      (4)                 rr =   E(eprrI41)

       There is a large body of evidence that supports this rationality, or

equivalently the efficiency of financial markets, and tests directed more

specifically at the rationality of inflation forecasts in the bond market also

support the use of this assumption over long sample periods such as are used

here.5

       If the real rate determined at t—1, rrt, is correlated with observable

variables, X_1 which are elements of the available information

set         then we can write the linear projection of rr into X_1 as:




      An alternative methodology would involve using survey data to measure
      inflationary expectations in order to construct real rates. Mishkin
      (1981a) discusses why the methodology used here should be nre reliable.


      See Mishkin (1983).
                                                    —5—

        (5)                    P(rrI1) =          X1
    and then



        (6)                    rr =           +


where



                  =
                      rr   —
                               P(rrtlXti)

Note that P(utjX_i) = 0 by using the law of iterated projections,6 and so Ut

is orthogonal to X_1. Furthermore, Ut is also in the information

set            because economic agents observe the ex—ante real rate even if the

econometrician cannot.             Equation (5) cannot be estimated because rr is not

observable. However, substituting (6) into (2) and writing the inflation

forecast error as              we get:



       (7)                     eprr =             + u —


where
                                         e
                               Ct =1r —11.
                                      t   t




        Since data on the ex post real rate are observable, the above equation

can be estimated for each country with ordinary least squares (OLS). How do

       See Sargent (1981) for an excellent exposition of linear projection and
       the law of interated projections.
                                        —6—

the resulting estimates relate to what would have been obtained from OLS

estimates of (6) if it were estimable? The rationality of inflation

expectations implies that the error term        has the attractive property that



       (8)             E(EtIt_i) = 0



so that it is uncorrelated with all past available information which includes

Xtl and u. It is then easy to demonstrate, as in Mishkin (1981b), that the

resulting      estimates will have the desirable property that they will be

consistent estimates of .       This result indicates that, although we cannot
observe the ex ante real rate, rr, we can infer information about its

relationship with variables known at time t—l via ex post real rate

regressions.

       Although the procedure followed here will yield consistent estimates of

the real rate projection in (5), we must be careful in interpreting the

results. Nothing in the empirical work here demonstrates that the variables

in X_1 are exogenous and thus there is no guarantee that the estimated        are

consistent estimates of the effects on real rates from exogenous changes in

the X—variables.

       An even more interesting issue for the methodology here is the situation

where relevant information has been excluded from X1. Assume that the true

real rate has the following linear relationship to X_1 and another relevant

set of information Z_1 which has been ignored by the econometrician.



       (9)             rr =         +
                                        ZtitS

then

    (10)             P(rrjXti) = Xt 1(X'X) X(X* + Z)

                                 =
                                     Xi[   *            —1
                                               + (x'x) z5]


Equation (10) above tells us that the      estimate from the ex—post real rate
                                                                               *
regression where Z_1 is excluded will not be a consistent estimate of
Indeed the larger is    and the more correlated Z1 is with              the more

serious this bias becomes. Hence, even if X_1 were exogenous, leaving out

relevant information would lead to inconsistent estimates of the effects from

changes in X1.
     The remarks above indicate that, without further identifying information,

it is not appropriate to make inferences on causation from the results

produced here. Nonetheless they are useful. This paper is a study in the

measurement of real rates. Knowing how real rates have moved with other

variables and how they have moved over time is important to constructing

theories of what determines real rate movements. The estimates of the

projection equation yield exactly this information.

     For purposes of inference on the movement of real rates and the

relationship of real rates with the X—variables, we need to calculate

appropriate standard errors for the     and the estimated real rates. An

important element of the methodology in this paper is the use of non—

overlapping data——i.e. where the forecast horizon is never longer than the

observation interval——because rational expectations then implies that c is -

serially   uncorrelated. As has been emphasized in Nelson and Schwert (1977)

and Mishkin (l981a,b), forecast errors of inflation are probably extremely

large and much greater in magnitude than the ups. Hence, even if u were

serially correlated or correlated with past C,        the amount of serial
correlation in the composite error term u —      c,   should necessarily be slight.
                                    —8

Evidence in Mishkin (l981b) supports this view and the results below also find

that serial correlation is not a serious problem.7

     One advantage from using data on several countries is that we can conduct

joint tests for several countries at once. This can result in more powerful

statistical tests of propositions such as the constancy of real rates because

more data are exploited in conducting these tests. One pitfall to beware is

that these joint tests cannot be conducted by estimating each country's OLS

constrained and unconstrained regressions separately, adding up their sum of

squares, and then carrying out the usual comparison to construct the F—




   For example, in the regressions used to generate the estimated real rates
   in Figures 2—8 the residual autocorrelations do not display any evidence
   of serial correlation. The Durbin—Watson statistics range from 1.74 to
   2.36, none of which indicate the presence of first order serial
   correlations and none of the Ljung—Box (1978) Q(12) statistics reject the
   null hypothesis that the first twelve residual autocorrelations all equal
   zero: the Q(12) statistics range from 5.23 to 17.88 while the critical
   value at the 5% level is 21.0 In regressions with fewer explanatory
   variables there are a few cases where Durbin—Watson statistics sometimes
   fall below 1.6 but never below 1.0. However, this is an unusual
   occurence. Coldfeld—Quandt (1965) tests also did not indicate that the
   homoscedasticity assumption is strongly violated. For example in the
   regressions used to generate Figures 2—8 there was only one rejection of
   homoscedasticity in the seven CPI regressions and one in the seven WPI
   regressions. However, these rejection were not for the same country and
   there was no consistent pattern of the variance of the residuals having a
   similar upward or downward trend in all the countries.

OLS parameter estimates in different equations is being ignored.9

    This is equivalent to generating the test statistics using a standard
    seemingly unrelated regression package where the variance—covariance
    matrix of the residuals is specified to be diagonal.

     Since we must allow for covariance of the residuals and the parameter
     estimates In order to generate correct F—statistics, why are the models
     estimated here with OLS rather than a GLS seemingly unrelated regressions
     technique. Furthermore, using OLS was actually far more costly in time
     and effort than GLS because standard econometric packages (such as SAS or
    TSP) are not set up to calculate the F—statistics in (12) easily. There
    are two primary reasons why OLS Is preferred. First, one sensible view of
    results from cx post real rate regressions is that they are nothing more
    than useful summary statistics when OLS is used. The OLS results have an
    easy interpretation In terms of the comprehensible concept of
    correlation. If the regressions are not viewed as reduced forms, however,
    then GLS results have no easy interpretation. Second, when GLS is used in
    estimation, the parameter estimates from ex post regressions no longer
    have the desirable property that they are equal in the expectation (or in
    the probability limit) to those obtained from cx ante real rate
    regressions. It is easy to demonstrate that they will only be equal if
    the variance—covariance matrix of C is proportional to the variance—
    cov-arjance matrix of u. The use of OLS rather than GLS does not
    appreciably affect the results in this paper. The GLS standard errors are
    slightly smaller and test statistics slightly higher as we mIght expect,
    while the parameter estimates are quite close to those reported in the
    text. The basic conclusions of the paper thus do not change. The GLS
    results are available from the author on request.

The following points about the rr estimate of the real rate are now easily

seen. It will be a consistent estimate of rr only if u equals zero. This

will occur if no relevant information is left out of the explanatory variables

in the ex post real rate regression or if the information left out is

perfectly correlated with the X_1 information. Therefore, the consistency of

the real rate estimate does not depend on the consistency of the

estimate. Indeed, paradoxically, the more highly correlated is the left out

information with X_1, the more inconsistent is the        estimate, but the more

consistent is the rr estimate.

     Even if rr is not a consistent estimate of the real rate because u is

non zero, we can still use it to conduct inference about the actual real rate

because we can calculate the variance of its within sample error. Mishkin

(1981a) derives this to be1°

                          rrt)   =   (   —

     Since we do not know the relative size of the variance of u and C,    the
formula in (17) cannot be used directly to yield the standard errors of the

estimated real rates. However, we can calculate bounds on the standard errors




10 This derivation requires that u as well as c is serially uncorrelated.
   This can be achieved by including lags of the ex post real rate in
   This is not necessary in the models used to derive rr in Figure 2—8
   because they do not display any' serial correlation in the residuals (see
   footnote 7) and four lagged values of the ex post real rate do not add
   significant explanatory power to these models.

for    two extreme cases. With the estimated standard error of the regression

denoted by a, if all variation in the error term is attributed to the forecast

error of inflation, then a = 0 and a = a                            .   The standard error of the

       If none of the variation in the error term is attributed to the forecast

error of inflation, then           =   0,       a =    a,       and the standard error of the

estimated real rate is

exceed greatly that of u, SE6 should be a far more accurate measure of the
true standard error than SEU•          Thus           in the discussion of the estimated real

      Note that the more that one's prior is that important information has been

      knowLi to have been excluded, the true standard error wil still be closer
       to   SE than to SEu

                             III.   EMPIRICAL RESULTS



THE DATA

      Obviously, there is no unique real interest rate. The magnitude of a

real rate depends not only on the risk charcteristics of the security being

studied, but also on the price index used to calculate real returns. What is

the appropriate price index depends on what economic decision is being

analyzed. For example, if we are interested in the savings——consumption

decision, a price index based on a commodity bundle of consumption goods, such

as the CPI, is appropriate. If, on the other hand, we are interested in

decisions to trade among countries, then a price index with tradeable goods a

larger proportion of its commodity bundle, such as the WPI, is more

appropriate.

      This study analyzes real interest rates in the Euro deposit market in the

1967—Il to 1979—11 period for the following OECD countries: the United

States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, West Germany, the Netherlands,

and Switzerland. Quarterly data on threemonth euro rates obtained from the

Harris Bank tape are used in this study for several reasons.'2 High quality

data for domestic, short—term interest rates are not readily available for

other countries besides the United States and Canada. Unlike the U. S. and

Canada, other countries' treasury bill rates are not market clearing, so that




12
     Only seven of the ten countries' data available in the tape are used here
     because three of the countries——Italy, Belgium and Japan——either had a
     high proportion of the data missing or did not satisfy interest partity
     because of two—tiered exchange rates. In the few cases where euro rate.
     data were missing for the seven countries, the euro rate was calculated
     from the interest parity condition. The rest of the data were checked by
     verifying that there were no large deviations from interest parity.
     Several obvious errors in the tape were found in this manner and were
     corrected.
                                   — 14 —



these data, although available, do not reflect the true cost of credit. Euro
rates, however, are market clearing. In addition, euro deposits denominated

in different countries' currencies are issued by the same bank and therefore

have similar default risk and are not subject to capital controls because they

are offshore securities. Hence a comparison of real euro rates across

countries will not have to be adjusted for differing default risks or non—

comparability because of capital market controls. Quarterly data on three—

month rates have the advantage that the data are non—overlapping and timing

problems that would arise with monthly data are avoided.'3 The dating

convention is as follows. The ex post real rate for a quarter is the actual

real return on a three—month euro deposit held from the beginning to the end

of that quarter, continuously compounded. For each country the ex post real

rate is constructed by subtracting the continously compounded inflation rate

for that country from the continuously compounded nominal return on the euro




13 See Mishkin (1981a).
                                    — 15 —



deposit   denominated in that country's currency.'4 Both the CPI and WPI are

used in the empirical analysis to calculate inflation rates for the reasons

discussed above. The money growth and inflation variables are calculated as

the change in the log of the money stock or price level, from the last month

of the previous quarter to the current quarter, and are also quarterly

rates. The euro rate and U. S. treasury bill data were obtained from the

Harris Bank tape maintained at the University of Chicago and the CPI, WPI and

money stock data were obtained from the International Financial Ststistics

(IFS) tape maintained by the International Monetary Fund.



RESULTS

     The null hypothesis of the constancy of the euro real rates is studied

heçe with two types of tests which are similar to those carried out in Fama

(1975) and Mishkin (1981a). These tests correspond to the weak form and semi—

strong form distinction discussed in the efficient markets literature by Fama

(1970).

     Table 1 contaIns the weak form tests whIch look at the first twelve




14 These real rates seem to be the most natural to study, but matching
                                                                       up the
   country's price index with the euro deposit rate denominated in its
   currency is somewhat arbitrary. Clearly a Frenchman might also be
   interested in his real return from holding a U. S. dollar denominated euro
   deposit even though the price index relevant to him is, say, the French
   CPI. If uncovered interest parity holds, which will be the case when the
   forward exchange rate is an unbiased forecast of the spot exchange rate
   since interest parity in euro rates is a pure arbitrage condition, then
   the real euro rate for a Frenchman will be the same regardless of the
   denomination of the euro deposit. Thus in this case only the real euro
   rates analyzed in this paper need to be studied. However, recent evidence
   does not support the unbiasedness of the forward rate prediction or
   uncovered interest parity (for example see Cumby and Obstfeld (1981,
   1982), Hansen and Hodrick (1980) and Mishkin (1982). Thus it is
   potentially worth studying real rates where the currency denomination of
   the euro rate is not matched up to the price index for that country. This
   Is not done here because it would make this already long paper unwieldly.

autocorrelations   of the ex post real rates. The constancy of the real rate

implies that all the autocorrelations should equal zero. It is formally

tested with the adjusted Q—statistic suggested by Ljung and Box (1978). The

Q(12) statistic is distributed approximately as x2(12), and its marginal

significance level is the probability of getting that value of the test

statistic or higher under the null hypothesis of all autocorrelations equaling

zero: i.e., a marginal significance level less than .05 indicates a rejection

of the null hypothesis at the five percent level. The serial correlation

pattern for the ex post real rate in Table 1 is similar to that found for U.S.

treasury bill data in Mishkin (l981a). The first four or five

autocorrelations are usually positive with a high percentage significantly

different from zero. The Q(12) statistic rejects the null hypothesis implied

by the constancy of the real rate (at the 5% level) in 11 out of 14 cases, and

only the ex post real rate for the dutch guilder displays no evidence of

serial correlation.

     Table 2 contains the semi—strong form tests for whether the ex post real

rates in the seven OECD countries, and hence the real rates, are correlated

with other variables whose values are known when the real rate was determined,

i.e., at time t—1. The F—statistics in Table 2 test the null hypothesis that

all coefficients of the explanatory variables in the real rate model for each

country, except the constant terms, are zero. Line 2.1 follows Mishkin

(1981a) in conducting a mechanical test of the constancy of the real rate by

postulating that the real rate for each country moves with a fourth order

The null hypothesis of the constancy of the real rate implies that 0 and

thus the coefficients on Tt_i in the ex—post real rate regression, O must

also equal zero. The main advantage of this mechancial test is that it does

not require knowledge of what the X1 variables are and may thus capture some

effects from variables which belong in the relevant information set but have

been ignored by the econometrician.




hypothesis is less than one in 10 mIllion. Line 2.2 uses economic variables

to explain real rate movements while line 2.3 uses both the economic and

noneconomic time variables to explain real rates. Note that the ex post real

rate regressions for each country use only its own economic variables for

explanatory variables and not those of other countries. Clearly other

countries economic variables might affect domestic real rates, but if each

country's regressions included all other countries' economic variables, almost

all degrees of freedom would have been used up. Again, the rejection of the

null hypothesis is strong, and in one case the marginal significance level

drops below io"38. The rejection in Table 2 of the constancy of the real

rates jointly in all seven countries is stonger than is the case for any

country alone.'6 This demonstrates the increased power of joint statistical

tests for several countries.

(1981a) found a strong negative correlation of real U.S. Treasury bill rates

with U. S. inflation lagged one period. Does this negative realationship of

real rates and inflation hold up in the data here? The CPI results in System

3.1 to Table 3 provides only weak evidence that It does. The negative

association of each country's real rate and lagged inflation appears in all

seven countries. However, only two of these seven negative coefficients is

signficantly different from zero, and the F—test for whether all of the

inflation coefficients are zero is not rejected at the 5% level. Particularly

surprising is the weak association of the U. S. euro dollar real rate and

lagged U. S. inflation, considering the strong association found with Treasury

bill data in Mishkin (l981b).

     This result Illustrates the important point that real rates for

securities with different risk characteristics need not move together. The

U.S. Treasury bill is a rlskless interest rate in nominal terms while the euro

dollar rate bears some default risk. The risk preminum for the three month

euro dollar rate is plotted in Figure 1 and It does have substantial variation

over time. Two periods are particularly important in this regard: 1969 and

1974. Both periods displayed a very large premium of the three month Euro

dollar rate over the three month U.S. Treasury bill rate. Both periods were


    explanatory power Is .00003 versus l.l2xl08 for the joint
    test.


17 One factor behind the positive correlation of the premium and inflation
    could be Regulation Q. When inflation rises, nominal interest rates would
    rise as well in the U. S. via a standard Fisher effect. With Regulation Q
    binding so that banks cannot compete for deposits in the U.S., they might
    go into the euro market and bid for funds, thus possibly raising euro
    rates relative to U. S domestic rates. Another factor might be the
    greater uncertainty in the international financial system as a result of
    financial crises: the Penn Central bankruptcy and major bank failures such
    as Franklin National and the Herstadt bank. The determination of the
    premium on euro dollar rates over U.S. T—bill rates is an interesting
    question that deserves further research.

 also a time of high inflation.'7 Hence, the positive correlation of the risk

 premium and inflation could be obscuring the negative relationship of real

 rates and inflation. This possibility is explored by adjusting the euro

 dollar rates for default risk by subtracting the premium of the three—month

 euro dollar rate over the three—month U.S. Treasury bill from each country's

 euro rate. In the case of the U.S., this leaves us with the three—month

Treasury bill rate, while for other countries this leaves us with a nominal

 rate that is adjusted for bank default risk, but not for any political risk

borne by domestic securities.'8 The resulting estimates can be found in

system 3.2. All the inflation coefficients are negative, and now the

inflation coefficient in the U.S. regression is statistically significant and

has a very similar value to that found in Mishkin (1981a) which used a

soniewhat different sample period. The joint test of the null hypothesis that

the inflation variables have no explanatory power is now rejected at the 5

percent level.

      Systems 3.3 and 3.4 add three more lags of inflation to the models of

Systems 3.1 and 3.2 because they have significant additional explanatory

power,'9 and here the evidence is far stronger on the negative realationship

of real rates and inflation. The sum of the inflation coefficients in each

country is always negative, and the explanatory power of the inflation

variables is highly significant: the null hypothesis that their coefficients

equal zero is rejected at extremely small marginal significance levels.

      Panel B of Table 3 contains the results using the WPI for each country as

     The null hypothesis that their coefficients are different
     from zero can be rejected at the one percent level.
     F(21,308) = 3.61 while the critical F at 1 percent is 1.9.

the price index. The inflation coefficients always have negative sums and,
even in the System 3.5 results where the euro rates are not adjusted for

default risk and only one lag of inflation is included, the hypothesis that

these negative inflation coefficients equal zero is rejected very strongly.

Overall then, the results in Table 3 do strongly support the existence of a

negative correlation between Inflation and real rates in other countries

besides the United States.

     Mishkin (l981a) found evidence that, as we might expect from standard

monetary theory, money growth and real rates in the United States are

negatively correlated. However, only weak evidence was found that money

growth has explanatory power over and above that associated with inflation.

Table 4 yields evidence on this issue for the seven countries studied here.

Note that only one lag of each country's money growth is used as an

explanatory variable because additional lags did not contain significant

additional explanatory power.2° The CPI results in Panel A show that real

rates for other countries besides the U. S. are negatively associated with

lagged money growth in that country. The money growth coefficients are

negative in 13 out of 14 cases in Panel A, and the hypothesis that all the

money growth coefficients equal zero is always rejected at the 1 percent




20   The null hypothesis that coefficients on three more lags on money growth
     are zero cannot be rejected at the five percent level. Using the CPI,
     F(21,308) = 1.46 and using the WPI,F(21,308) = 1.34, while the critical
     value of F at 5% is 1.6.

21 For example when one lag of inflation for each country is added as a
     explanatory variable to the regressions in System 4.1, the null hypothesis
     that the coefficients on money growth are zero can be rejected at the one
     percent level, F(7,322) = 3.70 while the critical value of F at 1% is
     2.04. Although we could Interpret this result as indicating that monetary
     policy has an independent effect on real rates, it is also possible that
     money growth has significant explanatory power because it helps forecast
     inflation, and it is expected inflation which is negatively correlated
     with the real rate.

level.2'   In addition when lagged inflation for each country is also included

in the regressions, the money growth coefficients continue to be negative and

significantly different from zero. The finding here of an Independent

association of money growth and real rates over and above that coming from

inflation is stonger than was found for U. S. data alone, as in Mishkin

(1981a). Again this demonstrates the usefulness of analyzing data from many

countries. The WPI   results   display only a weak tendency towards a negative

association of real rates and money growth: the money growth coefficients for

each country are negative in 9 out of 14 cases in Panel B, and the explanatory

power of money growth is not strong: the null hypothesis of zero money growth

coefficients cannot be rejected at the 5% level.

      Results with U. S. data in Nishkin (1981a) indicated that movements in

noniinal interest rates were not positively correlated with real rates in the

post war period. Hence, nominal interest rates may have been a misleading

indicator of the tightness of monetary policy in this period. Has this been

true for other countries besides the United States? Table 5 presents evidence

on the relation of real and nominal rates for the seven OECD countries.22

      The System 5.1 CPI results indicate that not only is the real euro rate

not significantly correlated with the nominal euro rate for the U. S., but

this is also true for the United Kingdom and Canada. The 5.1 results for the

other countries are, however, quite different. France, Germany, the




22   Additional lags of euro rates are not included as explanatory variables
     because this would have cut down on the sample period and because evidence
     on their explanatory power is mixed. The null hypothesis that
     coefficients on three lags of euro rates are zero cannot be rejected at
     the five percent level. Using the CPI: F(21,287) = .90 However using
     the WPI, F(21,287) = 1.81, while the critical value of F at 5% is 1.6.
     Note that the degrees of freedom in this test are smaller than In
     footnotes 19 and 20 because three observations for each country are lost
     when three lags of euro rates are included as explanatory variables.

Netherlands and Switzerland display strong significant positive correlations
of nominal and real euro rates. Indeed, the null hypothesis that the real

euro rate moves one for one with the nominal euro rate cannot be rejected for

these countries. Thus, contrary to the U. S. case, movements in nominal

interest rates do provide information on the movements in real rates in

France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

      We might suspect that positive associations of real and nominal euro

rates using the CPI appear because of the substantial variation in the default

risk premium pictured in Figure 1, which is reflected in both real and nominal

euro rates. However, when the cx post real rates are adjusted for default

risk in System 5.3, the positive correlation of the real rate with the nominal

euro rate continues to be significant for France, Germany and the

Netherlands. The WPI results in Table 5 do not display as strong a positive

association between real and nominal rates as the CPI results. Only France

and the Netherlands display a significant positive correlation of real and

nominal rates, and when the real euro rate is adjusted for default risk, the

correlation is no longer significant for the Netherlands. Nevertheless the

pattern displayed in the CPI results is repeated in the WPI results: real

rates in France, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland are more positively




23
     Even though all variables in the empirical work are calculated as
     quarterly rates the figures report the real rates as annual rates.
24
     For the CPI system the F—statistic which tests the null hypothesis that
     the coefficients on the time variables arg zero is F(28,266) = 3.05 with a
     marginal significance level of 1.57 x l0 . For the WPI system, F(28,266)
     = 1.53 with a marginal significance level of .0484. As should be clear
     from footnote 15, the time variables are proxying for additional economic
     information over and above the inflation and money growth variables that
     belong in the real rate projection equations. One possiblity is that the
     time variables proxy for world wide economic factors that are related to
     red rate movements in all countries.

associated with nominal rates than is true for the U.S., Canada, and the

TJ.K. Thus, using movements in nominal rates as a guide to movements in real

rates would me more misleading for the latter countries than the former,

regardless of whether the CPI or WPI is used in calculating real rates.

     We now turn to measures of the real euro rates for the 1967—Il to 1979—Il

sample period. Figures 2 through 8 contain estimated real rates derived from

model 2.3 in Table 2 which includes as explanatory variables for each country

all the economic variables as well as a fourth—order polynominal in time.23

The time variables are included because they do contain significant additional

explanatory power in the CPI and WPI systems.24 Figures 2 through 8 also

contain 95% confidence intervals for the estimated real rates for the two

extreme cases of equations (18) and (19) where: a) all the variance of the

composite error term is attributed to forecast errors of inflation (the dotted

lines) or b) none of the variance of the composite error term is attributed to

the forecast errors of inflation (the dashed lines). Here, the discussion of

inference will focus on the dotted—lines confidence interval because, as

argued in Section II, this case is likely to be closer to reality.

     The U. S. results in Figure 2 are qualitatively similar to those found

with Treasury bill data in Mishkin (l981a). In the period of the '60s the

real euro dollar rate is positive and is frequently significantly so. In the

'70s the real rate has fallen and fluctuates around zero. The significantly

negative real rates for U. S. Treasury bills in the '70s rarely appear in the

euro market because, as is seen in Figure 1, the default risk premium averages

around 2 percent during this period. Canada's real rates are very close to

those of the U. S., as might be expected, while the British real euro rates

have greater fluctuations with significantly negative estimated real rates

appearing in 1975 and 1976. The greater fluctuation in British real rates is

not surprising considering the larger fluctuations in the British inflation
rates. The French estimated real rates are particularly interesting because

the results are so different depending on whether the CPI or WPI is used to

caldulate real returns. Both the CPI and WPI results indicate very high rates

during the exchange rate crisis of 1968 and these are significantly

positive. In 1974 both real rates rise substantially. However, the WPI real

rate reaches an annual rate of 33 percent, while the CPI real rate only rises

to 8 percent. The sharp differences in the French CPI and WPI real rates are

the result of widely diverging patterns of CPI and WPI inflation for

France.25 Particularly striking is the fact that the French WPI actually

declines in 1974 while the CPI inflation rate is substantial. This deflation

of the WPI when the nominal French euro rate was high is the source of the

unusually high WPI real rate in 1974. The German, Dutch and Swiss estimated

real rates are also positive in the late 60's, sometimes significantly so;

decline somewhat until 1974, rise and then fall in 1974; and then fluctuate

around zero thereafter.

     The estimated real rates in Figures 2 through 8 do have substantially

different values in the seven OECD countries —   real   rate differentials of

over 10 percent are not uncommon — but there are some similarities. The real

euro rates are positive for most countries in the late '60s, decline

thereafter, rise in 1974 and then fall back down again. More formal tests of

the relations of these real rates across countries can be found in Mishkin

(1982).

     The estimates of the real rate in Figures 2—8 can be used to derive

estimates of the expected inflation rate for each country, ITe.      It is easily

calculated   by substracting the estimated real rate, rr, from the nominal

interest rate, i: i.e.

and its error is



     (21)                =   — rr   —
                                             rr)   =
                                                       —(rr
                                                              —
                                                                  rr).
Because this measure of expected inflation is likely to be more rational than

alternative survery measures, Mishkin (1981a) argues that it is a potentially

more accurate measure of the expected inflation rate. In addition, since the

absolute value of Its error equals that of the estimated real rate, standard

error bounds are obtainable from equations (18) and (19).

     Figures 9—15 show the relationship between each country's estimated

expected inflation, real rates and nominal interest rates.26 Table 6 provides

the correlations of these variables for each country. Because there may be

non—stationarity in these variables, we must be somewhat cautious in drawing

inferences from these correlations. They are useful, however, as summary

statistics that can help us pick out the co—movements in the figures.

     As we would expect from the significant correlation of ex post real rates

and lagged inflation, the negative correlation of expected Inflation and real

euro rates Is sizeable. However, despite this, there is evidence of the

Fisher effect: i.e., the positive correlation of expected inflation and

nominal interest rates. It is strong for the United States, Canada and the

United Kingdom using both the CPI and WPI price indices, but is much less so

for Germany, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. As is found in the

earlier regression results, there is an usually strong positive association

between nominal and real euro rates for France, Germany, the Netherlands and

Switzerland, while this is not the case for the United States, Canada and the

United Kingdom. However, what is striking in Table 6 is the finding that

Fama's (1975) conclusion that, in the post—war period, movements in nominal

rates primarily reflect movements in expected inflation is not generally true

outside of the United States. Only Canada and the United Kingdom join the

United States in displaying this phenomenon. To the contrary, for France, the

Netherlands and Switzerland using both price indices, and Germany using the

CPI, movements in nominal rates are less highly correlated with movements in

expected inflation than they are with movements in real rates.



                                    IV. CONCLUSIONS



     This paper has studied real rate movements in seven OECI countries over

the 1967—Il to 1979 II sample period. The empirical analysis has been

directed at several questions posed in the introduction and now, is an

appropriate time to provide answers by way of summarizing the empirical

evidence.



    1.      The hypothesis that the real rates in these countries is constant is

            rejected at extrmely low marginal significance levels. The

            rejections here are exceedingly strong and confirm a similar finding

            for U. S. data alone.

2.   The real rates in these countries do decline with increased

     inflation. This confirms that this relationship is not unique to the

     United States.



3.   Real Rates in these countries also decline with higher money

     growth. This non—neutrality result which has been previously found

     for the U. S. seems to be prevalent elsewhere.



4.   Nominal Euro rates have not been reliable indicators of the movements

     in real rates for the United Kingdom and Canada as well as the United

     States. This gives some further justification for why nominal

     interest rates might have been a misleading target for monetary

     policy in these countries. In contrast, France, Germany, the

     Netherlands, and Switzerland frequently exhibit a strong positive

     correlation of nominal and real rate movements. Thus nominal

     interest rates may be less misleading as an indicator of monetary

     tightness in these countries than has been true for the United

     States, the United Kingdom and Canada.



5.   In the seven countries, real euro rates have been most positive in-

     the late 1960's, decline somewhat thereafter, rose briefly in 1974

     and then have come back down again. Significant negative real euro

     rates rarely appear in the 1970's in contrast to findings for the

     U.S. Treasury bill market, but this is explained by the substantial

     default risk in the euro market in this period.

6.   There is a strong negative association of real Interest rates and

     expected inflation for all seven countries, but nevertheless there is

     some evidence of a Fisher effect where higher expected inflation is

     associated with higher nominal interest rates. However, this effect

     does not appear to be as strong for France, Germany, the Netherlands

     and Switzerland as it is for the United States, Canada and the United

     Kingdom.



7.   Fama's (1975) finding that movements in U. S. nominal interest rates

     in the post war period are more closely associated with movements in

     expected inflation than with movements in real rates is not generally

     true outside of the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.

     The opposite result Is found for France, the Netherlands, Switzerland

     and sometimes Germany.
