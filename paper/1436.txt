                    Adjusting the Gross Changes Data:
                 Implications for Labor Market Dynamics


                                  ABSTRACT




   This paper develops a procedure for adjusting the Current Population Survey

gross changes data for the effects of reporting errors. The corrected data

suggest that the labor nBrket is much less dynamic than has frequently been

suggested. Conventional measures sy understate the duration of unemployment by

as much as eighty percent and overstate the extent of novement into and out of

the lp.bor force by several hundred percent. The adjusted data also throw

demographic differences in patterns of labor nExket dynamics into sharp relief.

      The dynamics of the American labor market have been an important focus of

research over the last decade. Early work by Hall (12], Feldstein [8] and

Marston 1161 suggested that nost unemployment was due to normal turnover, not

to individuals with special employment problems. A typical conclusion was

that of Feldstein who wrote that "almost everyone who is out of work can find

his usual job in a relatively short time." This dynamic view of unemployment

has been challenged in the ire recent work of Clark and Summers [6] and

Akerlof and Main 12].    Clark   and Summers in particular focus on how analysts

can   be misled by spurious labor market transitions, writing that "it seems
likely that some of the observed flows (into and out of the labor force)
arise from inconsistent reporting of consistent behavior [7, p. 281." This
paper re—examines the empirical basis of these debates.

   Studies of labor market dynamics are of necessity based on survey

data. In some cases inferences are drawn from individual responses to

retrospective questions. In other cases, presumably nre accurate inferences

are drawn from panel data in which individuals are interviewed several times.

The BLS Gross Changes data, which have been tabulated since l948, are a major

source of such information about individuals' labor market experience. While

the data have not been published in recent years due to concerns about accuracy,

they have been used in numerous studies of labor market dynaniics.l

   The report of the National Commission on Employment and Unemployment

Statistics [171 recommended that despite the data difficulties, the BLS

should resume publication of the gross flows data on an occasional basis.

The Commission concluded that "the importance of Current Population Survey—

based gross changes data for enhancing understanding of changes in the labor

market requires that very high priority be given to improvement in the data.
                                      —2—


    It is possible, of course, that a solution will not be achieved, but the

potential value of the data warrants an intensive effort [17, p. 2171."

   In   using longitudinal data, the flows of individuals between different labor

market states are derived by comparing the responses of individuals on two dif-

ferent survey dates. On each survey, some individuals are incorrectly

classified with respect to labor market status. While these errors may largely

cancel in tabulations of the unemployment rate or other labor market aggregates,

estimated flow rates between labor market states are extremely sensitive to

them. Individuals who are misclassified in one month but not in the next will

be reported as moving from one state to another even though their behavior has

not changed. Some observed transitions will therefore be spurious, leading to

overestimates of the amount of turnover and mobility in the labor market. Such

errors can substantially bias estimates of the expected duration of both

unemployment and nonparticipation spells. They are also likely to bias inferen-

ces about subtler aspects of labor market dynamics, such as efforts to estimate

"state dependence" effects.

   This paper presents a technique for correcting the classification

errors which plague the Current Population Survey (cPs) gross flows data.

Similar techniques could readily be applied to other data sets.    We use the

CPS Reinterview Survey to estimate the incidence of errors in the gross

changes data, and then calculate revised flows by adjusting for spurious

transitions. The results of our procedure suggest that conventional measures

greatly overstate flows into and out of the labor force. As a consequence,

standard estimates of unemployment durations, whether based directly on gross
                                      —3—


flows data or on other information such as the average duration of completed

or incomplete spells, are biased downwards.      The labor force attachment of

some groups, notably women and   teenagers,   has also been significantly

underestimated.

   This paper is divided into four sections. The first explains our proce-

dure for estimating the incidence of response errors which affect the CPS and

therefore the gross changes data. Section Two presents our algorithm for

adjusting the gross changes data, and contrasts our revised labor market

flows with the unadjusted data. The third section uses the adjusted flows to

analyze several characteristics of the American labor market, focussing on

differences in the experience of different demographic groups. There is a

brief concluding section which suggests several directions for future work.

 1.    The Incidence of Classification Errors in the Current Population Survey

      We need to calculate a matrix of response error rates showing the pro-

bability         that an individual whose true labor market status is i              (ST
                                                                                           i) will be

classified            as    into state j on his first CPS interview        =   j).   We define      =


Pr(S1
         =   i    I
                       ST
                            =   1).   Labor market status has three   possible values: E
(employed),           U (unemployed), and N (not in the labor force). The matrix of error

rates is therefore




(1)                             Q =



where, for example,                    is the probability that an individual who is employed

will be measured as not—in—the—labor force. There are only six independent

probabilities in this matrix, since the elements of each row sum to unity.

      The principal source of data on the incidence of errors in the Current

Population Survey is the Reinterview Survey conducted by the Bureau of the

Census.2 This survey measures coding error and evaluates interviewer perfor-

mance by reinterviewing a subsample of CPS households. In the initial inter-

view, respondents are asked about their activities in the previous week.

Reinterviews occur one week after the initial interview, and involve 5.6 percent

of the respondents in the original survey. During the reinterview, respondents

are asked to describe their activities two weeks prior to the reinterview, in

the week referred to in the initial interview.

      Individuals in the reinterview survey are divided into a Reconciled and an
                                    —5—


Unreconciled Subsample. For the 80 percent of the reinterviews in the

Reconciled Subsample, the reinterviewer conducts a second interview and then

compares the results with those on the first survey. He then attempts to deter-

mine which, if either, of any conflicting responses is correct. The results of

this reconciliation are recorded on a third form and tabulated along with the

survey responses. For the twenty percent of the Reinterview Survey respondents

in the Unreconciled Subsample, there is no attempt to investigate differences

between responses on the first and second surveys.   The reinterviewer conducts

a second interview without reference to responses on the first interview.

  The Bureau of the Census publishes tabulations of Reinterview Survey results

for some highly aggregated demographic groups. To investigate differences in

labor market experience for different demographic groups, we made our own

tabulations of error rates from Reinterview Survey data tapes provided by the

Bureau of the Census. Our data set contains 25,311 reinterviews conducted

between January and June, 1981.

  Table I shows the distribution of recorded labor market status for indivi-

duals in the Reconciled and Unreconciled Subsamples of the Reinterview Survey

for the period January—June, 1981. The table shows the percentage of indivi-

duals in each Reinterview subsample by their classified labor market status

on each survey. 0ff—diagonal elements correspond to different responses on

the two surveys. The table suggests a significant amount of response error

in the CPS. More than five percent of individuals in the Unreconciled

Subsample were classified differently on the two surveys.

  There are several ways to use the reinterview survey data to estimate

Each entry represents the percentage of individuals recorded in a par-
ticular pair of labor nRrket states, i.e., 57.69 percent of the individuals in
the Reconciled Subsample were recorded as employed in the interview and             reinter-
view. Calculations are based on authors' tabulations based on Current
Population Survey Reinterview Survey data for the period January—June, 1981,

the incidence of survey response errors.3 All are plagued by the fact that the

true labor market status of survey participants is never revealed.         Data on

some individual's reconciled data entries nay even be subject to errors,

especially since consistent but incorrect responses on the initial interview and

the reinterview will not prompt any investigation by- the reinterviewer.

   A simple procedure for estimating error rates would involve comparing

individuals' responses on the first survey with their recorded response after

reconciliation. Estimates of the response error rates based only on the

Reconciled Subsample of the Reinterview Survey are commonly regarded as

downward—biased, however)4 This is in part because some reinterviewers, who

are provided with a copy of the household's original survey responses, may

use the original survey answers as a guide in completing the reinterview sur-

vey. This minimizes the need for reconciliation and yields an overly--

reliable picture of the Current Population Survey. The rate of

inconsistencies between the first and second interviews is substantially

higher in the Unreconciled Subsample than in the Reconciled Subsample.

   A more accurate estimate of the response error rates, and therefore of the

adjusted gross changes, can be obtained using data from both the Reconciled and

the Unreconciled Subsamples. Our procedure may be described in two parts.

First, for individuals in the Reconciled Subsample, we estimated the probability

of truly belonging to each labor market state conditional upon reported first

and second interview status     and             These probabilities are:



(2a)
         w.k
               =
                   Pr(ST
                           k S1 =   i,   S2   j).


To estimate these probabilities, we assumed that when there were inconsistencies
                                                     —8—


between the two survey responses, the reconciliation procedure correctly iden-

tified true labor market status. Our estimator was therefore:


 (2b)
             wijk
                    =
                        Pr(SR
                                =   k    S1 =   i,   S2 =


There are twenty—seven such probabilities, but since they must satisfy adding up

conditions of the form


(3)                 +         +          = 1
                        Vju       wiJN

for each i—j combination, only eighteen parameters are independent.

      We assume that the Reconciled Subsample contains a partial sample of the

cases for which Initial Interview and Reinterview responses were different.

Reinterviewers in some cases consult the household's responses on the initial

survey before conducting the reinterview. Some inconsistent responses are

thereby avoided, explaining the lower rate of inconsistent response for the

Reconciled as opposed to the Unreconciled Subsample. Although the Reconciled

Subsample provides a misleading estimate of the incidence of response errors, it

may nonetheless provide reliable estimates of the fraction of inconsistent

cases which should be allocated to each of the two recorded responses.

     We used the estimates {wjjk} to impute the probability distribution of true

labor market status for each individual in the Unreconciled Subsample, con-

ditional upon his       responses       as recorded in the initial interview and   the
Reinterview. The number of individuals in the Unreconciled Subsample with

each    true labor market status was estimated as

()             = Number of individuals in the unreconciled
                    subsample with imputed labor market status k
                                                        —9--



                    =


where N1 is the number of individuals in the Unreconciled Subsample for whom
the first interview status is i, and the second interview status is j. From

these estimates we estimated the probability than an individual observed in a

particular labor market state on either the first or second survey was actually

In state k. The probability that our synthetic reconciliation status equals a

particular value, conditional upon the individual's recorded first survey

response, is


                                         U
                    w     xjy
                                    •N
                                         xj        -'



(5a)            =                             = Pr(ST = y      S1 =   x).
                                    xi


where ST denotes the imputed value of labor market status. An identical pro-
cedure could be performed using the reinterview survey data as the observed
response,   yielding:


                    w.ixy•N.ix
                    4
                                         U

(5b)            =                             = Pr (ST =   y   S2 =   x).
                                N?



We formed the estimated error rates which are used in our subsequent analysis by

averaging       and



(5c)            =               +
                        (q.jy

Since                           the choice amongst the three estimators was of little
significance.
                                    — 10 —




   The resulting estimates of classification error probabilities are shown in

Table II. The table displays separate error rates for men, women, the entire

population, as well as seven other demographic groups. Only the off—diagonal

elements of the Q matrix are shown, since the other terms can be computed from

them.   The highest error rates are found for individuals whose reconciled sta-

tus is unemployed. In the whole survey, over eleven percent of the unemployed

are incorrectly classified as not in the labor force. The fraction of

unemployed persons misclassified in this way varies across demographic groups,

from less than seven percent for middle—aged men (aged 25—59) to over seventeen

percent for young women (aged 16—19). For teenagers of both sexes, the error

rate is nearly fourteen percent; at all ages, the error rate Is substantially

higher for women than for men.

   The second most important type of misclassification is from unemployment

into employment. Almost four percent of the unemployed individuals in the

population are incorrectly classified as holding a job; this error rate rises

to over six percent for male teenagers. Errors In which employed individuals

are classified as not—in—the—labor force are also surprisingly frequent:

nearly two percent of the employed, and three and a half percent of teenagers,

are miscategorized in this way. Most other error rates are small for the

total population, although for some demographic groups they may become signi-

ficant. For example, among men aged 25—59 who are out of the labor force,

there is a substantial probability (3.8 percent) that they will be

misclassified as employed. The demographic variation in error rates high-

lights the importance of disaggregating the flows before making adJustments

for classification errors.

   Before turning to the next section where we describe how       these   error

probabilities are used to adjust the gross changes data, it is important to

mention several potential biases in xir estimated {q}. Reinterviewers are

instructed to try to interview the same person who was interviewed in the ori-

ginal survey. No similar practice is followed in successive months of the

regular   CPS survey, probably   leading   to higher response error rates than those
reported here.    In addition, if the reconciliation procedure fails to identify

an individual's true labor market status, our estimates of response error will

be too small. There are also biases which work in the opposite direction.

The Reinterview Survey may exaggerate the extent of error since a week is

allowed to pass between the events being described and the survey week. The

Reinterview Survey is frequently conducted by phone which may tend to

exaggerate response errors. Finally, although different CI'S interviewers con-

tact different numbers of households, the Reinterview Survey typically con-

tacts a fixed number of households for each interviewer. If there is any

relationship between the efficiency of interviewers (measured by the number of

interviews they conduct) and their accuracy, then there will be additional

biases   in our estimates of response error.

                              2. Adjusting the Gross Changes Data

      In this section we describe our            procedure    for using the estimated

           to adjust the reported gross changes. Let F1 denote the measured flow
{
    q1 }
from labor market state i to state j, while Fij is the true flow. The notation
   will refer to our estimates of the true flows. We can use the {q} to
relate the "true" and nasured flows. For example, consider the measured flow
from employment to unemployment. There are nine different combinations of
actual labor market statuses and response errors which can lead an individual
CPS respondent to te          classified as making an E +        U   transition. By summing the
total      number of individuals in each          of   these nine categories, we obtain an

expression      for the total irasured flow:

(6)          FEU
                    =
                            qqF          +                +


                        +                +               +


                        +
                                  *
                                        +
                                                   *
                                                         +
                                                              qqF*
      Notice that regardless of his true labor market status, every

individual has some chance of being recorded as making an E + U transition.

Of course, for sorr individuals this probability is trivial. The number of

individuals who in fact made U ÷ E transitions but were twice misclassified,

first as employed (when they were unemployed) and then as unemployed (when they

were employed), and          were   therefore recorded as making U + E transitions, is

likely     to be quite small. The            main contribution to the sum in (6)    will   come

from the terms involving              diagonal elements of    the Q matrix.
     Equation      (6) may   be   written nxre generally as

We define F to be the 3 x 3 n.trix of observed flows:

The system of nine equations like (7) can be compactly written as the matrix

equation


(9)            F = Q?F*Q


where Q   is   the matrix of classification error probabilities jq and F is the

matrix of true flows. This equation expresses the observed flows as a function

of the unobserved true flows and the classification error probabilities. It can

be solved for the true flows:


(io)        F* =     (Q1)'FQ1.

Using   our estimates of {q I to       form Q,   we   can estimate the true flows as

(ii)        F* =     (Q)'FQ1.
This   procedure can be applied to both aggregate gross flows and data for

specific demographic groups, yielding a set of response—error corrected

gross flows.

   Associated with each matrix of the labor market flows, there is a

matrix of transition probabilities. Define

These probabilities can be   estimated from      the flows as:

           P =

Our calculations below present adjusted and unadjusted flows, as well as tran

sition   probabilities, for each demographic group0

   An illustration of our adjustment procedure using total labor market flows is

shown in Table III. The table's first panel reports the annual average unadjusted

flows for the period January 19T7 to December 1982 Transition probabilities

are shown beneath each flow0 The table's next panel, labelled "Adjusted Flows,

without Raking," reports the corrected gross flows calculated using the adjust

ment procedure described above0 Some flows, particularly those involving trari

sitions into and out of the labor force, change dramaticaily There is a c1er

reduction in the number of individuals who are off the diagonal of the flow

matrix. WhIle l26O2 million transitions are recorded in the actual gross flows

data, our adjusted matrix shows only 52O3 million transitions. This implies a

reduction in the escape probabilities from each labor market state and a

corresponding lengthening of the expected residence time in each state0 A more

complete discussion of the implications of these results for labor market dyna-

mics is provided in the next section0

  The procedure describe above does not impose any restictions on the number of

individuals in each labor market state before and         after   the flow adjustment0

Nor does it constrain the estimated flow data        to   be consistent with observed

           1977—1982. The reported flows represent averages of the annual flows
           for this period. Adjusted flows are based on authors' calculations

changes    in labor market stocks. The adjustment procedure substantially lovers

the number of individuals classified as NILF      and raises   the number of

unemployed. In the unadjusted data, there are 59.956xnillion individuals out of

the labor force and T.27 million unemployed. In the adjusted case, however, the

number of individuals who are NILF    declines   to 58.1460 million, while the number

of unemployed rises to T.53    million.   There are increases in the number of

employed individuals as well.

   A technique for nrdifying our  adjusted flows to yield the same marginal
totals   as those implied by labor market stock data is to apply the nthod of
iterative proportional fitting, or "raking," to our adjusted flows. Bishop,
Feinberg,   and Holland [3 describe this technique, developed by Deniing and

Stephan IT], for achieving comparability between cell proportions in a con-

tingency table generated from one data source, and marginal totals generated

from another source. We mdif led our adjusted flows using this technique to

conform   with the annual average labor market stocks reported by      the Bureau of

Labor Statistics .5

   The results of raking our adjusted flows are reported in the third panel of

Table III. The raking adjustments lead to substantial changes in some of the

flows. For example, the estimated E + B flow declines by over one and one half

million persons, while the N ÷ N flow rises by one million. The implications of

the flow    matrix for labor market dynamics depend nxstly on the     associated tran-

sition probabilities,   however, and there the raking adjustments have only tri-
vial   effects. The largest change in a transition probability is that for

which rises from .TlT to .725. The other transition probabilities hardly change
                                   —18—




at all. This suggests that relative to the correction for response errors,

margin—consistency adjustments are of limited importance.

   One iniportant caveat about our procedure should be noted. We have presented

no evidence to support our assumption that all individuals have identical,

serially uncorrelated probabilities of response error. If this were not the

case, our procedure would overstate the required adjustment to the gross flows

and could lead to negative adjusted flows. Our assumption is not testable

without longitudinal reinterview data.

                                       3. Results

   This section analyzes the results of applying our adjustment procedure to the

gross changes data for the total population, teenagers, Men, Women, Men 16—19,

Men 2O21, Men 25—59, Women 16—19, Women 20_214, and Women 25—59. In each case

the   values of {q }   are   estimated from Reinterview Survey data for the period
January through June 1981, and are used to adjust the annual average gross
changes for the period    197T—1982. This section draws only   on adjusted flows
which    have been raked for consistency with the labor market stocks.

Unadjusted, adjusted but unraked, as well as adjusted and raked flows with

their associated transition probabilities are reported in the Appendix.

   The comparison of adjusted and unadjusted flows is of some interest in

itself. In addition, however, labor market dy-narnics can be analyzed by

reference to several other statistics which can be derived from the transition

probability matrices. These include the expected duration of a completed spell

in each labor force state, the probability of an unemployment spell ending in

employment, and the probability of labor force withdrawal within a given nonth.

Expected durations of completed spells in each state are calculated as the

reciprocal   of the exit probability from that state. As discussed in re detail
below, the expected duration of a completed spell of unemployment differs from
the mean duration of interrupted spells published each nnth by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. Our calculation      depends only on a simple identity linking

flows and stocks, and not on any assumption about the Markovian character     of
actual   labor market behavior. The probability of an unemployment spell en ding

in employment entry is calculated as the ratio UE'UE +
                                                              P),    while the

 fl, and 11E denote, respectively, the steady state fraction of the population

 unemployed      and employed.
      Marston Ei61    has   -presented 'a very complete analysis of the transition
matrix differences between demographic         groups. Two central conclusions of his

analysis were the importance of transitions into and           out   of the labor force, and
the    great extent of turnover in the labor market. Here we focus on the extent
to which     these conclusions are modified when we make use of our adjusted data.

We then examine the implications of our findings for analyses such as those of

Kaitz    [liii   and Lancaster [l5 which explore labor market dynamics without

making explicit reference to gross changes data.

     Table IV presents estimates of the monthly probability of labor market

withdrawal, for different demographic groups, estimated from our unadjusted

and adjusted data. A striking feature of the unadjusted data is the

apparently overwhelming importance of labor force withdrawal. The unadjusted

data imply that over forty percent of the whole labor force can be expected to

leave the labor force within a year. For women, the comparable statistic

approaches fifty—five percent. The unadjusted data also show that among job

leavers,    labor force withdrawal is almost twice as common as unemployment.
This calculation is based on the ratio of                  +   Eu), using data reported
in   the appendix. Perhaps most significant, the unadjusted data imply that

almost half (15 percent) of unemployment spells end in labor force

withdrawal. Table V reports values of one minus this probability, the chance

that   conditional upon escaping from unemployment the individual finds a job.
For women, forty—six percent of unemployment spells end in successful job—

finding;    for men   aged   25—59, the probability is .75.

      As already emphasized, the Reinterview Survey     infornation   suggests that

spurious    reporting of 1abor    force withdrawal is the nost common form of

reporting error. Hence, it is not surprising that the adjusted data present a

very different view of the importance of labor force withdrawal. The overall

withdrawal rate is only about one—third as great for the entire population,

as    is suggested by the unadjusted data. In               unadjusted data,
                                                  contrast to the

job leaving to unemployment is twice as common as job leaving followed by
labor    force withdrawal. The     adjusted data also imply that about two—thirds of
the    unemployed end their spell of unemployment by finding    a job.
     The differences between the unadjusted and adjusted probabilities vary across

demographic groups. The largest proportionate changes in withdrawal probabili-

ties are    for those groups with the lowest initial withdrawal rates. For mature
men, for example, there is a ninety percent reduction in withdrawal probabili-
ties. Male teenagers, who exhibit high nobility, experience only a thirty

percent reduction as a result of flow adjustment. The probability of a suc-

cessful escape from unemployment rises for nearly all demographic groups.

These   changes are   nost   pronounced for men aged 25—59.
     A second striking feature of the unadjusted data is the apparently
very   high rate of turnover in the labor force. This is illustrated in Table VI,

which provides estimates of unemployment durations using adjusted and unadjusted

flows data. For the entire population the unadjusted data suggest that the mean

duration of unemployment is only about 2.2 months. For.women the estimated

durations are shorter, and for teenagers, they are far shorter, 1.8 months. The

adjusted     data tell a rather different story. For the entire population the

estimated duration of a completed unemployment spell is 3.614 months, almost two—

thirds greater. For women, the expected spell duration rises from 2.0 to 3.1

months, while for man the change is even more pronounced, 2.14 to 14.5 months.

Our adjustments accentuate the differences between teenagers and the remainder

of the population, because they revise upwards the teenagers' durations of

unemployment by only small amounts.

     It   is interesting to note that our adjustments bave their most drama-
tic effects on groups whose labor market behavior is least dynamic. If error

rates are relatively constant across demographic groups, then eliminating errors

will have the greatest proportional effect on groups whose members make the

fewest transitions. The point is exemplified by considering the men 25—59

group.     Here the estimated duration of unemployment more than doubles from 2.16

months to 14.T0 months. Unfortunately, these results niist be discounted because

some of the adjusted flow probabilities are negative. This is probably a con-

sequence    of positive serial correlation in reporting errors and suggests that
all our estimates may somewhat overstate the appropriate adjustments. It also
suggests the importance of demographic disaggregation in adjusting these data.
This pitfall would not be visible had     we   worked only with data on men and   women

as   done by   Abowd and Zeliner Ei and Fuller and Chua tiol.
     It   seems inevitable that correction for reporting   errors which lead to
overestimates     of close to seventy percent in the escape rate from unemployment

are likely to dramatically increase reasonable estimates of any      unemployment
duration measure. It     follows naturally that even estimates such as those of
                                          —26—




Clark and Summers (6)    are   likely to underestimate the true extent of con—
cent ration in unemployment.
      There is some support for our suggestion that unemployment spells are
longer than usually shown in gross changes data. Non—CPS sources of labor
market information, which are usually retrospective surveys of individual
experience, often find spell lengths for all        labor   market states which are
longer    than those reported by the CPS.6 While interpretation of these facts is

complicated by the varying definitions of unemployment used on non—CPS surveys,

they corroborate our findings.

      On balance, our results suggest that the unadjusted gross changes data

lead to very misleading inferences about the character of the labor market. We

suspect    that similar problems plague efforts to use the gross changes data           to

study cyclical phenomena. In particular, conventional analyses may understate

the cyclicality of labor market flows because a relatively constant number of

spurious flows are added in all periods to the cyclically variable true flows.

   We believe that our results also cast doubt on conventional analyses

of unemployment which do not make explicit use of the gross changes data. One

common    method for analyzing unemployment durations, pioneered by Kaitz       (])41


and   Salant 120] , involves inferring the distribution of completed spell
lengths    from published information   on the   distribution of interrupted spell

lengths. A simple procedure of this type is to estimate the maan duration of

completed spell lengths by dividing the number of unemployed persons by an esti-

mate of the flow rate into unemployment, based for example on the number of per-

Sons unemployed less than 5 weeks. For 1981 this procedure yields a mean
                                             —27—




duration of completed unemployment spells of 2.39 ixrnths, very close to the
estimate      produced by the unadjusted gross changes data. The reason for this

should   be clear. A large      number of persons are     spuriously classified as
unemployed,     artificially inflating the stock of short      term unemployed.
Likewise,     many of the longer term unemployed    are   spuriously not measured as

unemployed.      These biases imply that these published data also understate the
mean duration of incomplete spells of unemployment.
   Related difficulties plague studies of the transition cxit of unemployment
which use the techniques of survival analysis, such as Lancaster t151.            Some

transitions out of unemployment are spurious, and some          spells   of unemployment
are recorded as ending when they       are   in fact continuing. Estimated hazard
functions correspond not to the probability of escaping unemployment, but to
the   probability of being measured as leaving      unemployment. The latter may be
the   outcome of either a classification error or a genuine labor market tran-

sition; this complicates the structural interpretation of hazard models.

   Still further difficulties infect procedures which rely upon individuals'

reported unemployment 'durations, since these data are often extremely unre-

liable. One way to illustrate this is by comparing the reported unemployment

durations of Current Population Survey respondents who are unemployed in two

consecutive     nnths. The surveys occur roughly four weeks apart, so for            indivi-

duals experiencing      a continuing unemployment spell     the duration reported in

month two should exceed that in month one by between three and five weeks.

            more than 14 weeks. DUR is the reported unemployment duration in May,

of   the individuals surveyed provided consistent responses in the two months,

and more than twenty percent reported shorter durations, or the same duration,

on the second survey. Moreover, there is a substantial incidence of large

changes, more than four months, in the reported durations in the two surveys.

These findings suggest that any attempt to apply techniques which are not

robust against measurement errors to analyze duration—related phenomena such

as job—finding are prone to yield substantially misleading results.

     A full analysis of how response errors affect the measured duration of

unemployment spells would require a statistical model of how spuriously

misclassified individuals report durations, both during and after their response

error. We have previously 1181 presented some fragments of evidence on this

question. We showed that of those who are classified as unemployed, NILF, and

unemployed in three successive months, less than one third report an

unemployment duration which increases by more than two months between the two

periods of unemployment. On the other hand, less than a quarter consider them-

selves as beginning a new spell and report durations of less than one month

during   the second spell of   unemployment. These results suggest the dif-

ficulties with   any simple assumption about how classification errors affect

reported   durations.

                                   b.    Conclusions
    This paper has developed a procedure for adjusting the Current Population

 Survey gross changes data for reporting errors. The corrected data suggest that

 the labor market is much less dynamic than has     frequently   been suggested.
 Conventional   measures may understate the duration of unemployment by as much as
 eighty percent and overstate the extent of nvement into and out of the labor
 force by- several hundred percent.                 adjusted data also throw
                                        The use of our

 demographic differences in patterns of labor market dynamics into much sharper
 relief.
   This research could usefully be extended in several directions.        A

number of methodological issues should be explored. Alternative procedures for

estimating CPS error rates could be devised to relax the assumption that the

reconciliation process correctly- estimates individuals' true labor force status.

Error probabilities could also be estimated imposing the constraint that the

marginal labor market stocks estimated in the CPS are unbiased estimates of the

true stocks. Allowance could be made for heterogeneity within demographic

groups in the likelihood of reporting errors. Alternative procedures to adjust

the actual gross changes data could also be developed.

   It would also be valuable to adjust data for several years, to allow study of

cyclical aspects of labor market dynamics. Explorations of the importance of

reporting errors for studies of inter—industry or occupational flows would also

be valuable. It would be particuarly useful to examine the incidence of

reporting errors as a function of an individual's duration in a state so as to

evaluate the reliability of conclusions reached by applying hazard function
                                      —31—




methodologies   to labor market data. Another important area for further research
is the effect of reporting errors in retrospective surveys such as the National
Longitudinal Survey.
   Our findings suggest that measurement errors importantly distort estimates of
even basic statistics characterizing the labor market. Statistical techniques
for analyzing labor market data which take account of pervasive measurement
errors   need to be developed. Because of the discrete nature of the data, and

its longitudinal character, standard techniques for the treatment of errors in

variables are not applicable. In work now underway [191, we are developing a

multinomial logit procedure for analyzing labor market transitions which are

reported with error.
