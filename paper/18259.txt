We use a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing firms to study their internal organization.
We first divide the employees of each firm into `layers' using occupational categories. Layers are hierarchical
in that the typical worker in a higher layer earns more, and the typical firm occupies less of them. In
addition, the probability of adding (dropping) a layer is very positively (negatively) correlated with
value added. We then explore the changes in the wages and number of employees that accompany
expansions in layers, output, or markets (by becoming exporters). The empirical results indicate that
reorganization, through changes in layers, is key to understand how firms expand and contract. For
example, we find that firms that expand substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all
pre-existing layers. In contrast, firms that expand little and do not reorganize pay higher average wages
in all pre-existing layers.

          We use a comprehensive dataset of French manufacturing …rms to study their internal orga-
      nization. We …rst divide the employees of each …rm into ‘layers’using occupational categories.
      Layers are hierarchical in that the typical worker in a higher layer earns more, and the typical
      …rm occupies less of them. In addition, the probability of adding (dropping) a layer is very pos-
      itively (negatively) correlated with value added. We then explore the changes in the wages and
      number of employees that accompany expansions in layers, output, or markets (by becoming
      exporters). The empirical results indicate that reorganization, through changes in layers, is key
      to understand how …rms expand and contract. For example, we …nd that …rms that expand
      substantially add layers and pay lower average wages in all pre-existing layers. In contrast, …rms
      that expand little and do not reorganize pay higher average wages in all pre-existing layers.


1    Introduction
Labor is not a homogeneous input. Employees are distinct in their levels of skill, knowledge,
experience, and a vast variety of other dimensions. So an important decision made by …rms is
to determine not only the number but also the characteristics of their employees, as well as the
role that each of them plays in the …rm. We refer to these decisions as the organization of a …rm.
In this paper we aim to describe empirically the organization of …rms and how this organization
is related to other …rm characteristics, including export status. We are particularly interested in
understanding if …rms actively manage their organization –and therefore the number and knowledge
of their employees– and how they do this. Understanding these decisions is important in order to

understand the characteristics of …rms and therefore the behavior of the aggregate economy. As
far as we know, this is the …rst empirical study of the internal organization of …rms that uses a
comprehensive dataset with a large number of …rms.
      We use a sample of the large majority of French manufacturing …rms during the period 2002-
2007.1 To organize the data in a practical and meaningful way, we …rst introduce the concept of a
‘layer’of employees. The concept of a layer is adopted from the theory of management hierarchies
proposed initially by Garicano (2000) and used in the context of heterogeneous …rms in Caliendo
and Rossi-Hansberg (2012). In this theory a layer of employees is a group of managers or workers,
with similar characteristics and knowledge, who perform similar tasks within the organization.
Conceptually, these layers are hierarchical in the sense that higher layers of management are smaller
and include more knowledgeable employees who have as subordinates employees in lower layers.
Dividing the employees in real …rms into layers requires some mapping between these concepts
and the data. The …rst part of the map involves using wages as a one-dimensional measure of the
marketable characteristics of employees, that is, to view wages as a measure of the ‘knowledge’of
workers. In this vein, if one individual is more knowledgeable than another (in terms of practical
knowledge used in production) he will obtain a higher wage. The second part of the map is to group
workers into layers. To do so we use information on occupational characteristics. Fortunately,
the French data we use provide hierarchical occupational categories. The top occupation includes
owners who receive a wage. The next one below includes senior sta¤ and top management positions;
the next one employees at a supervisory level. The lowest two occupations include clerks and blue
collar workers. We document that they earn similar wages and so we pull them together into one
layer. This gives us a maximum of four hierarchical layers of employees. Of course, many …rms (in
fact, most of them) do not employ agents in all of these layers, something we exploit extensively in
this paper.
      We then investigate whether this division of the employees in a …rm into layers is an economically
meaningful classi…cation. We cut the data in a variety of ways that indicate that it is. Firms with
more layers are larger in terms of value added and employment, and, in general, pay higher wages.
Around 50% of the variation in wages within …rms is variation across layers. A large majority of
…rms have adjacent layers that start at the bottom. When they add or drop a layer, it is mostly
an adjacent layer and they add or drop only one. Layers within …rms are also di¤erent from each
other. Lower layers are larger in the number of hours of work and employ agents who earn lower
wages. Thus, most …rms are hierarchical in their layers both in terms of wages and in terms of time
employed at each layer. In addition, the probability of adding a layer is increasing in value added
and the probability of dropping one is decreasing in value added. All these facts are very signi…cant
in the data and robust to accounting for industry and time …xed e¤ects. So we conclude that the
layers we identify using occupations are not arbitrary names but have an economic meaning in
terms of the characteristics of the employees they group and the tasks they perform.
      The next step is to understand how …rms change their organization — the knowledge and number

      A detailed description of the data is relegated to Appendix B.

of employees at each layer— as they grow. It is useful to go back to the theory in order to guide
our exploration. We rely on Caliendo and Rossi-Hansberg (2012, from now on CRH) as our guide,
since their general equilibrium theory of production hierarchies allows for …rm heterogeneity, which
is important in the data.2 In this theory …rms organize production to economize on their use of
knowledge: a costly input. Production requires time and knowledge. Workers in layer zero work
on the production ‡oor. To produce, they need to solve the problems they face in production.
Their knowledge allows them to solve some, but not all, the problems they face. If they can solve
a problem output is immediately realized. Otherwise, they can ask agents in higher layers how to
solve them. Since they do not know anything about these problems, they …rst ask the managers in
layer one. These managers spend their time communicating with the workers and understanding
their problems. They in turn solve some of them and pass the rest to the second-layer managers
and so on. The problem of the …rm is to decide the number of hours of work and the level of
knowledge of employees in each layer and how many layers to have in the …rm. The number of
hours of the top manager is …xed and common across …rms.
      A …rm with higher demand, or higher exogenous idiosyncratic productivity, optimally decides
to have more layers. Its larger scale allows it to economize on the total cost of knowledge by
having many layers of management with very knowledgeable managers at the top, but much less
knowledgeable employees in the bottom layers. The theory in CRH implies that some …rms that
expand value added will add layers. However, some others might expand without adding layers
since the expansion is not large enough to make the added cost of an extra layer (namely, the wage
of the new top manager) worth paying. The trade-o¤ is simple: lower ‘marginal’cost from having
less knowledgeable employees in the existing layers (because the new top manager can solve the
less frequent questions) versus higher ‘…xed’cost from having to pay an extra, and large, wage of
the top manager. So it is worth paying the ‘…xed’cost only if the expansion is large enough. Thus,
in the theory, …rms that expand by adding layers reduce wages and increase the number of hours
at all layers, while …rms that expand but do not add layers increase both hours and wages at all
layers.
      We go to the data guided by these implications. We look at …rms that expand and add layers
and …rms that contract and drop layers. In particular, we estimate changes in log wages and
changes in log hours of work normalized by hours in the top layer, for …rms that add or drop layers.
The implications discussed above hold for each layer in …rms with any number of layers. We do
not …nd any instance in which these implications are falsi…ed by the data. We then look at …rms
that expand but do not add or drop layers. We …nd that these …rms expand hours and wages at
all layers. Note the key …nding: If …rms expand by adding layers, wages in preexisting layers fall,
while if …rms expand without reorganizing, wages rise. Importantly, our …ndings are not simply the
result of regrouping workers with the same wages across layers. We document that the distribution
of wages in preexisting layers shifts down for all percentiles when …rms grow by adding layers, while
  2
    Throughout, we refer mostly to the theory of CRH, although some of the arguments we advance can be traced
back to Garicano (2000) or Garicano and Rossi-Hansberg (2006).

it shifts up for all percentiles when …rms grow without reorganizing. All these results reverse when
we focus on …rms that contract.
       These …ndings are consistent with the theory in CRH but contradict theories of e¢ ciency
wages, or Nash bargaining, in which …rms that expand always pay higher wages, independently
of organizational changes. Several studies have documented that average wages at …rms increase
with …rm size, or as …rms expand: the size-wage premium (Abowd, et al., 1999, Brown and Medo¤,
1989, Oi and Idson, 1999, Bernard and Jensen, 1997, 1999, and Frias, et al., 2009). Our …ndings are
not inconsistent with these …ndings. What we document, among other things, is that the size-wage
premium is reversed when we condition on the …rm reorganizing by adding layers and we focus on
workers in preexisting layers.
       Next we explore organizational change in …rms that become exporters. Exporters are larger,
employ more hours of labor, pay higher wages, and have more layers. Firms with more layers are
much more likely to be exporters. For example, among …rms with three layers of management (the
highest number of layers given that they also have a layer of workers) 90.2% of the value added is
generated by …rms that also export. All of these facts are consistent with the standard …nding in
the literature that exporters are larger and are also consistent with CRH where larger …rms have
weakly more layers. Hence, it is perhaps more interesting to turn our attention to new exporters.
       We …nd that new exporters are more likely to add layers than non-exporters (and symmetrically
…rms that exit exporting are more likely to drop layers). In addition, new exporters that add layers
decrease average wages in existing layers while exporters that do not add layers increase them.
The well-known …nding (see Bernard and Jensen 1995, 1997, and Verhoogen 2008) that …rms that
become exporters pay higher wages is the result of a composition e¤ect. In fact, the …rms that
expand signi…cantly as a result of exporting, namely, the ones that add layers, reduce average
wages. Furthermore, they do so at all pre-existing layers. In contrast, new exporters that do not
change layers barely expand but do increase wages. Since there are more new exporters that do
not change layers than there are exporters that do change layers, the average e¤ect on wages is
positive but small. The result is relevant for the conceptualization of new exporters. The notion
that new exporters expand and increase the wages of their employees either because they upgrade
their technology (and so the marginal product of labor is higher) or because pro…ts are higher
and they share them with workers (via a wage sharing or bargaining mechanism) is at odds with
our data.3 The data are consistent with a view in which new exporters that expand signi…cantly
change their organizational design and economize on knowledge by employing less knowledgeable
employees who are paid less.
       Several other papers have studied the internal organization of …rms using small samples of pro-
ducers (a few hundred). For instance, Caroli and van Reenen (2001) use surveys from England and
France to …nd that the wage bill share of di¤erent skill levels change as …rms delayer. These results
support our …nding that delayering is associated with systematic occupational shifts.4 Garicano

propose models were the exporter-wage premium is the outcome of a bargaining mechanism.

     Caroli and van Reenen (2001) has the advantage of using a measure of delayering directly reported by managers

and Hubbard (2007) study the role of hierarchies as a means of organizing production in law …rms.
They use con…dential data from law o¢ ces from the 1992 Census of Services. They …nd that as
market size increases, the ratio of associates to partners increases. We document a similar …nding
for manufacturing …rms in France. We …nd that as …rms expand, either by adding layers or not,
the number of hours worked by lower-level employees relative to higher-level ones expands. Rajan
and Wulf (2006), using a sample of 300 large U.S. …rms for the period 1986 to 1998, analyze how
hierarchies of top-level managers have changed over time. The study shows that the CEOs’span of
control has increased, while the number of layers between division heads and CEOs has gone down
during the sample period. Thus, they …nd evidence that such hierarchies have ‘‡attened’over time
and have decentralized their decision making. Using a large comprehensive dataset for France, we
document that …rms have also become ‘‡atter’during the period 2002 to 2007. In a similar study,
Guadalupe and Wulf (2010), using the same data as Rajan and Wulf (2006), …nd evidence that
exposure to the export market makes …rms reorganize their production. We …nd that …rms that
enter the export market are more likely to reorganize production than non-exporters.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section describes in more detail the
essential features of the theory in CRH that guides our empirical exploration. Section 3 describes
the data and our construction of layers and shows the basic characteristics of …rms and layers.
Section 4 presents our …ndings on organizational changes as a result of changes in layers and
expansions in value added. Section 5 presents the results for new exporters and …rms that exit
the export market. Section 6 discusses how …rms change average wages in a layer and Section
7 concludes. Appendix A presents a variety of robustness checks and extensions of the results
in the main text. Appendix B describes in detail the data, its manipulation, and our empirical
methodology.


2     A Theory of Organization with Heterogeneous Firms
In this section we discuss brie‡y the framework in CRH. Given that the purpose of the current
paper is to describe and understand the data, we present the theory in its simplest form and do
not discuss all the details fully. The interested reader is directed to CRH for the more technical
discussions and all proofs of the results.
    We consider an economy with N    ~ identical agents with preferences that lead to a demand for
variety    given by x (p; ; R; P ) where p denotes the price; R revenue, and P the price index. We
assume that agents like varieties with higher             better, so @x (p; ; R; P ) =@       > 0 and, as usual,
@x (p; ; R; P ) =@p < 0. Agents are endowed with one unit of time that they supply inelastically
and obtain an equilibrium wage w for their unit of time. Agents acquire knowledge in order to solve
the problems they encounter during production. Learning how to solve problems in an interval of
knowledge of length z costs wcz (c teachers per unit of knowledge at cost w per teacher). Since the
rather than indirectly inferred from the occupational structure, like ours. The advantage of our approach is that it
relies less on the subjective views of managers and more on their observed actions. Our measure also allows us to use
the universe of manufacturing …rms instead of specialized surveys.

cost of knowledge is linear, agents receive it back as compensation for their work. Hence, the total
wage of an employee with knowledge z is given by w = w[cz + 1]:
       An entrepreneur pays a …xed entry cost f E in units of labor to design her product. After
doing so, she obtains a demand draw             from a known distribution G( ): The draw               determines
the level of demand of the …rm. If the entrepreneur decides to produce she pays a …xed cost f
in units of labor. Production requires labor and knowledge. Agents employed in a …rm act as
production workers (layer ` = 0) or managers (layers `                 1). We denote by n`L , zL` , and wL
                                                                                                         ` ; the

number, knowledge, and total wage of employees at layer ` = 0; 1; 2::: of an organization with L
layers of management (or L + 1 layers of employees, given that we call the layer of workers layer
zero). Workers use their unit of time to generate a production possibility that can yield one unit of
output. For output to be realized the worker needs to solve a problem drawn from a distribution
F (z) with F 00 (z) < 0: Workers learn how to solve the most frequent problems. The ones in the
interval 0; zL0 : If the problem they face falls in 0; zL0 ; production is realized; otherwise, they can
ask a manager one layer above how to solve the problem. Managers spend h units of their time
on each problem that gets to them. A manager at layer ` = 1 tries to solve the problems workers
could not solve. Hence, they learn how to solve problems in zL0 ; zL0 + zL1 . In general, the …rm
                                                                P
needs n`L = hn0L (1 F (ZL` 1 )) managers of layer `; where ZL` = `l=0 zLl :5
       We characterize the problem using the variable cost function. Let C (q; w) denote the minimum
variable cost of producing q units, and CL (q; w) the same cost if we restrict the organization to
producing with L layers of management. Then,
                                                                                  XL

So one entrepreneur, nL                                                                 `

in that curve is associated with a particular organization. Namely, it is associated with a number
of layers, and a number of employees and their knowledge at each layer.
   5
    To derive some of the implications of the theory, CRH specify the distribution of problems as an exponential, so
F (z) = 1 e z .



                                                           6
   Importantly, as proven in CRH, as …rms increase the number of layers by one in order to produce
more, the number of agents in each layer increases and the knowledge in all pre-existing layers, and
therefore the wage, decreases. In Figure 1 this is illustrated as a change from q( ) to q (                    00 ).   The
logic is straightforward. Firms add layers to economize on the knowledge of their workers. So when
they add a new top layer, they make the new manager deal with the rare problems and make lower
level employees know less. The lower knowledge in all pre-existing layers reduces, by equation (4),
the span of control of each manager in the organization. However, the number of employees in all
layers still goes up since the span of control of the new top manager is larger than one.

                   Figure 1: The average cost function C (q; w) =q as a function of q

   Figure 1 also illustrates how …rms grow when they do not add layers (a change from q ( ) to
q ( 0 ) in the …gure). In this case we see that the number of workers in all layers increases, as do the
knowledge and wages of all workers. This is the only way the …rm can expand given the number of
layers. Because the span of managers is given by the knowledge of their subordinates, the only way
the …rm has to increase output is to increase the knowledge of its employees. Since the knowledge
of agents at di¤erent layers is complementary, the …rm does so at all layers. So the implications of
the model on how …rms grow and how the wages and knowledge of their employees vary depends
crucially on whether …rms add layers or not. Clearly, …rms that want to expand substantially
change the number of layers, while …rms that do not want to expand that much, in general, keep
the number of layers …xed. We investigate all of these implications in our empirical analysis below.
   So far we have not said anything about how the quantity produced is determined. To do
so we need to turn to the pro…t maximization and entry decision of the …rm. CRH embed the
cost function discussed above into a standard Melitz (2003) type framework with heterogeneity in
demand. Given that we exploit the general equilibrium of the model only in a limited way, we
direct the reader to CRH for details. Here we only state that the model yields an optimal quantity
produced, which is increasing as a function of the demand draw . So a higher demand draw leads

                                                   7
to a higher quantity and, as described above, a new organization.
    The model in CRH also allows us to study the e¤ect of a new opportunity to export on the
organization of …rms. Essentially, the possibility to export has e¤ects similar to those of a larger
demand draw . So exporters are larger and therefore have more layers. Furthermore, new exporters
that add layers reduce the knowledge and wages of pre-existing layers and increase the number of
employees in those layers. New exporters that do not add layers increase wages, knowledge, and
the number of employees at all layers.
    To sum up, the model has the following implications:

    1. Firms are hierarchical, n0L   :::n`L :::    nL
                                                    L for all L:

                                                                   XL
    2. Layers, L; sales pq; and total number of employees,                n`L ; increase with :
                                                                    `=0

                 ` and n` increase with
    3. Given L; wL                                at all `:
                        L

                ` decreases and n` increases with an increase in L at all `:
    4. Given ; wL                L


    5. Exporters sell more and have more layers than non-exporters.

    6. When …rms start exporting:
        a) L increases weakly.
                                                    ` and n` at all `:
        b) Exporters that do not change L increase wL      L
                                               ` and increase n` at all `:
        c) Exporters that increase L decrease wL               L


    Armed with these implications, and the way of organizing the data dictated by the theory, we
now turn to our empirical analysis of the anatomy of French production hierarchies.


3    The Data
We use con…dential data collected by the French National Statistical Institute (INSEE) for the
period 2002 to 2007. We do not use the data before 2002 because the occupational categories,
which we use to determine layers below, changed that year. To construct our unique dataset, we
merge two di¤erent sources of mandatory reports. First is the BRN dataset, which includes the
balance-sheet data of private …rms. It includes 553,125 …rm-year observations in the manufacturing
sector. Second is the DADS dataset, which includes occupation, hours of work, and earning reports
of salaried employees. In matching the datasets, we lose 5.9% of the observations and we lose
another 11.5% from cleaning the data. The resulting sample covers on average over time 90.7% of
total value added in manufacturing. We should note that small …rms can choose not to report in
the BRN. However, …rms that choose not to report add up to a small share of value added, since
they are included in the 9.3% of value added not included in our sample. A detailed description of
the construction and characteristics of the dataset is included in Appendix B.


                                                       8
      In order to dissect this large dataset in a way that we can understand and analyze through the
lens of the theory described in the previous section, we …rst need to determine what constitutes a
layer of workers or management in the data. To do so, we use the PCS-ESE classi…cation codes for
workers in the manufacturing sector. Remember that the notion of a layer is a group of employees
who have similar knowledge levels and wages and who perform tasks at a similar level of authority.
That is, our purpose is not to separate employees in a …rm according to the functional characteristics
of the tasks they perform (e.g., whether they are accountants or lawyers) but rather based on their
hierarchical level in the organization, that is, based on the number of layers of subordinates that
they have below them. The PCS-ESE is, we believe, ideal for this purpose. For manufacturing
it includes …ve occupational categories classi…ed with numbers from 2 to 6.6 The classes we use,
together with their class number, are:

  2. Firm owners receiving a wage (which includes the CEO or …rm directors).

  3. Senior sta¤ or top management positions (which includes chief …nancial o¢ cers, heads of
        human resources, and logistics and purchasing managers).

  4. Employees at the supervisor level (which includes quality control technicians, technical, ac-
        counting, and sales supervisors).

  5. Quali…ed and non-quali…ed clerical employees (secretaries, human resources or accounting
        employees, telephone operators, and sales employees).

  6. Blue collar quali…ed and non-quali…ed workers (welders, assemblers, machine operators and
        maintenance workers).

      Throughout the paper we merge classes 5 and 6, since the distribution of wages of workers
in these two classes is extremely similar, indicating similar levels of knowledge. Table 1 shows
percentiles of the distribution of wages in the di¤erent classes of workers, all expressed in 2005
euros.7

   The distributions are clearly ranked. CEOs make the most money, and wages decrease as we
reach classes 5 and 6, which are practically identical. In order to match the numbers of these
occupational classes with the theory, we order them from the bottom up. So classes 5 and 6 will
form the layer of workers, namely, layer zero. Class 4 of supervisors will form the …rst layer of
managers, layer 1. Senior sta¤ will be included in layer 2, and CEOs and …rm directors will form
layer 3. So …rms can have a maximum of 4 layers, starting with layer zero and moving all the way
up to layer 3. Throughout the rest of the paper we refer to the number of layers in the …rm by the
number of management layers. So a …rm that has a layer of workers and two layers of managers is
referred to as a …rm with two layers.

3.1   Firms with a di¤erent number of layers are di¤erent
We aim to establish that this classi…cation of workers into layers is a meaningful economic clas-
si…cation. Of course, this occupational classi…cation could just constitute some arbitrary names
given to particular workers in an organization that are not systematic across …rms. The evidence
in Table 1 suggests otherwise. Wages across these occupations are evidently ranked. Clearly, much
more is needed. We dedicate the rest of this section to convincing the reader that this classi…cation
is useful. In Tables 2 and 3 we present some basic statistics of our dataset.

   Table 2 presents the number of …rms by year as well as average value added, hours of work,
wages, and layers. There is little variation by year in the data, as is evident from the table. We
classify a …rm as having a particular layer if it reports employing a positive number of hours in
that layer. On average, …rms in our sample employ a positive number of hours in about 1.5 layers.
It is important for our purposes that …rms do not tend to employ workers in all layers, since we
will analyze how …rms change as they add or drop layers of management. Given that on average
…rms have only slightly more than 1.5 layers of management and that they can have a maximum
of three layers of management (plus one layer of workers), there are ample opportunities for …rms
to add new layers.

              Table 3 presents the average characteristics of …rms across layers. Clearly, …rms with more
     layers are larger in terms of value added and hours. They also tend to pay higher wages. The
     last fact is more evident when we look at the median than at the mean given that there are some
     outliers for …rms with only layer zero. Figures 2, 3, and 4 document the same facts using the whole
     distribution.

                  The …gures also show the distributions after we control for time and industry …xed e¤ects (which
          as can be seen in the …gure do very little). The distributions provide a picture very similar to the
          one we obtained from just looking at the means. Firms with more layers are larger and tend to pay
          higher average wages. As a robustness check, Table A1 and Figure A1 in Appendix A show the
          same …ndings using an alternative measure of wages (from DADS) that does not include payroll
          taxes and other expenses. A description of the data is presented in Appendix B. The evidence in
          this section has documented not only that layers do not simply group workers in arbitrary ways
          but that …rms with di¤erent numbers of layers are di¤erent in economically meaningful ways.

          3.2           Firms have adjacent layers and form hierarchies
          So far we have studied …rms with di¤erent total numbers of layers but not which layers …rms actually
          do include in their organization. Table 4 shows that the vast majority of …rms have adjacent layers
          starting from layer zero. That is, 87.17% of the …rms in our sample that have zero layers of
          management actually have layer zero. These are also the largest …rms in terms of employment, as
          they account for 95.86% of the total employment of …rms with zero layers. As another example,
          consider the …rms with two management layers. About 80% of them include layers zero to two.
          The remaining 20% are missing one of these layers and include layer three. Note that, weighted by
          employment or value added, these …rms account for less than 7%. So the producers that do not
          have adjacent layers starting from layer zero are the smallest …rms in the sample. Clearly, all …rms
          with three management layers have adjacent layers starting from zero since they have all layers.
          Overall, 81.57% of …rms have adjacent layers starting at zero and they account for 96.65% of value
          added. The results that follow in general do not depend on whether we restrict the sample to …rms
          with adjacent layers (what we label ‘selected sample’). These robustness checks are included in
          Appendix A.
                  Not only do …rms have adjacent layers but they form hierarchies. That is, the number of hours
          employed in the lowest layer is, in most of them, larger than in the …rst layer of management, which
          is larger than the second layer of management, which is larger than the top layer (if the …rm has


                                                                                    12
all these layers). Table 5 presents the fraction of …rms that satisfy this hierarchical criterion for
hours in all layers and in each of them individually. Table A39 in Appendix A presents the averages
weighted by value added.

   A particular ranking of layers is hierarchical in the sense that the upper layer is smaller than the
lower one in at least 74% of cases in the data. Almost all …rms with one layer satisfy the ranking.
However, only slightly more than half of the …rms with all layers satisfy the ranking in all layers. So
most …rms are hierarchical in terms of hours, but we have a relatively large number of exceptions in
at least one layer. In contrast, when we look at the hierarchy in wages –namely, whether workers in
higher layers earn more than workers in lower layers–the hierarchy is satis…ed in the vast majority
of cases. We present this evidence in Table 6. All individual rankings are hierarchical in more than
87% of cases, and even …rms with three layers of management are hierarchical in all the rankings
in about 80% of cases. Table A40 in Appendix A presents the averages weighted by value added.

   In sum, we conclude from this evidence that it is accurate to think of the representative …rm as
hierarchical, with more hours of work in lower layers, but workers that are paid less.
   Figure 5 represents graphically the …rms in our sample. Each panel in the graph represents
…rms with di¤erent numbers of layers. Each layer is represented using a square. The length of the
square represents the average number of hours employed in the layer by …rms with a given number
of layers. The height of the square represents the average hourly wage of employees in that layer

(so the area is the total wage bill of the layer). The hierarchical organization of labor is evident.
Also evident is the way in which …rms with more layers organize di¤erently. In the next section we
study the particular changes in wages and hours by layer as …rms expand.

                                                          Figure 5: Representative hierarchies

   Figure 6 presents the same representative hierarchies when we normalize the number of hours
of each layer by the number of hours in the top layer. Our model keeps the number of hours at the
top layer …xed, so this normalization is desirable when we contrast the implications of the theory
with our data. All the characteristics of the representative hierarchies that we discussed in Figure
5 are also present in Figure 6 after normalizing.
   The theory in CRH as well as our empirical analysis underscores average wages at each layer.
Clearly this is a simpli…cation since workers within a layer are bound to be heterogenous in their
knowledge; for example, due to the individual histories of workers and the frictions faced by …rms
to hire and …re employees with particular levels of knowledge. Still, we have not said anything
about how much of the variation in wages within the …rm is explained by variation across layers
rather than by variation within layers. This is relevant since if the fraction explained by cross-layer
variation was negligible, our focus on layers would be clearly misguided, at least when it comes to
analyzing the distribution of wages within …rms. Table 7 shows that this is not the case.
   The mean share of variation in log wages explained by variation in layers for all …rms is about
half, independently of how we weight …rms. The share is zero for …rms with zero layers of manage-
ment (since, by de…nition, for these …rms there is no cross-layer variation in log wages) and grows


                                                                            14
to 66% for …rms with three layers of management. The table reassures us that variation in wages
across layers is essential to understand the distribution of wages within …rms.

3.3   Layer transitions depend on size and …rms add or drop adjacent layers
Let us now investigate how many producers add or drop layers in a given period. Table 8 shows
that between 60 and 70% of …rms in a given period maintain their number of layers. From the
remaining, some …rms exit, with the exit rate decreasing with the number of layers. Clearly, of the
…rms that change layers, the majority adds or drops only one of them. In fact, out of the …rms

                                                                           15
                    with adjacent layers, most of the …rms that add one add an adjacent layer (75.4% for zero-layer
                    …rms and 82.9% for …rms with one layer of management; see Table A2 in Appendix A). Hence,
                    when …rms add or drop layers they tend to drop or add an adjacent layer, and only one of them.
                    This is all consistent with the view, provided by the theory, that …rms add layers to expand and
                    drop layers to contract, and do so in a systematic way. Since very large expansions are rare, we
                    see few transitions that add or drop more than one layer. Table A3 in Appendix A shows that the
                    same pattern as in Table 8 is observed even if we weight the …rms by their value added.

    We can also study the probability of adding or dropping one or more layers as a function of the
size of the …rm in terms of its value added. Figure 7 shows a lowess smoothing interpolation of the
probability of changing the number of layers to any count, as a function of the value added of the
…rm, for …rms with di¤erent initial numbers of layers. If, for example, …rms receive shocks to their
demand parameter      over time, and these shocks are drawn from a common arbitrary distribution,
the model predicts that the probability of adding a layer should increase with value added. In
contrast, the probability of dropping a layer should decrease in value added. Furthermore, the
probability of adding one layer should be larger than the probability of adding two, which should
also be increasing in value added. This is exactly what happens in Figure 7.
    The probability of adding layers is always increasing in value added and of dropping is always
decreasing, and the ranking of probabilities is always consistent with the predictions of our theory,
augmented with some simple stochastic process for the fundamentals. Figure 7 does not include
con…dence bands in order to enhance the visibility of the curves. However, in Figure A1 in Appendix
A we present a graph with all the individual observations and show that they line up fairly tight
around the interpolation estimates. Appendix B describes all the details and choices made to
construct Figure 7.
    The evidence in this section has documented that layers do not just group workers in arbitrary
ways but that …rms with di¤erent numbers of layers are di¤erent in economically meaningful ways.
In addition, we have documented that changes in the number of layers are also systematic and are
determined by the size of the …rm. We now turn to analyze how …rms change their organization,
layer by layer, when they decide to expand or contract.


4    How Do Firms Expand?
In this section we analyze how …rms change when they expand or contract. The main body of
evidence we present tracks …rms over time and, therefore, controls for a variety of individual …rm
characteristics, such as industry. This, we believe, is the ideal way of analyzing the predictions of
our theory in the data and we do so below. However, before we present our results over time, it
is informative to analyze brie‡y the cross-section of …rms. In particular, we study the relationship
between value added and normalized hours in a given layer, `; for …rms with L layers, n`L , or the
                                         ` . The theory predicts that if we focus on …rms with a
wage of the workers in a given layer `, wL
given number of layers, L, n`L ; and wL
                                      ` should increase with value added absent any other source of

heterogeneity across producers. Of course, …rms are di¤erent in many dimensions and so instead of
a one-to-one relationship we …nd substantial heterogeneity in n`L and wL
                                                                       ` for any given level of value

added. Nevertheless, Figures A3 to A9 in Appendix A show a positive and signi…cant relationship
between log value added and the log of n`L and wL
                                                ` for every ` 2 0; 1; :::; L and every L:

    The theory also has a more subtle prediction. Namely, that the slope of the relationship
between the log of value added and normalized hours should decrease as we consider higher layers
of management. The reason is that a larger …rm with the same L has more knowledgeable workers


                                                 17
in all layers, as discussed in Section 2, and so larger spans of control at all layers. Figures A3 to
A5 in Appendix A, together with Table 9, show that the ranking of the slopes is the one predicted
by the model for …rms with two management layers but not for …rms with three layers (where
the ranking is reversed). The di¤erences between the elasticities are signi…cant at the 1% level for
all comparisons. The table also shows the estimates when we add time and industry …xed e¤ects
(again see Appendix B for details). The failure of the implication of the model for …rms with three
layers is the result of cross-sectional heterogeneity, as we show below.

   Similarly, we can look at the ranking of the slopes of the relationship between log wages and
log value added. Now the model predicts that the elasticity should be higher, the higher the
management layer. The …rm economizes by expanding the knowledge of higher layers more, since
there are fewer of those managers. This is in fact the case in the majority of comparisons, except for
a couple that are not signi…cant, as is evident in Table 10. Thus, among …rms with the same number

                                                      18
of layers, the larger ones pay higher wages, and proportionally higher at the top of the hierarchy.
Note that these comparisons are treating all the sources of heterogeneity across …rms that are not
accounted for by value added as classical measurement error. This is certainly a stretch, so it is
somewhat surprising that these predictions still emerge so clearly in our data.
    The evidence above is informative about the di¤erences across …rms with similar characteris-
tics, in particular, the same number of layers. However, it is confounded by other dimensions of
heterogeneity across …rms. We now move to time series evidence that tracks …rms over time. Let
us start by looking at the same prediction we analyzed in the cross-section. That is, we study how
n`L and wL
         ` change as the …rm increases its value added. We estimate a regression of the form



                                         d ln n`Lit =      `
                                                           L   +   `

where i refers to a particular …rm with L management layers, t is the time period, and d is a yearly
time di¤erence (e.g., d ln n`Lit = ln n`Lit+1            ln n`Lit ).

are normalizing hours by the number of hours in the top layer, we can look at the value of                   L   for
` = 1; :::; L       1 only. First note that as predicted by Implication 3 of the theory in Section 2, given
L; …rms grow by increasing the number of hours at all layers. Furthermore, now the ranking of the
                `                           `       `0
values of       L   always satis…es that    L   >   L    for ` < `0 , although in one instance the di¤erence is not
signi…cant. Hence, these results show that once we control for …rm …xed e¤ects, the predictions of
the theory are in line with our …ndings. As a robustness check we present in Table A42 the results
with the selected sample. We conclude that when …rms grow but keep the same number of layers,
they employ more hours of work at all layers but proportionally more in the lower layers. So …rms
become ‡atter, with a wider base.
    We do the same analysis for wages. In particular, we estimate

                                               `           `       `

                `
where now d ln wLit denotes the log di¤erence in wages. The results are presented in Table 12 and
are, as were the cross-sectional results, for the most part consistent with the theory. Namely,                  `   is

cases, apart from a couple of instances where the di¤erence is not signi…cant. Hence, we reinforce
the conclusion that when …rms grow without changing the number of layers, they increase wages
(or knowledge according to the theory) in all layers, but they increase wages proportionally more
at the top of the …rm. Table A37 in Appendix A presents several robustness checks.

   The above analysis paints a familiar picture of the way …rms expand. Firms expand by adding
more workers of all types, by hiring more knowledgeable workers, and by paying them more. Most
models of …rm dynamics (Hopenhayn 1992, Luttmer 2007, Rossi-Hansberg and Wright 2007, Lentz
and Mortensen 2008, among others) share these features with the theory outlined in Section 2 when
…rms keep the number of layers constant. The next subsection shows that when a …rm’s expansion
leads to a change in the number of layers –a reorganization of the …rm–many of these …ndings are
altered in a signi…cant way, speci…cally, the one predicted by Implication 4 in Section 2 above.

4.1   Expansions that add layers
We …rst look at how …rm-level outcomes change depending on whether …rms add or drop layers of
management. Table 13 shows the average log changes in total hours, total normalized hours, value
added, and average wages (including and excluding the new top manager in the case of adding
layers) for all …rms, the ones that add layers, the ones that do not change layers, and the ones
that drop layers. As one can see in the …rst column of the table, most of these variables exhibit
some trend over time, and so the average log change is signi…cantly di¤erent from zero. To account
for this, we also present average changes after we control for time trends (see Appendix B for
details). Clearly, adding layers is related to increasing hours, normalized hours, and value added.
In contrast, …rms that add layers decrease average wages once we take out the common time trend.
Furthermore, if we look at wages in the pre-existing layers only, wages fall signi…cantly, by 13.7%.
The results are reversed when we select only …rms that drop layers. Now wages rise by 13.6%.


                                                    20
   These estimates demonstrate that in …rms that expand by adding layers, wages in pre-existing
layers fall. As far as we know, this is inconsistent with most theories in the labor and …rm dynamics
literatures. In these theories …rms that expand always increase the wages they pay. Note also that
since overall wages increase (without de-trending), as do wages of …rms that do not exhibit changes
in layers, the fall in wages cannot be the result of reverse causality in which drops in wages cause
expansions. If that were the case, we would see drops in wages associated with expansions in all
…rms, not only the ones that add layers. Furthermore, we would not obtain the opposite result when
we select only …rms that drop layers. Of course, the theory in Section 2 is exactly consistent with
this evidence on wages. Implication 4 says that, as …rms add layers, the knowledge and therefore
wages at all layers should decrease.

   The results in Table 13 suggest that wages in …rms that add or drop layers behave di¤erently
than previously thought. Table 13 also shows that the …rms that add or drop layers represent an
important fraction of …rms in the economy, as well as an important fraction of value added. Firms
that add layers represent 12.75% of the total. Furthermore, as they are on average larger than
their counterparts that do not add layers, they contribute 39.2% of the total change in value added.
Inversely, …rms that drop layers represent 13.78% of …rms and contribute -4.87% to the change
in value added. Together, the …rms that reorganize by changing layers and that therefore change
wages in the new way we uncover represent more than a quarter of the …rms in the economy and
contribute more than 40% of the absolute changes in value added. So the …rms that change their
organization to expand and contract do not represent a fringe of the …rms in the economy. They are
essential to understanding …rm dynamics and the associated labor market outcomes. The theory
of organization with heterogeneous …rms in CRH can rationalize the behavior of these …rms.

   We now proceed to analyze in more detail …rms that change their layers of management. In
particular, we are interested in whether …rms that add layers add hours of work to all layers and
decrease wages in all layers. The results above tell us that this is the case on average, but they do
not imply that this happens layer by layer. Table 14 computes average log changes in normalized
hours for …rms that transition between layers. Each line in the table represents a particular type of
transition (e.g., from two to three layers) and a particular layer in …rms that undergo that transition.
The …rst column in the table indicates the number of management layers in the initial period and
the second column the number of layers in the second period. The third column indicates the layer,
`; for which we are calculating the average (over i and t) of d ln n`Lit . The fourth column indicates
the coe¢ cient of interest. Note …rst the sign of the average change. It is positive and signi…cant for
all …rms that increase the number of layers (by one or more layers). Symmetrically, it is negative in
all layers for all …rms that drop one or more layers, exactly what we would expect from the theory
in Section 2. So Table 14 indicates that the …rm-level outcomes on normalized hours from Table
13 not only hold for the …rm as a whole, but they hold layer by layer too. All our estimates are

signi…cant at the 1% level.8 Appendix A presents a variety of robustness checks. In particular,
it presents the results when we only use …rms with adjacent layers and we condition on …rm-level
outcomes, such as expansions in hours or value added.

       We do the same analysis layer by layer for changes in wages. Namely, we compute the average
                        `
(over i and t) of d ln wLit for …rms that add or drop layers. We present the results in Table 15.
Again, the table con…rms that the results we obtained for …rm-level outcomes hold layer by layer,
   8
    The theory also predicts that the proportional change in the hours of employees in higher layers should be larger
than the proportional change in the hours of employees in lower layers. The reason is that the knowledge of all
employees falls and so does the span of each manager. This results in positive but smaller proportional changes in
hours at the bottom of the …rm, when the …rm adds a layer. In Table 14 we see, in most cases, exactly the opposite.
As in the case of …rms that keep the number of layers constant, the lower layers expand proportionally more. Several
forces can be responsible for this mismatch between the theory and the data. First, during a year, …rms that switch
might also have grown without further changes in the number of layers. Since according to the theory the rank of the
log changes is di¤erent depending on whether layers are added or not, what we see could be the result of one e¤ect
dominating the other. Second, there could be frictions in hiring that make lower layers easier to expand than higher
ones. This would be the case if hiring more knowledgeable employees is more costly and takes more time. Finally, the
theory suggests that changes in communication costs, h; as the …rm adds layers could also reverse the implications
of the theory on this ranking.


                                                         23
as the theory predicts. Firms that add layers reduce wages in all pre-existing layers and …rms
that drop layers increase wages in all the layers of the reorganized …rm. Again, these results are
robust to conditioning on large …rm expansions in value added, normalized hours, or both, as well
as to restricting the sample of …rms with adjacent layers. Furthermore, we corroborate our results
using a di¤erent source of wage data. Tables with the robustness checks are presented in Appendix
A and the description of the tables are presented in Appendix B. The conclusion is that many
…rms expand by adding layers of management and these …rms reduce the salary of workers in all
pre-existing layers (or, accordingly, their knowledge as the theory would suggest). The theory also
predicts that, as a …rm adds layers, the wages of higher level managers should fall proportionally
more than those of lower level ones (since their knowledge is more sustitutable with that of the top
manager), a prediction also corroborated by Table 15.
   The …nding is surprising in light of theories of …rm growth that do not put organization at center
stage. Expansions associated with any revenue-enhancing shock (like a demand or an exogenous
productivity shock) are, in virtually all of these theories, associated with increases in employee
wages. The channels vary, but the result is the same. Sometimes wages rise because the marginal
product of workers increases, sometimes because they share some of the rents, and sometimes
because the bargaining position of the worker improves. In contrast, in the theory of CRH, wages
go down because by adding an extra layer of management the …rm can have top managers deal with
the exceptional problems and make workers learn only how to solve the most common problems.
The …rm economizes on knowledge by having more experts together with less knowledgeable workers
and lower-level managers who earn less. Of course, this new organization is only optimal if the …rm
expands enough, since it involves a higher …xed cost in terms of the salaries of its managers.
   We can decompose the total log change in average wages in the …rm into two parts. The …rst
part is the change in wages of workers in existing layers, which, as we know, is negative by the
results discussed above. The second part is the change induced by adding a new agent at the top of
the hierarchy. Agents in the new added layer earn more than the average worker in the …rm since
they are added, in the vast majority of cases, to the top layer. For example, for …rms that transition
from zero to one layer of management, the new manager in layer one makes 53.1% more than the
average wage in the …rm before reorganization. This number can be much higher for larger …rms.
Firms that go from 2 to 3 layers pay the new top manager 335.7% more than the average worker
in the …rm before adding the layer. All of these results are presented in Table 16. We decompose
the average wage in the …rm, d ln wLit , as

                                                   ` L                L 0
         d ln wLit = ln wL0 it+1   ln wLit = ln   wL0 it+1 =wLit s + wL0 it+1 =wLit (1   s)

       ` L                                                                                  0
where wL0 it+1 is the average wage in all pre-existing layers in the reorganized …rms with L > L
         L0
layers, wL0 it+1 is the wage of the new top manager, and s is the fraction of hours of work done

by employees in pre-existing layers. Table 16 presents each of these components. The fact that
 ` L
wL0 it+1 =wLit is below one for all transitions is, for practical purposes, just a re-expression of the

results in Table 15. The upper-right panel shows the earnings of the top managers as a fraction

                                                  24
of the average wage in the …rm before transition. Clearly, since workers in pre-existing layers earn
less, but the new top manager makes more, the overall e¤ect of adding a layer is ambiguous and not
particularly robust. The relevant …nding is that new managers are the only ones in the reorganized
…rm who earn more after adding layers.

   The results in this section suggest that in order to understand the behavior of …rms that expand,
it is essential to condition on whether the expansion requires a reorganization. On average, the
…rms that expand the most tend to reorganize. So to understand expansions we need to understand
reorganization. The salient fact in the data is that when …rms expand and reorganize they pay
workers on pre-existing layers on average less. This is consistent with the view, borrowed from
the theory in CRH, that the …rm wants less knowledgeable workers on pre-existing layers after the
reorganization. Note that this …nding does not challenge the many empirical studies (Abowd, et
al. 1999, Brown and Medo¤ 1989, Oi and Idson 1999, Bernard and Jensen 1997, 1999, Frias, et
al. 2009) that have found that average …rm wages (or the wages of a particular class of workers)
increase with …rm size or as …rms expand. In fact, we …nd some evidence that this is true in our
sample too. What our …nding says is that this is not the case when we condition on the …rm
reorganizing by adding layers. Furthermore, we …nd that a substantial fraction of expansions are
in fact paired with this type of reorganization.
   One might be concerned that the results presented above are just driven by a reclassi…cation
of agents across occupations. For example, as the …rm expands the oldest and best paid worker
might be now called a ‡oor supervisor and since she has the highest wage, this relabeling results in
a lowering of the average wage of the agents that remain as workers in layer zero. This relabeling
of jobs would show up in our results as a …rm that added a layer and reduced the average wage in
pre-existing layers, even though the actual distribution of wages within the …rm has not changed.

                               To address this potential concern we look at the change in the distribution of wages within the …rm
                               after a reorganization.

                                               Figure 8: Di¤erence in the distribution of wages after minus before the transition
                                       Figure 8 presents the di¤erence in the log wages at each percentile of the distribution for the
                               di¤erent one-layer transitions.9 The …gure also shows a bootstrapped 95% con…dence interval
                               constructed as we explain in Appendix B. First note that the distribution of wages in …rms that
                               transition actually changes signi…cantly. This eliminates the concern that our results are just the
                               result of meaningless relabeling of employees. Furthermore, note how wages in the lower part of
                               the distribution fall for all transitions where …rms add layers and they increase when …rms drop
                               them; exactly as we have been arguing.
                                       Figure 8 also shows that, in some transitions, at the upper tail of the distribution wages rise
                               when …rms add layers and fall when they drop them. This was expected given the results in Table 16
                               where we show that agents in the newly added layer make more money than the average employee
                               in the …rm before the transition. Still, to con…rm that this is in fact driven by the agents hired at
                               the new layer, in Figure 9 we present a parallel …gure without including the hours of work in the
                               new layer (or the dropped layer). The results are very stark and consistent with our interpretation.
                               In all transitions where the …rms add (drop) a layer we observe a shift down (up) in the distribution
                               of wages after the transition. In fact, the largest changes in the distribution are now observed at
                               the upper tail of the distribution. This was expected from the results in Table 15, that indicate
                               that average wages in the upper pre-existing layers are the ones that fall the most when …rms add
                               a layer.

                                       Transitions of more than one layer look similar and we omit them for brevity.

       These results are particularly meaningful when contrasted with Figure 10 where we present
the di¤erence in the log wages at each percentile of the distribution for …rms that expand without
reorganizing.10 As before, the distribution of wages changes signi…cantly. However, now the distri-
bution of wages shifts up signi…cantly at all percentiles of the distribution. So, as expected from the
layer-level results above, the distribution of wages of …rms that grow and reorganize shifts down for
preexisting hours of work, while the distribution of wages of …rms that grow without reorganizing
shifts up.11 These results underscore how, even if one is not interested in layer-level outcomes,
conditioning on reorganization is essential to understand …rm growth and its implications for wages
and the characteristics of a …rm’s labor force.

       We …nish this section with a graphical illustration of …rm transitions and the representative
changes in wages and normalized hours that result from those transitions. Figures 11 to 13 showcase
the results. The main characteristics of these changes have been analyzed before and are consistent
with the …rst 4 implications of the theory in Section 2. The top row shows a representative …rm
that adds a layer and the bottom row a …rm that drops a layer. The …gure emphasizes the dramatic
changes associated with reorganizations in the data.
  10
     Again, bootstrapped 95% con…dence intervals are included in the …gure and an explanation of how we constructed
the …gure is presented in Appendix B.

     In Figure A12 in Appendix A we present the change in the distribution of wages conditioning on …rms that
contract. In this case the distribution shifts down, as expected from the theory and the layer-level outcomes, for all
percentiles in …rms with 2 and 3 layers and for most percentiles in …rms with 0 and 1 layers. In the case of 0 and 1
layer …rms wages at the very top of the distribution increase. This might be the result of some rent extraction by
top managers and owners before …rms exit.

    We could also illustrate how …rms respond to an expansion of, say, 5% in value added. In
that case we can also illustrate what happens with the …rms that do not add layers (which we
know increase normalized hours and wages). We present these results in Figures A10 and A11 in
Appendix A. In the next section we explore a particular form of a …rm’s expansion and its resulting
reorganization. Namely, we study …rms that start to export goods to serve foreign markets.


5    Reorganizing to Export
It is well known by now that exporters are larger in terms of value added and employment (see
Bernard and Jensen, 1999, and Bernard, et al., 2007, among others). This is clearly the case in our
data as well.12 They also pay slightly higher wages. As Table 17 shows, they have more layers of
management as well. The average number of layers of management among non-exporters is 1.23,
meaning that the average exporter has a layer of workers, a layer of management and a fraction of
a second layer of management. If we look at exporters, they have 1.96 layers of management on
average. Hence, Implication 5 of the theory in Section 2 is con…rmed by the data.


                                       Table 17: Description of exporters
                                                                  Average

                         See the footnote in Table 2. The di¤erence in wages is signi…cant at 1%.


    About 44% of the …rms in our data export, and they account for slightly more than 83% of
value added, with some variation across years. More relevant for our purposes is that the …rms that
export tend to have more layers. As Table 18 shows, of the …rms with three layers of management,
71.6% of them export, while for …rms with only workers, only 18.9% of them export.

                            Table 18: Share of exporters by number of layers
                            # of layers       Unweighted           Weighted by V A
                                   0             18.9%                    25.2%
                                   1             31.7%                    38.3%
                                   2             54.1%                    82.1%
                                   3             71.6%                    90.2%

    These numbers are expected given that from Section 3 we know that larger …rms have more
layers, and from Table 17 and the vast literature on exporting, we know that larger …rms export.
  12
     Part of our data is used in Eaton, et al. (2011) to study the exporting behavior of …rms. As a result, some of
these facts for France are known from their paper. However, they have no results on layers or …rm reorganization
conditional on changing or keeping constant the number of layers.


                                                          30
   Table 19 presents the composition of …rms by number of layers. Out of all exporters, only 7.5%
have only a layer of workers, while 42.6% have two layers of management, and 30.4% have three.
So, as shown in Table 19, there is substantial heterogeneity in the number of layers of exporters
and non-exporters. Furthermore, most exporters have many layers, while most non-exporters have
only one or two.

                          Table 19: Composition of …rms by number of layers

   We now focus on …rms that become exporters during the period in our sample: new exporters.
New exporters are more likely to add layers than non-exporters. Table 20 shows that the proba-
bility of adding one or more layers for new exporters is signi…cantly higher than for non-exporters,
regardless of the initial count of layers. The probability of keeping the same number of layers goes
down if the …rm has zero or one layer of management, while the probability of keeping the same
number of layers increases for …rms with two or three layers. Given that …rms with three layers
cannot add layers, this is natural. We conclude from this evidence that new exporters tend to
add layers, consistent with Implication 6a of the theory. Of course, there are some that also drop
layers, but there are fewer of those …rms than among …rms that do not start to export. Table A5
in Appendix A shows that …rms that exit the export market are more likely to drop layers than
exporters that do not exit.


              Table 20: Layer transitions for new exporters relative to non-exporters

   In fact, the new exporters that add layers expand on average much more than the ones that do
not reorganize. Table 21 shows the changes in hours, normalized hours, value added and average
wages for all new exporters, the ones that add layers, and the ones that do not change L. The
table is similar to Table 13, which we analyzed in the previous section, but it limits the sample


                                                        31
to new exporters only. Table A4 in Appendix A presents the results for …rms that exit the export
market. As in Table 13 we present results when we detrend using trends for all …rms in the economy
(not only new exporters, of course). Firms that start exporting increase value added on average
by 3.8%. The ones that add layers increase value added by much more, 11.6%, while the ones
that do not change layers increase value added by only 3.3%. We …nd similar numbers for hours
and normalized hours. Namely, new exporters that add layers expand much more than …rms that
do not add layers.Now let’s look at wages. After detrending, new exporters pay wages similar to
those paid before; so do …rms that do not change layers. In contrast, …rms that change layers
decrease wages by a signi…cant 1.8%. Perhaps more relevant is that this average change masks a
composition e¤ect between the new top manager and pre-existing layers. When we focus on wages
of employees in pre-existing layers, we …nd that wages fall by 11.9% in …rms that add layers (13.9%
if we detrend), while they increase by 2.1% in …rms that do not change layers (although the change
is insigni…cant when we detrend).

   The results paint a picture consistent with the one presented in the previous section. New
exporters that reorganize reduce wages in pre-existing layers. Furthermore, these are the new
exporters that actually expand signi…cantly. The …rms that add layers account for 14.62% of new
exporters and 18.62% of the total increase in value added by new exporters. In sum, many …rms
expand little when they become exporters; these …rms increase the salaries of all their employees.
Some …rms expand a lot when they start to export. They reorganize, add layers, and pay lower
wages to employees in the pre-existing layers and higher than average wages to the new top manager.
   We now proceed to verify that these results hold layer by layer. We look …rst at …rms that do
not add layers. As in the previous section, we estimate the regression in equation (6) for the change


                                                        32
in normalized hours. The only di¤erence is that now we use only …rms that either start to export
or stop exporting in the year in which we measure the change in normalized hours. The results for
 `
 L   are presented in Table 22. Many of these estimates are not signi…cant. The ones that are are
positive as predicted by the theory. As we showed using Table 21, the …rms that do not add layers
                                                  `
expand very little, so it is hard to estimate     L   precisely enough to have signi…cant results.

                   Table 22: Firms that change export status and do not change L

     The results for wages using equation (7) for the sample of …rms that change export status are
presented in Table 23. Now the estimates are much more signi…cant and robust. All the values
of   `   are positive and signi…cant and they tend to increase with ` given L. The ranking of the
     L
elasticities is not always signi…cant, but it is in most cases, and when it is, it corresponds to the
one predicted by the theory. Namely, the wage of the higher-level managers expands proportionally
more than that of the lower-level ones. Hence, Implication 6b is also corroborated by the evidence.

Table 20 shows that new exporters tend to add layers. So it is natural to expect that in fact the
predictions of the theory will be corroborated by the data.

   Table 24 presents the average log change in the number of hours for all transitions and all layers.
The table is similar to Table 14, but it uses the sample of …rms that enter the export market and
add layers and …rms that exit the export market and drop layers. The results establish that, for
all transitions and layers, …rms that add layers increase the number of hours, while …rms that drop
layers decrease them. The numbers are also extremely large. In the data there are 1,132 …rms with
one layer of management that add a second layer and start to export. Our results indicate that
the average percentage change in the number of hours in layer zero is 95% (exp(0:67)) and 74% in
layer one. So new exporters with one layer of management that add a new layer almost double in
employment size. Some transitions are smaller and some even larger. However, all of them tend to
be fairly large and the e¤ects are extremely signi…cant and robust.
   The next step is to look at wages. Again, we study the change in average log wages for all
transitions and layers for the sample of new exporters that add layers and …rms that exit the export


                                                 34
market and drop layers. The results are displayed in Table 25. The prediction in Implication 6c is
broadly corroborated by the data (although the change in log wages in ` = 0 for transitions from
2 to 3 layers is not signi…cant). New exporters that add layers decrease wages and the …rms that
exit the export market and drop layers increase wages. As we show in Table 20, new exporters
tend to add more layers than non-exporters. Similarly …rms that exit the export market tend to
drop more layers than exporters. Again, Appendix A tables A34 to A36, A38 and A41 show several
robustness checks for …rms that transition and for …rms that do not transition, using only …rms
with adjacent layers and DADS wages.

   So exporters tend to reduce wages as a result of adding layers. To continue with our previous
example, a new exporter that had one layer of management and added another as a result of its
decision to start exporting reduces the wages of its workers in layer zero by 2.5%, and the wage
of managers in layer one declines by 26%. In contrast, as Table 26 (discussed below) shows, the
newly hired second layer manager earns 97.5% more than the average wage in the …rm before the
change. Appendix A shows robustness checks with the alternative wage database.


                                                35
   The result should change our view on the distribution of the gains from exporting. The view
that new exporters pay higher wages is ‡awed. Most new exporters expand little and do not
change their organization. They hire more hours and pay higher wages. The new exporters that
expand substantially add layers of management. They hire substantially more workers but pay
these workers less (since according to the theory they also know less). The new exporters that
expand and add layers exhibit more dispersion in wages within the …rm.

   Table 26 shows the same decomposition we showed in Table 16 in the previous section. It
separates the change in wages in the …rm in the contribution to the average of the new top manager
and the change in the wage of the pre-existing layers. The top left panel shows that the average
wage of all existing layers decreases as …rms add layers (and we know from Table 25 that it decreased
for each layer individually). The top right panel shows the wage of the new top manager relative
to the mean wage of the …rm before the change. Clearly, wage dispersion in the …rm increases
substantially when it starts to export and adds layers.
   We end this section as we did the last one, with a graphical representation of the change in
…rms as they become exporters. Figures 14 to 16 show the organization of …rms that had zero, one,
or two layers of management before they became exporters. The …rst row in each graph represents
the old and new organization when the …rm adds layers and starts to export. The second row
represents the organization when the …rm starts to export but keeps constant the number of layers.
   Perhaps the most striking observation coming out of Figures 14 to 16 is how little …rms change
when they do not add layers compared to when they do. Hopefully, these …gures are convincing
in showing that new exporters expand by adding layers, adding employment, and reducing wages.
The reduction in wages challenges, as far as we know, all theories of trade that do not add explicit
organizational choices.

6         How Do Firms Change the Average Wage in a Layer?
The theory in CRH is useful as a guide into the optimal behavior of …rms at the level of a layer.
However, it is silent about how …rms achieve any change in hours, average knowledge, or average
wages in a layer when they face costs or restrictions to adjust freely. For example, how do they
manage to lower the average wages in pre-existing layers conditional on the institutional environ-
ment in which they operate? The answer to this question will surely be speci…c to the particular
characteristics of the French labor market. As such, it is interesting for learning something about
France, but not necessarily about …rms in general. This is why this question is not a central concern
of our paper. Our conclusions and the interpretation of our …ndings is not a¤ected by the answer
to this question. Still, we want to make sure that it is not impossible for …rms to do what we are
arguing they are, in fact, doing. Of course, we know that labor market frictions, institutions, and
regulations make reducing the wage of a particular employee complicated, if not impossible. So
how can the prediction that …rms that add layers reduce average wages in pre-existing layers be so
clearly present in our data?
         The data we use is very detailed in that they allow us to observe hierarchical occupations
together with wages at the occupation level for most manufacturing …rms. To study how reorgani-
zation a¤ects layer-level average wages, we track hours of work, and their average hourly wage, as
they enter, stay, or leave the layer during a transition.13 Studying these transitions we …nd that
    13
         See description of Tables A43 to A46 in the appendix for a detailed account of this excercise and …ndings.


                                                                                 38
…rms reduce wages by promoting or …ring the highest paid hours of work in a layer and by hiring
new hours of work that are paid less. They keep the salaries of hours of work that stay in the layer
essentially unchanged, although in some cases they raise them slightly.14 This reduces the average
wage in the layer. That is, the adjustment happens via an extensive margin. Firms adjust the
composition of the employees in the layer and not the individual wages that they command.
    This way of adjusting the level of knowledge and wages in a layer clearly re‡ects the presence
of some form of downward wage rigidities. Hence, the reductions we observe in the average wages
of pre-existing layer in …rms that add layers necessarily understate the reductions that we would
observe absent these frictions. Similar empirical explorations in other, more ‡exible, labor markets
would shed light on the importance of this argument.


7     Conclusion
This paper provides the …rst anatomy of organizations using a large scale dataset. Previous studies
focused on particular details of the organization and included only a few hundred …rms. In contrast,
we use virtually all the manufacturing …rms in France during the period 2002-2007. To study the
organization of these producers and how they modify their organization, we use occupational data
to classify workers in layers. The concept of a layer of employees and our empirical implementation
using hierarchical occupations have proven enormously useful in analyzing these data. First, …rms
actively manage the number of layers in the …rm. Firms expand by adding them and contract by
dropping them. Furthermore, exporters that expand substantially do so by adding layers.
    We …nd that the organization of labor in the …rm depends dramatically on the number of layers.
In our data, studying the behavior of hours of work or wages in a …rm without classifying workers
in layers and conditioning on changes in these layers results in ambiguous …rm-level e¤ects that are
hard to understand and not robust. In contrast, once we classify workers in layers, the behavior
of wages and hours of work for each layer is easy to understand through the lens of a theory of
hierarchical organization, such as the one in CRH (which borrows the technology from Garicano,
2000). Firms that expand without adding layers increase hours at all layers as well as average wages
at all layers. They essentially behave the way most theories would suggest expanding …rms behave.
In contrast, …rms that add layers (for example, because they start to export) expand much more,
add many hours of work to all layers, but reduce average wages in all pre-existing layers. The fact
that the wages of all pre-existing layers go down is, as far as we know, a novel empirical …nding.
Furthermore, it is hard to rationalize with theories that do not have the organization of knowledge
at their core.15 The evidence we provide is extremely robust and needs to be confronted by all
   14
      Tables A43 to A46 in the appendix present these results for all transitions. Table A43 shows that the results
for hours that stay in the layer are small and not particularly systematic, so they do not dominate the e¤ect on
the average wage in a layer. In contrast, Table A44 shows that the wages of hours that enter the layer are always
signi…cantly lower than the wages of hours that leave the layer (and vice-versa for …rms that drop layers, except for
layer 0 in …rms that go from 3 to 2 layers of management).
   15
      Calvo and Wellisz (1979) and Qian (1994) present theories were e¢ ciency wages decrease as the span of control
is reduced. However, these theories assume a …xed organizational form and so are silent about the way in which

existing and future theories of …rm dynamics and export behavior.
    Our results also have implications for the distribution of wages within the …rm and how this
distribution changes as …rms expand or start to export. Since most large expansions are done
through reorganization via new layers, …rm growth and export behavior lead to increases in the
range of wages within the …rm. This is the case because the new managers in …rms that add layers
make much more than the average employee before the change.
    It is important to be clear about the way in which our results should be interpreted. Our study
has identi…ed patterns in the data and clear robust correlations between organizational change and
a variety of …rm characteristics, like the distribution of employees across layers and their wages.
The patterns we uncover are useful to discriminate between theories of …rm growth and their
implications for labor market outcomes. They establish a set of facts that theories of …rms and
wages should relate to in the future. What we have not done in this paper is to identify exogenous
shocks that lead to reorganization. So our …ndings cannot be used to compute, say, the size of the
e¤ect of a trade liberalization on the wages paid by …rms, or the number and types of the workers
they hire. This analysis could easily be done in a country where such a shock is clearly identi…able.
    Our empirical analysis of …rms’organization can be replicated easily for any country that has
data on wages by occupation at the …rm level. This opens the possibility of studying how …rm’
organization a¤ects a variety of economic phenomena. Hopefully, our paper will convince others of
the importance and relevance of this endeavor.
growing …rms reorganize and, as a result, change the number of employees and wages at each layer.

9         Appendix B - Data Description
Our dataset is built from two data sources, a …rm-level source and a worker-level source, both
collected from the French National Statistical Institute (INSEE). We cover the manufacturing
sector of metropolitan France for the years 2002-2007. The …rm-level source contains balance-sheet
information for all the …rms reporting their income under the Béné…ce Réel Normal (BRN) …scal
regime. This regime is compulsory for …rms above a certain revenue threshold, but it can still
be adopted by smaller …rms. The ratio between the value added of manufacturing …rms in our
original, uncleaned BRN dataset and value added in manufacturing as reported by the French
National Statistical Institute is 96.4% on average. Each row in this dataset contains, among other
things, a …rm identi…er, total employment, total wages and employer-paid payroll taxes, total
value added, domestic, export and total sales, and an industry classi…cation. The worker-level data
source is the Déclarations Annuel des Données Sociales (DADS). This dataset is built on mandatory
employer …ling of the earnings of each salaried employee in France subject to the French payroll
taxes in a given year. Each row of this dataset is an employment spell and contains, among other
things, a worker identi…er, his or her occupation, a …rm identi…er (which will be matched to the
BRN dataset), the number of hours worked, and the total gross wage received by the worker from
the …rm.

9.1        Data processing
We start with the …rm-level dataset, keeping only …rms in the manufacturing sector. There are in
total 553,125 …rm-year observations. We drop some existing duplicated …rm-year identi…ers and
then all …rms with non-positive value added, total employment, total labor cost (i.e. total wages
plus payroll taxes) or total sales. This leaves us with 11.5% fewer observations. We then move to
the worker-level dataset. Starting from the universe of all observations, we keep the observations
referring to all employees in any …rm in the French private sector. We drop observations with missing
or non-positive hours or total wage or with missing occupations. At this point, we match this dataset
with the …rm-level dataset based on the …rm identi…er and year and keep the observations that are
matched (workers for which we …nd the …rm and vice versa). This gives us a dataset of about 25.6
million observations for 6 years.16
         To recover the occupational structure at the …rm level, we work with the occupational code
reported in the worker-level data. The occupational classi…cation used in the DADS is the PCS-
ESE 2003, and its …rst digit identi…es 5 occupational categories relevant for manufacturing …rms:
…rm owners and CEO (code 2), senior sta¤ or top management positions (code 3), supervisors
(code 4), white collar workers (code 5), blue collar workers (code 6).17 We relabel code 6 into code
    16
     Note that the number of observations in any given year does not correspond to total employment. A worker can
have more than one row, for example, because of a job change during the year.
  17
     In this process, we …nd 599 observations of workers categorized as farmers (code 1). Since the …rms in our sample
are only in the manufacturing sectors, we exclude from the analysis the 127 …rm-year observations associated to these
workers.



                                                         63
5, in order to create a unique category of blue and white collar workers, since their hourly wage
distribution coincides in the data (see Table 1). We are left with 4 occupational categories: for each
…rm-year, we sum total hours and total wages of all the observations with the same occupation to
recover the occupational structure at the …rm level. During the matching we lose about 5.9% of
the original dataset. Finally, we trim away …rm-year observations with average hourly wages (see
below for details) above the 99:95th percentile, which would otherwise cause abnormal swings in
the average wage by year. Our …nal dataset is composed of 456,638 …rm-year observations. These
observations represent on average 90.7% of the value added in the manufacturing sector in France.
   To compute the average hourly wage at each occupation, we follow two alternative approaches.
The …rst simply divides the total wage resulting from the DADS by the total number of hours in
the same source. This approach doesn’t include payroll taxes and some other worker-related expen-
ditures paid by the …rm. To approximate more closely the e¤ective labor cost of each occupation
type for the …rm, we compute the share of wages paid to a given occupation in the total wages paid
by the …rm in the DADS source; we then apply this share to the total labor cost as in the BRN
dataset to compute the labor cost of the occupation considered. We …nally divide this total cost
by the number of hours reported in the DADS to obtain the hourly wage from the BRN source.
This latter estimate is our preferred measure of hourly wages; we will use the former measure for
purposes of comparison and robustness checks.
   We …nally recode the name of the occupations into layers of management. A …rm reporting
c occupational categories will be said to have L = c        1 layers of management: hence, in our
data we will have …rms that have from 0 to 3 layers of management. We drop the name of the
occupation and assume that …rms always grow from the lowest (occupations 5+6) to the highest skill
(occupation 2), irrespective of the name of the occupation itself. Hence a …rm with occupational
categories 3 and 5 will have 1 layer of management, and its organization will consist of a layer 0
corresponding to blue and white collar workers, and a layer 1 corresponding to senior sta¤. This
choice raises the question, what is the fraction of …rms with the ‘correct’ordering of layers? De…ne
a …rm with adjacent layers as a …rm that only 1) reports occupations in adjacent categories, 2)
starting from occupation 5+6. In this de…nition, …rms with occupations 2 and 4 or 2 and 3 are
not …rms with adjacent layers; a …rm with occupational categories 4 and 5 is. Table 4 shows that
on average, 81.6% of the …rm-years in the sample (representing 96.7% of value added and 95.7%
of hours worked) meet this requirement. After this recoding, we can compute normalized hours.
We de…ne normalized hours, n`L ; in layer ` = 0; :::; 3 in a …rm with L layers of management as the
number of hours in layer l per unit of hour worked in the top layer.
   In results involving export behavior, we also exclude from the analysis …rms that in some year
have negative domestic or export sales; the sample in this case is of 456,559 …rm-year observations.
   All monetary values are de‡ated to 2005 euros using a CPI de‡ator for France. Value added is
always expressed in thousands of euros; all hourly wages are in euros.

9.2     Description of tables and …gures
9.2.1    De…nitions

Some concepts are recurring in the explanation of a majority of the tables and …gures. We de…ne
them here and consider them understood in what follows.
   Average hourly wage from BRN: the total labor cost resulting from the balance sheet
divided by the number of hours in the DADS source.
   Average hourly wage in layer ` from BRN: the total labor cost for layer ` in the BRN
divided by the number of hours reported in the DADS; the total labor cost for layer ` from the
BRN is the share of wages paid to layer ` in the total wages paid by the …rm as in the DADS
source, multiplied by the total labor cost in the BRN.
   Average hourly wage from DADS: the total wage payments in the DADS to all occupations
divided by the number of hours, always from the DADS source.
   Firms with adjacent layers or …rms in the ‘selected sample’: it is a …rm that 1) reports
occupations in adjacent 1 digit PCS-ESE occupational categories, 2) starting from occupation 5+6
(blue and white collar workers). For examle, …rms with occupations 2 and 4 or 2 and 3 do not have
adjacent layers; a …rm with occupational categories 4 and 5 does and has 1 layer of management.
   Layer number: is the position of the workers in the hierarchy of the …rm, starting from
0 (lowest layer, present in all …rms) to 3 (highest layer, only present in …rms with 3 layers of
management).
   Normalized hours: normalized hours in layer ` = 0; :::; L in a …rm with L layers of manage-
ment are the number of hours in layer ` per unit of hour worked in the top layer L.
   Number of layers of management: the total number of 1 digit occupations in the …rm from
the DADS source minus 1.
   Representative hierarchy of an L layers of management …rm: for each layer ` = 0; :::; L,
we compute the average number of hours and the average hourly wage in the layer from the BRN
among …rms with L layers of management. To mitigate the impact of outliers, the set of …rms used
to compute each average is all the …rms with the given number of layers, trimming observations
below the 0.05th and above the 99.95th percentile of the outcome variable. In a …gure portraying a
…rm with L layers of management, L + 1 rectangles are shown, one for each layer. The horizontal
length of each rectangle is proportional to the number of hours in the layer (hours are reported
along the x axis) while its height is proportional to the average hourly wage (the value of the wage
is reported to the left of each rectangle).

9.2.2    Descriptions

Table 1: This table reports, for each 1-digit occupational code present in the PCS-ESE 2003,
mean and percentiles of the hourly wage distribution across all …rms and years in the data. One
observation in an occupation is the average hourly wage in a given …rm-year from the BRN source,
conditional on the …rm reporting the occupation. The average hourly wage is the total labor


                                                65
cost from the BRN dataset for an occupation, divided by the number of hours reported in this
occupation. The total labor cost for an occupation is computed multiplying the total labor cost
from the …rm balance sheet times the share of wages paid to the occupation as resulting from the
DADS source. Occupation 6 excludes one outlier, which would have driven its mean to 28.94.
   Table 2: This table reports, for each year, the number of …rms in the dataset and corresponding
averages across all …rms for selected variables. VA is the value added in the …rm’s balance sheet.
Hours is the average number of hours from the DADS source. Wage is the average hourly wage
from the BRN. # of layers is the average number of layers of management across …rms in each
year.
   Table 3 and Table A1: Table 3 reports summary statistics on …rm-level outcomes, grouping
…rm-year observations according to the number of layers of management reported (# of layers).
Firm-years is the number of …rm-years observations in the data with the given number of layers of
management. VA is the average value added from the …rm’s balance sheet. Hours is the average
number of total hours from the DADS source. Wage is the average hourly wage from the BRN; to
mitigate the impact of outliers, the set of …rms used to compute the average is all the …rms with the
given number of layers, trimming observations below the 0.05th and above the 99.95th percentile of
the hourly wage distribution; the untrimmed averages across all …rms in the cell are 30.48, 21.54,
21.21, and 22.41 for layers 0 to 3, respectively. Median Wage is the median across all …rms in the
cell of the average hourly wage from the BRN source. Table A1 was constructed in the same way
using wages from DADS.
   Table 4: This table reports the fraction of …rms with adjacent layers conditioning on the
number of layers of management in the …rm (…rst four columns) and overall (…fth column). The
…rst row reports the simple fraction of …rms; the second and third rows assign a weight that is
proportional to the total value added in the balance sheet, and to the total hours in the DADS,
respectively.
   Table 5, Table 6, Table A39 and Table A40: Table 5 reports the fraction of …rms that
satisfy a hierarchy in hours, grouping …rms by their number of layers of management (# number
of layers). Hours NL` is the number of hours reported in layer ` in an L layers of management
…rm from the DADS source. For L = 1; 2; 3, and ` = 0; :::; L         1, we say that a …rm satis…es a
hierarchy in hours between layers number ` and ` + 1 in a given year if NL`          NL`+1 , i.e. if the
number of hours worked in layer ` is at least as large as the number of hours worked in layer ` + 1;
moreover, we say that a …rm satis…es a hierarchy at all layers if NL`      NL`+1 8l = 0; :::; L   1, i.e.
if the number of hours worked in layer ` is at least as large as the number of hours in layer ` + 1,
for all layers in the …rm. Following these de…nitions, the top panel reports, among all …rms with
L = 1; 2; 3 layers of management, the fraction of those that satisfy a hierarchy in hours at all layers
(…rst column), and the fraction of those that satisfy a hierarchy in hours between layer ` and ` + 1,
with ` = 0; :::; L   1 (second to fourth column). Table A39 reports the same information when
weighting each …rm according to the share of its value added among all …rms with L layers. Table

weighting each …rm according to the share of its value added among all …rms with L layers.
   Table 7: Table 7 reports statistics on the mean share of variation in log hourly wages within
a …rm associated to variation in average wages between layers. For each …rm-year, we compute
the R2 of a regression of log hourly wages of workers within a …rm on a constant and dummies for
layers (all except one), weighted by the number of hours each worker provides to the …rm. For each
row, the column unweighted reports the average R2 across all …rm-years, while the remaining two
columns to the right report the same average when weighting …rms by their total number of hours
or total value added. The column …rm-years reports the number of …rm-years used to compute
the statistics in the corresponding row (note that for some …rms - for example …rms with only one
worker - the R2 cannot be computed, and hence the total number of …rm-year in the dataset does
not correspond to the total number of …rm-years used). Each row di¤ers from the others according
to the subsample of …rm-years used in computing the average R2 .
   Table 8 and Table A3: Table 8 reports the distribution of the number of layers of management
at time t+1, grouping …rms according to the number of layers of management at time t. Among
all …rms with L layers of management (L = 0; :::; 3) in any year from 2002 to 2006, the columns
report the fraction of …rms that have layers 0; :::; 3 the following year (from 2003 to 2007), or are
not present in the dataset, Exit. The elements in the table sum to 100% by row. Table A3 reports
the same information when weighting each …rm according to the share of its value added.
   Table 9 and Table 10: Table 9 shows the slope and robust standard errors of a set of
regressions of log number of normalized hours worked at a given layer on log value added of the …rm
across …rm-year observations. Speci…cally, each row ln n`L =nL
                                                             L reports the results of two regressions.
The columns with heading Without FE (With FE ) report the slope and the robust standard error
of a regression of log normalized hours in layer ` on log value added among …rms with L layers of
management, in the raw data (controlling for year and 2 digit industry …xed e¤ects). To mitigate
the impact of outliers, the set of …rms used to compute each regression is all the …rms with the
given number of layers, trimming observations below the 0.05th and above the 99.95th percentile of
each variable. Table 10 was constructed in the same way for the case of hourly wages.
   Table 11 and Table A42: These two tables report the results of regressions of log change in
normalized hours by layer on log change in value added for …rms that do not change their number
of layers of management L across two adjacent periods. Speci…cally, we run a regression of log
change in normalized hours at layer ` (layer ) in a …rm with L (# of layers in the …rm) layers of
management on a constant and log change in value added across all the …rms that stay at L layers
                                              `

while the second one (Table A42) replicates it considering only …rms with adjacent layers before
and after the transition.
   Table 12 and Table A37: These tables report the results of regressions of log change in

s.e. and p-value are its robust standard error and p-value, and obs is the number of observations

A37 uses the selected sample, all the …rms that are observed to stay at the same layer. The second
panel uses hourly wage at layer ` from DADS.
   Table 13: This table shows changes in …rm-level outcomes between adjacent years for all …rms
(All ), and for the subsets of those that increase (Increase L), don’t change (No change in L) and
decrease (Decrease L) layers. It reports changes in log hours, log normalized hours, log average
wage from the BRN, and log average wage in common layers for the whole sample. The change
in average wage for common layers in a …rm that transitions from L to L0 layers is the change in
the average wage from the BRN computed using only the …rst min fL; L0 g layers before and after
the transition. To detrend a variable, we subtract from all the log changes in a given year the
average change during the year across all …rms. In the last two rows of the table, % of …rms is
the percentage of …rms observed doing each type of transition; % VA change is the fraction of the
total change in real value added observed in the dataset accounted for by …rms making the given
transition.
   Table 14 and Tables A6-A16: This set of tables show estimates of the average log change in
normalized hours at each layer ` (Layer ) among …rms that transition from L (# of layers before)
to L0 layers (# of layers after ), with L 6= L0 : for a transition from L to L0 , we can only evaluate
changes for layer number ` = 0; :::; minfL; L0 g. Change is the average log change in the transition,

adjacent years on a constant. s.e. is the robust standard error associated with the constant, p-

according to the sample of observations used to compute the change. The …rst table (Table 14) uses
all observed transitions in the sample; all the other tables condition on positive (negative) changes
in the indicated variables when …rms add (drop) layers; in particular, observations are selected on
changes in value added (A6), in value added and total hours (A7), in total hours of the …rm (A8),
in the total normalized hours of the …rm (A9), and in value added and total normalized hours
(A10). The table series Selected sample (Tables A11-A16) replicates the same set of 6 regression
tables when we consider only …rms with adjacent layers before and after the transition.
   Table 15 and Tables A17-A33: This set of tables show estimates of the average log change

hourly wage at each layer ` from the BRN (a correspondent set of tables replicate the results using
average hourly wage at each layer from DADS). Di¤erent tables di¤er according to the sample of
observations used to compute the change. The …rst table (Table 15) uses all observed transitions in
the sample; all the other tables condition on positive (negative) changes of the indicated variables
when …rms add (drop) layers; in particular, observations are selected on changes in value added
(A17), in value added and total hours (A18), in total hours of the …rm (A19), in the total normalized
hours of the …rm (A20), and in value added and total normalized hours (A21). The Table series
Selected sample (Tables A22-A27) replicates the same set of 6 regression tables when we consider
only …rms with adjacent layers before and after the transition. The table series DADS (Tables
A28-A33) shows the average log change in hourly wage at each layer ` from DADS, using all …rms.

wL0 it+1 is the average hourly wage after the transition in the common layers, wLit is the average

hourly wage before the transition, s is the share of hours of the common layers after the transition,

in hourly wage during the indicated transition. Each cell is computed excluding observations below
the 0:05th and above the 99:95th percentile.
   Table 17: This table shows summary statistics of …rm-year variables broken down by export
status of the …rm. VA is the value added in the …rm’s balance sheet. Hours is the number of hours

layers is the number of layers of management in the …rm.
   Table 18: This table shows the fraction of …rms in the data that have positive export sales,
grouping …rms by their number of layers of management (# of layers). Unweighted reports the
fraction of exporters in the raw data. Weighted by VA reports the fraction of …rms that are
exporters, where each …rm receives a weight proportional to its value added in the year considered.
   Table 19: This table shows the composition of …rms by number of layers of management (#

   Table 20 and Table A5: Table 20 shows, for each transition from L to L0 , the di¤erence
between the fraction of domestic sellers entering the export market that make the transition and
the fraction of domestic sellers not entering the export market that make the same transition. Each
number is computed as follows. Consider all the …rms that have L layers in a given period, and
either do not export before and after, or do not export before but export after; among all these
…rms, let d be an indicator variable equal to 1 if the …rm is transitioning from L to L0 in a given

period, and zero otherwise; we run a regression of d on a constant and a dummy equal to 1 if the
…rm is entering the export market. Robust standard errors are used to compute the signi…cance
levels. Table A5 replicates the same analysis for the case of all …rms that exit the export, the ones
that drop layers and the ones that do not change layers.
   Table 21: This table focuses on …rms entering the export market and shows changes in …rm-
level outcomes between adjacent years for all …rms (All ), and for the subsets of those that increase
(Increase L), and don’t change (No change in L) layers. It reports changes in log hours, log
normalized hours, log average wage from the BRN, and log average wage in common layers for the
whole sample. It is parallel to Table 13 and shares the same content and methodology. The time
trend is computed with respect to all …rms in the sample, not just new exporters.

malized hours by layer on log change in value added for …rms that do not change their number of

   Table 24 and Table A34: Table 24 shows estimates of the average log change in normal-
ized hours at each layer ` among …rms that enter (exit) the export market and concurrently add

presents the results using the selected sample, all the …rms that are observed to stay at the same

   Table 26: This table shows the sources of change in the average hourly wage from the BRN,
by type of transition, focusing on …rms entering the export market. The contents and methodology
are the same as those reported in Table 16.
   Table A4: This table reports the fraction of …rms that have adjacent layers at time t+1,
conditional on having adjacent layers at time t. Transition Up reports, among all …rms with L
adjacent layers of management in any year (from 2002 to 2006) that stay in the sample the year
after, the fraction of those moving to L + 1 adjacent layers of management, with L = 0; 1; 2.
Transition Down reports, among all …rms with L adjacent layers of management in any year (from
2002 to 2006) that stay in the sample the year after, the fraction of those moving to L           1 adjacent
layers of management, with L = 1; 2; 3.
   Table A43-A46: These tables report the sources of changes in the average wage by layer
during a transition. Some introductory notation will aid clarity. For any given …rm, denote with
i an employee, with h (i), w (i) and ` (i) the hours worked, the total wage received, and his or her
wage before a transition, and let us use primes to denote the same outcomes after a transition,
h0 (i), w0 (i) and `0 (i). If an employee is not present in the …rm before a transition then ` (i) =        1,
and h (i) = w (i) = 0 (and analogously if an employee is not present after a transition). In the
employee level dataset for year t, a given employee’s row reports his or her outcomes for year t
(after a transition) and year t      1 (before a transition), provided the employee stays in the same
…rm. Given the way the data is reported, an employee may have ` (i) =               1 even if he or she was
in the same …rm but switched to a di¤erent plant, or switched occupation in the middle of the year
(rather than at the end of the preceding year): in fact, more rows of data may be present for the
same employee. For these reasons, our processing implies an over-estimation of hours leaving the
layer and entering the layer, as opposed to hours staying in the layer during a transition. To track
the ‡ow of hours across layers we reconstruct transitions observed from year t          1 to year t by using
only the employee level dataset for year t (rather than using separately the datasets at time t and
time t   1, which would lose such ‡ow). In a number of cases (less than 1/30,000) we are not able
to match perfectly the layer structure of the …rm with the one recovered by only using information
of employees at time t in each year. For a given …rm transitioning from L to L0 layers, …x a layer
` which is common to both before and after the transition. Hours worked in ` after the transition
can be grouped in hours worked by employees coming 1) from the same layer or 2) from outside the
layer. For each of these groups, we can compute an average hourly wage: denote these two hourly
                     P                         P                                     P

     P                  0
=[    i:`0 (i)=`6=`(i) h (i)];   respectively. Similarly, we can group hours worked in ` before the transition
in hours worked by employees who will 1) stay in the same layer or 2) leave the layer, and compute
                                                                                          P
their average hourly wage: denote these two hourly wages with w ` = [ i:`0 (i)=`(i)=` w (i)] =
 P                                   P                           P
[ i:`0 (i)=`(i)=` h (i)]; and w ` = [ i:`(i)=`6=`0 (i) w (i)] = [ i:`(i)=`6=`0 (i) h (i)], respectively. Tables
A43- A46 report di¤erences between these averages across all …rms where both quantities can be
computed, for each transition and each layer common to before and after the transition. Table A43
reports the average of ln w0 ` =w ` , i.e., the average change in the hourly wage for hours worked
by employees who don’t change layer. Table A44 reports the average of ln w0                  ` =w    ` , i.e.,
the average log di¤erence between the hourly wage after the transition of hours which came from
outside the layer and the hourly wage before the transition of hours which are going to leave the
layer. Table A45 reports the average of ln w0               ` =w0 ` , i.e., the average log di¤erence, after
the transition, in the hourly wage of hours coming from outside the layer vs. hours who stayed
in the layer. Table A46 reports the average of ln w                ` =w ` , i.e., the average log di¤erence,
before the transition, in the hourly wage of hours who will leave the layer vs. hours who will stay
in the layer.
     Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4: These …gures report kernel density estimates of the
distribution of log value added (Figure 2), log hours worked (Figure 3) and log hourly wage (Figure
4) by number of layers in the …rm. We describe Figure 2; Figures 3 and 4 are constructed in the same
way but instead of using value added, we use hours worked and hourly wage, respectively. The left
panel reports the kernel density estimate of the distribution of log value added on the raw data: one
density is estimated for each group of …rms with the same number of layers. The right panel shows
the same density estimated after removing year and industry …xed e¤ects. To remove these e¤ects,
                                             P                P                P
we run a regression of the form log vi = + j j layersij + i i industryij +         i yearij + "i ;
where vi is value added for …rm-year i, and layersi , industryi , and yeari are a set of layers, 2
digit industry and year dummies, respectively. The omitted dummy for layers is for …rms with
zero layers of management. The log value added for …rm-year i without year and industry …xed
                                P
e¤ects is then log v^i = log m + j ^ j layersij + ^"i , where we set m to the median value added in
2002 for …rms with zero layers of management. We then compute 4 kernel density estimates of the
distribution of log v^i ; grouping …rms according to their number of layers.
     Figure 7 and Figure A1: These …gures show the probability of transition away from the
current layer as a function of the initial value added of the …rm. Figure A1 shows these probabilities
in the raw data. Each panel reports transition probabilities starting from a di¤erent initial number
of layers. To produce the panel of transitions out of layer L = 0; :::; 3, we take for each year (from
2002 to 2006) all the …rms with L layers of management and group them into 100 bins according
to their value added; for each bin, we compute the fraction of …rms that will have any number
of layers (or exit the dataset) in the following period and plot the average value added in the bin
against this fraction. In Figure 7, for each transition series we then apply a lowess smoothing for
all the probabilities estimated from the …rst to the 99th bin.

y-axis) in the percentiles (on the x-axis) of the wage distribution within …rms, after the transition
vs. before the transition, and associated 95% bootstrapped con…dence intervals. To compute
these panels, we …rst construct a employee-level dataset that contains log hourly wage of each
employee, a …rm identi…er, year and current number of layers of the …rm, and we remove year
and …rm …xed e¤ects from the log hourly wage distribution. We then focus on all the hours
worked in …rm-years observations where the …rm is making a transition from ` to `0 layers (both
before and after the transition takes place) and compute the pth percentile (for p = 1; :::; 99) in
two distributions: the wage distribution after the transition and the wage distribution before the
transition. Each distribution of hourly wages is computed making sure that each employee receives
a weight proportional to his or her number of hours in the …rm, but giving to each …rm the same
weight, regardless of the total number of hours worked in it (to be consistent with our estimates of
changes in log wages in Table 15 in the paper). The y-axis in each panel reports the log di¤erence
between the wage at the pth percentile after, less its correspondent wage before the transition
(hence, a negative number implies a shift to the left of the distribution at the given percentile). To
compute standard errors, we performed 500 bootstrap replications of this process, clustering the
sampling at …rm-transition level (i.e., one cluster contains all the employees present either before
or after a transition in one …rm) to preserve the within-…rm and within-transition correlation in
wages present in the data, and we report the 5th and 95th percentiles of these replications.
   Figures 9: This …gure portrays, for each transition type, the estimated log change (on the y-
axis) in the percentiles (on the x-axis) of the wage distribution in common layers within …rms, after
the transition vs. before the transition, and associated 95% bootstrapped con…dence intervals. To
build it we follow the same process described in Figure 8, to which we refer, with the only di¤erence
that after removing year and …rm …xed e¤ects, we focus on the wage distribution implied by all
hours worked in layers which are common before and after the transition.
   Figure 10 and Figure A12: Figure 10 portrays, for …rms staying at a given number of layers
in two consecutive years and positive change in value added, the estimated log change (on the
y-axis) in the percentiles (on the x-axis) of the wage distribution within …rms, the year after less
the year before, and associated 95% bootstrapped con…dence intervals. To build it we follow the
same process described in Figure 8. Figure A12 portrays the estimated log change (on the y-axis)
in the percentiles (on the x-axis) of the wage distribution within …rms, for …rms staying at a given
number of layers in two consecutive years and negative change in value added.
   Figures 11-13: These …gures depict hierarchies of …rms before and after a transition, using
normalized hours: each panel focuses on transitions from L to L + 1 layers of management and from
L + 1 to L, for L = 0; 1; 2. In each panel, for …xed L, the left column portrays the representative
hierarchy with L layers of management and normalized hours, using only …rms that will make
the indicated transition. The right column estimates the hierarchy after the transition using the
average log changes in each quantity as resulting from our estimates reported in Tables 14 and
15: the wage (normalized hours) in layer ` after the transition from L to L + 1 is computed as
the average hourly wage (normalized hours) before the transition multiplied times exp(b), where


                                                 73
b is the average log change in wages (normalized hours) at layer ` in transitions from L to L + 1.
Normalized hours after a transition are always set to 1 for the top layer. An analogous procedure
is followed for transitions from L + 1 to L. For transitions one layer up, the hourly wage for the top
layer after the transition is computed as follows: we estimate the average log change in the wage of
                   L+1       L ) and multiply the wage at the top layer before the transition times
the top layer (ln wL+1   ln wL
the exponential of this change.
   Figures 14-16: These …gures portray hierarchies of …rms before and after a transition, using
normalized hours, for …rms entering the export market: each panel of four graphs focuses on
transitions from L to L + 1 layers of management (…rst row), and from L to L (second row), for
L = 0; 1; 2. To estimate the hierarchies before and after a transition (…rst row of graphs), we
consider only the subset of …rms with L layers that will enter the export market and have L + 1
layers the following period. We use these …rms to compute the representative hierarchy before the
transition (top left graph). To estimate the representative hierarchy after the transition (top right
graph), we follow the procedure indicated in Figure 11 and use the estimated log changes for …rms
entering the export market from Tables 24 and 25. To estimate the hierarchies for …rms that do
not switch while entering (second row of graphs) we consider only the subset of …rms with L layers
that will enter the export market and stay at L layers the following period. We use this set of …rms
to compute the representative hierarchy before the transition (bottom left graph). To compute the
change in each layer level outcome, we regress the change in log outcome on change in log value
added, with no constant; each layer level quantity after the transition is computed as the layer level
quantity before the transition times the exponential of the predicted log change associated with
the mean increase in value added observed for these …rms.
   Figures A3-A9: Figures A3-A5 show the relation between the number of normalized hours
worked at each layer against the value added in the …rm, grouping …rms by number of layers of
management across …rm-year observations. Each of the 3 panels …xes the number of layers of
management L = 1; 2; 3 and shows L scatterplots, showing the relation between the number of
normalized hours worked in each layer ` = 1; ::; L against the value added in the …rm. To mitigate
the impact of outliers, the set of …rms used to produce each graph is all the …rms with the given
number of layers, trimming observations below the 0.05th and above the 99.95th percentile of each
variable. The regression line …ts a linear relation between log normalized hours and log value added
and is computed using the same trimming procedure. Figures A6-A9 replicated the same for the
case of average hourly wage from the BRN at each layer `.
   Figure A10 and Figure A11: These …gures show the change in the hierarchical structure
of a …rm with 2 layers of management associated with (…rst panel) a 5% increase in value added
when the …rm adds a third layer (…rst row) or stays at 2 layers (second row), and (second panel)
a 5% decrease in value added when the …rm drops one layer (…rst row) or stays at 2 layers (second
row). Consider the …rst panel (the second panel will follow an analogous procedure). To estimate
the hierarchies before and after a transition (…rst row of graphs), we consider only the subset of
…rms with 2 layers that will become 3 layers the following period, increasing value added and total


                                                 74
hours. We group these …rms in three terciles according to the size of their value added before the
transition, and we use the middle tercile of these …rms to compute the representative hierarchy
before the transition (top left graph). To estimate the representative hierarchy after the transition,
we regress the log change in layer level outcomes (normalized hours and hourly wage for each layer
` = 0; :::; 2) on a set of three dummies (one for each tercile) and log change in value added, using
the same subset of …rms; again, to mitigate the impact of outliers, each of the six regressions is
run on the subsample of …rms trimmed of the observations below the 0.05th and above the 99.95th
percentile of each variable. Each layer level quantity after the transition is computed as the layer
level quantity before the transition times the exponential of the predicted log change for a …rm in
the middle tercile following a 5% change in value added. The average hourly wage of the third layer
after the transition is computed using changes in the top layer (consistent with Figures 10 - 12),
following the same procedure described here. To estimate the change in the hierarchy for …rms that
do not transition (second row of graphs) we proceed as follows. We compute the representative
hierarchy before the transition using …rms in the middle tercile of value added among those that
do not transition. To compute the change in each layer level outcome we regress the change in log
outcome on change in log value added, with no constant, using the set of all …rms staying at 2
layers (trimming as above); each layer level quantity after the transition is computed as the layer
level quantity before the transition times the exponential of the predicted log change associated
with a 5% increase in value added.
