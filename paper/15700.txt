One important puzzle in international political economy is why lower-earning and less-skilled intensive
industries tend to receive relatively high levels of trade protection. This pattern of protection holds
even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to be the relatively abundant factor
of production and therefore would be expected in many standard political-economy frameworks to
receive relatively low, not high, levels of protection. We propose and model one possible explanation:
that individual aversion to inequality—both envy and altruism—lead to systematic differences in support
for trade protection across industries, with sectors employing lower-earning workers more intensively
being relatively preferred recipients for trade protection. We conduct original survey experiments in
China and the United States and provide strong evidence that individual policy opinions about sector-specific
trade protection depend on the earnings of workers in the sector. We also present structural estimates
of the influence of envy and altruism on sector-specific trade policy preferences. Our estimates indicate
that both envy and altruism influence support for trade protection in the United States and that altruism
influences policy opinions in China.

1        Introduction

One important puzzle in international political economy is why lower-earning and less-skilled

intensive industries tend to receive relatively high levels of trade protection. Because this

pattern of protection holds even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to

be the relatively abundant factor of production, it is arguably at odds with the common em-

pirical …nding that declining, comparative disadvantage industries are more likely to receive

protection. Moreover, it is at odds with most theoretical political economy models which tend

to either predict, consistent with most empirical work, that losing sectors from international

trade receive more protection or that expanding sectors that gain from greater trade should

enjoy more government support. Existing accounts are generally good at explaining support

for winners or for losers.         They are not, however, good at explaining why winning sectors

are supported in some countries and losing sectors in others, and they do not explain why

lower-earning sectors seem to be advantaged in the contest for government support in almost

all countries. Our paper analyzes this puzzle in two steps.

        First, we propose and model one possible explanation: that individual preferences over

trade policy are shaped by considerations of others, above and beyond one’s own income. A

growing literature has explored theoretically and empirically the possibility that individuals

may have "other-regarding" preferences.1 One important approach assumes that individual

utility functions depend not only on the individual’s own material payo¤ but also on the

material payo¤s that others receive. These interdependent, social preferences could include

everything from altruism, for which utility increases with the well being of other people, to

spitefulness, for which utility decreases in the well being of others.

        Our model of trade policy incorporates the form of social preferences known as "inequity

aversion," in which individuals are altruistic toward others if their material payo¤s are be-

low an equitable benchmark but envious of others whose payo¤s are above this level (Fehr

and Schmidt, 1999). We show how individual attitudes about inequality— both envy and

altruism— lead to systematic di¤erences in support for trade protection across industries

with sectors employing lower-earning workers more intensively being relatively preferred re-

cipients for trade protection. The essence of our argument is that if individual citizens and

policymakers care not only about how trade policy in‡uences their real incomes but also

how it a¤ects their incomes relative to others, with a preference for policies that promote

income equality, then government policies will tend to support industries that employ lower-

earning, less-skilled workers more intensively. Importantly, we suggest the possibility that

these preferences will be observed across lots of di¤erent types of countries and will in‡u-

ence the observed sectoral distribution of trade protection across countries with very di¤erent

factor endowments and political institutions.

   The second step of our paper is to evaluate the argument empirically through the analysis

of original survey experiments on national samples of citizens in China and the United States.

These analyses include two main tests. First, in a survey question, we randomly assign the

average wage of the worker in the industry under consideration for trade protection and

estimate the e¤ect of variation in workers’wages on support for sectoral trade protection. In

both China and the United States, we …nd that sectors with lower average incomes receive

broader support for trade protection.    Second, we derive from our model and estimate an

equation of policy preferences and we …nd evidence that the social preferences assumed in

our model do in‡uence support for sector-speci…c trade protection.

   Our estimates for the United States indicate that support for sector-speci…c trade pro-

tection depends on both altruism and envy. Increasing our measure of altruism (the gap by

which a respondent’s income exceeds the income of the typical worker in the sector being

considered for increased trade protection) by two standard deviations (a $48,400 annual dif-

ference) raises the probability that respondents support trade protection by 18 percentage

points (about a 59% increase). Similarly, increasing the measure of envy (the gap by which

a respondent’s income lies below the income of the typical worker in the sector being consid-

ered for increased trade protection) by two standard deviations (a $48,800 annual di¤erence),

lowers the probability that respondents support trade protection by 16 percentage points

(about a 53% decrease). Our estimates for China indicate that support for sector-speci…c



                                                2
trade protection depends on altruism but provides little evidence of a substantively impor-

tant e¤ect for envy. Increasing the measure of altruism by two standard deviations (a 2,680

yuan di¤erence on a monthly basis) raises the probability that respondents support trade

protection by almost 17 percentage points (about a 37% increase). We also present evidence

from a follow-up experiment in the United States that social preferences remain important

for understanding variation in support for sectoral trade protection when the ine¢ ciency of

the policy is made more salient.

      Overall, our analysis …nds substantial evidence that Chinese and American citizens exhibit

inequity aversion in their preferences for sector-speci…c trade protection. In turn, this feature

of preferences can explain the puzzle of lower-earning sectors receiving greater trade protec-

tion in so many countries around the world. Such preferences would be in‡uential across a

wide variety of political economy models of trade including standard lobbying models such

as Grossman and Helpman’s (1994) protection-for-sale model. Moreover, the paper builds

on recent contributions by Rotemberg (2003), Freund and Ozden (2008), and Tovar (2009),

which also adopt nonstandard preferences to explain patterns of trade policy. The approach

in those papers is to suggest if voters had certain types of preferences, certain anomalies in

observed trade policymaking could be resolved. Our paper takes a similar approach but also

provides evidence that such preferences are actually observed in the area of trade policymak-

ing. This feature of the paper also contributes to the literature on the determinants of trade

policy opinions, for which various departures from self-interest have been considered.2

      Beyond trade policy, our paper provides a new methodology for investigating the role of

envy and altruism in determining policy preferences.           This general strategy could be ap-

plied to many other areas of economic policymaking for which envy and altruism may be

in‡uential in opinion formation.       Finally, our paper contributes to the broader behavioral

economics literature on social preferences.        Much of the empirical evidence in this litera-

ture that individuals have other-regarding preferences is based on how subjects behave in a

laboratory setting playing abstract games.3 Our analysis of policy opinions using survey ex-

periments provides evidence of such preferences in a real political economy setting. Although

responses to survey questions are costless, it is precisely these responses and the factors that

drive them that policymakers respond to in the policymaking process. As such, evidence of

social preferences in policy opinions as presented in this paper suggests one way that the

other-regarding behavior observed in so many laboratory environments may in‡uence actual

political-economic outcomes.

    The rest of our paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we document the puzzle that

lower-earning, less-skilled sectors receive more trade protection in many countries around

the world. In Section 3, we model trade policy preferences in a setting in which individual

preferences display inequity aversion. Our empirical analysis of the role of inequality aversion

in sector-speci…c trade preferences in the United States and China is in Section 4, and Section

5 o¤ers some concluding remarks.



2     The Puzzle: Sectoral Wages and the Distribution of Trade

      Protection

This section provides descriptive evidence that for a broad sample of countries, low-earning,

less–skilled intensive industries receive relatively high levels of trade protection. This pattern

of protection holds even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to be the

relatively abundant factor of production and therefore would be expected in many standard

explanations of the determinants of trade policy to receive relatively low, not high, levels of

protection.

    Figure 1 plots trade-weighted tari¤s in United States manufacturing industries in 2000

against normalized average wages in those sectors.4 This graph shows a familiar pattern to

      See Levitt and List (2007) for a skeptical review of the real world importance of social preferences observed
in laboratory settings but also DellaVigna (2009) for reasons why laboratory results may both over and under-
estimate the empirical importance of other-regarding preferences.

TRAINS database. The source for the wage data is the most recent UNIDO Industrial Statistics Database

students of trade policymaking in the United States. Tari¤s are relatively low in the United

States but those industries that use lower-skilled, lower-paid workers more intensively receive

higher levels of trade protection. This graph would look very similar employing alternative

measures of trade protection and skill intensity.

    The most common explanation for the pattern of trade protection observed in this and

similar graphs is that comparative disadvantage sectors— losers from expanding trade— get

more protection. A large empirical literature has documented the tendency of governments

to provide greater trade protection to declining industries. In the United States and Europe

for example, heavily protected industries include textiles, footwear, clothing, and agriculture

which have been contracting for decades. Gawande and Krishna (2003) and Baldwin and

Robert-Nicoud (2007) review a number of alternative measures that have been documented

to be correlated with higher levels of trade protection in declining industries. These include

industry growth rates in terms of output and employment and changes in import penetration

ratios. The general idea is simply that governments tend to pick losers when they intervene

to support domestic industries.

    The reasons for this pattern of intervention are not obvious. As Baldwin and Robert-

Nicoud (2007) note, the dominant approach for explaining which industries get protected is

various lobbying models and there are good reasons to think that larger, expanding industries

would have more resources for lobbying governments to support their businesses.5 Some

explanations for this phenomenon include the idea that losing sectors lobby harder because

rents from lobbying are not competed away through entry of new …rms, at least as long as

the bene…ts of protection are not too great (Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud, 2007). Grossman

and Helpman (1996) focus on the possibility that the asymmetry in lobbying e¤ort may be

due to greater free riding in expanding sectors. Krueger (1990) argues that policymakers

privilege declining industries because this supports the income of known workers whereas

supporting expanding sectors supports unknown bene…ciaries. A number of papers have
which is an outlier in many other countries as well.

suggested various ways in which policymakers and/or citizens may be generally averse to

income losses and that this aversion directly a¤ects how governments set policy in declining

and expanding industries (Freund and Ozden 2008, Tovar 2009, Corden 1974).6

      One implication of the idea that governments tend to support declining sectors is that we

should expect signi…cant di¤erences across countries in the distribution of trade protection

across di¤erent sectors of the economy. While some losing sectors may be common across

all countries due to changes in technology or consumer tastes, many changes in the fortunes

of industries will re‡ect di¤erences in comparative advantage across countries. For example,

it is not an accident that commonly cited declining industries in the United States include
  6
      See Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2007) for a more complete review.




                                                                 6
textiles, footwear, and toys. These industries are declining in the U.S. in part because they use

less-skilled labor intensively, a factor with which the U.S. is not well endowed. In contrast,

these industries have been expanding in other countries that are abundant in less-skilled

workers. More generally, to the extent that winning and losing sectors are in part determined

by comparative advantage, we would expect that patterns of trade protection vary across

countries according to their relative factor endowments.

       To investigate this question further, Figure 2 plots trade-weighted tari¤s in Chinese man-

ufacturing industries in 2000 against normalized average wages in those sectors.7 While the

level of tari¤s in China is higher than the United States, what is striking about this graph

is how similar the distribution of protection by factor intensity is compared to the United

States. Those sectors which employ less-skilled, lower-paid workers more intensively have

higher levels of trade protection. This is evident both in the handful of very high tari¤ sec-

tors but also when considering only those sectors with applied tari¤ rates below 40%. Under

the common empirical claim that China is relatively well-endowed with less-skilled workers,

the pattern of protection described in this graph is not easily explained by describing these

sectors as losing sectors as in the U.S. case.

       There are, nonetheless, reasons that lower-paid sectors might be declining in China. For

example, sectors for which state owned enterprises are large employers may be experiencing

employment declines as competition increases. More generally, as China develops wages are

increasing, which may erode its comparative advantage in some sectors. That said, Figure 2

suggests the possibility that lower-paying and less-skilled intensive sectors are more likely to

get greater trade protection in a setting in which we would expect these sectors to generally

be comparative advantage industries. This pattern of trade protection has also been noted

for several other developing countries in previous research.8

     The data are for 4-digit, ISIC, revision 3 manufacuturing sectors. The source for the tari¤ data is again
the TRAINS database. The Chinese wage data was obtained from the China Data Centre at the University of
Michigan. The original dataset consists of over 500 4-digit industries under the Chinese Industrial Classi…cation

    To investigate this possibility more systematically, we examine the correlation of trade

protection and skill intensity in a large cross-section of countries. Our data for this analysis

are from the Trade, Production and Protection (1976-2004) World Bank dataset arranged by

Alessandro Nicita and Marcelo Olarreaga.9 This dataset contains variables on trade, produc-

tion, and protection in 28 manufacturing sectors (3-digit, ISIC rev.2). For each country, we

picked a year close to 2001 for which data was available to calculate trade-weighted tari¤s

and average industry wages. We then calculated Spearman’s rank correlation coe¢ cient for

the tari¤ and wage data. Spearman’s rank correlation is essentially a Pearson’s correlation

coe¢ cient on the ranks and average ranks of each variable. A negative Spearman’s rank

correlation coe¢ cient here indicates that the industry ranks for tari¤s and average wages are

negatively correlated with lower wage industries receiving relatively greater tari¤ protection.

We report these results for trade-weighted tari¤s; the results look quite similar for simple

average tari¤s.10

    Figure 3 plots the Spearman rank correlation between weighted tari¤s and average wages

in 3-digit ISIC, revision 2 manufacturing industries in each country against GDP per capita.11

The …gure reveals two signi…cant patterns in the data. First, for all but two of the coun-

tries, the Spearman’s rank correlation coe¢ cient is negative indicating that in almost every

country industries with lower wages receive greater protection. Second, the magnitude of

this correlation does not vary across countries by GDP per capita. If we treat GDP per

capita as a rough measure of human/physical capital endowments, this suggests that there

is little evidence in this data that comparative advantage is driving the distribution of trade

protection across sectors.

    Figure 3 presents a puzzle for the literature on trade protection: why do industries that

employ lower-paid, less-skilled workers more intensively get greater trade protection across all

transitions to democracy.

types of countries.12 This pattern of industrial trade protection is puzzling because it holds

even in low-income countries in which less-skilled labor is likely to be the relatively abundant

factor of production and therefore would be expected in many standard explanations of the

determinants of trade policy to receive relatively low, not high, levels of protection.13



3         A Social Concerns Model of Trade Protection

The data reviewed in the previous section show that sectors that employ lower-paid, less-

skilled workers more intensively receive greater trade protection across countries with very

di¤erent factor endowments. There are a number of alternative explanations for this pattern

of protection. For example, it may be that tari¤ levels are constrained by GATT and WTO

commitments and these policies are dominated by the domestic political interests of relatively

wealthy countries for which losing sectors certainly do include industries that employ less-

skilled workers more intensively. Another alternative might be that lower paid sectors lobby

harder because their opportunity costs for lobbying are lower. Another possibility which we

explore is that individual citizens and policymakers care not only about how trade policy

in‡uences their real incomes but also how it a¤ects their incomes relative to others, with a

preference for policies that promote income equality. As a result, policies that support the

incomes of low earners are favored in the policymaking process.14

         A growing literature has explored theoretically and empirically the possibility that some

individuals may have other regarding preferences. Sobel (2005), Fehr and Schmidt (2006),
    12
     We also examined some alternative ways to investigate the possibility that low-earning, low-skilled sectors
generally receive greater levels of trade protection. For example, we calculated the di¤erence between the
median trade-weighted tari¤ in industries with average wages above the median pay industry and the median
trade-weighted tari¤ in industries below the median pay industry and show that this statistic is never positive
and mostly negative in our sample countries and that these di¤erences are if anything larger in countries with
relatively lower GDP per capita. These patterns are consistent with those reported in Figure 3.
  13
     In unreported analyses, we explored the robustness of the correlation between average wages and levels
of protection by examining industry panel data for the United States and China between 1998 and 2004.
This allowed us to evaluate if within-industry changes overtime in relative skills or earnings are negatively
correlated with changes in levels of protection in two countries with very di¤erent factor endowments. For a
host of regression speci…cations and estimation techniques that account for a wide range of measurement and
endogeneity issues, we indeed …nd this prediction to hold true. In our Chinese data, a two-standard-deviation
increase in an industry’s average wage is associated with a 34% decline in that industry’s tari¤. In our U.S.
data, the analogous drop is estimated to be about 45%.

and DellaVigna (2009) provide reviews of the empirical evidence of these preferences and

various theoretical frameworks for understanding this evidence. One signi…cant approach in

this literature is models of social preferences which assume that individual utility functions

depend not only on the individual’s own material payo¤ but also on the material payo¤s

that others receive. The main idea is that individuals maximize their utility as they would in

more conventional self-interested models but they do not solely care about their own material

outcomes. These social preferences could include everything from altruism, for which utility

increases with the well being of other people, to spitefulness, for which utility decreases in

the well being of others.

       One in‡uential form of social preference is inequity aversion. Fehr and Schmidt (1999),

for example, posit that individuals are altruistic toward others if their material payo¤s are

below an equitable benchmark but envious of others whose payo¤s are above this level.

They propose a simple utility function to capture this idea and argue that it is consistent

with behavior commonly observed in a wide variety of experimental social interactions such

as dictator games, ultimatum games, trust games, public good games, punishment games,

and gift exchange games.15 Empirically the claim is not that all individuals are averse to

inequality but that there are at least a signi…cant proportion of individuals who are and that

this preference has an important e¤ect on social interactions.

       In this section, we apply the idea of inequality aversion to the problem of trade policy-

making. Our argument is that if individual citizens and policymakers care not only about

how trade policy in‡uences their real incomes but also how it a¤ects their incomes relative to

others, with a preference for policies that promote income equality, government policies will

tend to support industries that employ lower-earning, less-skilled workers more intensively.

Importantly, we suggest the possibility that these preferences will be observed across lots

of di¤erent types of countries and will in‡uence the observed sectoral distribution of trade

protection across countries with very di¤erent factor endowments and political institutions.

       Our argument is related to an older literature that suggested the possibility that gov-

and Sobel (2005) for a more general review.

ernments use trade policy to combat inequality. For example, “social change” arguments

discussed in Gawande and Krishna (2003), Baldwin (1985), Ball (1967), Constantopoulos

(1974) and Corden (1974) are all related to the idea that reducing inequality might be one

explanation for why governments in the United States and Europe seem to favor declining

sectors that employ less-skilled workers more intensively. More recently, Davidson, Matusz,

and Nelson (2006) argue that inequality aversion is important for understanding trade poli-

tics. Limao and Panagariya (2007) address the question of why trade policy is biased toward

import-competing sectors— and therefore restricts rather than increases trade— and show that

this bias may be a consequence of government concern about inequality.

       Our theoretical model closely follows standard political economy trade models with the

key di¤erence being that individuals in our model care about their own incomes and their

incomes relative to others— they are motivated by both envy and altruism.16 The model

focuses on identifying how envy and altruism in‡uence preferences about trade protection

in a standard setting, and then we discuss how such preferences may in‡uence policymaking

outcomes in diverse institutional settings.

       In a perfectly competitive economy with a population size of N and n sectors, individuals

maximize the utility function given by

                       n
                       X                         X                                 X

                                                                            P
    This utility function has two components: utility from consumption (x0 + ni=1 ui (xi )) and
                                          P                           P
disutility from inequality aversion ( n 1 i6=j maxfIj Ii ; 0g n 1 i6=j maxfIi Ij ; 0g).

Goods/sectors and types of individuals— as all individuals within a sector are identical— are

indexed by i, i = 1; 2; :::n.           x0 is the consumption of the numeraire good 0 and xi is the

consumption of non-numeraire good i. The utility functions ui ( ) are increasing functions

which are di¤erentiable, separable, and strictly concave.

       To account for inequality aversion, we incorporate a social preference term into the in-
  16
    Speci…cally, we adopt the same assumptions and notation for the economic environment as in Grossman
and Helpman (1994) except for the speci…cation of individual utility functions.

dividual’s utility function. The term for inequality aversion is same as the speci…cation in

Equation (1) in Fehr and Schmidt (1999: 822). In particular, Fehr and Schmidt specify one

parameter ( ) for “altruism" when Ii > I i ; and the other parameter for “envy" ( ) when

Ii < I i . This speci…cation of the utility function implies that an individual would feel al-

truistic to those who earn less than him/her, and at the same time feel envious of those who

earn more.

   Let   i   indicate the fraction of population N working in sector i, and we assume that

workers in sector i all earn identical incomes which are a function of their labor and the return

to sector-speci…c skills and/or inputs owned only by individuals working in each respective

sector. Note that an individual owns at most one type of sector-speci…c input, and we

assume the sector-speci…c factor input is indivisible and non-tradable. The technologies

to produce these goods have constant returns to scale, and the speci…c factor inputs have

inelastic supplies. The numeraire good 0 is produced with labor alone and sets the economy-

wide return to labor. The non-numeraire good i is produced with labor and the sector-speci…c

factor input. We normalize the wage of good 0 to 1, and the aggregate reward to the speci…c

factor depends on the domestic price of the good, that is,              i (pi );   where pi is the domestic

                                                                          iN               i 1N

sector will, all else equal, be less likely to support barriers if they have a lower income than

workers in the industry under consideration for protection— envy e¤ect— and more likely to

support barriers if they have a higher income than workers in the industry under consideration

for protection— altruism e¤ect. Our empirical work will test this central feature of our model.

For i = j, individuals in this group will gain income from tari¤ protection. However, the

e¤ect of inequality aversion may either increase or decrease workers’ welfare, depending on

where sector i’s per capita factor endowment return falls in the overall income distribution

as well as on the degree of altruism and envy.

   This model identi…es how envy and altruism in‡uence policy preferences about trade pro-

tection in a standard setting and provides clear empirical predictions that we will evaluate in

the next section of the paper. It is straightforward to see that the preferences described in

our model would tend to push policy outcomes in a direction for which lower-earning indus-

tries tend to receive higher levels of protection under a number of alternative assumptions

about the policymaking process— that is inequality aversion constitutes one possible answer

to the empirical puzzle documented in Section 2.

   For example, suppose policy is chosen by a single individual in the society with the

preferences described above. This policymaker could be a citizen from the median industry,

or an individual elected to o¢ ce for reasons unrelated to trade policy, or a leader in a non-

democratic political regime. The exact policy selected for each industry by such a leader will

depend on the individual’s position in the income distribution and the relative magnitude of

the parameters in the model. That said, lower-paying industries are more likely to bene…t

from the policymaker’s altruism and less likely to be punished by his or her envy yielding a

pattern of greater protection for lower-paying industries.

   Another relatively simple way to think about the policy implications of our model of

preferences is to consider the case of a social welfare maximizing planner. In this setting,

aggregate envy toward workers in a sector will tend to lower protection in an industry while

aggregate altruism towards workers in a sector will tend to raise protection in a sector. Lower-

earning sectors will have lower levels of aggregate envy and higher levels of aggregate altruism



                                              16
and thus will be more likely to be protected than higher-earning sectors.17 Many political

economy models of trade are, in e¤ect, models for which a policymaker weighs aggregate

welfare against some other gain such as lobbying contributions. To the extent that aggregate

welfare is in‡uential at all in the policymaking process, inequality aversion is likely to push

policy toward greater protection for lower-earning sectors and less for higher-earning sectors.

       One such political economy model is Grossman and Helpman’s “protection for sale”the-

ory. This model is particularly instructive because it has been applied both theoretically

and empirically to countries with diverse political institutions and levels of economic devel-

opment. For example, policymakers in both democratic and non-democratic settings have

incentives to weigh aggregate welfare whether to win elections or to prevent revolutions or

coups.      As such, inequality aversion can explain why low-earning sectors are more heav-

ily protected across countries with diverse political institutions.          Importantly, however, in

the Grossman and Helpman model, the extent to which policymakers care about aggregate

welfare is only one mechanism by which inequality aversion privileges low-earning indus-

tries.    Aggregate envy and altruism among organized sectors making contributions to the

policymaker will also tend to result in higher protection in lower-earning industries even if

the policymaker does not value aggregate welfare.             This is an important insight because

it suggests one reason why even if there are di¤erences across political institutions in the

extent to which policy is made in the interests of citizens— or how much aggregate welfare

is in‡uential in policymaking— we would still expect envy and altruism among citizens to

move policy toward more protection in lower-earning industries.              While it is certainly the

case, that the introduction of inequality aversion might have di¤erent consequences under

alternative assumptions about either the economy or the political process, there are a wide

variety of economic and political settings under which inequality aversion would tend to push

both individual preferences and policy equilibria toward great protection for lower-earning

sectors of the economy.
  17
    In this very simple economic setting, a welfare maximizing policymaker would choose no tari¤s for many
sectors, but depending on the relative magnitude of the model’s parameters, some sectors would receive
protection and those sectors would be low-earning sectors with high aggregate altruism and low aggregate
envy.

4     Envy and Altruism in Trade-Policy Preferences

Section 2 presented evidence that sectors employing lower-paid, less-skilled workers more

intensively receive more protection across countries with diverse factor endowments and sug-

gested that this pattern of protection was not well accounted for in existing political economy

models. Section 3 argued that one possible explanation for this pattern of protection is that

individual preferences over trade policy are shaped by attitudes about inequality— both envy

and altruism— and demonstrated how both these factors imply relatively greater support for

policies that protect industries employing lower-earning workers more intensively.

    In this section we use national samples of citizens in China and the United States to

provide two critical empirical tests in support of our model. First, we show that preferences

aggregated across all respondents in each country vary systematically with the treatment

income of industry workers: industries with lower-income workers receiving broader support

for trade protection. Second, we derive from our model and estimate an equation of policy

preferences, and we …nd that individuals have the social preferences of altruism and envy

assumed in our model in Section 3. Econometrically identifying these preferences lends

considerable support to our explanation of the trade-policy puzzle documented in Section 2.


4.1   Experimental Design

The main objective of our empirical analysis is to determine if individual policy preferences

about sector-speci…c trade protection exhibit inequality aversion and, speci…cally, to estimate

separately the envy and altruism parameters in the model presented in Section 3. Recall

from Equations (4a)-(4c) that a trade-policy induced increase in another sector’s price a¤ects

individual utility (or sectoral utility since all individuals within a sector are assumed to be the

same) through three channels. First, it decreases the consumer surplus but increases tari¤

revenue. Under standard assumptions, the net impact of these two e¤ects is negative. Absent

social concerns, individuals in other sectors are worse o¤ from trade protection. Second, if

the individual has a lower income than the sector under consideration for trade protection, he

or she su¤ers an additional loss from envy. Third, if the individual has a higher income than


                                                18
the sector under consideration for trade protection, he or she bene…ts from a trade-policy

induced increase in another sector’s price because of altruism.

       To estimate the e¤ect of envy and altruism on support for sector-speci…c trade protec-

tion, we designed a survey experiment that randomly assigned respondents to consider trade

protection for industries with di¤erent wage levels and recorded their support for sector-

speci…c trade protection. In China, the experiment was conducted in face-to-face interviews

for a national sample of the Chinese adult population living in major cities and county-level

cities.18 In the United States, the experiment was conducted over the internet for a nationally

representative sample of the U.S. adult population.19          20


       The English translation of the question that we asked to elicit support for sector-speci…c

trade protection in China was:

             There is an industry in China in which the average worker makes X yuan per
         month. To increase the wages of workers in this industry, some people want the
         government to limit imports of foreign products in this industry. Others oppose
         these limits because such limits would raise prices that consumers pay and hurt
         other industries. Do you favor or oppose limiting the import of foreign products
         in this industry?
             IF FAVOR: Do you strongly favor or only somewhat favor limiting the import
         of foreign products in this industry?
             IF OPPOSE: Do you strongly oppose or only somewhat oppose limiting the
         import of foreign products in this industry?


       The question that we asked to elicit support for sector-speci…c trade protection in the

United States was:


             There is an industry in the United States in which the average worker makes X
         dollars per year. Some people favor establishing new trade barriers such as import
         taxes and quotas because trade barriers would increase the wages of workers in
         this industry. Others oppose new trade barriers because they would raise prices
         that consumers pay and hurt other industries. Do you favor or oppose these new
         trade barriers?

     The experiment was conducted by the Horizon Research Consultancy Group.

     The experiment was conducted by Knowledge Networks as part of their QuickView studies employing

         for this industry?
             IF OPPOSE: Do you strongly oppose or only somewhat oppose new trade
         barriers for this industry?


       The value of X was assigned randomly across respondents to be equal to 1,000, 2,000, or

4,000 yuan in China and 18,000, 40,000, or 80,000 dollars in the United States. These values

were chosen so that respondents were considering trade protection for low, average, and high

wage industries. For example, in the U.S., the low value of $18,000 corresponds to an income

a bit higher than the total money income in 2007 for an adult who worked full-time, year-

round at the 10th percentile in the income distribution.21 Alternatively, one can think about

this low income amount as the wage earned by a worker who worked full-time, year round at

about $9.00 per hour or a bit higher than the minimum wage. The average value was selected

as a round value close to the median total money income in 2007 for an adult who worked

full-time, year-round of $41,245. Similarly, the high wage of $80,000 falls at about the 84th

percentile in the total money income distribution in 2007. The values for China correspond

to points in the 2007 monthly Chinese wage distribution similar to those used for the United

States.22   23


       It is important to compare the wording of our survey question to other questions ex-

amined in the literature on the determinants of trade-policy opinions. This question asks

respondents whether they favor new trade barriers for a single industry and consequently

is more narrowly focused than typical question formats which elicit opinions about general

trade policy across an entire economy. Moreover, although not stated explicitly, our wording

implies that the industry in question is not the industry in which the respondent works. We

chose our question wording to correspond with the empirical puzzle of this paper which is

focused on the distribution of protection across industries and with our theoretical model

which assumes both that returns— income— to workers and policy setting is determined by

industry.

    The marginal responses to this question are consistent with the intention to elicit support

for sector-speci…c trade policies. Speci…cally, respondents are much less likely to give a

protectionist response when considering a single industry than when answering a question

about general trade policy. This is most clearly the case for the United States for which there

is a long record of polling public opinion about trade policy. In our U.S. survey, just 30.9%

of respondents favor new trade barriers while nearly 70% of respondents are opposed (44%

favor limiting imports with 56% opposed in the Chinese data).24 This ratio of two-to-one

against new sector-speci…c trade barriers contrasts with responses to more general trade policy

questions which, depending on question wording, tend to elicit anywhere from two-to-one

support for further trade barriers to equal support and opposition to new barriers (see Scheve

and Slaughter 2001b, Chapter 2). There are many possible explanations for this di¤erence in

marginal responses, including variation in the experimental treatments corresponding to the

average wage levels in the industry under consideration, but such responses are not surprising

given that the proposed policy change singles out a speci…c industry for assistance.


4.2    Experimental Results

Our …rst set of empirical results report the basic …ndings from the experiment— that is the

e¤ect of variation in the assumed average wage of the industry under consideration for trade

protection on support for sector-speci…c trade protection.

    We constructed two measures of support for new trade barriers based on responses to our

question. Trade Opinion 1 is set equal to 1 for respondents who favor new trade barriers and is

equal to zero for those opposed. Trade Opinion 2 is set equal to 1 for respondents who oppose

new trade barriers strongly, 2 for respondents who oppose new trade barriers somewhat, 3

for respondents who favor new trade barriers somewhat, and 4 for those who favor new trade

barriers strongly. Each of the measures is increasing in support for a protectionist policy.

    Table 1 reports the mean estimates for each treatment category and di¤erence-in-means
  24
     Descriptive statistics are based on weighted averages though these di¤ered little from the unweighted
averages.



                                                   21
estimates for each combination of treatments.       These results provide substantial evidence

that support for sector-speci…c trade barriers are in‡uenced by the average wage of workers

in the industry.

   For China, support for limiting the import of foreign products is 7 percentage points

higher (a 16% increase) for respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low

wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with an average wage.

This di¤erence was of a similar magnitude for respondents who considered protection for an

industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with

a high wage. The results thus suggest for China a signi…cant di¤erence between respondents

receiving the low wage treatment and both the middle and high wage treatments but no

di¤erence between the middle and high treatments.

   In the United States, the results are even more striking. Support for new trade barriers is

8 percentage points higher (a 26% increase) for respondents who considered protection for an

industry with a low wage versus respondents who considered protection for an industry with

an average wage. This di¤erence was nearly 19 percentage points (an over 90% increase) for

respondents who considered protection for an industry with a low wage versus respondents

who considered protection for an industry with a high wage. The di¤erences between the

middle and high wage treatments are also substantively and statistically signi…cant.                 It is

clear that support for sectoral trade protection is decreasing in the average wages of the sector

under consideration for trade protection.

   Table 2 reports estimates of the di¤erences across our treatment categories controlling for

various demographic characteristics of respondents and …xed e¤ects for geographical location,

industry of employment, and interviewer. This framework allows identi…cation of the treat-

ment e¤ects within geographical location, industry, and other respondent characteristics. We

estimate the following ordinary least squares regressions:




 T radeOpinion1i;k;j;l =   0 + 1 M W Ti;k;j;l + 2 HW Ti;k;j;l +   Xi;k;j;l +   k + j + l + i;k;j;l    (5)



                                               22
       where the dependent variable Trade Opinion 1 is the dichotomous measure described

above and is increasing in support for trade protection;25 MWT, Middle Wage Treatment, is

a dichotomous measure equal to one if the respondent received the middle wage treatment

for that country and zero otherwise; HWT, High Wage Treatment, is a dichotomous measure

equal to one if the respondent received the high wage treatment for that country and zero

otherwise; X is a vector of demographic variables measuring education attainment, sex,

age, and income;26          k   are …xed e¤ects for geographical location;27        j   are …xed e¤ects for

industries;28       l   are …xed e¤ects for interviewers (China only);         is the error term; i, k, j,

and l index individuals, geographic locations, industries, and interviewers respectively; and

 0,     1,   2,   and     are parameters to be estimated. The omitted treatment category is Low

Wage Treatment and so the parameters              1   and   2   should be interpreted respectively as the

e¤ect of being exposed to the middle and high wage treatments compared to the low wage

treatment.

       The estimates reported in Table 2 closely mirror those discussed for Table 1 without

control variables. For both countries, Model 1 excludes industry …xed e¤ects and Model 2

includes them. For China, exposure to the Middle Wage Treatment decreased the probability

of giving a protectionist response by about 7 percentage points compared to exposure to the

Low Wage Treatment. This estimate is quite similar across Models 1 and 2. The estimated

di¤erence for the High Wage Treatment is between 5 and 6 percentage points across the two

speci…cations. This again suggests that there is no di¤erence between the middle and high

wage treatments. It is worth noting the stability of these estimates despite the fact that the

speci…cations with industry …xed e¤ects have many fewer observations because individuals not

in the labor market cannot be coded for this variable. For the United States, the di¤erences
  25
     The results are qualitatively similar employing the Trade Opinion 2 measure.
  26
     The variables are College Grad equal to one if the respondent graduated from college and zero if not,
Female equal to one if the respondent is female and zero if not, Age equal to age in years, and Personal
Income equal to an individual’s monthly (China) or annual (U.S.) income (see below for further details on the
construction of this variable).
  27
     These are cities and counties in China and states in the U.S.
  28
     These industry dummy variables are fairly aggregated in our Chinese data and include about 20 categories.
For the United States, we recorded the industry of employment for each working respondent using the North
American Industry Classi…cation System at the three-digit level and there are over 100 industries in our data.




                                                      23
across the treatments are statistically and substantively signi…cant across all combinations

and the magnitudes are quite close to those reported in Table 1.       Again, this is true even

in the case for Model 2 for which the industry …xed e¤ects result in a great deal of missing

observations.

   These experimental results in Tables 1 and 2 provide strong evidence that increasing the

average wage of the industry under consideration for trade protection reduces support for new

trade barriers in that industry. The random assignment of the treatments in the experiment

makes us con…dent that these di¤erences are not attributable to other characteristics of the

respondents or other selection e¤ects. The result further provides evidence for one possible set

of explanations for why low-earning, less-skilled industries tend to be more heavily protected

across countries with di¤erent factor endowments and political institutions: citizens, for

whatever reason, prefer to support the incomes of low-wage sectors more than high-wage

sectors and this preference is in‡uential in the policymaking process. More generally, this

…nding is consistent with our speci…c explanation why low-earning, less-skilled industries tend

to be more heavily protected across lots of di¤erent countries: inequality-averse citizens prefer

to support the incomes of low-wage sectors more than high-wage sectors. This interpretation,

however, should be made with some caution. First, these estimates do not provide direct

evidence of envy and/or altruism as de…ned in our model. Second, there may be alternative

reasons why trade opinions vary with the average wage of the industry under consideration for

protection. Consequently, our interpretation of Tables 1 and 2 is that they report evidence

consistent with our argument though there could be other related factors driving preferences

in a similar direction.   They do, nonetheless, constitute strong evidence that preferences

may be important in accounting for the puzzle of low-earning industries receiving more trade

protection across many countries. We now turn to more direct evidence of altruism and envy

in policy opinions about sectoral trade protection.

4.3   Estimation of Envy and Altruism Parameters

To derive our statistical model for estimating the e¤ect of envy and altruism on support for

sector-speci…c trade protection, we start with the individual indirect utility function in our

model, Equation (3):




                               i (pi )
                                                                           X             j (pj )        i (pi )
            Zi (p) = 1 +                 + r(p) + s(p)                            maxf                            ; 0g
                                iN                               n     1
                                                                           i6=j           jN             iN
                                    X           i (pi )          j (pj )
                                           maxf                          ; 0g                                            (6)
                           n    1                 iN               jN
                                    i6=j


   In order to estimate the parameters of this model, we need to introduce an error term

and specify its distribution. The error term should be thought to be composed primarily of

those factors in‡uencing opinion about sector-speci…c trade protection not included in our

model.




                               i (pi )
                                                                           X             j (pj )        i (pi )
            Zi (p) = 1 +                 + r(p) + s(p)                            maxf                            ; 0g
                                iN                               n     1
                                                                           i6=j           jN             iN
                                    X             i (pi )        j (pj )
                                           maxf                            ; 0g +   i                                    (7)
                           n    1                  iN             jN
                                    i6=j


   We assume that      i   is normally distributed and that it enters the function additively. We

further simplify our model in three ways. First, we omit the terms r(p) and s(p); which

represent per capita tari¤ revenues and per capita consumer surplus.                                   Neither argument

varies across individuals and so will be captured by the constant in our estimating equation.

Second, the survey question forces respondents to focus on one industry at a time and so

we consider only income di¤erences between the individual and the average worker in this

industry.    Consistent with the model, this assumes that changes in trade policy in one
                                                                                                   i (pi )
industry do not a¤ect income in other industries. Third, the term                                            is equal to the
                                                                                                    iN

portion of individual i’s income that varies across individuals/sectors and is denoted as Ii



                                                            27
(and analogously for individual/sector j). These simpli…cations leave us with:



                  Zi (p) = Ii    [maxfIj     Ii ; 0g]      [maxfIi       Ij ; 0g] +   i   where i 6= j              (8)

   Let ziF be the utility to individual i from introducing new trade barriers and ziO be the

utility to individual i from the status quo policy with no new trade barriers We assume

that our survey respondents answer our question favoring or opposing new trade barriers by

selecting the policy option that yields the highest utility.                Let Y           ziF       ziO .   If y > 0,

the individual favors new trade barriers and otherwise will be opposed. Further, let yi = 1

if y > 0 and yi = 0 otherwise. Y                is the di¤erence between two normally distributed

variables and is itself normally distributed. As such, the probability that an individual favors

P (Y > 0) = P (Y = 1) or opposes P (Y                   0) = P (Y = 0) new trade barriers can be derived

from the standard normal CDF. This yields:



                      P (Y = 1) =    (   0    [maxfIj         Ii ; 0g]    [maxfIi         Ij ; 0g])                 (9)

   where          ( ) is the standard normal CDF and          0   is a constant. Note that the income term
       i (pi )
Ii =             drops out when ziO is subtracted from ziF because trade barriers in sector j do not
        iN

a¤ect the income of individuals in other sectors in the model.

   The variable Trade Opinion 1 described above is de…ned to follow this estimation frame-

work and is set equal to 1 if the respondent favors new trade barriers and is set equal to 0 if

they are opposed. In both our surveys, we also measured annual personal income. In China,

the survey instrument places individuals into one of 16 monthly personal income categories.

We then de…ned the actual magnitude of each respondent’s income as equal to the midpoint

of the income range in which they placed themselves. This variable, Personal Income, serves

as our measure of Ii . For the United States, our survey assigned respondents to one of 19

annual personal income categories and we constructed the variable Personal Income in the

same way as for the China data. The variable Other Income is equal to treatments in our

survey questions and takes on the three randomly assigned values of 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000



                                                         28
yuan in China and 18,000, 40,000, or 80,000 dollars in the United States. This variable serves

as our measure of Ij . We de…ne the variable Envy equal to Other Income minus Personal

Income if Other Income is greater than Personal Income and equal to zero if not. We de…ne

the variable Altruism equal to Personal Income minus Other Income if Personal Income is

greater than Other Income and equal to zero if not.29                 Thus, we have measures of each

argument in Equation (9) and our initial estimating equation is:



                               P (Y = 1) =      (   0+   Envy + Altruism)                                 (10)

       We estimate this equation as a probit model and report heteroskedastic consistent stan-

dard errors.30 The …rst key hypothesis from our model is that                 < 0 because sector-speci…c

trade protection will raise the income of workers in that industry, reducing the utility of in-

dividuals who have lower incomes than the industry under consideration for trade protection

(see Equation (4a) above). The second main hypothesis from our model is that                    > 0 because

sector-speci…c trade protection will raise the income of workers in that industry, increasing

the utility of individuals who have higher incomes than the industry under consideration

for trade protection (see Equation (4b) above).              In short, new trade barriers increase or

decrease inequality depending on your own income and thus the direction of our envy and

altruism parameters, although both indicating a form of inequality aversion, are in opposite

directions.31

       Our initial speci…cation follows directly from our theoretical framework. Given that our

substantive interest is in estimating the Envy and Altruism parameters, it is important to note

that this speci…cation makes the usual strong identi…cation assumptions of a cross-sectional
  29
     All of these variables are measured in thousands.
  30
     The preceding derivation could be adjusted for analysis of the ordered opinion measure Trade Opinion 2
and estimated with an ordered probit model or a regression. Our results below are qualitatively similar in
these alternative speci…cations. We also calcluated bootstrap standard errors and found little di¤erence in the
magnitudes of our standard errors.
  31
     We note that our estimates of the envy and altruism parameters investigate whether the data from the
experiment are consistent with our theoretical framework. It is possible that an alternative theory, perhaps
an alternative theory of other regarding preferences would explain the data as well. We note though that
the results described below are more consistent with inequality aversion— envy and altruism— than a pure
altruism account.




                                                      29
analysis. These assumptions would be violated if the model was incomplete and the omitted

factors were correlated with Envy or Altruism.             Because Personal Income is a component

of the Envy and Altruism variables, and because personal income and its correlates such as

education have been shown to be associated with trade opinions, there is little doubt that

the estimates in this baseline speci…cation are biased.

       In a second, preferred speci…cation, we add three additional controls. The …rst is Personal

Income; the second is an indicator variable, Personal Income Greater, equal to one if the

individual’s Personal Income is greater than the Other Income treatment which they received;

and the third is an interaction term between Personal Income Greater and Personal Income.

This speci…cation recognizes that the Envy and Altruism variables are a function of Personal

Income, Other Income, and which one is greater than the other. The experimental treatments

ensure that Other Income is randomly assigned across respondents but Personal Income is

not.      However, once we control for Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their

interaction, variation in the Envy and Altruism variables is driven exclusively by the random

assignment of the Other Income treatments from the survey experiment. This speci…cation

has the substantial advantage of fully employing the experiment to identify our estimates

of the Envy and Altruism parameters and yields consistent estimates of the parameters

even if the model is incomplete.32           For this reason, although we report results for the

initial speci…cation, we focus attention on the models that include Personal Income, Personal

Income Greater, and their interaction as controls. We also present additional results which

add control variables to this second speci…cation.

       Table 3 reports our main results for China. The estimates for Model 3 are for our ini-

tial speci…cation, Equation (10).         The estimates for both envy and altruism are small in

magnitude and statistically insigni…cant. As discussed above, this speci…cation follows from

the theoretical model but is likely biased because although the Other Income component of

Envy and Altruism is randomly assigned, the Personal Income component is not. Given
  32
    Note that one potential concern is if there are heterogeneous treatment e¤ects from the di¤erent compo-
nents of the Envy and Altruism variables (see Dunning 2008 for a related discussion), this speci…cation would
only estimate the e¤ect from the Other Income component of Envy and Altruism.

the existing literature on the correlates of trade opinions, there are very good reasons to

believe that there are unobserved and omitted factors in‡uencing trade opinions which are

correlated with Envy or Altruism. The Model 4 speci…cation in Table 3 addresses this issue

by adding the variables Personal Income, Personal Income Greater and their interaction.

Once we add these controls, variation in the Envy and Altruism variables is driven only by

the random assignment of the Other Income treatments from the survey experiment and so

we can be con…dent our estimates are not biased by omitted unobserved factors in‡uencing

trade opinions.

       The estimates for Model 4 indicate that the estimates for both envy and altruism are

correctly signed but that only the estimate for altruism is statistically and substantively

signi…cant (the probit coe¢ cient estimate for           is 0.159 with a standard error of 0.055).

This indicates, that all else equal, individuals with incomes greater than the income of the

average worker in the industry under consideration for protection are more supportive of

sector-speci…c trade barriers, the greater their income is relative to the income of workers

in the industry which may be protected. To get a sense of the magnitude of this e¤ect,

the impact of increasing the Altruism measure from 0— the value assigned to the variable

when the respondent has an income less than or equal to the average income in the industry

under consideration for protection— to 2.68— a two standard deviation increase equivalent

to an income di¤erence of 2,680 yuan— on the probability of supporting new trade barriers,

holding all other variables at their means is 0.165 (standard error of 0.057). This means that

the probability of favoring new trade barriers increases 16.5 percentage points, which is over

a 37% increase from the overall mean of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.33

       Table 3 also reports two additional speci…cations which add various control variables

to Model 4. The Model 5 speci…cation adds the variables College Grad, Female, and Age

de…ned above and …xed e¤ects for geographical location and interviewer while the Model 6

speci…cation also adds …xed e¤ects for industry of employment. Not surprisingly, given the

design of the experiment, our estimates of the envy and altruism parameters                    and     in
  33
   This estimate was calculated by simulating from the sampling distribution of the probit parameter esti-
mates, following the procedures described in King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000),



                                                   33
Models 5 and 6 are quite similar to those reported for Model 4. Overall, the estimates in

Table 3 provide robust evidence that in China, altruism has a positive e¤ect on support for

trade protection.

   Table 4 reports our main results for the U.S. The estimates for Model 3 indicate negative

and statistically signi…cant coe¢ cients for both the Envy and Altruism variables. The Envy

result is consistent with our theoretical expectations while the Altruism estimate is not.

However, as discussed in the results for China, this speci…cation follows from the theoretical

model but is likely biased given what we know about determinants of trade policy opinions and

the assignment of the Personal Income component of the Envy and Altruism variables. The

Model 4 speci…cation in Table 4 addresses this potentional problem by adding the variables

Personal Income, Personal Income Greater and their interaction. Once we add these controls,

variation in the Envy and Altruism variables is driven only by the random assignment of the

Other Income treatments from the survey experiment and so we can be con…dent that our

estimates are not biased by the omission of unobserved factors in‡uencing trade opinions.

   The results for Model 4 indicate that the estimates for both envy and altruism are correctly

signed and statistically and substantively signi…cant The estimated probit coe¢ cient, , for

the variable Envy is equal to -0.010 with a standard error of 0.002.       This indicates that,

all else equal, individuals are less supportive of sector-speci…c trade barriers, the greater the

income of the average worker in the industry under consideration for protection relative to

the survey respondent. The magnitude of the envy e¤ect is substantial. To get a sense of

the substantive magnitude of this estimate, the e¤ect of increasing the Envy measure from

0— the value assigned to the variable when the respondent has an income greater than or

equal to the average income in the industry under consideration for trade protection— to

48.8— a two standard deviation increase equivalent to an income di¤erence of $48,800— on

the probability of supporting new trade barriers, holding all other variables at their means

is -0.163 (standard error of 0.025). This means that the probability of favoring new trade

barriers falls 16.3 percentage points, which is almost a 53% decrease from the overall mean

of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.



                                               34
       The estimated probit coe¢ cient,      , for the variable Altruism is equal to 0.010 with a

standard error of 0.004. The magnitude of this e¤ect is also substantively signi…cant. The

e¤ect of increasing the Altruism measure from 0— the value assigned to the variable when

the respondent has an income less than or equal to the average income in the industry under

consideration for trade protection— to 48.4— a two standard deviation increase equivalent to

an income di¤erence of $48,400— on the probability of supporting new trade barriers, holding

all other variables at their means is 0.182 (standard error of 0.065).            This means that the

probability of favoring new trade barriers increases 18.2 percentage points, which is about a

59% increase from the overall mean of the Trade Opinion 1 measure.

       Table 4 also reports two additional speci…cations which add various control variables

to Model 4. The Model 5 speci…cation adds the variables College Grad, Female, and Age

de…ned above and …xed e¤ects for the state of the respondent. The Model 6 speci…cation

also adds …xed e¤ects for industry of employment.34 Our estimates of the envy and altruism

parameters      and   are quite similar to those reported for Model 4. So although education and

sex in‡uence trade opinions, their inclusion makes little di¤erence for our estimates because

conditional on Personal Income, Personal Income Greater, and their interaction, variation

in Envy and Altruism is randomly assigned and thus uncorrelated with our measures of

education, sex, or any other determinants of trade opinion. Overall, the estimates in Table

4 provide robust evidence that envy and altruism have an important e¤ect on support for

trade protection in our U.S. data.

       Taken together the results in both China and the United States strongly support the

overall argument of this paper.        One reason that lower-earning sectors receive more trade

protection around the world may be that citizens support trade protection more for low-

earning sectors. This support could obviously be in‡uential in a democratic setting but it

could also be in‡uential in an environment in which special interests dominate— whether it

be in a democratic or non-democratic regime.             Furthermore, when we combine our model
  34
    The addition of the industry dummy variables decreases the number observations even more than in the
analyses reported in Table 2 because the probit model drops from the analysis any observations for which an
industry dummy variable perfectly predicts opinion.




                                                    35
with our experiment, our empirical results are consistent with inequality aversion— in the

form of envy and altruism— accounting for why individuals are more supportive of protection

for lower-earning sectors.


4.4      Envy, Atruism, and Ine¢ cient Policy

One of the distinctive features of trade policy is that it is an ine¢ cient policy instrument for

redistributing income. In fact, why governments use trade policy at all to redistribute in-

come when other policies could do so more e¢ ciently is a central question in the international

political economy literature. To explore further the importance of inequality aversion in un-

derstanding trade policy preferences, and perhaps shed some light on why individual citizens

support costly redistribution, we conducted a small follow-up experiment with a subset of

our U.S. respondents. We asked the following question immediately after the respondents

answered the initial trade question analyzed above:


             Considering this same industry in which the average worker makes X dollars
         per year, economists have estimated that to raise this worker’s salary by 5,000
         dollars per year through new trade barriers such as import taxes and quotas, it
         would cost Y dollars per year to the US economy in terms of higher consumer
         prices and higher costs for other industries for each worker helped. Do you still
         favor or oppose these new trade barriers?
             IF FAVOR: Do you strongly favor or only somewhat favor new trade barriers
         for this industry?
             IF OPPOSE: Do you strongly oppose or only somewhat oppose new trade
         barriers for this industry?


       The value of X was set equal to the same value initially assigned to that respondent

(18,000, 40,000, or 80,000 dollars) in our main question described above and the value of Y

was set equal to either 5,000 dollars for the e¢ cient redistribution or 7,500 for the ine¢ cient

redistribution. This experiment allows us to investigate whether the pattern of trade pref-

erences that we observe in our main experiment remain even when the ine¢ ciency of the

policy is made salient to respondents.35 The evidence presented thus far already suggests
  35
    One caveat which should be kept in mind in thinking about this second experiment is that our survey
respondents may have a tendency to stick to their original policy opinion in order to remain consistent in their



                                                      36
that inequality aversion helps explain support for ine¢ cient redistributive trade policy, but

our second experiment makes the ine¢ ciency unambiguous.

    Table 5 presents the key results from this experiment, focusing on the results for the

variable Trade Opinion 3 which records support for increased trade barriers as a 1 and

codes opposition as a 0. The …rst panel reports the mean estimates and standard errors for

those respondents that received the e¢ cient prime of $5,000 and for those that received the

ine¢ cient prime of $7,500. Making the ine¢ ciency of trade policy more salient moderately

reduces support for protection from 0.28 to 0.24 of respondents. Given the sample size in this

second experiment, this di¤erence has a p-value of 0.13 (the di¤erence for the full ordered

responses has a p-value 0.04).

    Our main interest is in whether our results indicating the importance of social concerns

in opinion formation about trade are robust when individuals are primed about the ine¢ -

ciency of trade policy. The second panel in Table 5 reports the di¤erences across treatment

groups under the e¢ cient and ine¢ cient prime. Crucially, the estimates under the ine¢ -

cient prime are 0.115, 0.182, and 0.067 for the low-wage minus middle-wage treatment, the

low-wage minus high-wage treatment, and middle-wage minus high-wage treatment respec-

tively. These di¤erences are in the predicted direction, are of similar magnitudes as in our

main experiment, and are statistically sign…cant at the 0.01, 0.00, and 0.11 levels.                     Under

the e¢ cient policy prime, the results indicate a signi…cant di¤erence between the low and

high-wage treatments and middle and high-wage treatments but not between the low and

middle-wage treatments. Thus, if anything, the average wage of workers in the industry

under consideration is more important for understanding preferences when the ine¢ ciency

of the policy is salient. This strengthens our interpretation that our main results indicate

that social concerns are important for understanding why individuals are more or less likely

to support costly redistributions. The third panel in Table 5 reports the regression estimates

for the Middle Wage Treatment and High Wage Treatment variables.employing the Model 1
views. We note, though, that almost 20% of our respondents changed positions from support to opposition or
vice-versa. Further, as we discuss below there is heterogeneity in our results across the e¢ cient and ine¢ cient
prime suggesting individuals were willing to respond to the new information.

speci…cation which includes demographic controls and state …xed e¤ects. These estimates

con…rm the pattern observed in the di¤erence estimates.

         The fourth and …nal panel in Table 5 presents probit estimates of the envy and altruism

parameters employing our Model 4 speci…cation.                  Again, focusing our attention on the

estimates for the respondents who received the ine¢ cient prime, we …nd our estimates quite

similar to those reported in Table 4. The estimate for the envy parameter is -0.008 (with a

standard error of 0.004) compared to the Table 4 estimate of -0.010. The altruism estimate

is 0.009 compared to 0.010 in Table 4. However, the altruism estimate here is imprecisely

estimated with a standard error almost as large as the coe¢ cient.36 Again, when we compare

these estimates across the e¢ cient and ine¢ cient prime, the results suggest, if anything, envy

and altruism are more important for understanding policy opinions when it is salient that

the policy is ine¢ cient.



5         Conclusion

Trade and economic policymaking more generally foment so much political activity and the-

atre because of the signi…cant distributional consequences at stake. One important class of

explanations for why governments adopt policies that support the incomes of some citizens

but not others is that these polcies re‡ect the preferences of particular actors— voters, in-

dustry lobbies, politicians, etc.— in the policymaking process. An essential element of any

explanation of policy outcomes is what accounts for the preferences of the relevant actors.

In trade and virtually all areas of economic policymaking, self-interest— how policy a¤ects an

individual’s economic welfare— is a compelling place to start in explaining support for policy

alternatives.

         Nonetheless, this does not preclude the possibility that economic policy preferences are

also in‡uenced by other-regarding preferences. Our paper investigates the possibility that

social concerns in‡uence policy opinions in trade, an important area of economic policymak-

    Given the smaller sample sizes here, we would emphasize the similarities in the magnitude of the estimates
rather than imprecision of the altruism estimate.

ing, and that these preferences may help explain policy outcomes not easily accounted for by

exisiting theories.

   Speci…cally, we address the question of why in so many countries lower-earning, less-

skilled intensive industries receive relatively high levels of trade protection. What is especially

puzzling is that this pattern of protection holds even in low-income countries in which less-

skilled labor is likely to be the relatively abundant factor of production and therefore would

be expected in many standard political-economy frameworks to receive relatively low, not

high, levels of protection.

   We o¤er an explanation of this puzzle: individual preferences that display inequity aver-

sion. Under a variety of models of the policymaking process, inequity aversion on the part

of individual citizens would make it more likely that governments favor lower-earning, less-

skilled intensive industries in setting trade policy. To provide empirical evidence in support

of our explanation, we analyze policy preferences in national samples of citizens in China and

the United States. First, we show that preferences aggregated across all respondents in each

country vary systematically with the treatment income of industry workers: industries with

lower-income workers receive broader support for trade protection. Second, we derive from

our model and estimate an equation of policy preferences, …nding that individuals have the

social preferences of altruism and envy assumed in our model. Econometrically identifying

these preferences lends considerable support to our explanation of the trade-policy puzzle,

and suggests that social concerns as well as self-interest in‡uence opinion formation about

trade policy.

   In addition to contributing to the trade policy literature, our paper provides a new

methodology for investigating the role of envy and altruism in determining policy prefer-

ences. This general strategy could be applied to many other areas of economic policymaking

for which envy and altruism may be in‡uential in opinion formation. Our …ndings for trade

policy recommend greater attention to how social concerns may in‡uence the policymaking

process across many areas of government economic policymaking.
