Corporate Taxes and Internal Borrowing within Multinational Firms

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper develops a theoretical model of multinational firms with an internal capital market. Main
reasons for the emergence of such a market are tax avoidance through debt shifting and the existence
of institutional weaknesses and financial frictions across host countries. The model serves to derive
hypotheses regarding the role of local versus foreign characteristics such as profit tax rates, lack of
institutional quality, financial underdevelopment, and productivity for internal debt at the level of a
given foreign affiliate. The paper assesses hypotheses in a panel data-set covering the universe of German
multinational firms and their internal borrowing. Numerous novel insights are gained. For instance,
the tax-sensitivity found in this paper is many times higher than previous research suggests. This accrues
mainly to three things: the consideration of the boundedness of the internal debt ratio as a dependent
variable in comparison to its treatment as an unbounded variable in most of the previous work; the
coverage of all (small and large) multinationals here rather than a focus on large units in previous work;
and the inclusion of endogenous characteristics in other countries multinationals are invested in (due
to endogenous weights) while previous work did not consider such effects at all or assumed them to
be exogenous. Moreover, local and foreign (at other locations of a given affiliate) market conditions
matter more or less symmetrically and in the opposite direction. There is a nonlinear trade-off between
institutional quality or financial development on the one hand and higher profit tax rates on the other
hand, and the strength of this trade-off depends on the characteristics of one location relative to the
other ones a multinational firm has affiliates (or the headquarters) in.

1    Introduction

 ... in a credit-constrained setting [...] headquarters can create value by actively reallocating
 scarce funds across projects. For example, the cash flow generated by one division’s activity
 may be taken and spent on investment in another division, where the returns are higher.
                                                        Jeremy Stein (1997, p. 111)

     A recent literature in corporate finance explores how large corporations allocate scarce
funds to different company divisions through an internal capital market (see Gertner and
Scharfstein, 1994; Stein, 1997; Bolton and Scharfstein, 1998; Scharfstein and Stein, 2000).
A prime example of such multi-unit companies are multinational enterprises (MNEs) which
operate affiliated entities in different countries. In principal, each plant could operate as a
separate unit and independently raise external funds to finance investment, just like any other
local firm. Similar to other forms of multi-unit firms, productivity may differ across the units
(affiliates) within MNEs. However, in contrast to domestic (single-country) multi-unit firms,
MNEs are exposed to different corporate tax rates, institutional quality, or levels of financial
development. Unit-specific productivity and local corporate tax rates determine the return
on capital across units. Local institutional quality (such as legal, accounting, or governance
standards) affect the accessibility of external capital markets. Similarly, the maturity of
the financial sector (or its development) influence the loan rates charged at external capital
markets and, hence, the cost of capital. In case of scarce resources, differences in these
fundamentals (even in the absence of tax differentials) across countries and locations of
units of an MNE then generate an incentive to reallocate capital across units to their most
efficient use through an internal capital market. An important consequence of this procedure
is that investments of different units within the same MNE then become interrelated.
     This paper postulates a theoretical model of affiliates of MNEs which are financially
constrained to different degrees. All units raise external funds at local capital markets and,
in addition, borrow or lend at the MNE’s internal capital market. The presence of financial
constraints entails an excess return on investment. In our model, tighter constraints imply
higher returns on investment. We illustrate as to how an MNE optimally allocates internal
funds among units facing lesser constraints and ones with tighter constraints through an
internal capital market. This internal borrowing and lending renders investment of units of
an MNE different from stand-alone, but otherwise comparable, local firms which cannot rely
on an internal capital market. By ignoring reasons for an internal capital market beyond the
variability of profit tax rates, earlier research on the matter comes to the strong hypothesis
that only the affiliate facing the lowest tax rate should lend and all others borrow internally
to exploit the tax advantage of interest deductions.
     The model proposed in this paper predicts a much richer pattern of internal capital flows
that cannot be explained by standard models without capital market frictions. Differences in
unit-specific productivity, local institutional quality, and financial institutions may amplify
or offset differences in profit tax rates so that internal capital can flow in any direction.
Empirical work ought to control for such fundamentals of the internal capital market to
be able to identify the effect of corporate tax rates on internal borrowing and lending.

                                               2
Furthermore, since an operative internal capital market renders investments across plants
inherently interdependent, not only the lowest profit tax rate but the tax rates of all units
are relevant.
    We utilize the panel data-set Microdatabase Direct Investment (MiDi) provided by
Deutsche Bundesbank (the German Central Bank) containing information about virtually
all foreign affiliates of German MNEs to shed light on both aforementioned aspects of inter-
nal capital markets: the dependence of the internal capital market on fundamentals beyond
tax rates such as institutional quality and financial development at the location of units;
and the relevance of profit tax rates, productivity, and (financial and other) institutions not
only at the unit with the most favorable environment but also at other locations for internal
borrowing and lending.
    Using a fractional response model, our main results imply that a one-percentage point
higher statutory tax rate in the host country is associated with a 0.92-percentage point
higher internal-debt-to-capital ratio of the borrowing affiliate. At the same time, a one-
percentage point increase in the (weighted) tax rate of the lending affiliates is associated
with a 0.77-percentage point lower internal-debt-to-capital ratio of the borrowing affiliate.
Other determinants of internal debt show the same qualitative pattern. While financial
underdevelopment in the host country is positively related to the internal debt ratio of the
borrowing affiliate, financial underdevelopment at other locations exerts a negative effect on
the internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate. Financial weakness in the host country is
associated with a higher internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate, but financial weakness
at the lender locations leads to a lower internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate. A
higher affiliate-level productivity of the borrowing affiliate relates positively to its internal
debt ratio, but a higher productivity of the lenders exerts a negative impact on the internal
debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate (it should be mentioned, however, that productivity
measures are found to be statistically insignificant).
    The next section sets out to portray the state of earlier theoretical and empirical work on
internal capital markets and MNEs. Sections 3 and 4 introduce and analyze, respectively, the
theoretical model. Section 5 describes the empirical approach taken and introduces the data.
Section 6 summarizes and discusses the empirical results, and the last section concludes.


2    Previous Work on Debt Shifting
A substantial literature in public economics has investigated theoretically and empirically
how tax rate differences induce international profit shifting via internal debt and other
channels. MNEs with affiliates in different countries tend to exploit differences in tax rates to
reduce consolidated tax payments. Devereux (2007) provides an overview of the literature. In
Mintz and Smart (2004), for example, the subsidiary in the country with the lowest tax rate
lends to other units subject to higher tax rates. This tax arbitrage is profitable since interest
earnings in the tax haven country are only lightly taxed, while interest deductions in high-tax
countries create large tax savings. Typically, the literature assumes reduced form ‘agency
costs’ of debt such that a deviation from a natural leverage ratio and a positive internal debt
ratio create rising deadweight costs that eventually limit the amount of debt shifting (see


                                               3
Fuest and Hemmelgarn, 2005; Huizinga et al. 2008; Buettner et al., 2009; Overesch, 2009;
Egger et al., 2010; for example). Empirical results find that debt shifting is important, and
undermines corporate tax revenue in high-tax countries (Huizinga et al., 2008) since MNE
subsidiaries are much higher leveraged than autonomous national firms (Egger et al., 2010).
On the positive side, the possibility of debt shifting can facilitate investment in high-tax
countries (Overesch, 2009).
    Desai et al. (2004) estimate that 10% higher local corporate tax rates are associated
with 2.8% higher affiliate debt-to-asset ratios. One interesting result of their analysis is
that the elasticity of external borrowing with respect to the tax rate is 0.19, while the
elasticity of internal borrowing is 0.35. Mintz and Smart (2004) argue that income shifting
has pronounced effects on provincial tax bases in Canada. They estimate the elasticity of
taxable income with respect to tax rates for income shifting firms to be 4.9 and only 2.3 for
other, comparable firms. Egger et al. (2010) find a substantial difference in the debt-to-asset
ratios between foreign and domestically owned firms and report a strong interaction effect
between plant operation mode and tax rates. An increase in the statutory corporate tax
rate by one percentage point leads to an increase in the debt ratio by about 0.7 percentage
points.
    Some papers recognize more interaction of internal lending among affiliate units, as op-
posed to the unidirectional flow of debt from the unit with the lowest tax rate to all others
with higher rates. Huizinga et al. (2008) find that debt leverage of a subsidiary in a given
country significantly depends on a weighted average of tax rate differentials to all other units.
    Desai et al. (2004) point to the fact that internal debt not only responds to tax rate differ-
entials but is also importantly influenced by financial market development and institutional
quality. They find that multinational affiliates obtain less external debt in countries with
underdeveloped capital markets and higher local borrowing costs. Internal debt substitutes
for about three quarters of reduced external borrowing due to adverse local capital market
conditions. Buettner et al. (2009) confirm this result using data on German multinationals.
Antras et al. (2009, p. 1208) argue, as does this paper, that ‘the exploitation of technology
is central to understanding MNE activity, but the critical constraint is the nature of capital
market development and investor protections in host countries.’ Their focus is, however, on
the choice of arm’s length trading relative to foreign direct investment (FDI), rather than
tax-induced internal debt shifting. Like the present paper, they develop an MNE model
with credit rationing of local production units in the spirit of Holmstrom and Tirole (1997)
and explain how institutional and capital market variables determine the parent’s decision
to acquire a larger equity stake and thereby co-finance the local production unit rather than
choosing an arm’s length relationship. Their empirical analysis confirms that weak investor
protection and adverse local capital market conditions in the host country limit the scale of
MNE activity.
    The recent empirical literature thus leads us to believe that MNEs operate internal cap-
ital markets not only to exploit tax rate differentials across countries but, perhaps more
importantly, to overcome institutional and financial investment barriers in host countries.
Our analysis of internal capital markets implies that firms tend to withdraw internal funds
from less profitable units and reallocate them to operations with an above-average return on
investment but limited access to external financing. Compared with the existing literature

                                                4
on internal debt shifting, our analysis yields two central and novel results. First, investment
in different units tend to be inherently interrelated. Second, the tax motive may reinforce
or offset the economic motive of using internal debt, leaving no clear-cut pattern of inter-
nal debt flows. In spite of the tax disadvantage, internal funds may easily flow to high-tax
countries for good economic reasons.
    Similarly, albeit in a different context, Lamont (1997) provides evidence that investments
are interrelated among different affiliates: when major oil companies’ cash flows were hard-
hit by the oil price decline of 1986, leaving them with much reduced own funds, they cut
investment across the board, both in oil and non-oil related divisions.1 Gopalan et al. (2007)
argue that intragroup loans are typically used to support financially weaker firms, e.g., to
avoid default within the MNE with consequent negative spillovers to other affiliates. For
example, a bankruptcy in a group causes significant drops in external financing, investments
and profits of other affiliates and an increase in their bankruptcy probability.


3       A Model of Internal Capital Markets
3.1     Definitions
Assume that there is an MNE with 𝑛 plants/subsidiaries/affiliates in different countries. To
finance investment, each affiliated firm raises external debt from the local capital market.
In addition, the MNE can operate an internal capital market and lend to subsidiaries with
the largest need for investment funds. Alternatively, internal debt may be used to minimize
the global
         ∑ tax bill by shifting profits to low-tax locations. The net value of the MNE is
𝑉 𝐻 = 𝑗 𝑉𝑗 where 𝑉𝑗 refers to the value of a single, wholly-owned affiliate in country ∑   𝑗, and
index 𝐻 refers to the headquarters. The MNE is endowed with total equity/own funds 𝑗 𝐴𝑗
from previous operations. The distribution of own funds 𝐴𝑗 across locations is historically
determined.
     If investment 𝐼𝑗 in plant 𝑗 is successful, it yields an end-of-period value 𝐼𝑗 + 𝑌𝑗 , where
𝐼𝑗 is undepreciated capital, 𝑌𝑗 = 𝜃𝑗 𝑓 (𝐼𝑗 ) is the cash-flow function satisfying 𝑓 ′ > 0 > 𝑓 ′′ ,
and 𝜃𝑗 denotes productivity. Assuming that investment opportunities exceed own funds,
𝐼𝑗 > 𝐴𝑗 , the subsidiary has to raise internal debt 𝐷𝑗 and external funds. The latter consist
of passive bank credit 𝐵𝑗 and active, informed monitoring bank credit 𝑀𝑗 . Hence, investment
in location 𝑗 is financed by 𝐼𝑗 = 𝐴𝑗 + 𝐷𝑗 + 𝐵𝑗 + 𝑀𝑗 . Total plant value is split among the
affiliate’s stakeholders, 𝑉𝑗 = 𝑉𝑗𝑆 + 𝑉𝑗𝐷 + 𝑉𝑗𝐵 + 𝑉𝑗𝑀 , where the upper indices refer to end-of-
period values of subsidiary dividends, internal debt, external debt from passive banks, and
external debt from monitored, active banks.
     Denote the loan rates charged by standard banks by 𝑖. Since monitoring is costly and
might vary across countries, loan rates charged by active banks could differ as well, despite
of an integrated savings market with a common deposit rate. Therefore, denote the loan
    1
    Agency problems within firms could be of different nature, leading to underinvestment due to credit
rationing or overinvestment due to self-serving managers and misuse of excess internal funds (Jensen, 1986).
Lamont (1997) points out that interdependence of affiliate investments may result from either type of agency
problems. Our key results do not essentially depend on which paradigm we adopt.


                                                     5
rates charged by monitoring banks in 𝑗 by 𝑖𝑀   𝑗 . The subsidiary is successful with probability
𝑝 and fails with probability 1 − 𝑝. If it fails, cash-flow is zero and no debt, neither internal
nor external, is repaid. The deposit market yields a safe return 𝑟 ⩾ 0, and we utilize the
acronym 𝑅 ≡ 1 + 𝑟. The loan rate on risky debt results from the no-arbitrage (or zero-profit)
condition 𝑝 (1 + 𝑖) = 𝑅. Accordingly, the end-of-period value of the subsidiary is determined
as
              𝑉𝑗𝑆 = 𝑝 𝐼𝑗 + 𝑌𝑗 − (1 + 𝑖) (𝐵𝑗 + 𝐷𝑗 ) − 1 + 𝑖𝑀                                  (1)
                      [                                 (       )        ]
                                                              𝑗   𝑀𝑗 − 𝑇𝑗 − 𝑅𝐴𝑗 ,
while the values 𝑉𝑗𝐷 = 𝑝 (1 + 𝑖) 𝐷𝑗 − 𝑅𝐷𝑗 and 𝑉𝑗𝐵 = 𝑝 (1 + 𝑖) 𝐵𝑗 − 𝑅𝐵𝑗 refer to internal debt
and external debt from passive banks, respectively, and 𝑉𝑗𝑀 = 𝑝 1 + 𝑖𝑀
                                                                 (        )
                                                                        𝑗   𝑀𝑗 − 𝑅𝑀𝑗 − 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗
is the value of monitored external debt.
    Financial development refers to active oversight associated with informed capital. Active
banks incur monitoring costs 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 proportional to investment, where 𝑐 is a cost parameter
and 𝑚𝑗 stands for the monitoring intensity. Adding up the value of all stakeholders yields
                              𝑉𝑗 = 𝑝 (𝐼𝑗 + 𝑌𝑗 − 𝑇𝑗 ) − (𝑅 + 𝑐𝑚𝑗 ) 𝐼𝑗 .                          (2)
With competitive lending, 𝑉𝑗𝐷 = 𝑉𝑗𝐵 = 𝑉𝑗𝑀 = 0, the subsidiary gets the entire joint surplus,
𝑉𝑗𝑆 = 𝑉𝑗 , which is repatriated to the parent as an end-of-period ‘dividend’.2 If lending
involves monitoring costs, banks must charge a higher rate, determined by 𝑝 𝑖𝑀
                                                                                (      )
                                                                                  𝑗 − 𝑖 𝑀𝑗 =
𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 so that 𝑖𝑀
                𝑗 ⩾ 𝑖.
   The corporate tax liability owed in the source country is 𝑇𝑗 . In line with common tax
practice, interest on debt is deductible while the return on equity 𝐴𝑗 is not, so that
                             𝑇𝑗 = 𝜏𝑗 ⋅ 𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖 (𝐷𝑗 + 𝐵𝑗 ) − 𝑖𝑀                             (3)
                                      [                         ]
                                                            𝑗 𝑀𝑗 .

If 𝐷𝑗 > 0, the subsidiary is a borrower and receives internal debt. If 𝐷𝑗 < 0, the subsidiary
is a lender in the internal capital market. When a subsidiary in a low-tax country lends
one dollar – creating a small tax liability 𝜏𝑙 𝑖 on interest earnings – to another affiliate in
a high-tax country – yielding large tax savings, −𝜏ℎ 𝑖, from interest deductions there – the
global tax is reduced by − (𝜏ℎ − 𝜏𝑙 ) 𝑖. Differences in tax rates across countries introduce a
tax motive to use internal debt in order to shift profits to low-tax locations. This tax motive
may reinforce or offset other economic motives to use internal debt to allocate scarce capital
to those units with the most profitable investment opportunities.
    In the internal capital market, lending and borrowing over all subsidiaries must balance
and add up to zero. The total NPV of the MNE firm over all its operations is
                                     ∑               ∑
                              𝑉𝐻 =        𝑉𝑗 𝑠.𝑡.         𝐷𝑗 = 0,                           (4)
                                          𝑗               𝑗

where 𝑉𝑗 = 𝑝 (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) (𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖𝐼𝑗 ) − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑖𝑀
                                                𝑗 − 𝑖 𝑀𝑗 − 𝜏𝑗 𝑖𝐴𝑗 results upon substituting
               [                              (       )              ]
(3) and zero-profit conditions together with 𝐼𝑗 = 𝐴𝑗 + 𝐷𝑗 + 𝐵𝑗 + 𝑀𝑗 . We will emphasize the
case 𝑚𝑗 = 0 and 𝑖𝑀 𝑗 = 𝑖, implying 𝑉𝑗 = (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑝 (𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖𝐼𝑗 ) − 𝜏𝑗 𝑖𝑝𝐴𝑗 , where the last term is
due to the tax disadvantage of equity.
  2
    There is a slight abuse of language. Strictly speaking, 𝑉𝑗𝑆 is a surplus of end-of-period wealth
 [ the opportunity cost 𝑅𝐴𝑗]. The expected dividend payment to the parent firm amounts to
over
𝑝 𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖 (𝐷𝑗 + 𝐵𝑗 ) − 𝑖𝑀
                       𝑗 𝑀𝑗 − 𝑇𝑗 . In addition, the parent gets expected interest payments 𝑝𝑖𝐷𝑗 .


                                                 6
3.2    Investment and External Borrowing
Timing: To maximize the total value in (4), the MNE makes a sequence of decisions. It
(i) allocates loans 𝐷𝑗 ≷ 0 on the internal capital market; (ii) raises external debt 𝐵𝑗 and 𝑀𝑗
from local banks and sets affiliate investments 𝐼𝑗 ; (iii) induces managerial and monitoring
efforts in all units; and (iv) pays back external funds and repatriates dividends. We solve
backwards and begin with stage (iii).

Effort: We assume that the headquarters choose effort to manage 𝑛 subsidiaries in the total
conglomerate. The success probability 𝑝 is high if managerial effort allocated to subsidiary
𝑗 is high. It is low (𝑝𝐿 < 𝑝) if the headquarters neglect the subsidiary (low effort) and,
instead, consumes a private benefit Γ𝑗 𝐼𝑗 proportional to investment. The parent obtains the
expected surplus of the subsidiary (income over opportunity cost of funds), consisting of the
sum of repatriated dividends and repayment of internal debt,

        𝑣𝑗ℎ ≡ 𝑉𝑗𝑆 + 𝑉𝑗𝐷 = 𝑝 𝐼𝑗 + 𝑌𝑗 − 𝑇𝑗 − (1 + 𝑖) 𝐵𝑗 − 1 + 𝑖𝑀                            (5)
                           [                            (        ) ]
                                                               𝑗  𝑀𝑗 − 𝑅 (𝐴𝑗 + 𝐷𝑗 ) .

    The subsidiary’s success probability is high only when incentives are strong. The bank
must restrict external lending and not claim too high a repayment to keep the firm incen-
tivized with high enough residual earnings. The incentive constraint to assure high effort
(avoid private benefits) is 𝑣𝑗ℎ (𝑝) ⩾ 𝑣𝑗ℎ (𝑝𝐿 ) + Γ𝑗 𝐼𝑗 . Substituting (5) yields

         𝑝 𝐼𝑗 + 𝑌𝑗 − 𝑇𝑗 − (1 + 𝑖) 𝐵𝑗 − 1 + 𝑖𝑀                                                   (6)
          [                           (       ) ]
                                            𝑗  𝑀𝑗 ⩾ 𝛾𝑗 𝐼𝑗 ,          𝛾𝑗 ≡ Γ𝑗 ⋅ 𝑝/ (𝑝 − 𝑝𝐿 ) .

The parent’s total stake must at least amount to 𝛾𝑗 𝐼𝑗 to be incentive compatible.
    Monitoring is not contractible either. Its purpose is to reduce private benefits from a
high Γ′𝑗 to a low Γ𝑗 . Suppose (6) is satisfied if both monitoring and managerial effort are
high. The monitor keeps 𝑣𝑗𝑚 (𝑝) = 𝑝 1 + 𝑖𝑀         − 𝑅 𝑀𝑗 . If she diverts resources 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 and
                                       [ (       )    ]
                                               𝑗
fails to monitor, Γ𝑗 rises to a high value Γ′𝑗 , thereby violating the incentive constraint (6)
and discretely reducing the firm’s success probability[ to
                                                         ( a low  )𝑝𝐿 < ]𝑝. With low effort, she
would thus get a lower expected income 𝑣𝑗 (𝑝𝐿 ) = 𝑝𝐿 1 + 𝑖𝑗 − 𝑅 𝑀𝑗 but obtain income

𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 from diverted resources. To assure monitoring, the contract must satisfy the incentive
constraint 𝑣𝑗𝑚 (𝑝) ⩾ 𝑣𝑗𝑚 (𝑝𝐿 ) + 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 , or

                       𝑝 1 + 𝑖𝑀                                                                 (7)

External Financing and Investment: Investment and borrowing in stage (ii) are gov-
erned by optimal contracts. Formally, banks compete with contracts that maximize the firm’s
surplus subject to incentive constraints for managerial and monitoring effort and participa-
tion (zero profit) constraints for active and passive banks. In the optimum, all constraints
are binding. Hence, (7) and the active bank’s participation constraint yield
                   𝜇𝑗 − 𝑐𝑚𝑗          𝑝𝐿 𝑐𝑚𝑗                                         𝜇𝑗

                                                 7
In equilibrium, the firm thus raises a fixed fraction of investment as monitoring capital for
which it pays 𝑖𝑀
               𝑗 > 𝑖. Any need for further external funding must come from residual bank
credit 𝐵𝑗 = 𝐼𝑗 − 𝐴𝑗 − 𝐷𝑗 − 𝑀𝑗 . Substituting this and the monitor’s zero-profit condition into
the incentive constraint (6) shows how the firm can raise value by expanding investment.
The firm optimally invests until the constraint becomes binding,

         𝑉𝑗 = 𝑝 [(1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) (𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖𝐼𝑗 ) − 𝜏𝑗 𝑖𝐴𝑗 ] − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 = 𝛾𝑗 𝐼𝑗 − 𝑅 (𝐴𝑗 + 𝐷𝑗 ) .   (9)

Given a level of own funds 𝐴𝑗 of the subsidiary and a level of internal debt 𝐷𝑗 allocated
by the MNE, scaling up investment is possible only if the firm is able to raise additional
external debt, 𝐵𝑗 . When more debt-financed investment raises the r.h.s. of (9) at a faster
rate than the l.h.s., see Assumption (A) below, the constraint eventually becomes binding.
At that level of lending, the firm has then exhausted its debt capacity. Banks cannot extend
more credit since this would violate the incentive constraint and lead to a discrete reduction
in the success probability. If this would occur, either the bank could not break even or the
MNE would suffer a discrete reduction in the joint surplus 𝑉𝑗 . Hence, the level of investment
and external borrowing is implicitly determined by the binding constraint (9) as a function
of internal debt, the tax rate, and other parameters. Figure 1 illustrates the solution for
the case 𝑚𝑗 = 0 and 𝑖 = 𝑖𝑀 . The curved line corresponds to the l.h.s., while the upward
sloping, straight line stands for the r.h.s. of (9). If the financing constraint does not bind,
subsidiary (investment      is at the first-best level that maximizes the expected value on the
l.h.s., 𝜃𝑗 𝑓 ′ 𝐼𝑗𝐹 𝐵 = 𝑖, so that the marginal return is equal to the user cost of capital 𝑖. Taxes
                    )
are not distorting the user cost since investment is financed with 100% debt at the margin
with interest being fully deductible.

                                     – Insert Figure 1 here –

   If agency costs 𝛾𝑗 are sufficiently large, and since high agency costs reduce the firm’s
pledgeable income, investment becomes constrained and is no longer determined by the user
cost formula 𝜃𝑗 𝑓 ′ (𝐼𝑗 ) = 𝑖. When raising more external debt to expand investment, firms hit
the financing constraint before reaching the first-best level. Being constrained, they earn an
excess return on capital, 𝜌𝑗 > 0. At the intersection point in Figure 1, the slopes satisfy
𝛾𝑗 > 𝜌𝑗 . For this to be a well-determined equilibrium, we assume

                   𝑅 + 𝜌𝑗 > 𝛾𝑗 > 𝜌𝑗 ≡ (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) [𝑝 (𝜃𝑗 𝑓 ′ (𝐼𝑗 ) − 𝑖) − 𝑐𝑚𝑗 ] > 0.              (A)

     Figure 1 illustrates how the parent can relax the subsidiary’s financing constraint and
expand investment in location 𝑗 if it allocates more internal debt. Other determinants of
investment are plant productivity 𝜃𝑗 , the profit tax rate 𝜏𝑗 , and agency costs 𝛾𝑗 = 𝛾 (𝑙𝑗 , 𝑚𝑗 ).
A firm’s financing capacity depends positively on the quality of the legal and institutional
environment (variable 𝑙𝑗 ) and on the monitoring intensity of active banks (variable 𝑚𝑗 ).
Tighter accounting standards, for example, make management more accountable, narrow
down the possibility to shirk and enjoy private benefits and are, thus, associated with lower
𝛾𝑗 . Active oversight by informed intermediaries similarly reduces private benefits and boosts


                                                  8
debt capacity. In other words, more intensive monitoring or institutional improvements
reduce private benefits by

                          𝛾𝑗 = 𝛾 (𝑙𝑗 , 𝑚𝑗 ) ,   𝑑𝛾𝑗 /𝑑𝑙𝑗 = −1,    𝑑𝛾𝑗 /𝑑𝑚𝑗 = −𝜎.                         (10)

       To obtain analytical results, we need to take the total differential of (9),3

              𝑑𝐼𝑗 = 𝑘𝑗 𝑅 ⋅ 𝑑𝐷𝑗 − 𝑘𝑗 [𝑝 (𝑌𝑗 − 𝑖𝐼𝑗 + 𝑖𝐴𝑗 ) − 𝑐𝑚𝑗 ] ⋅ 𝑑𝜏𝑗
                                                                                                         (11)
                  + 𝑘𝑗 (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑓 (𝐼𝑗 ) 𝑝 ⋅ 𝑑𝜃𝑗 + 𝑘𝑗 𝐼𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝑙𝑗 + [𝜎 − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐] 𝑘𝑗 𝐼𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝑚𝑗 ,

where 𝑘𝑗 ≡ 1/ (𝛾𝑗 − 𝜌𝑗 ) > 0. The concavity of 𝑓 (𝐼𝑗 ) implies that investment is concave
in internal funds, 𝑑2 𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝐷𝑗2 = 𝑘𝑗2 𝑅𝑝 (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝜃𝑗 𝑓𝑗′′ ⋅ 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝐷𝑗 < 0. The first inequality of
assumption (A) implies 𝑘𝑗 𝑅 > 1. Receiving a unit of debt from other affiliates boosts
investment more than proportionately, i.e., internal debt is leveraged by additional external
debt, 𝑑𝐵𝑗 /𝑑𝐷𝑗 = 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝐷𝑗 − 1 = 𝑘𝑗 𝑅 − 1 > 0.
    A higher local tax rate reduces subsidiary investment by eroding cash-flow and tightening
the financing constraint, 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝜏𝑗 < 0. In Figure 1, the profit curve would shift down,
leading to a reduction of affiliate investment. When the subsidiary becomes more productive,
it generates higher earnings at each level of investment which boosts pledgeable income,
improves access to external financing and expands investment, 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝜃𝑗 > 0. In Figure 1,
the profit curve shifts up. Tighter accounting standards, associated with more corporate
transparency and lower agency costs, boost investment, 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝑙𝑗 > 0. Finally, a more active
style of business finance, captured by an exogenous increase in monitoring intensity 𝑚𝑗 , has
a positive and a negative effect. It raises pledgeable income and, thereby boosts investment
in proportion to 𝜎. It also imposes extra cost and makes monitored finance more expensive
which reduces investment in proportion to 𝑐. For the net effect to be positive, we must
assume 𝜎 > (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐. Since monitored finance is costly and more expensive, it might not be
demanded. Firms attract monitored finance only if it adds value. From (9), the introduction
of monitored financing yields

                 𝑑𝑉𝑗 = 𝜌𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝐼𝑗 − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐𝐼𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝑚𝑗 = [𝜎𝜌𝑗 − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐𝛾𝑗 ] 𝑘𝑗 𝐼𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝑚𝑗 .             (12)

We must thus assume 𝜎 > (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐𝛾𝑗 /𝜌𝑗 > (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐 for monitoring capital to be in demand.
The last inequality is implied by (A).

3.3       Internal Capital Market
Value of Subsidiary Plants: We now show how the MNE, in stage (i), allocates funds
on the internal capital market. Capital is moved to where it generates the highest return
and adds the greatest value. Figure 1 illustrates how the subsidiary value depends on the
level of internal capital received from other units. Allocating more internal debt relaxes
the financing constraint and boosts investment. The larger scale boosts subsidiary value in

     All derivatives for comparative static analysis are taken at an initial position of 𝑚𝑗 = 0 so that 𝑖𝑀 = 𝑖
is fixed by 𝑝 (1 + 𝑖) = 𝑅 and 𝑀𝑗 = 0. We later consider the implications of financial development, i.e., an
increase in 𝑚𝑗 , starting from zero.

                   𝑗         𝑑2 𝑉 𝑗                                           𝑑𝐼𝑗
                  𝑉𝐷𝐷      ≡     2
                                    = (1 + 𝜌𝑗 𝑘𝑗 ) 𝑘𝑗 𝑅 ⋅ 𝑝 (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝜃𝑗 𝑓𝑗′′     < 0.
                             𝑑𝐷𝑗                                              𝑑𝐷𝑗

The derivative 𝑉𝐷𝑗 represents the return on internal debt, showing by how much the value of
subsidiary 𝑗 rises if it receives more funds. The second equation shows that the subsidiary
value is concave in the allocated level of internal debt.

Allocating Internal Debt: We assume that subsidiaries are historically endowed with
an amount of equity or internally accumulated funds 𝐴𝑗 . Affiliate value is a function of total
capital provided internally. Using 𝜆∑to denote the Lagrange-multiplier, the MNE’s global
optimization problem 𝑉 𝐻 = max𝐷𝑗 𝑗 [𝑉 (𝐷𝑗 ; . . .) + 𝜆 ⋅ 𝐷𝑗 ] leads to
                                                                                    ∑
              𝑉𝐷𝑗 (𝐷𝑗 ; 𝜏𝑗 , 𝜃𝑗 , 𝑙𝑗 , 𝑚𝑗 ) = 𝜆 = 𝑉𝐷𝑖 (𝐷𝑖 ; 𝜏𝑖 , 𝜃𝑖 , 𝑙𝑗 , 𝑚𝑗 ) ,           𝐷𝑗 = 0.   (14)
                                                                                        𝑗

The MNE operates an internal capital market to allocate funds to those units where the
return is highest. The internal capital allocation is optimal when returns are equalized. As
noted in (13), the marginal value functions are downward sloping in the level of internal
debt. Figure 2 illustrates for the case of an MNE with two affiliates and shows how the
allocation changes with a country-specific shock (see the next section).

                                         – Insert Figure 2 here –

     Condition (14) includes tax and economic motives to use internal debt. Holding every-
thing else constant, loading subsidiary 𝑖 with more internal debt reduces the tax liability
and raises its value in (2) by 𝑑𝑉𝑖 = 𝑝𝜏𝑖 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑑𝐷𝑖 . If taxes are high in location 𝑖 and low in 𝑗,
i.e., 𝜏𝑖 > 𝜏𝑗 , internal lending from affiliate 𝑗 to 𝑖 (𝑑𝐷𝑖 = −𝑑𝐷𝑗 ) boosts MNE value by an
amount equal to global tax savings, 𝑑𝑉 𝐻 = 𝑝 (𝜏𝑖 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑖 ⋅ 𝑑𝐷𝑖 . However, internal debt also
serves economic functions and raises subsidiary value in location 𝑖 by relaxing the financing
constraint, see Figure 1. The need to do so depends on other fundamental country and plant
characteristics which may reinforce or offset the tax motive.


4    Determinants of Internal Debt
We start from a symmetric situation 𝐴𝑗 and all other parameters are the identical. Initially,
there is no reason, neither tax nor economic, to use internal debt, i.e., 𝐷𝑗 = 0. The compar-
ative static analysis reveals how certain structural changes make subsidiary establishments
different from local firms. Intuition suggests that those subsidiaries which face the tightest
financing constraints (due to high taxes 𝜏𝑗 , inefficient capital markets with little monitoring

                                                        10
𝑚𝑗 , bad legal environment reflected in low 𝑙𝑗 , and high factor productivity 𝜃𝑗 creating large
investment opportunities etc.), have the highest excess return and should attract the largest
internal credit.( In the following   analysis, we start in a situation of 𝑚𝑗 = 𝑀𝑗 = 0, leaving
𝜌𝑗 = (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑝 𝜃𝑗 𝑓𝑗′ − 𝑖 , and will often assume that financial constraints are not too tight
                           )
and excess returns are small.

Corporate Tax: Suppose that country 1 raises the tax rate and becomes a high-tax lo-
cation. Standard reasoning suggests that local subsidiaries should attract internal debt to
save taxes. In addition, the higher tax reduces firms’ pledgeable income and makes them
more constrained relative to plants in other regions which creates yet another reason to shift
internal funds towards the high-tax country. Altogether, a higher tax rate should raise the
return to internal debt in that country. The derivative of (13) yields
                   𝑑2 𝑉 𝑗
                                             [                                     ]
                                                                            ′′ 𝑑𝐼𝑗

                 𝑑𝐷𝑗 𝑑𝜏𝑗                                                       𝑑𝜏𝑗
The square bracket reflects the change in the excess return, 𝑑𝜌𝑗 /𝑑𝜏𝑗 . The tax directly reduces
the return, giving rise to a negative first term. The second term is positive since lower
investment yields a higher excess return. If the financing constraint is not too tight and the
excess return is small at the outset, the first term is close to zero, leaving an overall positive
effect. The return on internal debt rises when subsidiary 𝑗 gets taxed more heavily, 𝑉𝐷𝜏   𝑗
                                                                                             > 0.
In Figure 2, the schedule 𝑉𝐷1 shifts up.
    Since the higher tax diminishes the subsidiary’s external financing capacity, the MNE
gets more constrained in location 1. Given a higher return on internal debt, the MNE
makes plant 1 borrow internally (𝑑𝐷1 > 0) from other subsidiaries which become lenders,
𝑑𝐷𝑗 < 0. Analytically, the differential of (14) when only country 1 raises the tax rate, gives

                                    ⋅𝑑𝐷𝑗 = 𝑑𝜆. Summing over all plants and using 𝑗 𝐷𝑗 = 0
                                                                                      ∑
𝑉𝐷𝐷  ⋅𝑑𝐷1 +𝑉𝐷𝜏
together with symmetry, 𝑉𝐷𝐷 𝑗
                               = 𝑉𝐷𝐷 , yields
               𝑑𝜆   𝑉1                𝑑𝐷𝑗   𝑉1                  𝑑𝐷1             𝑉1

Starting from symmetry, the higher tax makes the plant in country 1 more constrained so
that the excess return becomes larger than at other locations. Internal borrowing makes the
MNE more constrained in other locations as well so that the marginal value of a unit of debt
rises by a common factor 𝑑𝑉𝐷𝑗 = 𝑑𝜆. This is illustrated in Figure 2.

Factor Productivity: Turning to economic fundamentals, we argue that MNEs shift
capital towards more productive plants. Higher productivity affects the (return      ) to internal
debt only via its impact on the excess return which is proportional to 𝑑 𝜃𝑗 𝑓𝑗′ /𝑑𝜃𝑗 = 𝑓𝑗′ +
        𝑑𝐼
𝜃𝑗 𝑓𝑗′′ 𝑑𝜃𝑗𝑗 . The productivity shock directly boosts the excess return but the induced investment
brings it down again. If the technology is not too concave (𝑓 ′′ small),4 the second term is

 1 − 𝜃𝑓 ⋅ 𝛼 𝑘 (1 − 𝜏 ) 𝑝 𝑓 . With 𝜃𝑓 ∼ 𝑖 and the multiplier 𝑘 not much larger than one (consistent with a
realistic leverage factor 𝑑𝐼/𝑑𝐷 = 𝑘𝑅), the square bracket is surely positive for values of 𝛼 > 1/2.

profitable compared to elsewhere, the return to internal debt rises:

Starting from symmetry, a higher productivity boosts the return on capital and makes the
firm more constrained. A more productive plant has a larger excess return than other ones
and, therefore, offers a higher return on internal funds. For this reason, the MNE makes
plant 1 borrow internally from other, less productive units. The borrowing makes the MNE
more constrained in other locations so that the marginal value of a unit of debt rises by a
common factor 𝑑𝑉𝐷𝑗 = 𝑑𝜆. Figure 2 illustrates, with 𝜏1 replaced by 𝜃1 .
    The literature in public economics predominantly uses reduced-form models of internal
debt, predicting that internal lending should flow only from low to high-tax jurisdictions.
In our model, the internal lending pattern is much more complex. Consider a situation
where location 1 faces a low tax rate and lends to other units. Starting from a symmetric
equilibrium as in the preceeding subsection, this situation is created by a negative tax shock
𝑑𝜏1 < 0. All other units face relatively higher tax rates and take on internal debt. Suppose
now that plant 1 becomes more productive, 𝑑𝜃1 > 0. Given capital market frictions, it
cannot raise enough funds on the external capital market and needs to borrow internally to
accommodate the larger investment opportunities. Obviously, if the productivity difference
to other units is large enough, plant 1 becomes a net internal borrower despite of it being
located in a low-tax country! One can easily compute an ‘exchange rate’ (reflecting the
respective trade-off), giving the size of the compensating productivity differential required
to offset the tax rate differential such that the level of internal debt us unchanged. Using
(16) and (17) yields
                             𝑑𝜃1            ∂𝐷1 /∂𝜏1       𝑉1
                                        =−            = − 𝐷𝜏 1
                                                                < 0.                      (18)
                             𝑑𝜏1 𝑑𝐷1 =0     ∂𝐷1 /∂𝜃1       𝑉𝐷𝜃
The upshot is that the pattern of internal debt not only depends on tax rate differentials
but also on other firm and country-specific characteristics so that the flow of internal debt
cannot be predicted by looking at tax rate differentials alone.

Institutional Development: A country’s institutional environment may be an important
determinant of capital market frictions. MNEs might then use internal debt to offset the
negative influence. For example, better accounting standards and corporate governance
rules make management more accountable to outside stakeholders and reduce the moral
hazard problem. This improves access to the local, external capital market and reduces the
reliance on scarce internal funds. Better institutions should thus lead the MNE to release
internal resources to other affiliates operating in countries with a less developed legal system.5

    The excess return should be high in a country with bad institutions. Antras and Caballero (2009) show
that capital does not flow from rich to poor countries despite of the return on investment there being high.

Institutional improvement reduces the return on internal debt. More formally, 𝑉𝐷𝑙         𝑗
                                                                                            = 𝜌𝑗 𝑘𝑗2 𝑅+
                    𝑑𝜌 𝑑𝐼
(1 + 𝜌𝑗 𝑘𝑗 ) 𝑘𝑗 𝑅 ⋅ 𝑑𝐼𝑗𝑗 𝑑𝑙𝑗𝑗 . With good governance, managerial incentive problems are less severe,
𝑑𝛾𝑗 = −𝑑𝑙𝑗 in (10), and pledgeable income is higher. In allowing for more externally financed
investment, a better legal system would actually raise the return on internal debt, because
the plant can earn the excess return on a larger investment scale, see the term 𝜌𝑗 𝑘𝑗2 𝑅.
However, this effect is small if the excess return 𝜌𝑗 is small. More importantly, the additional
investment erodes the return on capital and, thereby, the return on internal debt. This
                                                                         𝑑𝜌 𝑑𝐼

            𝑑𝑙1               𝑛𝑉𝐷𝐷            𝑑𝑙1       𝑛𝑉𝐷𝐷
By improving access to local finance, institutional development reduces the return on internal
debt, i.e., shifts down the return schedule 𝑉𝐷1 in Figure 2, and triggers a flow of internal debt
towards other countries with less developed institutions.

Financial Development: We study financial development in the sense that local interme-
diaries engage in a more active, but also more costly style of lending. Intensifying monitoring
and oversight raises a firm’s pledgeable income and financing capacity by reducing private
benefits, 𝑑𝛾𝑗 = −𝜎 ⋅ 𝑑𝑚𝑗 , see (10). On the negative side, monitoring raises intermediation
costs 𝑐𝑚𝑗 𝐼𝑗 which must be compensated by higher loan rates. Starting from 𝑚𝑗 = 0, the
introduction of monitoring capital boosts investment by 𝑑𝐼𝑗 = (𝜎 − (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) 𝑐) 𝑘𝑗 𝐼𝑗 ⋅ 𝑑𝑚𝑗 > 0
as in (11), and raises affiliate value by (12). A more active local banking sector reduces the
incentive in (13) to use internal debt by
                                𝑑 2 𝑉𝑗                           𝑑𝜌𝑗

The first term is positive and arises because monitoring directly reduces agency costs which
boosts the investment multiplier. The second, negative term results because monitoring
reduces the excess return, 𝑑𝜌𝑗 /𝑑𝑚𝑗 = (1 − 𝜏𝑗 ) [−𝑐 + 𝑝𝜃𝑓 ′′ ⋅ 𝑑𝐼𝑗 /𝑑𝑚𝑗 ] < 0, directly by raising
monitoring costs, and indirectly by boosting investment which reduces the gross return 𝑓 ′ .
If credit constraints are not too tight, the total effect is negative. Letting 𝜌 → 0 leaves
  𝑗
𝑉𝐷𝑚   = 𝑘𝑅 ⋅ 𝑑𝜌𝑗 /𝑑𝑚𝑗 < 0. Repeating the steps in (16) yields
                       𝑑𝐷1            𝑉1                    𝑑𝐷𝑗   𝑉1
                           = − (𝑛 − 1) 𝐷𝑚 < 0,                  = 𝐷𝑚 > 0.                         (21)

Financial development relaxes the financing constraint and makes it less profitable to allocate
funds to an affiliate with better access to external funds. Financial development in country
1 reduces the return on internal debt and makes affiliate 1 an internal lender. Funds flow to
affiliates in other regions, turning them into borrowers.
They do not address the role of MNEs to overcome local capital market problems.

                      Financial underdevelopment 𝑑𝑚1 < 0 (+)               (−)

    Internal debt is used to equate the marginal value of a dollar of internal funds across
locations when there are constraints on external debt. The flow of internal debt is thus
driven by tax and economic considerations. In particular, there is no clear-cut pattern any
more between tax rates and profit shifting via internal debt when countries not only differ
by tax but also along other economic fundamentals! Suppose that country 1 is a high-tax
country and also has a well developed financial sector, 𝜏1 > 𝜏𝑗 and 𝑚1 > 𝑚𝑗 . Clearly, the
higher tax creates positive internal debt, 𝑑𝐷1 > 0, while financial development (switching to
𝑑𝑙1 > 0 in Table 4) leads to less internal debt, 𝑑𝐷1 < 0. It improves access to external funding
which allows MNEs to economize on scarce internal funds and reallocate them to other units
operating under more constrained conditions. Obviously, these two country differences can
offset each other.


5     Data and Empirical Approach
In what follows, we seek to identify how internal borrowing responds to both local incentives
and global incentives created within an MNE which holds affiliates in different countries. The
above model suggests that incentives to lend or borrow among units within MNEs arise from
differences in productivity, corporate income taxation, institutional quality, and financial
development across locations. In this section, we introduce the data and empirical approach
utilized to infer how local versus global aspects matter and illustrate that not only features
of the most-favorable market but also those of other locations matter for the internal capital
market.

5.1    Specification of Country-specific and Affiliate-specific Funda-
       mentals of the Internal Capital Market
Let us use 𝜃𝑖𝑡 , 𝜏𝑖𝑡 , 𝑙𝑖𝑡 , and 𝑚𝑖𝑡 to denote productivity, the corporate profit tax rate, insti-
tutional weakness, and the level of financial underdevelopment, respectively, at the location
of affiliate 𝑖 in year 𝑡. Let us refer to any of these fundamentals by 𝜄𝑖𝑡 ∈ {𝜃𝑖𝑡 , 𝜏𝑖𝑡 , 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 },
where, to simplify matters, 𝑙 (institutional quality) and 𝑚 (financial development) as used
in Sections 3 and 4 have been replaced by 𝜙 = ∣𝑙 − max{𝑙}∣ and 𝜅 = ∣𝑚 − max{𝑚}∣ measur-
ing institutional weakness and financial underdevelopment, respectively, so that 𝜄𝑖𝑡 is defined
such that a higher level thereof ceteris paribus raises the incentive towards internal debt
for affiliate 𝑖 in 𝑡. According to the theoretical model, affiliate 𝑗 then has ceteris paribus

                                                 14
an incentive to provide internal debt to affiliate 𝑖 whenever 𝜄𝑖𝑡 > 𝜄𝑗𝑡 (see Table 4 for the
individual comparative static effects).
    Let us describe informally how we will account for the incentives of the lending entities
with regard to fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡 . Since affiliate 𝑖 may borrow from other affiliates in different
countries within the same MNE according to Sections 3 and 4, we capture the affiliate-
𝑖-specific incentive to borrow internally in relation to fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡 by considering the
weighted (indicated by superscript 𝑤) average level of that fundamental over all affiliates 𝑗
of the same MNE with at most as favorable an environment w.r.t. that fundamental towards
                              6
                          𝑖𝑡 . This average fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡 involves weights that are based on
internal debt financing, 𝜄𝑤                                   𝑤

the lending capacity each affiliate of an MNE exhibits.7
    For a formal treatment, let us define a binary variable
                                            1, if 𝜄𝑖𝑡 > 𝜄𝑗𝑡 ,
                                          {
                                 𝑏𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 =                                                   (22)
                                            0 otherwise.
which, in words, is unity if fundamental 𝜄 is more favorable to internal debt financing at
𝑖’s location than at 𝑗’s in year 𝑡 and zero otherwise. Furthermore, let us define the set of
affiliates 𝐼𝑖𝑡 , which consists of all units that belong to the same MNE as 𝑖 in year 𝑡, except
for ones in the same country as 𝑖. Furthermore, let us denote the internal lending carried
out by unit 𝑗 in 𝑡 with 𝑓𝑗𝑡 . Then, we may define the relevant share or weight of 𝑗 in the
lending capacity 𝑖 has access to within the same MNE among all affiliates in year 𝑡 as
                                    {     𝑏     𝑓
                                        ∑ 𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑗𝑡        , if 𝑏𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑓𝑗𝑡 > 0,
                           𝑤𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 =      𝑗∈𝐼𝑖𝑡 𝑏𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑓𝑗𝑡                                  (23)
                                       0                    otherwise.
The incentive of any affiliate 𝑖 of an MNE in year 𝑡 to use internal debt financing arises
(ceteris paribus) from the fundamentals, 𝜄𝑖𝑡 , and the fundamentals at other locations of the
same firm, 𝜄𝑤𝑖𝑡 , where the latter are defined as

                                                        if 𝜄𝑖𝑡 = min𝑗 (𝜄𝑗𝑡 ),
                                 {
                                    𝜄𝑖𝑡 ,
                           𝑤
                          𝜄𝑖𝑡 = ∑                                                                    (24)
                                              𝑤     𝜄
                                         𝑗∈𝐼𝑖𝑡 𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑗𝑡 otherwise.

To acknowledge the lending capacity within each MNE comprehensively 𝑗∈𝐼𝑖𝑡 runs over all
                                                                                   ∑
units, including the German parent, even though the parent does not surface in the affiliate-
level data on internal debt below. Suppose affiliate 𝑖 faces the least favorable fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡
in the group in year 𝑡 for internal debt financing. Then, by design of (24), 𝜄𝑤         𝑖𝑡 = 𝜄𝑖𝑡 . Hence,
the differential 𝜄𝑖𝑡 − 𝜄𝑤
                        𝑖𝑡 ≥   0 is a    compact     measure  of the (ceteris paribus) incentive   to use
                                                    8
cross-border internal debt according to 𝜄𝑖𝑡 . Notice that all fundamentals 𝜄𝑖𝑡 and 𝜄𝑖𝑡 vary over
                                                                                            𝑤

time for the average affiliate which permits conditioning on affiliate-specific fixed effects and
to identify the parameters on 𝜄𝑖𝑡 and 𝜄𝑤       𝑖𝑡 from the time dimension within affiliates.
   6
      Recall that one specific aspect of the above model is that, from a specific fundamental’s point of view,
there is an incentive to use cross-border internal debt from affiliates in countries with a less favorable
environment, depending on the configuration of other fundamentals. We will come back to this issue below.
    7
      Internal lending of all German affiliates is observed in the data (see Section 5.3).
    8
      Of course, other fundamentals may generate incentives for internal borrowing or lending beyond a specific
𝜄𝑖𝑡 in the theoretical model in Sections 3 and 4.

                                                      15
5.2     Capturing Incentives for Internal Debt with Several Fundamen-
        tals
If countries or, generally, units within a firm differed only in one dimension – say, the
corporate profit tax rates they face – the internal capital market would be determined by a
bivariate model where only affiliate 𝑖’s and the minimally taxed affiliate’s tax rates would
matter. With several fundamentals for the internal capital market as in the theoretical
model outlined in Sections 3 and 4, we arrive at a multivariate empirical model. Moreover,
there is a trade-off between more favorable market conditions in some dimensions (profit
taxes, institutions, financial development, or productivity) and less favorable ones in other
dimensions. Hence, the sharp rules for relevant borrowing or lending relationships for the
fundamentals 𝜄𝑖𝑡 ∈ {𝜃𝑖𝑡 , 𝜏𝑖𝑡 , 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 } in (22) do not have to hold at the stated precision. This
is in line with the model in Sections 3 and 4.
    There are several options to relax those conditions, and we chose to implement heuristic
degrees of imprecision by modifying (22) to

                                               1, if 𝜄𝑖𝑡 > 𝜄𝑗𝑡 − 𝑟𝜎𝜄,𝑖 ,
                                           {
                                𝑏𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 =                                                         (25)
                                               0 otherwise,

where 𝜎𝜄,𝑖 is the standard deviation of fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡 calculated across all observations
for the MNE that affiliate 𝑖 belongs to, and 𝑟 ∈ {0.1, 0.5, 1.0} is a heuristic scaling factor.
Hence, we relax the sharp conditions for internal debt financing in (22) by up to one standard
deviation of the respective fundamental for each affiliate 𝑖 in year 𝑡. Notice that, in line with
the model in Sections 3 and 4, the approach in (25) implies that units in a firm may not only
borrow from ones with, say, a favorable (lower) tax rate but also ones with a less favorable
(higher) tax rate, as long as the disincentive to borrow entailed by the tax rate alone is
compensated by other favorable characteristics.

5.3     Data
The empirical investigation relies on the MiDi database (Microdatabase Direct Investment)
collected by Deutsche Bundesbank. Two aspects of MiDi are particularly noteworthy. First,
above a minimum reporting threshold, we observe all foreign affiliates in Germany.9 The fact
that MiDi reports the universe of German MNEs is especially important for our analysis, as
it allows determining tax and other incentives to use internal debt in a comprehensive way
across all units, taking into account MNEs’ activities in almost all countries of the world,
including all affiliates and the German parent firm. Second, MiDi does not only provide
information about the affiliates’ total debt but also about internal borrowing. Specifically,
firms have to report liabilities to affiliated enterprises linked with the party required to report
   9
     All German firms and households which hold 10% or more of the shares or voting rights in a foreign
enterprise with a balance-sheet total of more than 3 million Euros are required by law to report balance-
sheet information to the Deutsche Bundesbank. Indirect participating interests have to be reported whenever
foreign affiliates hold 10% or more of the shares or voting rights in other foreign enterprises. The reporting
requirements are set by the Foreign Trade and Payments Regulation. For details and a documentation of
MiDi, see Lipponer (2009).

                                                     16
through participating interests (see Lipponer, 2009). We are particularly interested in the
determinants of cross-border internal borrowing and lending, which is supposedly used by
MNEs to shift profits. Hence, we focus on cross-border transactions among units (affiliates
and the parent company) excluding all debt from affiliated entities that are located in the
same country as the borrowing entity.10
      The data-set available to us comprises 45,608 affiliates of German MNEs over the period
1996 to 2007. Altogether, our empirical analysis is based on 227,558 observations over this
time span. Since we have information on all internal debt provided to affiliates by the parent,
we can determine the total amount of internal lending of the German parent.
      According to the theoretical model, the aforementioned fundamental determinants of the
internal capital market should be included in an empirical model of internal debt financing.
Our empirical analysis includes the following variables as determinants of internal debt of
affiliate 𝑖: (i) corporate income tax (host) denotes the statutory income tax rate faced by
affiliate 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝜏𝑖𝑡 ; (ii) weighted corporate income tax (other locations) is the lending
capacity-weighted corporate income tax rate as defined in equation (24), 𝜏𝑖𝑡𝑤 ; (iii) financial
underdevelopment (host) is a variable that captures the financial underdevelopment at the
location of 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝜅𝑖𝑡 ; (iv) weighted financial underdevelopment (other locations) is the
lending capacity-weighted financial underdevelopment defined akin to equation (24), 𝜅𝑤          𝑖𝑡 ; (v)
institutional weakness (host) is a variable that captures the institutional weakness of the
host country of 𝑖 in year 𝑡, 𝜙𝑖𝑡 ; (vi) weighted institutional weakness (other locations) is the
lending capacity-weighted institutional weakness at the other locations as defined in equation
(24), 𝜙𝑤 𝑖𝑡 ; (vii) affiliate-level productivity OP (host) is affiliate 𝑖’s productivity as estimated
by the method of Olley and Pakes (1996), 𝜃𝑖𝑡 ; (viii) weighted affiliate-level productivity (other
locations) is the lending capacity-weighted productivity (Olley and Pakes, 1996) from other
affiliates within the MNE that affiliate 𝑖 belongs to in year 𝑡 as defined in equation (24),
𝜃𝑖𝑡𝑤 .11
      Beyond the variables suggested by our theoretical model, even other factors might affect
internal debt. For some affiliates, the costs of external borrowing, i.e., issuing bonds or
borrowing from banks, might be comparatively low. One explanation for the better access
to external debt may be that affiliates differ in their opportunities to borrow against col-
lateral. Therefore, we include the variable Tangibility which reflects the fixed-to-total-asset
ratio of affiliate 𝑖 in year 𝑡. Asset tangibility is associated with higher liquidation values
and can facilitate debt financing since a possible liquidation of a firm gets less costly for
  10
      In the context of our model, reasons for internal borrowing from other affiliates in the same market
could only be productivity differences, since other aspects (profit taxation, institutional standards, financial
development) are similar for such units.
   11
      Note that in robustness tests we use alternative specifications for the productivity variable. The estimator
of Olley and Pakes (1996) accounts for three salient features of technology: endogenous input choice by firms;
dynamics (sluggish adjustment of productivity); and selection (variability of total factor productivity of
stayers versus exiters with selection of inefficient firms into exiting). We utilize (i) affiliate-level log turnover
(value added is not reported in the data) as the dependent variable, (ii) log number of employees and log
financial and other assets as inputs (intermediate goods are not recorded in the data), (iii) affiliate age and
log fixed assets as state variables, (iv) log net investment (the first difference of fixed assets) as the proxy
variable which is monotonically related by assumption to the unobserved total factor productivity state
variable. Throughout, we condition on a time trend as an additional control variable.

shareholders as well as for debt holders. Higher liquidation values may also facilitate more
effective management control since a liquidation threat becomes more credible.12 Harris and
Raviv (1990) find a positive correlation between companies’ liquidation value (proxied by
the fraction of tangible assets) and the optimal debt level. A positive effect of tangibility on
leverage is also confirmed by Rajan and Zingales (1995), who investigate the determinants of
capital structure of public firms in G-7 countries. Bernardo, Cai, and Luo (2001) emphasize
another case that might explain a positive relationship between tangibility and internal debt.
They argue that clear repayment and interest rules can solve information problems associ-
ated with long-term investment projects. A high share of fixed assets (high tangibility) may
indicate that the share of long-term investment projects is high and, therefore, internal debt
– associated with regular interest payments – may be the preferred source of finance. Tangi-
bility may as well capture another aspect that generally affects the use of debt. De Angelo
and Masulis (1980) point out that non-debt tax shields – such as depreciation allowances
or investment tax credits associated with fixed assets – may crowd out the value of interest
deduction. Accordingly, tangibility may also negatively affect the internal-debt-to-capital
ratio of a firm since alternative opportunities to reduce the corporate tax burden apart from
debt are available.
     Furthermore, we include the variable Loss carryforward, which is defined as a binary
variable that is unity if affiliate 𝑖 carries forward losses in period 𝑡 and zero otherwise.
Since taxable profits in the current period can be credited against losses carried forward,
the benefits of additional interest deductions may be crowded out as additional interest
payments only result in new losses that can be carried forward into consecutive periods
(see, e.g., MacKie-Mason, 1990). For this reason, we may expect that Loss carryforward
is negatively related to internal debt. If, however, a loss carryforward indicates that the
affiliate is financially distressed, more internal debt might be provided by the parent or
other affiliated entities to support the firm (see Gopalan et al., 2007).
     We also use Sales to capture the size and cash flow of affiliate 𝑖 in year 𝑡. With either
interpretation, higher sales are associated with more favorable lending conditions in terms
of external debt (see Graham and Harvey, 2001). In addition, higher sales may also imply
that a firm is more capable to retain earnings. Both arguments suggest a negative impact
on internal debt.
     The fact that MiDi provides panel data allows us to control for aggregate common year-
specific effects. This captures not only simultaneous aggregate shocks in host countries
but also changes in German taxing and lending conditions as all parent firms are based in
Germany. Another advantage of panel data is that we can use affiliate-specific fixed effects
to control for all unobservable time-invariant factors of influence on an affiliate’s internal
debt. This might be important as different affiliates can have different optimal internal debt
ratios, depending on affiliate-specific unobservable costs and benefits.
     The first and second moments of all dependent and independent variables used in the
regressions with the lending capacity or the internal debt ratio as dependent variables are
  12
    At the cost of complexity, one might include a liquidation value 𝛽𝐼, 𝛽 < 1, in the model which can
be accessed by creditors in case of failure and therefore allows additional debt financing. Higher tangibility
would be associated with a higher 𝛽.

                                  – Include Tables 1 and 2 here –
    As already emphasized above, the unique features of the MiDi data allow us to identify
virtually all relevant activities of German MNEs abroad. Table 2 provides some information
about the geographical distribution of foreign affiliates of German MNEs. In terms of the
total number of observations, the table shows that the USA, France, and the United Kingdom
are the most important host countries to German MNEs.

5.4     The Internal Debt Ratio as a Fractional Response Variable
An affiliate’s internal debt ratio is necessarily bounded between zero and one. A linear re-
gression model will not generally obey those bounds and involve similar problems as linear
probability models do. This calls for an appropriate estimation technique, where the marginal
effect of any explanatory variable is not constant over the support region (see Papke and
Wooldridge, 1996, for further discussion). We follow Papke and Wooldridge (2008) in esti-
mating a panel-data fractional response model with the debt ratio as the dependent variable,
first assuming strict exogeneity of all regressors, and then allowing lending capacity – which
is used in the weights 𝑤𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 in (23) – to be endogenous.
    The response variable is the cross-border internal-debt-to-total-capital ratio for affiliate
𝑖 at time 𝑡, denoted by 𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 ∈ [0, 1].13 We assume the conditional expectation of 𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 to be
                                   𝐸[𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 ∣x𝑖𝑡 , 𝑐𝑖 ] = Φ(x′𝑖𝑡 𝜷 + 𝑐𝑖 ),                            (26)
where Φ(⋅) is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, x𝑖𝑡 is a column vector
of explanatory variables, 𝜷 is the corresponding column vector of parameters to be esti-
mated, and 𝑐𝑖 is a time-constant affiliate-specific unobserved effect which is allowed to be
correlated with all explanatory variables. x𝑖𝑡 includes the fundamentals 𝜄𝑖𝑡 and 𝜄𝑤        𝑖𝑡 for all
𝜄 ∈ {𝜃, 𝜏, 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 } as introduced in Subsection 5.1. x𝑖𝑡 also includes affiliate-specific control
variables as introduced at the end of Subsection 5.3 and time dummy variables.
    With       regard       to   the    modeling    of    𝑐𝑖 ,    we    follow     the     so-called
Mundlak-Chamberlain-Wooldridge device (see Mundlak, 1978, Chamberlain, 1982, 1984,
and Wooldridge, 2002) as in Papke and Wooldridge (2008) and assume that 𝑐𝑖 is normally
distributed conditional on x𝑖𝑡 . They define
                                      ′
                          𝑐𝑖 = 𝜓 + x 𝑖 𝝃 + 𝑎𝑖 ,      𝑎𝑖 ∣x𝑖 ∼ Normal(0, 𝜎𝑎 ),                       (27)
                  ∑𝑇
where x𝑖 ≡ 𝑇   −1
                    𝑡=1 𝑥𝑖𝑡 is a column vector of the time-averaged explanatory variables for
affiliate 𝑖 and 𝜎𝑎 is the conditional variance of 𝑐𝑖 . Plugging this expression into (26), we
obtain
                                                                  ′
                        𝐸[𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 ∣x𝑖𝑡 , 𝑐𝑖 ] = Φ(𝜓 + x′𝑖𝑡 𝜷 + x𝑖 𝝃/(1 + 𝜎𝑎 )1/2 )                     (28)
                                                                      ′
                                          ≡ Φ(𝜓𝑎 + x′𝑖𝑡 𝜷𝒂 + x𝑖 𝝃𝒂 )                                (29)
  13
    Note that the data allow us to focus on cross-border internal borrowing. Hence, 𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 does not include
internal borrowing from affiliates active in the same country.

                                                    19
and see that 𝜷 is identified up to the positive scalar (1 + 𝜎𝑎 )1/2 (see Papke and Wooldridge
2008, p. 123, for details). Average partial effects can then be estimated by taking derivatives
                              ′
of 𝑁 −1 𝑁       ˆ     ′ ˆ       ˆ
          𝑖=1 Φ(𝜓𝑎 +x𝑖𝑡 𝜷𝒂 +x𝑖 𝝃𝒂 ) with respect to the variable of interest. In general (and with
       ∑
the only exception of one sensitivity check where we account for country-year clustering of
the disturbances), we apply a panel bootstrapping procedure (see Fitzenberger, 1998; Papke
and Woolrdidge, 2008).

5.5      Allowing for Endogenous Lending Capacity Weights
Since internal lending and borrowing within MNEs are simultaneously determined, 𝑤𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 for
𝜄 ∈ {𝜃, 𝜏, 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 } and, in turn, 𝜄𝑤
                                      𝑖𝑡 are likely endogenous to the internal debt ratio of affiliate
𝑖 at time 𝑡. To solve this problem, we project actual lending, 𝑓𝑗𝑡 , on characteristics thereof
(including affiliate-specific fixed effects) to obtain a measure of predicted lending capacity,
𝑓ˆ𝑗𝑡 , yielding predicted weights, 𝑤ˆ𝜄,𝑖𝑗𝑡 .
      Notice that 𝑓𝑗𝑡 is a non-negative variable which may be zero. Therefore, we use an
exponential regression model to estimate 𝑓ˆ𝑗𝑡 , conditional on affiliate-specific and market-
specific time-variant variables collected in the vector z𝑗𝑡 and an affiliate-specific effect 𝛼𝑗 ,

                                  𝐸(𝑓𝑗𝑡 ∣z𝑗𝑡 , 𝛼𝑗 ) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(z′𝑗𝑡 𝜽)𝛼𝑗 ,                                 (30)

where 𝜽 is a vector of unknown parameters on z𝑗𝑡 . We again follow the Mundlak-Chamberlain-
                                                      ′           ′
Wooldridge device to specify 𝐸(𝛼𝑗 ∣z𝑗𝑡 ) = 𝑒𝑥𝑝(z𝑗 𝝅), where z𝑗 are the affiliate-level means of
the regressors and 𝝅 is a corresponding vector of unknown parameters. Then, we substitute
𝑓𝑗𝑡 in (23) by 𝑓ˆ𝑗𝑡 to calculate lending capacity weights and weighted fundamentals ˆ𝜄𝑤       𝑖𝑡 for
𝜄 ∈ {𝜃, 𝜏, 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 } as defined in (24).
                                                          𝑤 14
    Below, we will make use of ˆ𝜄𝑤      𝑖𝑡 to instrument 𝜄𝑖𝑡 . We follow Papke and Wooldridge
(2008) and estimate a reduced form for 𝜄𝑖𝑡 using the instrument ˆ𝜄𝑤
                                                𝑤
                                                                       𝑖𝑡 along with the exogenous
explanatory variables in (26). We then include the predicted residuals of this regression,
                                                               𝑖𝑡 in the fractional response model
denoted as 𝜐ˆ𝑖𝑡 , to control for the potential endogeneity of 𝜄𝑤
(26).15

fects.

                                         – Include Table 3 here –

    The first column of the table confirms results of earlier studies, suggesting that the local
statutory tax rate positively relates to the share of internal cross-border debt of affiliate
𝑖. The columns labeled Coeff. contain the estimated coefficients (and standard errors in
parentheses), while the columns labeled APE display the re-scaled coefficients as average
partial effects, which may be compared to the coefficients of a linear model. Once we include
the weighted tax rate of the lending part of an MNE, the coefficient of the local tax effect
becomes slightly smaller but remains positive and significantly different from zero.
    Note that the point estimates on all other incentive variables (or fundamentals) suggested
by our model have the expected sign. According to our definition of those variables, the local
incentive to internal debt financing should increase with a higher value of the respective
variable (𝜄𝑖𝑡 ). Consistent with that, the weighted foreign fundamentals (in other affiliates
and countries than 𝑖; 𝜄𝑤𝑖𝑡 ) should exert a negative effect. While the estimate for the weighted
corporate income tax (other locations) is not significantly related to internal debt, we do
not want to overemphasize the findings of Table 3, because all variables portraying foreign
fundamentals are weighted by actual lending, and the estimates are likely biased as indicated
in Subsection 5.5.

                                         – Include Table 4 here –

    Table 4 allows for endogenous weighted regressors, using the approach suggested by Papke
and Wooldridge (2008) and described in Subsection 5.5. Other than that, the specification
underlying Table 4 is identical to the one in the last two columns of Table 3. One interesting
finding in comparison to the earlier results is that the magnitudes of the host coefficients
                                                   𝑖𝑡 ) are similar in Table 4 for all fundamentals
(on 𝜄𝑖𝑡 ) and the other-location coefficients (on 𝜄𝑤
𝜄. In comparison, the corporate tax effects were much more asymmetric when assuming
exogeneity in Table 3. Moreover, internal cross-border debt seems to be even much more
strongly determined by differences in corporate taxes across locations when allowing for
endogenous effects rather than assuming exogeneity.
    The average partial effect (APE) of the corporate income tax in the host country (𝜏𝑖𝑡 ),
which is displayed in column 2 of Table 4, implies that a ten percentage point higher local
corporate income tax rate leads to a 9.2 percentage point higher internal-debt-to-capital
ratio. This is almost four times as large as the comparable effect in Table 3. We may
compare this estimate to the findings of a meta-study by Heckemeyer, Feld, and Overesch
(2011), investigating 46 studies on the impact of taxes on debt-to-capital ratios. Their results
suggest a marginal tax effect on debt of about 0.3. Hence, the marginal effect identified in
the underlying census-type data-set is much larger than in other studies which mainly focus
on larger firms. A ten percentage point higher corporate income tax rate at other relevant

lending locations of the same MNE leads to an almost symmetric negative effect of the same
magnitude on affiliate 𝑖’s debt-to-capital ratio in the same year.
    The regressions in Table 3 suggested that all of the fundamentals postulated by the
above theoretical model matter for an affiliate’s internal debt ratio. With the exception
for productivity, the same conclusions apply when allowing for the endogeneity of lending
capacity in Table 4.17 A more severe financial underdevelopment and institutional weakness
in the host country lead to a significantly higher internal-debt-to-capital ratio. Consistent
with the incentives described in Subsection 5.1, the weighted averages of these two measures
across other locations within the same firm have a negative effect on the share of internal
debt of a given affiliate.
    Two of the affiliate-specific control variables included in the estimations are also signif-
icantly related to internal debt financing. First, a higher share of tangible (fixed) assets
(Tangibility) implies a higher internal-debt-to-capital ratio. Since a high tangibility is a
proxy for the importance of long-term investment projects in a firm, this finding might re-
flect that monitoring problems associated with investment projects are partly solved by using
internal debt (see Bernardo, Cai, and Luo, 2001). The positive coefficient of the Loss car-
ryforward indicator variable confirms that internal debt is a flexible source of finance that
can be provided by affiliated entities (see Gopalan, Nanda, and Seru, 2007). Beyond the
mentioned variables, firm size in terms of foreign affiliate sales does not enter significantly
as a driver of internal debt.

6.2     Sensitivity Analysis with Regard to the Incentives to Use In-
        ternal Debt
The results in Tables 3 and 4 do not allow for a trade-off between the different fundamentals
determining the incentives to use cross-border internal debt. There, the (ceteris paribus)
incentive to use internal debt according to fundamental 𝜄𝑖𝑡 ∈ {𝜃𝑖𝑡 , 𝜏𝑖𝑡 , 𝜙𝑖𝑡 , 𝜅𝑖𝑡 } is given by the
differential 𝜄𝑖𝑡 − 𝜄𝑤
                    𝑖𝑡 ≥ 0, where 𝜄𝑖𝑡 is the weighted-average over all affiliates 𝑗 with 𝜄𝑖𝑡 > 𝜄𝑗𝑡 .
                                   𝑤

This ignores that there is a trade-off between more favorable conditions in some fundamentals
(profit taxes, institutional weakness, financial underdevelopment, or productivity) and less
favorable ones in others.
    Tables 5 to 7 present results using weighted foreign fundamentals constructed as described
in (25). Here we allow the incentives in each dimension to become negative by building 𝜄𝑤            𝑖𝑡
over a larger set of affiliates 𝑗 with 𝜄𝑖𝑡 > 𝜄𝑗𝑡 − 𝑟𝜎𝜄,𝑖 , where 𝜎𝜄,𝑖 is the standard deviation of
fundamentals 𝜄𝑖𝑡 calculated across all observations within the MNE affiliate 𝑖 belongs to, and
𝑟 takes on the values 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 in Tables 5, 6, and 7, respectively. That is, we relax
the sharp conditions for internal debt financing in (22) alternatively by one tenth of, one
half of, and one standard deviation of the respective fundamental for each affiliate 𝑖 in year
𝑡.
  17
    However, affiliate-level productivity at affiliate 𝑖, and even more so at (weighted) other locations within
the same firm, displays a low degree of variation over short periods of time. Hence, it is hard to discern the
productivity variables’ effects on the debt ratio from the one of affiliate-specific time-invariant effects on the
one hand and from common time effects on the other hand.



                                                       22
    The magnitude of the effects across Tables 5 to 7 is very similar to those in Table 4 and
the levels of significance are somewhat higher. The APEs of the corporate income tax and
institutional weakness in the host country are respectively smaller and higher than in Table
4. For example, the APEs reported in Table 7 imply that a ten percentage point higher local
corporate income tax rate leads to a 7.2 point higher internal-debt-to-capital ratio, while an
increase in the index of institutional weakness of one standard deviation (1.7) increases the
internal-debt-to-capital ratio by 3.5 percentage points.

6.3     Sensitivity Analysis with Regard to Affiliate-Productivity Mea-
        surement
While all results presented in Tables 3 to 7 use the method suggested by Olley and Pakes
(1996) to estimate total factor productivity of an affiliate, we may investigate the sensitivity
of our findings with respect to other productivity measures. Table 8 shows that our main
results are not affected at all when doing so.
    In columns 1 and 2 we estimate affiliate-level productivity by using the method of Levin-
sohn and Petrin (2003).18 For both estimated coefficients (for the host-country productivity
and for the weighted productivity at other locations), we cannot find a significant impact
on the internal debt ratio of affiliates. In columns 3 and 4 we use an alternative, less accu-
rate measure for productivity calculated as affiliate sales divided by the average change in
the total assets of an affiliate.19 Again, we cannot confirm that this alternative measure is
significantly related to the internal debt ratio of the foreign affiliates.

6.4     Further Sensitivity Analysis
We have conducted further sensitivity checks regarding (i) the treatment of location choice
of affiliates as to be endogenous, (ii) an alternative treatment of standard errors by using
country-year clustering instead of a panel bootstrap procedure, (iii) effects on small versus
large firms, (iv) the relative importance of conditioning on other fundamentals than corporate
profit tax rates, (v) the role of estimating nonlinear models (which respect to the bound-
edness of the dependent variable) relative to linear (OLS) models, (vi) the consideration
of interaction terms of the fundamental variables so that their nonlinear effects on internal
borrowing do not only accrue to the nonlinear functional form of the estimator for fractional
dependent variables, and (vii) the consistency of internal borrowing within a country with
firm-level productivity differences across all units of a firm in that country and year.
  18
      In contrast to Olley and Pakes (1996), Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) suggest using intermediate inputs
(materials) as a proxy variable instead of investment. As said above, materials are not recorded in the
affiliate statistics at hand. Therefore, we use financial and other assets – which is also more stable than net
investment – as a proxy variable which is is monotonically related by assumption to the unobserved total
factor productivity state variable. In other regards, the adopted estimation procedure is similar to the one
of Olley and Pakes (1996).
   19
      In contrast to the estimates based on Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003), this
proxy variable does not account for the endogeneity of some of the inputs, nor does it account for selectivity.



                                                      23
    A detailed presentation of the associated results is provided in a separate online appendix
for the sake of brevity of the manuscript. The main conclusions drawn from this analysis
are the following. First, a control function approach to control for endogenous affiliate
location choice does not lead to qualitatively or quantitatively different results from the
ones presented above. Country-year clustering of the standard errors does not lead to a big
difference in standard errors relative to the panel bootstrap. The inclusion of small firms, the
treatment of endogenous fundamentals of other affiliates than 𝑖 for 𝑖’s internal borrowing,
and the treatment of the internal borrowing (share) as a bounded dependent variable are
major reasons for the identification of much larger tax semi-elasticities in this paper than in
previous work. The consideration of interaction effects of fundamentals beyond the nonlinear
functional form of the econometric model does not add much in terms of nonlinearity of the
effects of fundamentals on internal borrowing in the support region of the data (this is aligned
with our expectations; see Greene, 2010). Finally, within-country productivity differences
are of a similar importance for internal borrowing as productivity differences across countries.

6.5    Quantification of Tax Effects and Their Discussion in the Light
       of the Literature
The novel aspect of our investigation is that we allow MNEs to use their internal capital
markets to reallocate capital to entities facing constraints in general, and high taxes, weak
institutions, an underdeveloped financial market, and a high productivity in host-countries in
particular. An important advantage of our study over existing empirical work is that the data
allow us to observe lending and borrowing among affiliates of MNEs in a comprehensive way,
because German MNEs are required to report their capital links to Deutsche Bundesbank
so that we may gain a virtually complete picture of the internal capital market of a group.
    Since the literature has devoted much attention on tax incentives for internal debt, let us
compare our findings to previous estimates for the impact of taxes on debt. Feld, Heckemeyer,
and Overesch (2011) identify in a meta-study, synthesizing evidence from 46 studies, a typical
semi-elasticity of 0.313 of total debt. Our estimated host-country tax coefficient of .918 (see
Table 4) translates into a semi-elasticity of 5.02, which exceeds the typical semi-elasticity
found in the meta-study by a factor of more than 16. If only internal debt is considered,
the meta-analysis finds a typical semi-elasticity of 0.47, which is still less than a tenth of our
estimate. As indicated in Subsection 6.4, there are three likely reasons for the big difference
between the estimated semi-elasticity in this paper and the ones in earlier work. First, while
other data-sets often include large MNEs only, we consider also relatively small MNEs with
rather modest internal debt ratios in our Census of data. Second, while earlier work often
used linear models we resort to a nonlinear framework which pays attention to the limited
dependent variable nature of internal-debt-to-capital ratios employed as the dependent vari-
able. Third, unlike earlier work we consider a more complete array of incentives to internal
borrowing, where multiple units in a firm may act as lenders and borrowers simultaneously.
Against the background of several papers speculating about why the tax-sensitivity of debt
is so low (see Ruf, 2011), our results suggest that internal debt is highly tax-responsive and
that the tax rate is an important determinant of the internal-debt-to-capital ratio.

    The non-linear fractional response model used in our analysis allows us to evaluate
marginal effects at different values of the explanatory variables. Hence, MNEs with cer-
tain characteristics may respond even more to variations in taxes than others. Figures 4 and
5 emphasize this aspect by showing how predicted internal debt ratios vary according to vari-
ations in host-country characteristics. Tables 9 and 10 present the respective estimates for
some countries that exhibit extreme values of these characteristics in view of the distribution
of these variables across countries. Comparing Greece with the United States, for example,
shows that we would predict about the same internal debt ratio, even though the statutory
tax rate in the United States is about 10 percentage points higher. Another interesting
comparison between Greece and the United States shows that the institutional environment
faced by foreign affiliates in Greece ought to be improved by 0.36 (to 6.3) to predict ceteris
paribus the same internal debt ratio for the average affiliate located in Greece or the United
States. With respect to capital market development, Japan, for example, would have to
improve its capital market development index to a value of 32 (from about 125) for affiliates
located in Japan to exhibit the same predicted internal debt ratio as affiliates located in the
United States. A comparison between affiliates in Hong Kong and affiliates in Singapore,
on the other hand, shows that capital market conditions may become 2.5 (from 168 to 434)
times worse in Hong Kong until the lower tax rate in Hong Kong is offset and the affiliates
rely on the same amount of internal debt financing as in Singapore. The non-linearity of the
relationship between tax and institutional components in determining 𝐼𝐷𝑖𝑡 is also reflected
in different gradients with respect to fundamentals, which depend on where a country is
located in tax-institution space. Beside Figures 4 (in case of the institutional environment)
and 5 (in case of capital market development), the last columns of Tables 9 and 10 demon-
strate that the effect of a marginal increase in the host-country tax rate differs a lot across
locations.
                – Include Tables 9 and 10, as well as Figures 4 and 5 here –
    Finally, suppose that we observe an MNE that consists of just two entities. The bor-
rowing entity is located in a low-tax country and the lending entity is located in a high-tax
country. At the same time, the borrowing entity is located in a country with bad institu-
tions and an underdeveloped capital market, while the lending entity is located in a country
with sound institutions and a well developed capital market. Let us assume values for the
respective fundamentals of the borrowing (lending) affiliate that refer to the 95𝑡ℎ percentile
(5𝑡ℎ percentile) of the respective distribution of 𝜙 and 𝜅, and a corporate profit tax rate at
the lending location of 40%. We may compare the predicted internal debt ratio of this MNE
to the average MNE in our sample and determine the (negative) tax rate differential for this
example which the firm would be willing to accept to end up with the same predicted share
of internal debt. For the average MNE, our model predicts an internal-debt-to- capital ratio
of 0.18. Note that from a pure taxation point of view, affiliates in low-tax countries would
not borrow from affiliates in high-tax countries. In our example, however, given other fun-
damentals of the internal capital market, the borrowing affiliate would be willing to accept
a negative tax rate differential of 11 percentage point (i.e., a host-country tax rate of 29%)
and still choose an internal debt ratio of 0.18. Figure 6 describes how the tax incentives
interact in such an example.

7    Conclusions
This paper has shown how multinational firms allocate internal financing by means of an
internal capital market not only to shift profits but also to avoid constraints faced by affiliates
in foreign countries. Similar to a high productivity of these affiliates, constraints associated
with a weak institutional environment or an underdeveloped capital market lead to an excess
return on investment. In this sense, the internal capital market is used to allocate financing
to affiliates with investment opportunities that entail the highest return.
     Earlier work has mainly focused on tax responses of internal borrowing from the unit
where the incentive is maximal. We illustrate that internal capital markets render predic-
tions concerning tax effects more complex than portrayed before. In particular, differences in
incentives given by fundamentals such as institutional weakness, financial underdevelopment
or productivity can offset tax incentives so that affiliates in high-tax countries may lend to
affiliates in low-tax countries. For the empirical analysis we use the Microdatabase Direct
Investment (MiDi) provided by Deutsche Bundesbank, which is a unique data-set of Ger-
man multinational firms and their foreign affiliates. Since German law requires mandatory
reporting to Deutsche Bundesbank, MiDi includes the universe of German multinational
firms. This feature of the data allows us to capture tax, institutional, capital market, and
productivity incentives in a comprehensive way, since not only the borrowing parties within
a group but also the lending parties are observed.
     Using a fractional response model, our main results imply that a one percentage point
higher statutory tax rate in the host country is associated with a 0.92 percentage point
higher internal-debt-to-capital ratio of the borrowing affiliate. At the same time, a one
percentage point increase in the (weighted) tax rate of the lending affiliates is associated
with a 0.77 percentage point lower internal-debt-to-capital ratio of the borrowing affiliate.
Other determinants of internal debt show the same qualitative pattern. While financial
underdevelopment in the host country is positively related to the internal debt ratio of the
borrowing affiliate, financial underdevelopment at other locations exerts a negative effect on
the internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate. While financial weakness in the host country
is associated with a higher internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate, financial weakness
at the lender locations leads to a lower internal debt ratio of the borrowing affiliate. While
a higher affiliate-level productivity of the borrowing affiliate relates positively to its internal
debt ratio, a higher productivity of the lenders exerts a negative impact on the internal debt
ratio of the borrowing affiliate (it should be mentioned, however, that productivity measures
are found to be statistically insignificant).
     Since this paper shows that internal debt within multinational firms is not only used
to avoid taxes but also to compensate differences in other fundamentals, tax policy must
consider that anti-tax avoidance measures designed to restrict profit shifting of multinational
firms (e.g. thin-capitalization rules) might aggravate financing constraints caused by non-
tax fundamentals. Given our findings, such policies would have significant effects on real
investment decisions of multinational firms, which go beyond their actual purpose.

Appendix – Prediction of Lending Capacity
For the sake of the instrumental variable approach, we use yearly poisson regressions to pre-
dict the potential lending of each affiliate. The predicted values of these regressions are then
used to weight the tax rates of the lending countries. The yearly regressions to predict lend-
ing include the following variables: corporate income tax rate, financial underdevelopment,
and institutional weakness of the lender’s country, the affiliate-level productivity, tangibil-
ity, loss carryforward and the sales of the lending affiliate. The regressions also include the
affiliate-specific means of all variables. Figure 7 shows the world map of actual lending from
all countries affiliates of German multinationals are located in. Notice that this approach
is similar in spirit to the one taken by Frankel and Romer (1999), who estimate a bilateral
gravity model of international trade and employ the (aggregated) predictions of that model
to instrument (unilateral) observed trade as a determinant of economic growth. In our case,
predicted lending serves as an instrument for observed lending which then is used to aggre-
gate up all non-𝑖 affiliate fundamentals as weighted averages where the weights are allowed
to be endogenous.
     This approach leads to a just-identified instrumental variables approach akin to Wooldridge
(2002; chapter 18) so that we can not apply over-identification tests. However, since lending
is predicted by fundamentals that can not easily be changed by an affiliate from year to
year and we condition on time-specific effects through fixed effects, it is plausible to assume
that the instruments are exogenous. In any case, the predicted weighted affiliate funda-
mentals turn out to be jointly highly relevant determinants of observed weighted affiliate
fundamentals as is indicated by the F-statistics reported in the respective table footnotes.

     Notes: 227,558 observations ((𝑎) 217,103 observations). All affiliate-level variables are taken from the
     MiDi database provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. Internal-debt ratio is the cross-border-internal-
     debt-to-total-capital ratio, where total capital consists of registered capital, capital reserves and profit
     reserves, as well as internal and external debt. Corporate income tax (host) is the statutory tax rate
     of the country hosting the borrowing affiliate 𝑖. Weighted corporate income tax (other locations) is the
     lending-weighted corporate income tax rate as defined in (24). The tax data is collected from databases
     provided by the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD) and tax surveys provided by
     Ernst&Young, PwC, and KPMG. Financial underdevelopment (host) is variable that captures the
     financial underdevelopment of the host country. To measure financial underdevelopment, we have taken
     a statistic for domestic credit to private sector relative to a country’s GDP, provided by the World
     Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. We define Financial underdevelopment (host)
          ∣𝐷𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡
     as (       𝐺𝐷𝑃
                            − 𝑚𝑎𝑥{ 𝐷𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝐶𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑖𝑡
                                          𝐺𝐷𝑃
                                                     }∣) Weighted financial underdevelopment (other locations)
     is the lending-weighted financial underdevelopment as defined in (24). Institutional weakness (host)
     captures the institutional weakness of the host country. Also from the WDI database, to measure
     institutional weakness, we use an index on the strength of investor protection. We define the index
     such that it ranges from 0 (strong investor protection) to 9 (weak investor protection). Accordingly,
     weighted institutional weakness (other locations) is the lending-weighted institutional weakness as
     defined in (24). Affiliate-level productivity OP (host) captures the productivity of affiliate 𝑖. We use
     the method suggested by Olley and Pakes (1996) to estimate productivity. Weighted affiliate-level
     productivity OP (other locations) is lending-weighted productivity as defined in (24). Tangibility is
     the affiliate-specific fixed-asset-to-total-asset ratio. Loss carryforward is a binary variable taking the
     value one if an affiliate reports a loss carryforward. Sales are the annual sales of an affiliate in bill. e.

Sensitivity analysis
The aim of this online appendix is to provide more detailed information on some of the sensi-
tivity checks mentioned but largely suppressed in the paper for reasons of space constraints.
In particular, those sensitivity checks relate to (i) the treatment of location choice of affiliates
as to be endogenous, (ii) an alternative treatment of standard errors by using country-year
clustering instead of a panel bootstrap procedure, (iii) effects on small versus large firms,
(iv) the relative importance of conditioning on other fundamentals than corporate profit tax
rates, (v) the role of estimating nonlinear models (which respect to the boundedness of the
dependent variable) relative to linear (OLS) models, (vi) the consideration of interaction
terms of the fundamental variables so that their nonlinear effects on internal borrowing do
not only accrue to the nonlinear functional form of the estimator for fractional dependent
variables, and (vii) the consistency of internal borrowing within a country with firm-level
productivity differences across all units of a firm in that country and year. We discuss any
one of those considerations in more detail below.

(i) A control function approach to endogenous affiliate location choice
We address the potential endogeneity of location choice by adopting a semi-parametric con-
trol function approach, akin to the one utilized with binary choice problems. For this, we
estimate annual conditional logit location choice models based on the following determinants
of (potential) affiliate location (with data sources added in parentheses): the statutory cor-
porate tax rate in each potential host country (as in the paper); financial underdevelopment
in each potential host country (as in the paper); institutional weakness in each potential
host country (as in the paper); log real GDP at constant U.S. dollars of the year 2000 in
each potential host country (World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2010); the cor-
ruption perception index for each potential host country (Transparency International); the
investment freedom index for each potential host country (Heritage Foundation’s Heritage In-
dicators); the costs of starting a business in each potential host country (World Bank’s World
Development Indicators 2010); log bilateral distance between Germany and each (potential)
host country (Centre d’Études Prospectives et d’Informations Internationales’ Geographical
Database).
                                     – Tables A.1 and A.2 –
We report the conditional logit parameter estimates for each covered year between 1996
and 2007 in Table A.1, below. The table indicates that the parameters are not stable over
time. However, we should be careful with over-emphasizing this result since the conditional
logit model is nonlinear and the parameters should not be directly compared with each
other. We utilize the linear prediction from the location choice models across all the years
in original form and, at the same time, in squared form. These two variables (together
with the parameters that have to be estimated on them) form a quadratic control function.
This function is added to the specifications in the last two columns of Table 4 of the paper
(assuming exogeneity of the potential lending weighting of other affiliates) and the one in

                                                A.2
Table 5 of the paper (assuming endogeneity of the weighting). This control function approach
is, e.g., similar in spirit to the semiparametric control function approach adopted to selection
into export markets in Helpman, Melitz, and Rubinstein (2008). The corresponding results
are summarized in Table A.2, and they suggest that controlling for endogenous location
choice in the proposed way does not lead to any big qualitative change relative to the
benchmark results in Tables 4 and 5 of the paper. In fact, the (robust) standard errors on
the parameters of the control function suggest that there is no bias in the parameters in
Tables 4 and 5 from endogenous selection into locations by the multinational firm.

(ii) Country-year clustering of standard errors instead of panel-boot-
strapped standard errors
We report counterparts to the last two columns of Table 4 and to Table 5 using country-year
clustering instead of panel bootsrapping in Table A.3, below.

                                        – Table A.3 –

It turns out that controlling for country-year clusters in the variance-covariance matrix leads
to slightly bigger standard errors than panel bootstrapping. However, there is no qualitative
change in the conclusions.

(iii) Regression results for small versus large firms
To assess the potential relevance of firm size (and selectivity bias in previous research) for
the results, we run the regressions in the last pair of columns of Table 4 and in Table 5 for
two alternative subsamples: one that contains firms that are smaller than the firm at the
25th centile and one that contains firms that are larger than the firm at the 75th centile. The
corresponding results are summarized in Table A.4, below, and they should be compared
with the benchmark results in Tables 4 and 5.

                                        – Table A.4 –

If anything, the Table A.4 suggests that utilizing a subsample of large firms leads to somewhat
smaller coefficients and average partial effects than utilizing a subsample of small firms.
Hence, we conclude that – to some (though not an overwhelming) extent – the difference
in magnitude of tax effects for internal borrowing between this study and previous research
may accrue to the selective reliance on larger firms in several of the studies.

(iv) Regression results without the three non-tax fundamentals
We report counterparts to the last two columns of Table 4 and to Table 5 disregarding the
three non-tax fundamentals in Table A.5, below.

                                        – Table A.5 –


                                              A.3
It turns out that ignoring the three non-tax fundamentals from the specification leads to
somewhat bigger parameters for the corporate tax variables than in the benchmark spec-
ifications in Tables 4 and 5. The latter holds true no matter of whether one controls for
weighted corporate tax rates elsewhere in the firm or not. This suggests that the smaller ef-
fects found in previous research are unlikely due to the omission of those other fundamentals
from the corresponding model specifications.

(v) Regression results for linear (OLS) models
We report counterparts to the last two columns of Table 4 and to Table 5 based on (linear)
fixed effects and two-stage least squares fixed effects in Table A.6, below.

                                        – Table A.6 –

Indeed, it turns out that assuming a log-linear regression model (which is inadequate since it
does not pay attention to the boundedness of the dependent variable) leads to much smaller
coefficients and average partial effects of the statutory income tax variable. To see this,
compare the first column of Table A.6 with its nonlinear counterpart in the last two columns
of Table 4. It turns out that the corporate tax parameter (and the average partial effect)
is much smaller in the linear model with exogenous weighting than in the nonlinear model
as reported in the last two columns of Table 4. The parameters of the tax variables even
turn (and take on implausible signs) in case of two-stage least-squares estimation relative to
the nonlinear two-stage least-squares model in Table 5. This suggests that the inadequate
linear modeling of internal lending (in levels or as a ratio) is identified as one potentially
fundamental problem with the data at hand.

(vi) Estimating nonlinear models with interaction terms of the fun-
damentals
We report counterparts to the last two columns of Table 4 and to Table 5 based on specifi-
cations which include interactive terms between all four fundamental variables employed in
Tables 4 and 5 in Table A.7, below. This is meant to account for a nonlinear impact of the
fundamentals which goes beyond the nonlinearity as imposed by the functional form of the
nonlinear models estimated. Hence, in the corresponding models there are now two sources
of nonlinearity: one that relates to the specification of the latent process and the other one
relates to the nonlinear mapping of the latent process onto the unit space.

                                        – Table A.7 –

The corresponding parameter estimates are impossible to interpret since the fractional re-
sponse model is nonlinear per se. However, the results can be described as follows. First,
the predictions of the surfaces contain somewhat more extreme values (zero debt ratios at
the lower bounds and unitary debt ratios at the upper bounds) than Figures 4-6. However,
the qualitative shapes of the τ -φ relationship counterpart to Figure 4, the τ -κ relationship

                                             A.4
counterpart to Figure 5, and the τ -τ w relationship counterpart to Figure 6 is the same. While
the extreme values (zeros and ones of outcome) are mostly outside of the region supported
by the data anyway, the slope of the estimated surfaces are steeper in the support region.
Hence, if anything, including interaction terms among the fundamentals renders the debt
ratio even more responsive to the fundamentals (including tax rates) than in Figures 4-6.

(vii) Consistency of internal borrowing within a country with firm-
level productivity differences
We report counterparts to the last two columns of Table 4 and to Table 5 based on specifi-
cations which discern between the average productivity within a country (and year) and the
deviation from the latter per affiliate in Tables A.8 and A.9. For this, we split the (measured
or estimated) firm-level productivity variables into two orthogonal components. Let us de-
note a generic productivity variable for affiliate i in year t by θit as in the paper, and the
number of all units of the firm affiliate i belongs to in the same country as i and in year t by
Bit . Then, the average productivity
                                   PBit of that firm in the country where i is located and year
                                 1
t may be denoted as θ̄it = Bit i=1 θit , and the deviation of i from this average in year t is
θeit = θit − θ̄it . While the regressions in Tables 4-8 included θit as a regressor, the alternative
ones as counterparts to the benchmark regressions on the outer right of Table 4 and in Table
5 employ θ̄it and θeit as two separate regressors. Obviously, θit = θ̄it for all firms which hold
only a single affiliate in the country where i is hosted in year t. Hence, identification of the
separate effects of θ̄it and θeit comes entirely from multi-unit firms in a single country and
year.

                                     – Tables A.8 and A.9 –

Focusing on those results where the productivity measures carry statistically significant
coefficients, the findings suggest that θ̄it and θeit enter with the same sign and have coefficients
of quite similar magnitude. Hence, variability of productivity across units in the same firm,
host country, and year is as important for triggering internal lending as the variability of
average productivity across host countries is in the same firm and year.

      Notes: Conditional logit estimates of the location decision of German multinationals from 1996 to 2007. Robust standard errors reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate
      significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively. Control variables are taken from different sources. Corporate income tax is the statutory tax rate of a host country. The tax
      data is collected from databases provided by the International Bureau of Fiscal Documentation (IBFD) and tax surveys provided by Ernst&Young, PwC, and KPMG. Financial
      underdevelopment is a variable that captures the financial underdevelopment of the host country. To measure financial underdevelopment, we have taken a statistic for domestic
      credit to private sector relative to a country’s GDP, provided by the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. We then define Financial underdevelopment
           |DomesticCredit
      as (      GDP
                           − max{ DomesticCredit
                                         GDP
                                                   }|). Institutional weakness (host) captures the institutional weakness of the host country. Also from the WDI database, to measure
      institutional weakness, we use an index on the strength of investor protection. We define the index such that it ranges from 0 (strong investor protection) to 9 (weak investor
      protection). log GDP measures the real GDP at constant U.S. dollars of the year 2000 and is taken from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators 2009. CPI (Corruption
      Perception Index) is published annually by Transparency International. It ranks countries in terms of perceived levels of corruption, as determined by expert assessments and opinion
      surveys. The scores range from 10 (country perceived as virtually corruption free) to 0 (country perceived as almost totally corrupt). The investment freedom index Investment
      Freedom is taken from the Heritage Indicators database. The index can take on values between 0 and 100; higher values are associated with more investment freedom. Cost of
      Starting a Business is from World Bank’s Doing Business Database and measures the cost of starting a business relative to income per capita. log Distance is the log of the distance
      (in kilometer) between the most populated cities in the host country and the parent country (Germany). The distance variable is taken from the Centre d’Études Prospectives et
      d’Informations Internationales.

                        variable). The dependent variable refers to internal cross-border debt. The first column represents a
                        standard fixed effects model while the second column represents a fixed effects two-stage least squares
                        model. Due to the imposed linearity, the coefficients reflect partial (and average partial) effects, unlike in
                        Tables 4 and 5. All regressions include time dummies and affiliate-specific fixed effects. Robust standard
                        errors reported in parentheses. *, **, and *** indicate significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%, respectively.
