       On May 2, 1998, the leaders of the countries of the European Union formally selected those

countries deemed eligible to participate in a common currency union. This union, commonly

referred to as the European Monetary Union (EMU)1, was the third and final stage of a process

established under the Maastricht treaty of December, 1991. While various criteria were established

in that treaty as pre-conditions for membership, the most severe constraints were with respect to the

“convergence” criteria regarding acceptable levels of inflation rates, interest rates, budget deficits

and national debt. An additional criterion of exchange rate stability became obsolete after the

European currency crises of 1992 and 1993. 11 countries2 were selected as eligible; an additional

3 (Denmark, Sweden, and the U.K.) chose not to participate, while Greece failed to meet the

convergence criteria.



       Although the EMU now appears virtually certain to begin on January 1, 1999 with broad

participation, that outcome was not expected over most of the 1992-98 period. Academics discussed

a two-tiered Europe consisting of a few core countries that would meet the convergence criteria, and

a broader group that would not qualify until later. Paralleling this uncertainty, various academic

researchers and banks developed “EMU probability calculators” to infer from financial data the

probability of various countries qualifying for admission. The best-known is probably the one

developed by J.P. Morgan, the results of which were regularly reported in the Financial Times. Four

such probability calculations for Italy are illustrated below in Figure 1.3

        This article primarily reviews the methodologies employed in constructing such calculators.

While the initial group of participants has now been determined, many other countries are waiting

in the wings and may join later. A retrospective examination of the methodologies may therefore

be useful in providing a guide to constructing new calculators for prospective entrants. Section I
discusses two alternative direct approaches (Arrow-Debreu contracts, options-based assessments)

to creating EMU probability assessments, while Section II examines the more common approaches

that use the term structures of European interest rates. Section III concludes with some discussion

of what can be inferred from financial data regarding future policies of the new European Central

Bank.

I. Non-standard EMU Probability Calculators

I.A. Arrow-Debreu contracts

       The most direct assessments of the probabilities of specific countries joining a European

currency union are the prices of Arrow-Debreu securities that pay off contingent upon the countries

being admitted. Two such contracts, on Italy and on Spain, began trading on the Iowa Electronic

Markets on March 3, 1998. Each contract paid off $1 conditional upon Italy or Spain being selected

by the European Council as eligible to participate in the currency union -- which transpired at the

summit meeting on May 2. Market prices and volumes for the two contracts are graphed below, in

Figure 2.

       that pay off $1 conditional upon admittance. Volume figures are the total number of
       country-specific contracts traded per day -- both “in” and “out” contracts.


       Unfortunately, the contracts were introduced too late in the EMU process to contain much

insight into the alternate methods of assessing EMU probabilities. The contracts actually began
                                                    4

trading shortly after the European governments released their official economic results for 1997.

All countries except Greece that were interested in participating in the currency union met the

interest rate, inflation and budget deficit criteria of the Maastricht treaty, while exemptions on the

public debt criterion for heavily indebted Italy and Belgium were widely expected on the grounds

of substantial improvement.4 Consequently, the prices on Italian and Spanish admission rapidly

gravitated to 95 cents on the dollar once trading began in earnest on the contracts. Further

substantial trading volume and price movements were observed prior to the March 27 official reports

of the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission regarding countries’ eligibility,

at which time prices moved to 99 cents on the dollar



I.B Options-based EMU assessments
       An alternate direct method of assessing EMU probabilities is to exploit the information from

currency options’ implicit volatilities regarding future intra-European cross exchange rate volatility.

Stochastic volatility option pricing models such as Scott (1987) and Hull and White (1987) indicate

that the “implicit” variance that equates the Garman-Kohlhagen (1983) currency option pricing

formula to observed option prices should roughly be the expected average variance of exchange rate

percentage changes over the lifetime of the option:5

        Several issues are being ignored in this simplified exposition: a concavity bias that (slightly)
biases downward at-the-money implicit variances relative to expected average variance, the impact
of volatility risk premia, and Hull and White’s assumption that asset return shocks and volatility
shocks are uncorrelated. For further discussion of these issues, see Bates (1996, pp. 590-91).
                                                    5

Furthermore, currency options’ implicit volatilities do appear to forecast future exchange rate

volatility reasonably well in general -- in contrast to those from stock or stock index options.6

Consequently, setting implicit forward variances


                                                                 2             2

equal to the probability-weighted average of the zero value expected conditional upon currency

union, and a higher estimated value conditional upon EMU not occurring, would appear a natural

and direct way of assessing the probability of EMU transpiring.



       The major difficulty with this approach is data availability. Interbank options on pound/DM,

DM/FF, and DM/lira are actively traded, but primarily only for maturities of up to one year.7

International convertible bonds such as those studied by Jennergren and Näslund (1990) often

contain longer-maturity intra-European cross-rate options, but extracting implicit option prices is

severely complicated by the plethora of bond-specific features. Consequently, the effective absence

until 1998 of data on actively traded options maturing after January 1, 1999 has precluded the

construction of EMU calculators based upon intra-European currency options. Some studies have,

however, used such options to assess developments in the run-up to the currency union; notably

Campa, Chang, and Reider (1997), Butler and Cooper (1997), and Adão, Cassola, and Luíz (1998).



       6
         Most empirical work on currency options has used the $/FC options traded on centralized
exchanges. Those studies typically find implicit volatilities are roughly unbiased forecasts of future
volatility; see Bates (1996) for a survey. The over-the-counter intra-European cross-rate options
offered by many banks have been less actively studied, because of difficulties in acquiring data.
       7
        The Bank for International Settlements (1996, Table D-8) reports that turnover in pound/DM
over-the-counter options averaged about $1½ billion/day in April 1995, while FF/pound options’
turnover was about $2 billion/day. However, Table D-6 indicates only 11% of all OTC currency
options had maturities greater than 1 year.
                                                    6

       Even if the data were available, implicit volatility-based EMU calculators would suffer from

many of the difficulties of the interest rate-based calculators discussed below. The major issue is

estimating what cross-rate volatility would be conditional upon a specific country failing to join the

EMU. If, for instance, non-members nevertheless fix their exchange rates against the Euro-bloc

countries (Butler and Cooper’s ERM-2 scenario), the EMU and non-EMU cross-rate volatilities are

virtually identical and EMU probability computations are infeasible. Nevertheless, using currency

options to assess shifts in exchange rate regimes is a more direct approach than inferring shifts in

regimes from bond yields, and it is regrettable that the data are not readily available.

II.A. Theoretical foundations
       The equilibrium approach to bond pricing exemplified by Cox, Ingersoll, and Ross (1985a,b)

        The basic EMU probability calculator approach implemented inter alia by De Grauwe

(1996), J.P. Morgan (1997) and Favero, Giavazzi, Iacone, and Tabellini (1997) uses the interest rate

forecasts inferred from intra-European forward rates to assess the probability of any two countries

entering into a currency union. For instance, if both Germany and Italy enter into a permanent

currency union, the elimination of currency risk implies that DM and lira Italian money market

deposits and loans become perfect substitutes, with identical interest rates. By contrast, a failure to

achieve currency union implies a gap, presumably positive, between Italian and German interest

rates. The Marshallian expectations hypothesis ft, T ' Et (rt%T ) , combined with a particular estimate

of the expected future interest rate spread conditional upon EMU not occurring (NEMU), yields a

method of inferring the probability of EMU occurring from observed forward rate differentials:

                 ITL       DEM                                           ITL     DEM

                                                  8

The alternate EMU probability calculators diverge primarily in their method of estimating the no-

EMU scenario for future interest differentials, and in the selection of the future time interval.



       Figure 3 shows the forward spreads for 7 currencies and for the ECU currency basket.

Instantaneous forward rates corresponding to fixed 1999, 2002, and 2005 future maturities were

computed from 3-, 6-, and 12-month Eurocurrency rates and 1-10 year swap rates, using Svensson’s

extension of the Nelson-Siegel (1987) methodology as described in Söderlind and Svensson (1997). 8

Forward spreads over 1991-98 were predicting relatively narrow post-1998 interest rate spreads

relative to Germany for Belgium, Denmark, the ECU, France, and the Netherlands, but substantially

larger spreads for Italy, Sweden, and the U.K. The forward spreads for most of the countries

participating in the currency union (Belgium, France, and the Netherlands) had converged to zero

by or before the fixing of official bilateral rates against the DM at the May 1998 summit.

Interestingly, however, both the Italian and the ECU 1999 forward spreads were still slightly positive

as of the summer of 1998. The latter can be attributed to exchange rate uncertainty regarding the rate

of conversion of the ECU into euros, given the presence in the currency basket of non-EMU

currencies such as the pound. The positive Italian spreads suggests that some uncertainty also

remains as to whether the official lira/DM bilateral rate will in fact be achieved -- an uncertainty

reflected in an unsuccessful speculative attack on the lira in August.9



       Of the three countries (Denmark, Sweden, and the U.K.) that chose not to participate in the

EMU in 1999, two (Denmark and Sweden) nevertheless exhibited substantial convergence in post-

1998 forward rates relative to Germany over 1997 and 1998. The convergence was even more

pronounced for Swedish 2002 and 2005 forward spreads, suggesting the possibility of delayed entry.

British 1999 forward rates by contrast diverged increasingly over 1995-98 from German rates, but

a sharply inverted forward spread curve over 1997-98 also suggests the possibility of delayed entry.



       An immediate problem for EMU probability calculators is that although Germany is assumed

to be the low-interest rate country, as has historically been the case within the European Union over

1977-98, forward spreads relative to Germany have occasionally been negative by 0-40 basis points

for Denmark, France, the Netherlands, the U.K., and the ECU. This implies that despite history,

market participants are assigning some probability to a post-1998 non-EMU scenario in which

Germany is no longer the low-interest country. EMU probability calculators influenced by historical

norms that calculate positive interest spreads conditional on EMU not occurring consequently

estimate negative BNEMU values over these periods, and BEMU values greater than 1. De Grauwe’s

and Morgan’s EMU calculators set such BEMU values to 1, under the interpretation that they indicate

a strong probability of EMU. Theoretically, however, a negative forward rate spread can constitute

as strong evidence against future interest rate convergence as a positive spread.



       Three issues arise in the assessment of whether EMU probability calculators are likely to do

a good job. First is the issue of whether European term structures of interest rates have in fact

demonstrated any ability to forecast future intra-European interest rate differentials. Second, there

are assorted convexity biases, risk adjustments, and currency adjustments that can potentially bias

inferred probabilities of monetary union away from the true conditional probabilities. Finally, there

is the key issue of identifying the non-EMU regime.



II.B. The expectations hypothesis
       EMU probability calculators are useless if European term structures contain little information

regarding future interest rate changes. However, as discussed in Gerlach and Smets (1997a,b),

Hardouvelis (1994), and Bekaert, Hodrick and Marshall (1997), European term structures tend to
                                                   11

be more consistent with the expectations hypothesis than has been the U.S. experience. Table 1A

reports country-specific estimates of the forward expectations hypothesis

                      n         n                                     n

                                     n
for n-month Eurodeposit rates Rt (n = 3, 6) relative to the forward rates F inferred from n-month

and 2n-month Eurodeposit rates. Short-maturity forward rates are definitely informative with regard

to future short-term rates, but the unbiasedness hypothesis is rejected for about half of the countries.

Table 1B shows that intra-European forward spreads relative to the German forward rates do even

better when forecasting of future interest rate differentials, with only 3 regressions out of 18 rejecting

the unbiasedness hypothesis.



        As discussed in Gerlach and Smets (1997a,b), part of this greater consistency with the

expectations hypothesis is undoubtedly attributable to the greater past predictability of European

interest rate changes. Speculative attacks on the weaker currencies participating in the European

Monetary System generate temporarily high short-term interest rates for those currencies, and sharply

inverted term structures that correctly predict future interest rate declines once the currency is

devalued.10 The expectations hypothesis fares less well for the DM, pound, and dollar, which were

typically less constrained by exchange rate targets over 1977-98.



        A past ability of term structures to forecast largely predictable changes in interest rates

primarily associated with currency crises does not guarantee good forecasting performance for the

future. A currency union is a European exchange rate regime previously experienced only by

Belgium and Luxembourg, while the interest rate consequences of failing to achieve union could be

           Gerlach and Smets (1997b) note that while these crises are unquestionably important in
tests of the expectations hypothesis, the hypotheis is also not rejected in more tranquil periods.
                                                   12

difficult to forecast. Nevertheless, it is reassuring that there are no strong grounds a priori for

rejecting the use of forward spreads as a forecast of future interest rate differentials.



II.C. Divergences between inferred and conditional probabilities
          As indicated above in equations (3) - (5), equilibrium bond pricing theory does not in general

predict that forward rates should be unbiased predictors of future short-term interest rates. There are

three potential sources of bias. First is the interest rate risk premium (or term premium) when going

from conditional to “risk-neutral” bond pricing probability measures. Second is the use of forward

rates rather than bond prices, inducing biases indicated in equation (4).          Third is a currency

conversion issue when comparing forward rates from different currencies.



          According to equation (3), EMU probabilities inferred from bond prices are “risk-neutral”
                                                                               (
(or risk-adjusted) probabilities computed under the probability measure Et :

                                      (                           (
                  B(t, T ) ' BEMU Et [e &r T * EMU ] % BNEMU Et [e &r T * NEMU ]                   (9)

                               (
Equivalently, BEMU / Probt [EMU ] is the current futures price on an Arrow-Debreu contract that

pays off conditional upon EMU occurring. If the difference between EMU and no-EMU is

associated with a major difference in investment opportunities, hedging against those differences

could create a significant divergence between conditional probabilities and Arrow-Debreu futures

prices.



          Whether European Monetary Union will have real economic effects, and of what sign, has

been a matter of considerable debate. Bean (1992), for instance, argued that both the long-term costs

and the long-term benefits are likely to be small, implying little divergence between actual and risk-

neutral probabilities. On the other hand, the short-term consequences for economic policies and

interest rates of failing to achieve membership in a currency union could in principle be substantial.
                                                    13

For instance, a failure by Italy to achieve either the interest rate or inflation criteria of the Maastricht

treaty might well have caused yet tighter monetary policy, in order to qualify at a later date. Whether

this matters for risk premia does, however, depend upon the degree to which Italian bond markets

are segmented from world markets. It appears appropriate to interpret inferred probabilities as “risk-

neutral” probabilities and, to a first approximation, as conditional probabilities as well.



        A crude calibration of the potential difference between actual and “risk-neutral” probabilities,

inspired by Hansen and Jagannathan (1991) and Cochrane and Saa-Requejo (1996), can be obtained

by placing bounds on the maximal feasible Sharpe ratio from speculating in an Arrow-Debreu

forward contract on EMU occurring. If B is the futures price on EMU and p is the true probability,

this approach implies *p & B* # srmax p (1 & p) # ½ srmax . Using srmax ' .3 T (the historical

Sharpe ratio on the U.S. stock market) implies that actual and risk-neutral probabilities should

deviate by less than 15% at an annual forecast horizon. However, this approach is too imprecise at

longer horizons, indicating tighter theoretical bounds on srmax are needed.



Forward rates versus bond prices
        The second issue is the bias induced by using forward rates instead of bond prices when

inferring (risk-neutral) probabilities of EMU occurring. Bond prices can be written as

                          (
           B(t, T ) ' Et [e &r T ] ' BEMU E [e &r T * EMU ] % BNEMU E [e &r T * NEMU ]

                     / BEMU BEMU % BNEMU BNEMU .


Consequently the forward rate is

                                     BEMU                                  BNEMU
                     ' BEMU                    f EMU % BNEMU                           f NEMU

                            (                   (
                     / BEMU fEMU % BNEMU f NEMU




                 (
where fEMU / Et [rt%T e &r T * EMU ] / BEMU is the current forward rate conditional upon EMU

occurring, and fNEMU is defined similarly. The former is typically assumed equal to the current DM

forward rate; the latter is estimated by various methods discussed in section II.C below. Divergences

in bond prices conditional upon EMU occurring or not occurring will yield biased inferences of the

probability of currency union from the current observed forward rate ft, T .



       How severe is this bias relative to risk-neutral probabilities inferred from bond prices? Re-

expressing in terms of bond yields,

                                 (             BEMU
                                BEMU / B
                                                B
                                                                   &y EMU T
                                                               e                                (12)
                                         ' B
                                                    &y EMU T                      & y NEMU T
                                               Be              % (1 & B )e
                                         . B % B (1 & B) ( yNEMU & yEMU ) T .



Thus, the bias depends upon the maturity of the forward rates used in assessing EMU prospects, and

the divergence between the EMU and non-EMU contingencies. If, for instance, 1999 forward rates

are used, then bond yields correspond to 1999 maturities and differ only insofar as the event of EMU

occurring or not is associated with divergences in pre-1999 interest rate paths. For instance, Italy
                                                  15

might be more likely to join the EMU under tighter pre-1999 monetary policies, implying

yEMU > yNEMU and a downward bias in inferred EMU probabilities.



       If forward rates from later maturities are used, as in Favero et al (1997) and as graphed above

in Figure (3), alternate biases arise. Bond yields for longer maturities can be decomposed into the

1999 bond yield and post-1998 average forward rates:

                    yt, T T ' yt, 1999 & t (1999 & t ) % f1999 6 T (T & 1999) .                 (13)


Assuming for calibration purposes that the term structures conditional on EMU occurring or not
                                                                           (
occurring differ only in the average forward rates, EMU probabilities BEMU inferred from forward

rates are biased upward by the amount

                (
               BEMU . BEMU % BEMU (1 & BEMU ) f NEMU & f EMU (T & 1999) .                       (14)


If the difference between EMU occurring and not occurring implies a difference of 4% in the average

forward rates, using instantaneous forward rates for the year 2002 would bias inferred probabilities

upward by at most ¼ (.04) (3) ' .03 . Thus, using forward rates instead of bond prices does not

appear to significantly influence EMU probability computations.



Currency issues
       A further potential bias originates in numeraire issues when considering the forward

expectations hypotheses underlying EMU probability calculators. The “risk-neutral” expectational

operators that incorporate the assorted risk premia by changing the probability measure do depend

upon which currency is used when assessing investments. Consequently, forward rates from Italian

and German swap rates cannot be compared without first expressing the underlying investments in

a common currency.

The “risk-neutral” equilibrium condition that future currency speculation is currently expected to

yield zero discounted profits indicates that

        I know of no EMU probability calculator that considers this potential source of bias. Papers

that test or use the intra-European uncovered interest parity hypothesis at maturities of less than a

year typically rule out a substantial effect from numeraire issues from the fact that intra-European

exchange rate volatilities are small. 11 However, the maturities in (17) and (18) are substantially

longer, creating the possibility of a greater impact.



II.C. Estimating the non-EMU scenario
        One of the most critical issues in identifying the probability of two countries joining in a

currency union is estimation of the relevant forecast conditional upon EMU not occurring. As this

scenario represents a counterfactual hypothesis, the merits of the forecasts cannot directly be tested,

but can only be judged by the overall merits of the methodologies. Three quite different approaches

will be discussed here: J.P. Morgan’s “kitchen sink” regression, Favero et al’s central bank reaction

function, and Lund’s term structure model. A fourth approach used by De Grauwe (1996) and

Credito Italiano employs the average spreads from a period with low EMU prospects. De Grauwe

uses 1990 average spreads, while Credito Italiano uses 1993.12 Other banks have also created EMU

calculators, but Morgan’s is one of the few to publicly document its methodology.




        11
          See, e.g., Bertola and Svensson (1993).
        12
             Favero et al (1997), p. 15.
                                                  18

        J.P. Morgan’s EMU calculator identifies non-EMU forward rate spreads by regressing daily

10-year swap spreads (the difference, e.g., between Italian and German swap rates) on a set of non-

European interest rate variables intended to capture “international factors relating to investors

appetite for risk or the supply of liquidity.”13 Non-European variables were used for exogeneity
reasons, and the regression interval 1988-1992 was selected as a period in which expectations of

future currency union were plausibly not affecting intra-European interest differentials. Regressions

were only run through December 1991 for those countries that experienced currency devaluations

in the fall of 1992. Various regressors are considered; the analysis concludes “[w]e are principally

left with using the average of the U.S.-Canada and Japan-Australia 10yr bond spread and the U.S.

and Japanese 10yr-2yr yield spread.” The estimated “non-EMU” 10-year swap spread is then

transformed into an estimate of the post-1998 forward swap spread by using the observed pre-1999

swap spread and the average slope of the swap spread curve over 1988-92.



        While the objective of proxying for global trends in credit markets is laudable, the

diagnostics of model performance in- and out-of-sample overstate the model’s reliability. The major

difficulty is that the independent and dependent variables, while stationary, are highly persistent.

The high reported R 2 ’s (ranging from 61% to 83% on 1300 daily observations over 1988-92) are

therefore to be expected, while good out-of-sample forecasting performance over 1993 is also to be

expected for highly persistent variables. Dickey-Fuller tests for stationarity of in-sample residuals

are also run -- the standard Engle-Granger test for cointegrated variables -- but since the variables

are stationary the relevance of this test is not apparent.



        It does appear that the global variables used in assessing Morgan’s non-EMU scenario

contain some information for post-1992 swap spreads. In particular, several countries experienced

temporary declines in swap spreads relative to Germany over 1992-94, and again after 1995 (see


        13
         Morgan (1997), p. 4.
                                                  19

Figure 3) that are in part correlated with Morgan’s estimated non-EMU swap spreads.14 Overall, the

regression approach appears somewhat preferable to just using average spreads over some interval

as an estimate of the non-EMU scenario.15 Nevertheless, it must be recognized that the non-EMU

estimate potentially contains considerable structural instabilities that could affect EMU probability

inferences.16



       A further issue emphasized in Favero et al (1997), is that Morgan’s use of the post-1998

section of 10-year swap spreads ignores the possibility of delayed EMU entry. For instance, a 10-

year Italian-German swap spread as of January 1, 1995 incorporates instantaneous forward spread

predictions of future interest differentials over 1999 through 2005. Morgan’s EMU probability

estimates should therefore be loosely interpreted as the probability of EMU entry on or some time

after 1999.



Central bank reaction functions
       Favero, Giavazzi, Iacone, and Tabellini (1997) use macroeconomic variables instead of

financial variables in their forecast of the non-EMU scenario. Quarterly 3-month Euro-lira rates are

regressed over 1987:I through 1996:II upon a lagged value, the inflation and growth gaps relative

to Germany, a growth gap shift variable for the impact of German reunification, current and lagged

log $/DM exchange rates, current and lagged 3-month Euro-DM interest rates, and dummy variable


       14
        See Morgan (1997), Charts 3-9, which compare actual and non-EMU fitted swap spreads
over 1988-97 for Italy, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, U.K., Sweden and France.
       15
         Favero et al (1997) argue that Morgan’s results for the lira are in fact very similar to those
of Credito Italiano, which uses the average spread approach.
       16
          Morgan (1997) argues that the results are insensitive to misspecification, and that a ±15%
shift in the non-EMU forecast only shifts the inferred EMU probability roughly ±8% if the true
probability is 50%. However, a 15% percentage error in a 4% swap spread forecast is only a 0.6%
error absolute -- quite small compared to the forecast errors that might result from a misspecified
regression equation and the observed large movements over 1988-98 in, e.g., Japanese bond yields.
                                                   20

that eliminates the impact of the 1992:IV interest rate outlier. The regression results are interpreted

as representing the Bank of Italy’s reaction function to macroeconomic fundamentals over 1987-96.17

This regression, combined with current forecasts of the regressors,18 is used to forecast future interest

rates, and this forecast is used as the non-EMU scenario. The probabilities of Italy joining Germany

in a currency union by 1999 or by 2001 are then inferred using (7) above and instantaneous forward

rates computed from Euro-lira rates and lira swap rates via Svensson’s extended Nelson-Siegel

approach.



        Favero et al emphasize that the decline in Italian forward rate spreads after 1996 was

primarily attributable to improved fundamentals (e.g., falling Italian inflation) shifting the non-EMU

forecast. The residual explanation of shifting EMU probabilities played less of a role. Their

estimates also showed a relatively low probability over December 1995 through March 1997 of Italy

joining the EMU in 1999, but a higher probability of it joining by 2002. The difference apparently

reflects the sharply inverted term structure of forward rate spreads evident in Figure 3.



        It seems likely that the reaction function estimated by Favero et al is partly capturing Italian

monetary policy over 1987-1996. Achieving the Maastricht criteria certainly would create concern

about inflation differentials, while the pre-1993 Exchange Rate Mechanism implies German interest

rates were relevant over that period. However, whether forecasts based on this reaction function are

relevant conditional upon Italy failing to enter EMU in 1999 is open to question. While the

objective of qualifying by 2002 or later would plausibly prompt retention of the same reaction

function, an alternate hypothesis is that the Bank of Italy might revert to its policies of the 1980's.

The Bank of Italy reaction function estimated by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (1997) over 1981:6

        Favero et al found no statistical evidence supporting interest rate sensitivity to a somewhat
more traditional output gap measure: the deviation of actual GDP from a Hodrick-Prescott trend.

        The forecasts for inflation, output, and exchange rates for out to two years are based on
“consensus” forecasts, while German interest rate forecasts are inferred from German forward rates.

through 1989:12 is quite different from that in Favero et al; in particular, higher steady-state real

interest rates, and lower long-run sensitivity to Italian inflation, Italian output, and German interest

rates. If this were used instead as the non-EMU scenario, inferred EMU probabilities would be quite

different.



Bond pricing models
Lund (1998) provides a good example of the application of current bond pricing models to the issue

of inferring EMU probabilities. Lund models, e.g., Italian instantaneous interest rates as the sum of

the German rate and the Italian-German spread:

                                      ITL          DM            ITL            DM
                                 rt         ' rt        % (r t           & rt        )
                                                   DM          ITL                                (20)
                                            / rt        % st


and makes the critical identifying assumption that the instantaneous spot rate spread evolves

independently of the German interest rate. Under this assumption, plus the assumption that the

exchange rate does not jump at EMU inception, he builds an explicit model of yield spreads. From

(3) above, Italian bond prices are given by19

If the two currencies join together in a currency union, the instantaneous spread drops instantly to

zero. Rather than modeling this as only occurring on January 1, 1999, however, Lund posits a post-

January 1999 hazard rate that allows for delayed entry. The current assessment 2t of that hazard rate

determines the current EMU probability assessment [ 1 & exp(&2t J) ] of a country joining Germany

in a currency union within J years after 1/1/99. Combined with assumed independent Ornstein-

Uhlenbeck (or AR(1)) processes for the instantaneous spread st conditional upon no unification and

the market price 8t of spread risk, Lund develops a 3-factor model of yield spreads. In continuous

time, the pre-EMU “risk-neutral” processes used in pricing spreads via (22) are

                          ds ' [61 (µ 1 & s ) % 61 8] dt % F1 dW1 & s dq

                          d2 ' F3 dW3


where the W’s are independent Wiener processes and q is a 0- or 1-valued indicator for the
commencement of the currency union:

                                                        0 if t # 1/1/99

                                                        2t dt otherwise .


But whereas the yield spreads S ITL(s t , 8t , 2t , t, T ) for different maturities are priced as if the state

variables follow (23), the actual instantaneous spreads st (roughly equal to short-maturity Eurorate

differentials) are assumed to follow the AR(1) process

                                   ds ' 61 (µ 1 & s ) dt % F1 dW1                                      (25)

prior to January 1, 1999.



          Lund estimates the parameters in (12) and the state variable realizations via nonlinear

Kalman filtration, using two data sources: weekly 1-, 2-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month Eurorate differentials,

and 1-10 year yield differentials inferred from swap rates. The broadest data interval was January

1990 through August 12, 1998, although subsets of that interval were used for specific countries

either because of data unavailability, or because of deliberate data exclusion. First, short-maturity

interest rates were excluded for currencies affected by speculative attacks prior to September 1993,

so that the impact of a fourth underlying state variable (currency crises) could plausibly be ignored.

Second, post-1999 maturities were not considered prior to 1995, because of lack of confidence in

the inferred EMU hazard rates. The vector of yield spreads for different maturities provided cross-

sectional evidence each period regarding parameter values and state variable realizations, while the

time series evolution of those yield differentials provided further evidence regarding parameter

values.



          Lund makes two key identifying assumptions. First, he explicitly rules out the “double-

decay” process of Jegadeesh and Pennacchi (1996) on the grounds of parsimony, and assumes that

the “risk premium” state variable 8t does not affect the actual AR(1) process (25) followed by the

instantaneous spread. This assumption appears empirically reasonable for the 1990-98 period

considered, as will be discussed below. However, one advantage of the more general model, as

recognized in Andersen and Lund (1996), is that the second state variable can capture structural

shifts in the nominal interest spread processes resulting, e.g., from shifts in inflation targets.



          Second, the model implies yield spreads from bonds maturing prior to January 1, 1999 are

unaffected by shifts in the EMU probability state variable 2t . This is critical, because the “market

price of risk” 8t is also a free state variable that captures some movements in the shape of the term
                                                 24

structure unjustified by the AR(1) process (25) estimated for the instantaneous spread st .2021

However, 8t affects all maturities, whereas 2t affects only post-1999 maturities. 2t is inferred in

essence by the difference between the observed post-1999 portion of the yield curve, and the post-

1999 “local yield curve” predicted by extrapolating the pre-1999 yield curve for estimated state

variables ( st, 8t ). Thus, Lund’s EMU probability assessments are essentially assuming that the non-

EMU scenario for interest rate differentials is largely identified by the estimated 2-factor behavior

of the term structure of yield spreads over 1990-98 for pre-1999 maturities.



       Judging from Figure 1, Lund’s model appears to estimate generally lower Italian-German

interest differentials conditional upon EMU not occurring, and consequently higher non-EMU

probabilities (lower EMU probabilities) than other models. Despite the low standard errors of

Lund’s structural parameter estimates, however, it is not really possible to say whether Lund’s

inferred non-EMU scenarios are better or worse than the Morgan and Favero et al approaches. The

problem is that structural parameters are inferred partly from the time series behavior of the term

structure of yield spreads, and partly from what is needed to match the cross-sectional patterns of

yield spreads on individual weeks. The appropriate statistical theory for assessing the latter

informational source has not really been developed. The typical null hypothesis also used here is that

market participants know the true, time-invariant deep structural parameters and the state variable

realizations with certainty when pricing bonds, and that observed and actual bond prices deviate only

by independent, homoskedastic measurement error. Under this strong null hypothesis and given

abundant cross-sectional data, inferred parameters tend to have low estimated standard errors.


       20
          The 1-factor Vasicek model given by the risk-neutral equivalent of (14) primarily allows
upward or downward sloped term structures that converge exponentially at longer maturities towards
a fixed infinite-maturity yield; see Hull (1993, ch. 11). 2-factor models allow more complicated
hump and U shapes, as well as more (state-dependent) variation over time in the slope and curvature
of the term structure.
       21
         The current bond pricing literature does not typically attempt to impose constraints on such
risk premia from asset pricing models. See, e.g., Duffie and Singleton (1997).
                                                      25

Lund’s estimates are best viewed as a model-specific description of a non-EMU scenario consistent

with term structures of yield spreads observed over 1990-98. Term structures observed over the

1980's might yield different estimates of the non-EMU scenario.



        Some insight into the time series stability of the term structure of spreads at short maturities

can be gleaned from Eurocurrency spreads, for which data over a longer time interval are more

readily available. Lund’s model implies that the instantaneous spread is Markov, so the slope of the

term structure of spreads contributes no additional information. A crude proxy for the former that

partially avoids the impact on short maturities of speculative attacks is the six-month Eurocurrency

spread; the latter is proxied by the difference between 12- and 6-month spreads. Table 2 reports

estimates of the regression

for weekly data over 1977-1998, estimates for c over the 1990-98 subsample used by Lund, and

heteroskedasticity-consistent Chow tests of process stability.



        With the exception of the Dutch-German spread slope, all subsample estimates of ĉ1990&98

are statistically insignificant, justifying Lund’s specification. Over the longer 1977-98 interval,
spread slopes are statistically significant for Denmark, Italy, and the Netherlands, but not for the

other five countries. However, it does appear that including the spread slope captures parameter

instabilities in the estimated spread process to some extent. P-values are substantially lower for

subsample stability tests of Lund’s AR(1) than for stability tests of (26), for 7 out of 8 countries.

Parameter stability of (26) is rejected at the 10% level for 3 countries (Belgium, Great Britain, and

Sweden), whereas the subsample stability of Lund’s AR(1) is also rejected for these three, Denmark

and Italy.

III. Prospects for the Future
       There has been considerable speculation regarding what monetary policies will be pursued

by the new European Central Bank (ECB). Some have argued that the ECB is likely to initially

pursue a tight monetary policy, in order to establish an anti-inflationary reputation. The selection

of Duisenberg as its initial head is certainly consistent with this perspective. Others have argued that

the voting power of countries such as Italy that historically have been less concerned about inflation

may result in monetary policy somewhat weaker than that historically pursued by the Bundesbank.



       Morgan (1997) argues that the EMU probability calculators indicate a weak-ECB scenario.

Fluctuations in the average EMU probability of three “periphery” countries (Italy, Spain, and

Sweden) have been strongly correlated with deutsche mark weakness against the dollar. The

argument is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows that the average Italian-Swedish 1999 forward

spread against the DM has indeed fluctuated roughly in tandem with the $/DM exchange rate.

            forward rates, and the $/DM exchange rate.
Narrowing spreads (which EMU probability calculators would interpret as higher unification

probabilities) have roughly coincided with a weakening DM, while widening spreads have coincided

with a strengthening DM.



       One difficulty with this argument is that forward spreads over this period are a good proxy

for the overall level of European bond yields and forward rates, and for German rates in particular.
Figure 5 shows German 3-month Eurodeposit rates and forward rates at various maturities over the

same interval. Falling German rates were accompanied by even greater declines in non-German

rates, while rising German rates accompanied larger increases elsewhere. The synchroneity was

most pronounced for forward rates of at least 1 year in maturities. Consequently, in terms of the

implications for the $/DM exchange rate, it is impossible to distinguish the weak-ECB hypothesis

from an alternate hypothesis that the exchange rate fluctuations reflected German forward interest

rate fluctuations over 1992-96 resulting, e.g., from shifting near-term expectations of future

Bundesbank monetary policy.

Filtration-based assessments
       As indicated above in Figure 3, forward rates for all countries participating in the currency

union have currently essentially converged to a common “Euro” term structure. Some insights into

financial markets’ assessment of the future interest rate policies of the ECB relative to earlier

Bundesbank policies can potentially be gleaned by comparing this yield curve with historical German

norms. To this end, a state space representation of the vector of Eurocurrency deposit rates and

swap rates for German instruments maturing prior to January 1, 1999 was estimated via Kalman

filtration on weekly data:

                              y t ' A % H z t % u t , u t - N(0, R )
                                                                                              (27)
                              z t ' F z t& 1 % v t ,        v t - N(0, Q )


where y t is a 9 × 1 vector of 3-, 6-, and 12-month Euro-DM deposit rates and 1-7 year swap rates

(excluding 6-year rates), expressed as continuously compounded yields; and z t is a 4 × 1 vector of

underlying state variables.



       The Euro-DM data were available from January 5, 1997, while most of the swap rate data

began in June 24, 1991.22 Data for post-1998 maturities were treated as missing data, with only 3-

and 6-month Euro-DM rates available for inference on the final date of July 1, 1998. The estimated

state space model summarizes the time-series based information contained in the level and shape of

the German term structure with regard to future term structure evolution, as well as the current

assessment of the state vector conditional on pre-1999 maturities. The model was used to address

two questions:

   1. How does the current term structure of German swap yields compare with the

       German pre-1999 norm represented by the final filtered value ŷT *T ?



       22
         Further details on data, estimation methodology, and identifying restrictions are provided
in the appendix.
                                                   29

    2. How does the current term structure of German forward rates compare with the future

        3-month spot rates that would be predicted based upon pre-1999 norms?

        Figure 6 shows the actual and fitted yield curves, as well as 95% confidence intervals around

the fits. The current DM yield curve is flatter than that which would be predicted based up historical

German swap rates over 1991-1998 and given current short-term interest rates. The divergence is

statistically significant at longer maturities. However, it should be recognized that the fits for longer

maturities are based upon term structure relationships estimated on increasingly narrower subsets

of the 1991-97 swap data interval, given the deliberate exclusion of swaps with payments beyond

January 1, 1999.



        Figure 7 presents a different picture of future interest rate prospects. The German 3-month

interest rate is stationary but highly persistent, with a weekly autocorrelation of .9969 over 1977-98.

would forecast gradual mean reversion in German rates back to a steady-state level of 4.75%. The

current “unusually” flat Euro forward rate curve is largely consistent with that forecast. By contrast,

the forward rate curve consistent with the fitted “German” yield curve of Figure 6 implicitly

forecasts considerably faster increases in future German rates.




       In summary, the current Euro term structure is unusually flat by German standards, but that

flatness is consistent with how German short-term rates have historically evolved. This suggests that

German term structures have historically been inconsistent with German short-term rate evolution

(a hypothesis supported by the short-maturity rejections of German forward rate unbiasedness in

Table IA above), but doesn’t answer the question of how ECB monetary policies are likely to

compare with past Bundesbank policies. At present, the only evidence we have is from exchange
                                                31

markets, and even that has multiple interpretations. The overall declines in German and European

interest rates over 1996-98 have accompanied substantial weakening of the EMU currencies against

the dollar. However, those could be interpreted either as a vote of no confidence in future ECB

policies, or as an expectation of future economic recession.

Appendix
Data
       Interest rate data were obtained from two sources. The Bank for International Settlements
provided daily 3-, 6-, and 12-month Eurocurrency deposit rates for 21 countries, collected around
10 AM Swiss time. The data begin on January 3, 1977 for five currencies (German mark, Dutch
guilder, Swiss franc, pound, and U.S. dollar), on September 1, 1977 for most other currencies, and
run through August 31, 1998.


       Swap rate data were downloaded from Datastream for nine European countries. Swap rates
are the European coupon rates in a semiannual exchange of fixed European interest payments against
floating dollar interest rate payments indexed to the Eurodollar interest rate; principal is also
exchanged at maturity. Since the dollar floating-rate cash flows are at par at the swap’s inception,
swap rates provide the European coupon rate such that a European bond with semiannual coupons
would be at par -- or, equivalently, the European semiannual yields to maturity, times two. Swap
rate data are more readily available than country-specific bond yields. As with other Euromarket
data, swap rates also alleviate concerns about country-specific default risk, capital controls, and tax
issues, as well as eliminating heterogeneity across national data sources.


       Midpoint swap rates were used; the average of bid and ask. Swap rates for 2-5, 7, and 10-
year maturities were available for all countries except Denmark and Sweden beginning on June 24,
1991. Danish swap rates began on February 25, 1993, while Swedish rates began on January 2,
1992. Data for 1-, 6-, 8-, and 9-year maturities began on November 15 or 16, 1994 for all countries
except France. French franc 1-year swap rates began on October 31, 1994, while 6-, 8-, and 9-year
maturities began on January 24, 1995. Weekly (Wednesday) observations were selected from the
daily data, with the nearest other day used when Wednesday was a holiday.


Forward rates
The 3- and 6-month forward rates used in testing the expectations hypothesis in section II.B were
                                                         33

computed from the Eurodeposit rates using the formula1

                                        N2 & N1                   1 % Rt, N 2 ( N2 / 360)
                   1 % F [t, T1 6 T2]                     /                                 .     (A.1)
                                            360                   1 % Rt, N 1 ( N1 / 360)


where N1 ( N2 ) is the number of days until the shorter (longer) Eurodeposit matures. For 3-month
forward rates, N1 was roughly 91 days and N2 was roughly 182 days, although there was some
variation across months and because of bank holidays (identified by missing data) and weekends.
This 3-month forward rate was used to forecast the future 3-month rate on a Eurodeposit that begins
when the deposit corresponding to Rt, T 1 ends -- i.e., the rate 2 business days before the first contract
matures. Because of weekends and holidays, this second 3-month deposit did not necessarily mature
precisely on the same day as the 6-month contract. This minor deviation in maturity was not
considered a serious concern. 6-month forward rates were constructed analogously from 12- and 6-
month Eurodeposit rates.


The instantaneous forward rates computed in section II.A used Svensson’s extension of the Nelson-
Siegel method, as described in Söderlind and Svensson (1997):

                                       T            T        T                    T        T

where $0, $0 % $1, J1 and J2 are free positive parameters and $2 and $3 are unconstrained
parameters. The continuously compounded yields for zero coupon bonds can be evaluated using the
relationship

analytic solutions are in Söderlind and Svensson (1997). The parameter vector for each day was
estimated using 3 Eurodeposit rates and up to 10 swap rates, using the following loss function:

where

               n

        ŷ(Tn, 2 ) is the fitted yield given parameter vector 2;
        k is a free parameter used to splice together Eurodeposit and swap rate data;2
        B̂(Tn, cn ; 2) is the estimated price of a bond paying semiannual coupons at swap rate cn over
        maturity Tn , given parameter vector 2; and

The loss function is essentially in yield space rather than in bond price space, reflecting the way the
data are quoted. In particular, weighting log bond prices by the inverse of duration approximately
transforms the last terms in (A.4) into the deviation between the observed swap rate cn and the U.S.-
style yield to maturity Yˆ inferred from fitted bond prices:

                          . ½ D(T n, cn) ( Yˆ & cn ) ,



exploiting the fact that swap rates are coupon rates for bonds that are at par. All parameters were
estimated using the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell nonlinear optimization algorithm (GQOPT subroutine
DFP), with various parameter transformations used to enforce nonnegativity constraints.

Kalman filtration
A state space representation is of the form

                             y t ' A % H z t % u t , u t - N(0, R )
                                                                                                (A.6)
                             z t ' F z t& 1 % v t ,        v t - N(0, Q )



where y t , A , and u t are N × 1 , z t and v t are K × 1 , R is an N × N matrix assumed diagonal and
nonnegative, Q is a K × K positive semidefinite matrix, and N > K . (A.6) is underidentified, since
any transformation of the underlying state vector(e.g., x t ' M z t ) constitutes an equally valid
representation. Provided the N × K matrix H is of full rank K, the state space representation can be
uniquely identified by imposing semi-arbitrary restrictions on any K rows of the matrix; for instance,
setting HN ' (I K H2N ) , where H2 is an unconstrained (N & K ) × K matrix. The system (A.6) can
be estimated by Kalman filtration methods discussed in Shumway and Stoffer (1982), Watson and
Engle (1983), and Hamilton (1994).


The data vector yt consists of 3-, 6-, and 12-month DM Eurodeposit rates, and 1-7 year swap rates.
All instruments maturing after January 1, 1999 were excluded, resulting in total elimination of the
6-year swap rates that only became available in 1994. Eurodeposit rates were available over an
extended 1977-1998 interval; swap rates only after June 24, 1991. However, Kalman filtration
methods can cope relatively easily with mismatched data sets and missing data.


The system (A.6) was estimated using various choices of the number K of factors. The first three
identifying restrictions were chosen successively to mimic the level, slope, and curvature term
structure factors advocated by Litterman and Sheinkmann (1988) -- albeit for the short-maturity
Eurodeposit rates for which there was the most data. The fourth factor was chosen to mimic the
slope of the term structure for longer maturities. As discussed above, these restrictions are arbitrary.
Many of the factors exhibited near-unit root behavior. For instance, the single-factor model of the
term structure had a weekly autocorrelation of .99772, reflecting high persistence in German interest
rates. Consequently, a conditional Kalman filtration was estimated that included estimation of the
initial state vector z0 as of December 27, 1976.
                                                                 36

Table A.1 below summarizes the performance of the various models. While adding more factors
continued to be highly significantly statistically up through five factors, out-of-sample forecasts for
the five-factor model were more unstable. Furthermore, there were difficulties in inverting the
information matrix when computing standard errors. Consequently, the 4-factor model was used.

The final forecasts ŷT % n * T ' A % H F n ẑT * T for July 1, 1998 and beyond were computed based
upon the estimated process (A.6) and conditional upon pre-1999 maturity data, up through and
including 3- and 6-month Eurodeposit rates observed on July 1. Standard errors were computed
using the covariance matrix

                             MŷT % n *T                       MŷT %n *T

where Var(2̂) was estimated from the information matrix computed during optimization, and PT *T
was the estimated conditional covariance matrix of the final state variable realization. The first term
captures the impact of parameter uncertainty; the second, the impact of uncertainty regarding the
current state variable. It should be emphasized that the standard errors computed in this fashion
reflect the uncertainty about the current forecast of future data; not the uncertainty about the future
data. The purpose is to compare this forecast with other forecasts constructed using post-’99
maturities.
