American Incomes 1774-1860

                                              ABSTRACT

Building what we call social tables, this paper quantifies the level and inequality of American incomes
from 1774 to 1860. In 1774 the American colonies had average incomes exceeding those of the Mother
Country, even when slave households are included in the aggregate. Between 1774 and 1790, this
income advantage over Britain was lost, due to the severe dislocation caused by the fight for Independence.
Then between 1790 and 1860 US income per capita grew even faster than previous scholars have estimated.
We also find that the South was initially much richer than the North on the eve of Revolution, but
then suffered a severe reversal of fortune, so that by 1840 its white population was already poorer
than free Northerners. In terms of inequality, our estimates suggest that American colonists had much
more equal incomes than did households in England and Wales around 1774. Indeed, New England
and the Middle Colonies appear to have been more egalitarian than anywhere else in the measureable
world. Income inequality rose dramatically between 1774 and 1860, especially in the South.

The paper uses an open-source style, since our data processing is posted on http://gpih.ucdavis.edu
(click on the folder “American incomes 1774-1870”). Detailed defense of the 1774 and 1800 benchmarks
can be found in our previous NBER working paper (17211, July 2011), although the estimates reported
here are revised. The 1860 estimates are completely new.

               I. Growth and Inequality Debates about America’s First Century

        Economic historians need fresh information about American income levels and their
distribution at the end of the colonial era and the dawn of independence in order to understand
growth and evolving social structure over America’s first century. The need for more evidence
becomes apparent whenever we try to cast back from the late colonial period, to project ahead
from the colonial and early federalist years, or to view American incomes in trans-Atlantic
perspective.
        Modern debate over American growth experience before 1840 starts with Paul David’s
classic 1967 article offering what he called controlled conjectures. David (1967, 1996), Robert
Gallman (1992, 1999), Thomas Weiss (1992, 1993a, 1993b, 1994), and others focused their
conjectures on the division of the economy into large output sectors, each with its own labor
force and labor productivity growth. All of these competing estimates have been built up from
the output side in the spirit of Simon Kuznets. This paper offers something quite different,
building up estimates from the income side in the form of what have been called social tables.
Not only does our approach offer fresh new estimates of American incomes at three benchmark
dates – 1774, 1800, and 1860 – but it also allows us to estimate income distribution within
regions and for America as a whole. Until recently, our social tables approach would have been
impossible given a paucity of data on the occupations and the sector mix of the labor force
before 1840. The early censuses did not help much with these, except to give indicators that
should have affected labor force participation, such as sex, race, age, region, and urban/rural.
Accordingly, we have long thought that a new attack on the issue of early American growth
must feature new information on the American labor force by occupation in the form of social
tables. Even though many household heads were simply called artisans, merchants, farmers,
planters, farm hands, or slaves, it helps considerably to know what labor force shares they
represented, where they lived, their average incomes, and how those incomes changed over
time.
        Our interest in American incomes around the time of the Revolution is enhanced by
viewing them from across the Atlantic. Angus Maddison (2007) estimated that it was not until
after the 1870s that the United States caught up with the United Kingdom in real GDP per
capita, though active debate has ensued about the uncertainties of his index numbers.
                                                                                                    4

Maddison’s estimates need to be reconciled with the fact that America attracted a significant net
emigration from the Mother Country and that colonial and republican population growth was
much faster there. In the light of current research on the Great Divergence, on the history of
European incomes, and on the continued use of the Maddison world income estimates, we think
the time is ripe to add data from the American side to compare with the new estimates for
Europe.
       We can now offer new estimates based on more archival data than were available to
earlier researchers. The estimates are offered as an “open-source” presentation of our detailed
data and procedures on the internet, for both negative and positive reasons. The negative reason
is that many scholars might resist accepting some new estimates based on vulnerable primary
data, wishing to offer their own estimates. The positive reason for open sourcing is the
dynamism of the database itself. The information explosion that has offered us new data will
continue to offer additional data to all scholars in the future. Maximizing the disclosure of our
data and procedures accelerates the opportunities for improving the reliability of the estimates.
Hence, our work is inextricably tied to a growing downloadable set of spreadsheet and text files
at http://gpih.ucdavis.edu.
       Our findings confirm some conventional wisdom about American growth and inequality
between 1774 and 1860, yet contradict others, and also introduce some brand new issues. They
certainly offer a much clearer view of colonial American inequality and how the incomes of
different classes compared with those of their counterparts in England. Inequality was much
lower in 1774 and 1800, especially among free whites, than in England. Inequality was also
lower than in the United States today. We find higher colonial incomes in 1774 than have
previous scholars, especially higher in the Southern colonies. Indeed, average incomes in 1774
were higher than those in England and Wales, using either exchange rates or purchasing power
parity guesses. But they may have been lower in 1800. Thus, America gave up its per capita
income leadership to England between 1774 and 1800, as a price paid for independence. Our
estimates raise new questions about what happened between 1774 and 1800, during the
disastrous war years and the costly post-war struggle with confederation, only partially offset by
the 1790s boom. But our findings also suggest that America’s growth rate between 1800 and
1860 was quite a bit faster than has been previously thought. The Old South did not share that
                                                                                                                  5

dynamic experience, however, since its reversal of fortune,1 which had started after 1774,
continued after 1800.


    II. Estimating Three Social Tables for America’s First Century: 1774, 1800, and 1860


A. The 1774 Colonial Evidence


         Our approach starts by counting people by occupations or social classes, and mustering
evidence about their average incomes. That is, we build national income and product accounts
(NIPA) from the income side. This departs from all recent scholarship on early American
growth, which has built its real income series from the production side, and then used price
indexes to report nominal incomes for the price levels of that time. Historians will immediately
recognize our approach as that of building social tables, in the “political arithmetick” tradition
spawned by such Englishmen as Sir William Petty and Gregory King in the 17th century. That
is indeed our approach here, as it has been in other publications of ours.2 In fact, at least two
early American efforts tried to imitate Petty with their own calculations of what their region was
worth – presumably to guess at its ability to pay taxes and fight wars.3
         Fortunately, the archives continue to accumulate early local returns that recorded
people’s occupations, including such social labels as “Esquire” or “widow” in the English
tradition. Reconstructing society from these sources is no easy task, however, and will continue
to be challenging as the primary data accumulate in the future. This challenge requires that the
reader take a tour of our data warehouse in which we counted colonials and determined their
incomes. The tour will be shorter than the longer one offered in our earlier working paper
(Lindert and Williamson 2011: section II)).
         Any social profile of Americans on the eve of the Revolution must start from local
censuses, supplemented by tax lists and occupational directories, and supported indirectly by the
earliest national censuses of 1790 and 1800. Fortunately, the recent electronic revolution has

  One of these imaginative efforts was constructed by colonial Governor James Glen of South Carolina in 1751
(cited in McCusker 2006) and one by Samuel Blodget (1806: p. 99). They appear to have been readers of the
English political arithmeticians, whose writings accelerated with the growing needs to finance wars. On the rise of
the quantification culture in late-18th century England, see Hoppit (1996).
                                                                                                      6

made local enumerations from the late 18th century much more accessible. While all records
before 1790 were local, aggregate regional counts can be developed by assuming that
proportions from one documented locality represents those of other localities in the same region
and with the same population density, urbanization levels, and qualitative attributes.
       Our estimates of early American work status, location, and living arrangement start from
basic population counts themselves, and then add early labor force estimates (themselves
constructed from labor participation rates by age-sex-slave/free cells), before dividing up that
labor force by occupation and by household headship status.
       Population census counts. The few local censuses from the colonial period are now
collated and referenced in the colonial section of Historical Statistics of the United States, both
in the Bicentennial Edition (1976) and in the Millennial Edition (2006). These offer detail by
sex, race, free/slave status, and rough age distributions for seven colonies; we clone the other
six colonies from the seven, matching contiguous colonies.
       Labor force participation rates. Next we derived the numbers of persons in the labor
force for each demographic group defined by place, sex, race, free/slave, and age. The
conventionally defined labor force consists of all persons generating product sold in significant
part (or, for slaves, demanded in significant part) outside the household.
       To convert population into labor force, we use the detailed labor participation rates for
1800 supplied by Thomas Weiss. It seems reasonable to assume that there were no behavioral
changes in the rates defined in the detailed cell-specific Weiss estimates, which give separate
rates for such cell categories as urban Pennsylvania’s free white females age 10-15, or rural
South Carolina’s male slaves over the age of 10, or small town Connecticut’s free white males
aged 16 and older. However, since these categories changed in relative importance over time,
the regional and national labor participation rates could and did change between 1774 and 1800.
       Recorded occupations. Sketching the social make-up of the labor force requires detailed
occupation counts for different localities. We draw on newly accessible counts for years near
1774, though only for a few places, only for parts of the labor force, and only with the help of
some comparison of occupational mixes over time and space.
       Our effort to reconstruct the American social structure on the eve of the Revolution uses
local tax assessment lists and occupational directories. Such lists allow us to create the
following occupational groups for the free population: officials, titled, and professionals; big
                                                                                                   7

city merchants and shopkeepers; small town and rural merchants and shopkeepers; skilled
artisans in manufacturing; skilled in the building trades; farmers (renters, sharecroppers and
owner-operators); male menial laborers; and female menial laborers. Our new data re-shape the
standard view of the colonial occupational structure. For example, relative to Alice Hanson
Jones (1977), our estimates shift a lot of the Middle Colonies’ labor force from middling
farmers to less wealthy craftsmen and laborers, and to males with no stated occupation.
       For the urban South, we use the 1790 directory for Charleston but scaled back to
conform to the estimated total population of Charleston in 1774. One gets the same
occupational patterns by starting with Alice Hanson Jones’s w weights for a sample drawn from
four Southern states. In either case, one must adjust for the over-representation of landowners
and, especially, slaveholders (both absent from their plantations). We adjust the Jones weights,
guided by some very useful local censuses from three North Carolina counties in 1779-1782.
These enumerated all household heads according to whether they held slaves or real estate or
both or neither. We assume that the same adjustment of weights is required in Charleston as in
the rest of the South.
       For the rural South, we carried out the same adjustment away from slaveholders and
landowners, giving instead more weight to ordinary farmers. One could wish for a broader
sampling of the rural South than just the Alice Hanson Jones sampling from four states, plus our
new sampling from the three North Carolina counties. There are other rural Southern county
assessment documents on the internet, but only very few are for dates earlier than 1798, and
none of the lists we have seen record the occupations of the household head.
       Unrecorded occupations. Persons with occupations recorded by tax assessment lists or
urban occupational directories fall short of the persons in the labor force. In most cases the lists
even fail to capture all household heads, the exception being those three counties of rural North
Carolina between 1779 and 1782, which seem to have captured all free household heads.
       Not all members of the 1774 labor force without recorded occupations are equal. Some
lack an occupational label despite assessed wealth. Some lack an occupational label, and are
listed as tax-exempt because they had zero or near-zero wealth. We distinguish three groups
whose occupations aren’t recorded: free males with positive wealth listed but without a
recorded occupation; free females with positive wealth listed but without a recorded occupation;
and free persons listed without a recorded occupation and having zero or near-zero wealth.
                                                                                                    8

       Counting Households. One could avoid measuring household headship if we were
interested only in measuring aggregate national product, since it depends only on who is in the
labor force and their average income. Yet we need the headship rates by occupation to measure
inequality.
       Households are the income recipient units used here to measure income inequality, for
both practical and theoretical reasons. Previous investigators have been forced to confront the
simple fact that taxable property, such as real estate, is used by all household members, even if
only one is the owner and taxpayer. The prevailing practice is to measure income inequality
among households, not among individual income earners. In order to compare apples with
apples, we do the same. That is the practical reason. The theory comes from Simon Kuznets
(1976), who emphasized the superiority of the household focus. Caring about economic
inequality means caring about how unequally people consume resources over their lifetimes.
Even if data constraints force us to study annual inequality rather than life-cycle inequality,
Kuznets argued that annual income per household was a better measure of income distribution
than one using income per earner.
       Since the early population censuses usually did not count households, some assumptions
must be invoked to decide who were household heads and who lived under the same roof with
the head. Fortunately, historians of early America have already grappled with this issue.
Following the leads of Billy Gordon Smith (1981, 1984, 1990) and Lucy Simler (1990, 2007;
Clemens and Simler 1988) in particular, we estimate the number of household heads from
c1774 and c1800 population data from invoking assumptions detailed elsewhere (Lindert and
Williamson 2011: Section II). These assumptions have generated total households by place –
that is, by region and by urban versus rural.
       By subtraction, we derive the number of household heads that are missed by the listed
occupation accounts. The shares of heads omitted are often large when the occupational data
come from the tax lists and the urban directories. The colonial business directories and the tax
lists missed more than 30 percent of all households. Left uncorrected, such counts would
underestimate total income and bias inequality downwards, since many of the unregistered were
poor. Fortunately, the tax lists nearer 1800 seem to have captured something like the full
population, at least according to our samplings from New York State property tax rolls that
                                                                                                  9

began around 1799. The same should have been true of the federal direct tax of 1798, which
required a household enumeration subject to external audit.
       Which groups were most frequently omitted in the colonial era? The literature has
advanced the plausible intuition that the omitted consisted mainly of the tax-excused poor,
whose names could be safely omitted from tax lists or business directories. Yet, there is also
some evidence that many in the middling and rich groups may also have been omitted, or at
least that their wealth was under-assessed. Three questions need to be answered dealing with
those who were in the labor force (LF), according to the censuses and the Weiss estimates of
labor force participation rates, yet who were not reported as household heads (HHs): First, how
many of them were there for each place defined by region and by urban/rural? Second, what
kinds of occupations did they have? Third, whose households did they live in? Guided by the
censuses, we identify the following groups in the labor force who were not household heads:
free white males and females, ages 10-15; free white males and females, ages 16-up, but not
household heads; free black males and females, ages10-15; free black males ages 16-up, minus
free black household heads; free black females ages 16-up; white indentured servants in
Maryland, the only colony that labeled them separately in a census near 1774; and slaves ages
10-up. Some of these contained laborers who were almost surely paid only unskilled wages,
while others were spread over occupations of higher earnings. What we assumed about their
occupational distribution, and thus their incomes, is reported elsewhere (Lindert and
Williamson 2011: Section II).
       For inequality purposes, and following Kuznets, we must also decide in whose
households these non-HH head members of the labor force lived. The data are almost non-
existent on this issue. We make the following assumptions about the non-head earners
“imported” into the households of others: For each region and urban/rural location (e.g. New
England big cities or rural South), the non-heads and their individual earnings are absorbed into
the same region and place. In other words, earners do not engage in long-distance commuting
between regions or between countryside and city. For the free population, we assume that the
average earnings of each non-HH head imported into free families is the same for all free
persons of that occupation in that place. Slave non-heads are taken into slave households only,
leaving household income the same as the retained earnings of all slaves. This same assumption
holds for the separately recorded group of Maryland servants, though the assumption is
                                                                                                        10

redundant here because these are one-person households. These assumptions certainly can be
challenged. We emphasize one point about data sources: For each place defined by region and
by urban/rural, the aggregate imports of non-HH heads are driven by the census, the labor
participation rates, and by the household headship rates. But the allocation of non-HH heads to
households by place is not yet derived from micro-studies about how households shared
earnings, because few such studies exist.
        Labor earnings by occupation, circa 1774. We are able to assign annual incomes to the
most ubiquitous occupations in each location, thanks to the enormous archival gleanings of
Jackson Turner Main’s The Social Structure of Revolutionary America (1965), Stanley
Lebergott’s Manpower in Economic Growth (1964), the work of Carroll Wright (1885), the
BLS (1929), T. M. Adams (1944), Winnifred Rothenberg (1985), several articles of Donald
Adams (1968, 1970, 1982, 1986, 1992), and the contributions of a few others. Their time-
consuming collection of newspaper quotes and account book entries must be used with care.
Some are in the depreciated local colonial currency, whereas others are in (British) pounds
sterling. Fortunately, most sources, and Main in particular, are careful to say which was which.
Finally, we assume that slave and free labor marginal product was the same for all occupations
where they both worked, but, of course, the slave only retained or consumed a fraction of that
marginal product.4
        Some of the earnings are annual, as for white collar professionals and farmers, but many
are monthly, weekly, or daily rates of pay, requiring assumptions about how many days or
months they spent in gainful employment each year. We believe that for those days or months
in which a colonist did not hold his or her main stated job, he or she nonetheless filled in with
other productive work, like weaving and farming at home, and some of this output was traded
on the market. Thus, our “full-time” estimates assume that daily or monthly full-time
equivalent (FTE) workers performed productive work of some kind for 313 days a year
(excluding only Sundays). This assumption implies, of course, that we include more non-market
work in our income estimates than do other scholars that include only or mainly market work in
their output estimates. However, to imitate the labor force behavior that other scholars may have




4The debate over slave maintenance and its share of the market wage is extensive, especially for 1850 and
1860. See “Slave earnings retention 1774 & 1800.doc” at http://gpih.ucdavis.edu.

assumed in estimating early American GDP, and as sensitivity analysis, we also calculate “part-
time” estimates that use fewer labor days per year.5
        We enlarged the concept of labor earnings to include farm operators’ profits, estimated
by Main, plus slaves’ and indentured servants’ retained share of what they earned (discussed
above). As we noted previously, this labor income amalgam we have called “own-labor
incomes”.
        Property income in 1774. Our property income estimates benefit from Alice Hanson
Jones’s exhaustive and masterly study of America’s wealth structure in 1774, based on her 919
probate inventories and supporting documents.6 A key advantage of her data is that they
identify the occupation or social status of most of the people in her colonial sample. We have
examined her data and procedures in great detail, and find no flaws.7 Jones realized that a
probate-based sample ran the risk of overstating average wealth, and understating wealth
inequality, because probate was more likely for the deceased rich than poor. She went to
enormous lengths to adjust for this, ending with what she called w*B estimates that were meant
to capture more of the poor. We have moved in the same direction, using a different procedure.
Our greater weighting of the poorer households was achieved by introducing the new data on

  The shares of the 313-day full year that seem most plausible as a conventional “part time” measure of work
for pay outside the home are:
           1.00 (100% of 313 days) for those households with the head employed in the professions,
           commerce, and skilled manufacturing artisanal jobs, and for slave households;
           0.89 (280 days) for households with the head employed in construction trades, rural unskilled
           workers, and (to understate total annual days a bit) farm-operator households; and
           0.71 (222 days) for households headed by free urban unskilled laborers and zero-wealth household
           heads of unknown occupation.
This “sensitivity analysis” range is certainly wide enough to cover such estimates for England: 1760 and 1771
averaged 278 days; and 1800 280 days (Broadberry et al. 2012, Table 12). For 1774, these part-time
assumptions yield the following ratios of part-time to full-time total incomes (labor plus property):

These ratios imply that our use of “full-time” estimates will not explain away the gap between our income
estimates and those of others for 1774.

  In a set of side experiments, we tried to replicate Jones’s A*-weighted estimates using her own data and her own
procedures. In no case did we achieve exact replication, and for one regional wealth total, we were off by 4
percent. We cannot find the source of this discrepancy, but suspect that she had to take some shortcuts in the pre-
spreadsheet era that we have not understood. Despite the discrepancy, we feel confident of both her estimates and
ours. See the “property incomes 1774” files at http://gpih.ucdavis.edu for the details.

occupational structure described. As it turns out, our estimates imply an even greater probate-
wealth markdown than did her w*B estimates.
         Wealth is not property income or total income. Jones confined her income-measurement
efforts to brief conjectures about wealth-income ratios, using aggregate capital-output ratios
found in the macroeconomics literature of the 1970s.8 We have followed a different route, in
order to exploit the wage data just described. Our reading of the limited evidence on colonial
rates of return suggests that, on average, assets probably earned a net rate of return of about 6
percent per annum.9 Later we will quantify the sensitivity of our aggregate income estimates to
this 6 percent rate of return.
         The gross rate of return, which is more appropriate to the calculation of gross national
product for comparison with other studies, equals this net 6 percent plus rates of depreciation
that differed by asset. Following NIPA accounting standards, we have assumed zero
depreciation on financial assets and real estate (positive depreciation offset by rapid capital
gains), 5 percent for servants and slaves, 10 percent for livestock and business equipment, and
zero for net changes in producers’ perishables and crops.10
         Combining own-labor income and property incomes. Here we reap big returns to having
invested so much effort in gathering occupation data. Since own-labor incomes and property
incomes are both arranged by occupation, we can combine the two to get their total incomes, by
region, by urban/rural, and by socio-economic group.
         Households were practically the whole economy. Our calculations offer what NIPA
accountants call total private income of the household sector. The colonial government sector’s
contribution consisted only of the wages and salaries of government employees and military
personnel (already included in our occupations and own-labor earnings). There were no
government corporations in 1774. Nor do we need to worry about the retained earnings of

  There are only meager data on colonial interest rates, i.e. the net opportunity cost of holding real capital. For
estimates near the 1774 benchmark, see Homer and Sylla (1991, pp. 276-279). Near the 1800 benchmark, federal
government bonds had a market yield of 6.94 percent per annum, while New England municipals yielded 6.13
percent (Homer and Sylla 1991, p. 286). Winifred Rothenberg (1985, p. 790) notes that 6 percent was the “Lawful
Interest” stipulated by colonial law, but that “beginning in 1785, interest rates began to climb to 7, 8, and 9
percent”. In personal communication, Farley Grubb notes late colonial evidence that could argue for either a 5
percent or a 6 percent rate on government borrowing.
10
   The use of a zero rate on changes in producer perishables and crops adheres to a referee’s objection to our initial
assumption that all probated stocks of such perishables were used up in a year, thus adding a 94 percent
depreciation rate to the 6 percent interest forgone. Our initial assumption added slightly to the gross national
income estimates for 1774, though of course it added nothing to the net national income.

private corporations, since there were so few of them by the end of the century. The same
assumptions will be made for 1800. The non-household sector will take a larger share of
national income for 1860, however.


B. The 1798-1800 Early Federalist Evidence


        Our next benchmark for appraising national income is the census year 1800. On the labor-
income side, our procedures for 1800 are roughly the same as those we applied to 1774, though the
data sources are more copious and of higher quality. What is distinctive about the estimates for 1798-
1800 relates not to labor incomes but to property incomes. To fund a possible conflict with France,
Congress passed the first direct tax, a one-off tax levied on real estate wealth and on the numbers of
slaves.11
        The 1798 direct tax returns remain the most useful source available for the property income
side of 1800 national income estimation. True, one might view these returns with some suspicion: Can
we trust the quality of the data extracted by tax collectors from a new nation that had just shed its royal
government partly over tax issues? Such suspicion is indeed warranted, especially given some
evidence that properties had already been under-assessed in tax returns of the previous two decades.12
The 1798 direct tax under-assessed market values by something like 15.5 percent in New England and
the Middle Colonies, a figure based on a contemporary study of marketed real estate in Connecticut in
that same year.13 We have adjusted upwards our 1800 property income estimates for this 15.5 percent
underassessment in New England and the Middle Colonies, and also for the 7 percent rise in average
asset values from 1798 to 1800 suggested by the contemporary Samuel Blodget (1806).
        The South might have under-assessed rich households’ realty, and slaves, by even more than
the North. We have three clues about the degree of underassessment there. Two of these relate to




11
   The best introduction to the quantitative dimensions of the 1798 direct tax returns is still that of Lee Soltow
(1989). For the underlying political history, see Einhorn (2009).
12
   Warned in advance by Gerard Warden’s (1976) investigation of the Massachusetts 1771 tax rolls, we found
implausibly low assessments not only on those rolls but also in the Philadelphia 1772 returns supplied to us by
Billy Gordon Smith and in the 1786 New York City returns supplied to us by Herbert Klein. We found those tax
rolls useful for identifying occupational coverage, including occupations revealed by the presence or absence of
each asset type, but not for the assessed values themselves.
13
   Lee Soltow (1989, pp. 37, 256-257) cites correspondence he found in the Oliver Wolcott papers showing that for
518 Connecticut properties sold in 1798, the average ratio of US-assessed value to market value was 0.845.
                                                                                                             14

slaves and do not affect our income estimates. The third relates to real estate, and it does affect our
income estimates.
        The first clue arises from slave counts. The tax return of 1798 reported only 86,840 slaves of
taxable age 12-50 and 323,905 slaves overall. These numbers are much too low and also imply an
implausibly low working-age share for the slave population (0.268). Indeed, only two years later the
1800 census reported 513,905 slaves aged 10-up and 835,490 slaves overall. Even the 1790 census
reported far more slaves than were revealed in the 1798 tax returns. Fortunately, we were able to
reject the 1798 tax-return slave counts in favor of the 1800 census, combined with the Fogel-
Engerman (1976, updated 2006) sample values for the rental incomes derived by slaveholders.14
        A second clue supporting underassessment in the South lies with the overall tax valuation of
slaves, rather than just their numbers. According to Timothy Pitkin’s (1817) summary of the 1798
returns, slave taxes were only 21 percent of all reported realty plus slave taxes in the South Atlantic,
while in 1774 slave values were 58.1 percent of all slave plus realty value in that region. Either the
market value of slaves relative to the value of real estate dropped spectacularly over the quarter
century, or slaveholders gained a considerable tax break relative to real estate owners. It seems clear
that the fifty-cent tax per slave aged 12-50 years was based on an undercount of those slaves.15
Fortunately, our estimates of slaveholder incomes are based on the market value of slaves rather than
on the tax assessor’s slave values, and our slave counts are based on the 1800 census.
        In contrast with the first two clues, the third underassessment clue does have implications for
our southern property income estimates. The South Atlantic (here excluding Delaware) paid 38.1
percent of the eastern US realty tax in 1798. This share was tied by law to the South Atlantic share of
the free population of the eastern states in 1800 (35 percent). Note that the region’s 38.1 percent tax
share is much lower than the 57.7 percent share of the thirteen colonies’ real estate wealth in the
probate valuations for 1774.
        There are two possible explanations for the discrepancy. The first possibility is that the South
could have under-assessed its 57.7 percent share of the market-based value of all realty in the 13
colonies, reporting only 38.1 percent. This implies that we should mark up greatly South Atlantic real

15
  The ad valorem tax rate as a share of the Fogel-Engerman slave values (1976, updated 2006) resembles the share
of slaves that were reported. This again suggests that the undercount of slaves was the main mechanism for
understatement of Southern taxable wealth. The slave undercount was common to all states in 1798, though over
60% of the 1800-census slaves were reported in Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania, whereas less than 40%
were reported in New Jersey, Kentucky, and Tennessee.
                                                                                                               15

estate values in 1798-1800, from a South/North assessment ratio of 38.1/61.9 = 0.62 to a market ratio
of 57.7/42.3 = 1.36.16 We will call this assessment our upper bound assumption. The second
possibility is that Southern realty was truly worth only 38.1 percent of total market value, implying
that its relative real estate values must have crashed in the Revolutionary war and postwar years. This
assessment will be called our lower bound assumption.
        Neither assumption seems persuasive. The lower bound assumption would disregard the three
clues implying that the South got away with a lower assessment rate. The upper bound assumption
suggests something that would have been spotted by Northern members of Congress, and we would
have read their outcry. Its implication that the South Atlantic suffered relative war and postwar losses
that enormous also strains belief. The true underassessment differential probably lies between these
two extremes. We therefore settle on the middle ground: that is, we assume that the North had the 15.5
percent underassessment of real estate demonstrated in the 1798 Connecticut market study, and that
the South had the same 15.5 percent underassessment plus half of the upper bound extra
underassessment. Thus, the adjustment for the extra Southern underassessment raises real estate plus
slave wealth values by 30.1 percent for the South Atlantic. This combined with the nationwide
underassessment of real estate by 15.5 percent raises real estate plus slave wealth values by 40.4
percent for the South Atlantic, or 27.7 percent for the whole Eastern seaboard.
        Since the 1798 returns covered only real estate and slaves, we had to use the same ratios of
total property/(realty plus slave values) obtained from the 1774 evidence to inflate them to total
property. We apply region-specific ratios to each of the three colonial regions.
        There is one other important difference between the data sources on the property side between
1774 and 1798-1800. The 1798 tax returns are very handy in that they were aggregated for us at the
time. But a serious drawback of the 1798 returns is that it reports no data on occupation. This means
that we cannot document the occupational distribution of total income for 1800, although we can




16
  The algebra of adjustment is as follows. We observe the ratio of total assessed values, South to North (As/An) =
0.381/0.619. Under the upper bound assumption, the regional ratio of true market values (Rs/Rn) = 0.577/0.423.
Within the regions, the relationships of assessed to market value are As = (1-Us) Rs, or An = (1-Un) Rn, where the
U’s are the shares of underassessment. The 1799 market value study suggested that Un = 0.155 in the North.
These values imply that the market value of Southern real estate Rs = 2.6226 times As, so that the underassessment
rate Us = 0.619. (Just by coincidence, this matches the Northern share of assessments.)
         When Tables 1 and 2 introduce estimates of nominal income based on our middle assumption, one can
add $9.547 million to get the result obtainable from the upper bound assumption for 1800, or subtract the same
amount for the lower bound result.
                                                                                                           16

document the distribution of own-labor incomes and property incomes separately, as well as the
aggregate value of total income.


C. The 1860 Income Estimates: IPUMS Meets Wage History


        The procedures for building social tables for each region in 1860 are essentially the same as for
1774. Once we again we have a fairly reliable source of data on wealth. Parallel to Alice Hanson
Jones’s wealth estimates, we now have the IPUMS random (“flat”) sample of households in the 1860
census. Again, we convert the wealth data into property incomes using a rate of return. To the real
estate wealth we applied a net rate of return of five percent, based on interest rates of that era. For
gross rates of return on other assets, we had to reckon the approximate share of “personal estate” that
tended to be slaves versus other productive assets and consumer assets. Drawing on the wealth
portfolio assumptions of Raymond Goldsmith for the US in 1850 and 1880, we came up with a gross
rate of return of 7.8 percent for the South and 7.3 percent for the non-South, the difference explained
by slaveholding, for which we used a depreciation rate of 11 percent.
        Again, as with 1774, we were able to exploit the occupational detail to link property incomes
with own-labor incomes. The occupational weights are given directly in the IPUMS sample. For
1860 we have an even greater abundance of job-specific labor incomes, thanks to a variety of sources
– several authors’ gleanings from the Weeks and Aldrich Reports, Stanley Lebergott’s wage series,
Robert Margo’s rich data on civilian wage rates at Army Posts around the country, and the American
Almanac’s estimates of salaries for a wide variety of professional occupations. Slave retained
earnings were estimated from the Fogel-Engerman slave hire rates for 1858-1860, from free wage
rates, from the literature on the exploitation ratio for slaves, and from the IPUMS sample of slaves by
age, sex, and place. Finally, the pure residual profits of farm households were estimated from Lee
Craig’s sophisticated estimates for the North in 1860. For the South, we adjusted his profit estimates
in proportion to the wage rates of free farm laborers in different regions. For 1860 we continued to
apply our assumptions about the “part-time” work year for certain occupations.17

       The estimates speak to growth and inequality performance at the regional and national levels.
This section summarizes our findings about aggregate income levels and aggregate growth, while
Section IV reports inequality measures for our end-years 1774 and 1860.


A. The Income Level Estimates for 1774
       The aggregate estimates of labor and property incomes shed new light on average income in
1774 and 1800, and the growth of income per capita over a quarter century of war, postwar, and
national emergence. The levels and composition of total personal income are shown in Tables 1-4, for
the three regions used by Alice Hanson Jones and for a geographically fixed “nation”, defined as the
13 colonies in 1774 and the easternmost 15 states plus the District of Columbia in 1800, and adding
states further west for 1860.
       Here we stress two key results. First, the colonial South had an average income far above
those of New England or the Middle Colonies in 1774, even when one rightly counts slaves as
persons. That the South was so much richer in 1774 may not surprise those who have studied the
history of colonial wealth, but even average free labor earnings were higher in the South. (Wages were
not much higher occupation by occupation, but there were fewer unskilled free laborers in the South,
both farm and non-farm.) Second, these new estimates imply that real income per capita dropped
considerably over that quarter century. The 1774-1800 decline of about 20 percent looks almost as
serious in per capita terms as the 1929-1933 drop into the Great Depression. If other authors are
correct in reporting brisk income gains across the 1790s, then the Revolutionary disaster and
Confederation turmoil could have been America’s greatest income slump ever, in percentage terms.
Let us first scrutinize the levels of income at each date, before searching for explanations of the
implied net decline.
       As Table 2 shows, our thirteen-colony estimate of 173.2 million dollars is 26 percent greater
than the average of the Jones and McCusker estimates (137.7 million), assuming a full-time work year
for all occupations, or 19 percent above Jones and McCusker if we assume that certain occupations
worked only part of the year. Yet our colonial income estimates differ greatly from those of Alice
Hanson Jones for only one region. There is little difference for New England, and for the Middle
Colonies we report incomes “only” about 9 percent higher than hers. The main source of the big
difference with Jones arises in the South, for which our income estimate ($98.9 million) is 67 percent
above that of Jones ($59.2 million).
                                                                                                                 18

         For the 13 colonies as a whole, the large gap is not driven by any higher estimate of wealth per
household, since we rely on Alice Hanson Jones’ own work. Supplementing her data with our new
occupation weights, we get a slightly lower net worth per wealth holder than she did. Furthermore,
because we find many fewer households with wealth than her estimated number of “potential wealth
holders”, our aggregate wealth estimate is only about 70 percent of her implied total wealth.18
         An alternative suspicion might be that our income estimates overestimate the net and gross
rates of return on productive wealth. It seems very unlikely that our 6 percent figure for 1774
overstates the net rate of return, the opportunity cost of not having lent at interest. The colonies and the
early republic had a legal usury limit of 6 percent that was vigorously supported by law and custom.19
That is, the usury constraint seems to have checked a strong demand for capital, so that the 6 percent
ceiling might very well have been below market. Could the (illegal, market) rate of interest foregone
by holders of directly productive assets have been higher, say 8 percent? We agree that this is a
distinct possibility, especially for 1800, for which the literature suggests even greater capital scarcity
than for 1774.20 Table 3 shows the impact of assuming 8 rather than 6 percent. Shifting to the higher
rate of return would raise our total income estimates relative to those conjectured by other scholars.
         So much for property income. What about our own-labor income estimates for 1774, supported
as they are by new occupation weights, full-time employment assumptions, and occupation-specific
wage rates? Could these have exaggerated labor income for the 13 colonies as a whole, thus raising
our aggregate income estimates above that of previous scholars?
         What did Jones assume about rates of pay for labor, including the earnings retained by slaves?
In fact, she did not make any assumption at all, but took a single leap of faith that we have already
noted: By picking up some capital/output ratios quoted in the aggregate growth literature from the
1970s, she jumped from her impressive and reliable wealth estimates to less reliable total income
guesswork which stands or falls on her assumed aggregate wealth/income ratio (not necessarily the
same as a capital/output ratio). The macro literature offered Jones capital/output ratios ranging from
2.5 to 10 for the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Within this wide range, she said, “I hazard that

ratios of three or three and a half to one may be reasonable”. Yet we find that the 1774 ratio of net
worth (wealth) to national income was only 1.89.21
         The strikingly wide gap between Southern and Northern incomes in 1774 has a simpler
explanation. In 1774, unlike 1860 and later, the South had a very different mix of free men's
occupations, with a much higher propertied share and fewer poor. On the eve of the Revolution, the
South was still a frontier with high productivity in their exportable tobacco, rice, indigo, and cotton.
We find this contrast between the regional occupation mixes among free household heads in 1774:

Professions, commerce, crafts                         11.0                 32.5                     14.3
No occupation given, some wealth                      16.7                 28.7                     11.0

Southern farmers not only had higher incomes than other farmers on the average, but they constituted
a larger share of households, while low-paying occupations took a lower share among free
Southerners. Therefore, the advantage of the colonial South should not seem surprising, even without
any gap in wage rates for given occupations.


B. The Income Level Estimates for 1800
         Unlike those for 1774, our 1800 total income estimates are not above those offered by other
scholars. Rather, our estimates are in the middle of several competing estimates for the nation as a
whole (Table 2). Our 1800 estimates for the Lower South match those of Mancall, Rosenbloom, and
Weiss (2003), even though we used the income approach and they used the production approach. It
might seem comforting that our 1800 estimates are so close to others. However, ours would have been
a bit higher than most if we had been able to make all the adjustments that we feel are warranted. We
are especially concerned about two such adjustments.
         The first potential adjustment is one already mentioned in connection with Table 5: using the
interest rate on public debt as a measure of the opportunity cost of assets, it appears that the net rate of
return on property was higher in 1800 than in 1774, presumably in response to Revolutionary War and


21
  Jones’s conjectural range was given in her Wealth of a Nation to Be (1980), p. 62. Robert Gallman and Thomas
Weiss have preferred her top wealth-income ratio, 3.5 to one, and that is used in Table 3’s display of her estimates.
Decomposing our aggregate 13-colony wealth-income ratio of 1.89 into regional wealth/income ratios for 1774, we
estimated the ratio at 0.96 for New England, 1.80 for the Middle Colonies, and 2.25 for the South.

Confederation inflation, financial disruption, and perhaps even productivity advance.22 As we have
noted, if the interest rate tended to be 8 percent in 1800 versus 6 percent in 1774, then the 1774-1800
decline in real per capita income would be a bit less, using the “alternative” estimates for 1800 shown
in Table 3.
        The second adjustment relates to an omission from the baseline 1800 estimates. We have no
1800 data documenting farm operators’ pure residual profits, as distinct from their asset returns or the
implicit value of their own physical labor. For 1774, we were able to use a few testimonies unearthed
by Main (1965) to guesstimate that the farm profit residual was 18.9 percent of all farm operators’
income in New England, 21.1 percent in the Middle Atlantic, 34 percent in the South, and 28.8 percent
for the 13 colonies as a whole. We cannot apply these ratios to 1800, however, since we lack any
delineation between farm operators and free farm laborers in the census or in the Weiss labor force
estimates on which we rely.23 Until evidence on this issue emerges, we can only propose our
alternative estimates in Table 3, and note that accordingly the nation still experienced a big net income
decline of 20 percent over the quarter century, though the decline may turn out to be a little less than
our estimates show if we add farmers’ pure profits to the present 1800 estimates.


C. The Income Level Estimates for 1860
        Our income estimate for 1860 is 5,338 million in current dollars, using the part-time
assumption about employees’ work years.24 This is 26.4 percent above Thomas Weiss’s (1993b)
“broad” GDP definition.
        What might account for the large gap between Weiss (and Gallman) and ourselves? One
possibility points to price deflators. Recall that we estimate current-price, or nominal, incomes.
Other scholars, like Weiss (1992, 1993b), build up their estimates from the production side,
using their production indices to project their constant 1840 price estimates from the
Gallman 1840 base year. To compare the LW and the Weiss 1860 estimates, either the LW

22
   See Homer and Sylla (1991, pp. 274-296).
23
   Lucy Simler’s detailed study of Chester County, Pennsylvania found that farm operators’ families supplied 60
percent of farm labor in 1799, with the rest being hired farm labor. For 1774, she implied 67 percent (Simler 1990,
p. 197, Table 3). The only alternative to extrapolating from Chester County to the whole nation is to assume that
the 1860 shares (Atack and Bateman 1987, pp. 43-44) applied to 1800. We are exploring this option so as to
estimate farmers’ pure profits in 1800.
24 The FTE estimate, assuming everybody in the labor force worked 313 days a year, would be $5,712 million. Yet

we would not apply such an FTE assumption to the economy of 1860, even though we feel it could be valid
for 1774 or 1800, because there is evidence that non-market home production had dropped across the antebellum
years.
                                                                                               21


estimates need to be deflated or the Weiss estimates need to be inflated. In either case, we
need good price deflators, something the authors have not yet produced on their own.
          Getting the price deflator right may be crucial to reconciling with others our direct
estimates of nominal income or product and growth of real GDP they imply. We continue
to investigate this, challenged by our inability to learn the details of others’ layering of
index-number calculations of real outputs and price deflators for GDP as a whole. It is
entirely possible that deriving a correct detailed set of prices would make other scholars’
estimates of real incomes match our estimates of nominal incomes.

D. Long-Run Growth Implications 1774-1860
          Our estimates imply that between 1774 and 1800 America suffered a serious net decline in
income. We need to conduct some reality checks on these results, both in terms of their longer-run
growth implications and in terms of their implications about the turbulence within that quarter century
itself.
          We are more confident in using our income estimates to assess America’s growth performance
up to 1840. Table 4 supplies our real per capita income growth estimates for each of the three regions,
and for the three combined (the “nation” consisting of the thirteen original colonies), all the way from
1774 to 1860. For the entire period 1774-1860 real per capita incomes in the three-region “nation”
grew 0.80 percent per annum. Over these 86 years, the South Atlantic fell behind: The per annum
growth rates for New England, 1.26 percent, and the Middle Atlantic, 1.08 percent, were well above
the South’s 0.31 percent.
          Our implied growth rates may be compatible with those of other scholars for the 1800-1860
period on which they concentrated their attention. At face value, the upper part of Table 5 seems to
show that we find higher growth, at 1.53 percent a year, over this period. Yet our growth rates for
1800-1860 will be reduced as soon as we are able to make two adjustments. The first adjustment,
already considered in Table 3, would be to raise our assumed rate of return for the highly uncertain
time around 1800, thus raising property income and total income for that starting point. The second,
discussed but not yet quantified, would be to make a rough guess at the missing pure farm profits form
that 1800 starting year, again reducing our implied growth rate for 1800-1860. Once these
adjustments are made, we suspect that the main question about our income-side estimates of nominal
                                                                                               22

national product will center more on their higher levels everywhere during the 1774-1860 era, and less
on any remaining difference in implied growth rates.
       In international perspective, the income per capita in our eastern-seaboard “original thirteen”
region grew after 1800 at a rate that compared well with European growth rates for 1820-1860. So say
the comparisons in the lower part of Table 5 (though including farmers’ residual profits in 1800 would
have lowered our 1800-1860 growth rates a bit). Yet over the longer 1774-1860 period that included
the Revolutionary War our overall growth rate was slower than in Western Europe. With the help of
Table 4’s greater detail, we can identify two events that suppressed American growth in the late
eighteen century: The macro shock of the War of Independence itself, and the start of a Southern
“reversal of fortune”.


E. Revolutionary Shocks: War Damage, Diverted Trade and the Crisis at the Top
       What stands out in the longer run perspective is the economic turbulence between our two
benchmark years 1774 and 1800, first with the war years themselves and then with the troubled
Confederation in the 1780s. The last quarter of the eighteenth century found the economy on a rickety
swinging bridge, a metaphor that also describes scholarly attempts to span that gap with numbers from
what has been called a statistical dark age. Like late eighteenth century France, early nineteenth
century Latin America, early twentieth century Russia, and Africa after World War II, scholars of the
early United States have had great difficulty bridging the data gap across their revolutionary upheaval
and early nation-building. On the one hand, Thomas Berry (1968, 1988), Louis Johnston and Samuel
Williamson (2010), Richard Sylla (2011) and others have emphasized the strong growth experienced
across the 1790s, perhaps due to the wisdom of Alexander Hamilton and other founding fathers and/or
due to the recovery of foreign markets. Yet, the more we come to accept their sanguine view of the
1790s, the more we must infer a true economic disaster between 1774 and 1790.
       Any study attempting to measure incomes for 1774 and 1800 alone cannot quantify the depth
of any economic depression in between. Yet, we can help guide the search for the magnitude of the
Revolutionary war and post-war depression by posing a question: How deep would the per-capita
income loss have been from 1774 to 1790 if the scholars cited above are right about the growth from
1790 to 1800, and our estimates of the net decline from 1774 to 1800 are also right? This question has
eight numerical conjectures, based on our two estimates for 1800 (“baseline” and “alternative”) times
the four leading series documenting real income per capita growth from 1790 to 1800. The four series
                                                                                                                  23

are those by Richard Sutch, Louis Johnston and Samuel Williamson, Thomas Berry, and John
McCusker.25 All eight conjectures imply significant drops in income per capita between 1774 and
1790. Between these two years GDP per capita might have dropped 18 percent, based on Sutch and
our alternative estimate for 1800. The largest estimated drop is 30 percent, based on Berry’s series and
our baseline estimate. The estimates seem to agree with John McCusker and Russell Menard that the
“Colonists paid a high cost for their freedom”, with Allan Kulikoff that the drop in incomes was
“equal to the early years of the Great Depression”, and with their consensus that recovery was
painfully slow.26
         What could have caused such sustained income losses? There is good prima facie evidence that
three related negative shocks could have been large enough to cause the deep depression between 1774
and 1790. The first was the economic destruction of the war itself, as well as the impact of nearly two
decades of hyperinflation and a dysfunctional financial system. The second negative shock consisted
of the disruptions of overseas trade during the Revolution and, after 1793, the Napoleonic Wars.27 The
shock was concentrated in the South. Available price and trade data show that the colonies, especially
in the Lower South, suffered heavy volume and value losses in trade and shipping as the war
deepened, and that they recovered only slowly and partially across the 1780s. In real per capita terms,
New England’s commodity exports rose by a trivial 1.2 percent between 1768/72 and 1791/92, rose by
a modest 9.9 percent in the Middle Atlantic, but fell by a spectacular 39.1 percent in the Upper South,
and by an even bigger 49.7 percent in the Lower South (Mancall et al. 2003 estimate an even larger 67
percent), yielding a decline of 24.4 percent for the thirteen colonies as a whole.28 The most painful of
these shocks was the loss of well over half of all trade with England between 1771 and 1791. In
addition, America lost Imperial bounties like those on the South’s indigo and naval stores, as well as
New England’s reversal from colonial bounties to prohibitive duties on its whale oil exports.
         While these negative demand shocks to American commodity exports were very large,
especially for the Lower South, the initial share of exports in regional income was only about 6-7
percent in the early 1770s, according to the Shepherd-Walton export values per capita in 1768-1772

McCusker (2000).

   See McCusker and Menard (1985, p. 374) and Kulikoff (2005, p. 27).
27
   As Shepherd and Walton (1976) have noted, the loss of trade in the 1780s was domestic as well as overseas,
because the loose Confederation that preceded federal union briefly allowed the new states to tax interstate trade.
We concentrate here, however, on the larger and longer shocks to trade with Britain and its possessions.

estimate for the Lower South refers to the twenty years 1770-1790.
                                                                                                                  24

and our 1774 income estimates for the three main regions. Thus, it is hard to imagine that the huge
depression of 1774-1790 was entirely “export-led”: A 24-percent trade fall times a 6-7 percent share of
income equals no more than a 2 percent fall in income colony-wide. The numbers are bigger for the
South, where exports fell by perhaps 45 percent and the trade share was 7.1 percent, implying an
income loss of more than 3 percent. These calculations only deal with foreign trade losses; the trade
losses would be considerably higher if they included the decline in inter-colonial and subsequent inter-
state trade between 1774 and 1790. Finally, these negative trade shocks created a move back to
subsistence farming, and presumably lower agricultural productivity.
         The third major negative shock involved what we call a crisis at the top, and it was felt
primarily in the coastal cities and smaller river towns. This shock was related to the trade losses, but
transcended them and could have caused much greater income losses. America’s urban centers were
severely damaged by British naval attacks, blockades, occupation, and by the eventual departure of
skilled and well-connected loyalists, especially from New York, Charleston, and Savanna. In Richard
Hildreth’s summary, “one large portion of the wealthy men of colonial times had been expatriated, and
another part impoverished”.29
         The damage to urban economic activity was considerable, and potentially enough to bring
great declines to per capita incomes, even though population kept growing. To identify the extent of
the urban damage, one could start by noting that the combined share of Boston, New York City,
Philadelphia, and Charleston in a growing national population shrank hugely from 5.1 percent in
1774 to 2.7 percent in 1790, recovering only partially to 3.4 percent in 1800. To the extent that
urbanization is a close correlate of levels of economic development, this big fall in the American city
population share certainly confirms what our income estimates document. There is even stronger
evidence confirming an urban crisis: the share of the mainly-urban white collar employment fell from
12.7 percent in 1774 to 8 percent in 1800; the ratio of earnings per free worker in urban jobs relative to
that of total free workers dropped from 3.4 to 1.5; and the ratio of white collar earnings per worker to
that of total free workers fell even more, from 5.2 to 1.7. This evidence offers strong support for an


29
   Hildreth’s summary (1849, vol. III, pp. 465-466) is cited by McCusker and Menard (1985, p. 365).
          An estimated 60,000 free persons (3.1 percent of the free population) and 15,000 slaves (3.6 percent of the
slave population) had left as of the early 1790s (Jasanoff 2011, pp. 351-358). The losses to the American economy
were presumably much greater than the losses that the departing loyalists experienced themselves. A high estimate
of loyalist claims presented to His Majesty for losses in American rebellion came to $1,053,024 at the $4.44
exchange rate, or about 0.6% of the 1774 income of the 13 colonies (Eardley-Wilmot 1815, reprinted 1972,
Appendix VIII). Of course, this ignores the human capital that the new republic lost.
                                                                                                           25

urban crisis, and it also supports the view that America had not yet recovered from the Revolutionary
economic disaster even by 1800.


F. Southern Reversal of Fortune
        The absolute decline of South Atlantic per capita income over the last quarter of the 18th
century and its relative decline over the next four decades stand out as a classic example of what has
come to be called reversal of fortune (Acemoglu et al. 2002). Table 4 underlines the change.
According to Richard Easterlin (1960, 1961), the South Atlantic was well behind the Northeast and the
national average by 1840, while it was well ahead of all other regions in 1774. The “Southern reversal
of fortunes” draws support from the apparent absence of any large army of poor whites in the colonial
South. We note again that what few local colonial censuses and tax records we do have reveal that
nearly all white households around 1774 were assessed as having positive wealth. The familiar image
of the South as a repository for much of the nation’s poor whites was apparently a later development.
        Why the reversal of fortune for the South? A benign part of the story seems to have been that
the colonial South Atlantic was still a labor-scarce frontier with high returns to export crops. Its
decline after 1774 was echoed in two other cases of relative frontier decline: the relative decline of the
West South Central region 1840-1860 (again see Table 4), and the loss of the Pacific region’s super-
incomes after 1870. Still, the Southern reversal had multiple causes, and we do not yet know what
weights to attach to the decline of frontier super-returns, the exceptionally severe damage incurred in
the Revolutionary War, or some deeper institutional failure.


                                    IV. Income Inequality, 1774 - 1860


        While social tables are not an inherently superior way to estimate aggregate national product,
they have the clear advantage of being able to reveal the inequality of income in historical settings
where occupational labels and class rewards conveyed a great deal of income information. Thanks to
the social tables, we can now compare American income inequalities on the eve of the Revolution and
on the eve of the Civil War, whereas earlier scholarship could only draw on sketches of wealth
inequality and some scattered wage ratios.30


30For the vast 1960s-1970s literature on early wealth inequality, see Williamson and Lindert (1980). For
the wage ratios, see the same source and the important update by Robert Margo (1990).
                                                                                                 26

       Incomes were much more equally distributed in colonial America than in America today, or in
other countries in the late eighteenth century. Among all American households, slaves included, Table
6 reports that the richest 1 percent had 7.1 percent of total income, and the Gini coefficient was 0.437.
Without the slaves, the top 1 percent of free households had 6.1 percent of total incomes, and the Gini
was 0.400. Compare colonial American inequality with that of the United States today, where almost
20 percent of total income accrues to the top 1 percent, and where the Gini coefficient is almost 0.50
(Atkinson, Piketty, and Saez 2011: Table 5, p. 31). The image of an egalitarian colonial America
emerges even more clearly at the regional level, in colonial New England (Gini 0.354), in the Middle
Atlantic (Gini 0.381), and, surprisingly, among free Southerners (Gini 0.328). That is, within any
American colonial region, free citizens had more equal incomes than the thirteen colonies as a whole,
the reason being that wide income gap between the Southern region and the rest.
       Free American colonists also had much more equal incomes than did west Europeans at that
time. The average Gini for the four northwest European observations reported in Table 6 is 0.57,
versus that American colonial Gini of 0.437. Indeed, there was no documented place on the planet that
had a more egalitarian distribution in the late 18th century (Milanovic et al. 2011). For those who feel
that a large and strong middle class is essential for establishing institutions friendly to modern
economic growth, note that the middle of the distribution (Next 40%) received 41.6% of American
incomes in 1774, but only 27.8% in 1802 England and Wales, or 24.4% averaged over the four
European observations in Table 6. And note that the loudest revolutionary noise came from New
England, where the middle got 52.5 percent of total New England incomes.
       If people had far more equal incomes in America than elsewhere, which kinds of colonists
were better off than their counterparts in Europe? Figure 1 offers a striking answer, using an Anglo-
American comparison. On the horizontal axis each society is ranked from its poorest to its richest, and
on the vertical axis their average group incomes are displayed on a log scale. It appears that an
American colonist of any percentile rank had a higher income than his or her English counterpart of
the same rank until we reach the top one percent. Indeed, it turns out that even American slaves were
above the bottom of the Anglo-American income ladder, although such comparisons fail to account for
the loss of freedom, longer hours worked, and harsher working conditions. Yet, the top incomes so
dominated in England-Wales that its national product per capita was still close to that of America. Of
course, average English incomes are likely to have matched or surpassed the American average after
our economic disaster of 1775-1790.
                                                                                                              27

        What about the impact of relative purchasing power on such income comparisons? As is
widely recognized, simple exchange rate conversion does not adequately account for cost of living
differences between classes and places. This familiar point has a number of important applications in
the colonial American context, and they deserve emphasis and further investigation. One is that the
cost of a standard consumption bundle probably was lower in New England than it was either in the
Southern colonies or in England and Wales. So say some recent calculations for this era. If true, then
these nominal income contrasts might be somewhat misleading. Perhaps New England -- with cheap
fish, corn, beans, rum and molasses -- was not so much poorer than the Southern colonies as the
nominal figures in Table 5 imply. This might also have been true of the Middle Colonies with its
cheap grains, exported to England and the West Indies where they were expensive (Mancall et al.
2008b). In any case, such adjustments should also deal with the relative cost and quality of housing
(Shammas 2007). Perhaps New Englanders weren’t so much worse off relative to Southerners as our
figures suggest, and perhaps workers in the Middle Atlantic were even better off compared with
English workers than our figures suggest. In contrast, an upper-class cost of living bundle, including
the cost of music, theater, and servants, must have been lower in London than in the Northern
colonies. These “real inequality” dimensions need to be explored further, but we do not expect them to
overturn the inequality contrasts shown here.31
        The 1860 distribution of income for the US, for the original 13 colonies, and for each census
region is reported in Table 7, which can be compared with the 1774 results in Table 6. The main
finding is clear enough: American inequality rose everywhere over this 86-year span of history -- in
every region, among free households alone, and among slave and free combined. Furthermore, the rise
was steep. For the eastern seaboard, the “original thirteen”, the Gini rose from 0.40 (Table 6) to 0.53
(Table 7), and the share of income going to the top one percent of households rose from 7.1 to 10.0.
While income gaps widened in all parts of the eastern seaboard, the widening was most pronounced in
the South. Among slave and free household combined, the South Atlantic Gini rose from 0.46 in 1774
.60 in 1860 -- a figure much the same for the ESC (.58) and WSC (.60), and a level of inequality hard
to find anywhere in Europe or the rest of the world (Milanovic et al. 2011). Especially notable about
the South Atlantic was the enormous increase in income inequality among free households, where the

more general subtlety about class- and place-specific costs of living, see Williamson (1977) and Hoffman et al.
(2002). England’s lower interest rates may also have implied a lower user cost of capital than in the colonies.
                                                                                                28

Gini rose from .33 to .51. The top-one-percent share of income increased from 6.3 to 10.1 percent
among free households in the South Atlantic, while the share going to the poorest 40 percent fell from
21.9 to 11.3 percent. Any historian looking for the rise of a poor white underclass in the Old South
will find it in this evidence.

                                      V. Summary and Agenda

        The only way to push back the quantitative frontiers of inequality, living standards, and growth
history is to adapt to the archival environments of the deep past, just as archeologists have done. Even
reaching back to the late 18th century requires the use of an eclectic array of incomplete evidence. One
of the most underexploited bodies of evidence for the early modern era consists of social and
occupational class counts allowing us to construct aggregate incomes and their distribution. Working
on that frontier, we have emerged with a rich harvest of provisional measures sketching early
American growth and inequality.
        It appears that the colonists had far higher incomes in 1774 than previously thought, on
average probably greater than England, the richest country in Europe. Between 1774 and 1800
American incomes declined in real per capita terms, so that any rapid growth after 1790 failed to make
up for a very steep wartime decline and the “lost decade” of early independence. The quarter-century
decline was sufficiently big that America lost its lead to England in the income per capita rankings. In
addition, we find that free American colonists had much more equal incomes than did households in
England (and elsewhere in Europe). The colonists also had greater purchasing power than did their
English counterparts over all of the income ranks except at the top one percent.
        There is abundant evidence confirming reversal of fortunes for the original southern colonies, a
region that became the South Atlantic in census terms. Our results suggest that Southern per capita
incomes were far above that of New England and the Middle Colonies in 1774, and that poor whites
were much less common there than in other colonies. It appears that the colonial South lacked the
large numbers of poor free labor that could be counted in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and lesser
coastal and river towns in the north. In short, our results suggest that mass poverty did not spread
among the Southern white population until the early 19th century. In any case, the Old South had lost
almost all of its lead in average income by 1800. Why did the Old South (to become the South
Atlantic) undergo such a spectacular reversal of fortune between 1774 and 1800? Not only do we need
                                                                                                              29

to answer that question, but we also need to know more about the distribution of incomes in late
colonial and early national South, research of the sort already accumulated for Chesapeake. 32
        We need more work to reinforce the credibility of the estimates offered here. While we have
certainly found strong support for a steep rise in inequality over America’s first century, we do not yet
know when it happened. Future research needs to supply an inequality estimate for 1800. Only then
will we be able to separate out the role of early industrialization (1800-1860) from the turbulent first
quarter century (1774-1800). Adding an estimate of farm profits for 1800 – currently missing -- would
certainly lower our estimated 1.53 percent per annum growth rate in per capita income 1800-1860.
And new GDP deflators must be fashioned to replace the traditional ones. Finally, we are now
working on a 1870 social table, and hope that we can soon sketch the income effects of the Civil War
decade.

Notes to Table 1:
       The estimates exclude Native Americans.
       The 1800 estimates currently lack any estimate of farm operators' residual incomes
beyond the implicit value of their farm labor and their property incomes (see text).
       The gross property incomes for 1800 are based on middling assumptions about Southern
underassessment in 1798 (see text).
       The baseline estimates use the full-time assumptions of 313 days per labor year, in
occupations where the primary earnings data are sub-annual (e.g. daily or monthly wage rates).
The part-time assumptions retain the explicitly annual income estimates for titled and
                                                                                             31

professionals, for commercial proprietors, for manufacturing trades, servants, slaves, and
household heads of unstated occupations having positive wealth. Part-time work years for
explicit pay are assumed to have been only 280 days for construction workers, farm operators,
and the rural unskilled. For urban unskilled and for household heads with zero wealth and
unstated occupations, we assumed a work year of only 222 days.
        Delaware is here included with the Middle Colonies for both years, following Alice
Hanson Jones’s sample design.

Notes to Table 4:
(1) The italicized product estimate for the whole United States in 1840 is Thomas Weiss’s
(1993) “broad” measure. For the 1840 italicized regions, the Weiss total was multiplied by
regional relative products per capita implied by Richard Easterlin’s (1960, Table A1, variant A)
estimates. All other national “products” are our own “part-time” estimates of national
personal income. As noted in the text, we use the “part-time” estimates to make our concept
conform to the more conventional estimates, even though we believe that for 1774 and 1800
the conventional estimates make too little imputation for non-market home production.
(2) For 1800 we here used our “baseline” estimate, not the higher alternative estimate using
an 8 percent rate of return.
(3) The price deflator for 1800-1860 is that of Thomas Weiss (1993, Table 4). For 1774-1800
we spliced the David-Solar (1977) series onto the Weiss series at 1800. Using 1840 = 100, the
resulting price index is 81 for 1774, 126 for 1800, and 106 for 1860.

(4) The South Atlantic includes Delaware and Florida for 1840 and 1860, but not for 1774 or
1800.
(5) The “Original thirteen” refers to the territory of the original thirteen colonies in 1774 and
1800, even though the same territory had become fifteen states plus DC by 1800.
(6) The growth rate of 0.74 percent a year for the whole USA, 1774-1860, incorporates the
expansion from the thirteen colonies in 1774 to the whole USA in 1860.

Notes to Table 6 and Figure 1: The inequality results in Table 6 are based on the full-time
(FTE) measures of incomes at 313 days per year. Inequality would have been raised only
slightly by using the part-time work year assumptions described above. For example,
using the part-time work years would yield a 13-colony gini coefficient of 0.440 for all
households, or 0.408 for free households. Figure 1 is based on the part-time work years,
for better comparability with English and Dutch inequality.
