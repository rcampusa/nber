              AN EXPLANATION OF THE BEHAVIOR OF PERSONAL SAVINGS
                     IN THE UNITED STATES IN RECENT YEARS



                                   ABSTRACT


     A sharp increase in the real interest rates in the U.S. in the l98Os was
expected to induce a higher personal saving rate. Actually, between 1981 and
1983 the personal saving rate fell from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent and for the
1985-1988 period it had averaged only 4 percent even though real interest rates
have remained high. We argue that one possible explanation for this negative
relation between interest rates and the personal saving rate is the large
fraction of wealth, especially financial wealth, held by persons over 65 years
old (this group has received more than 50 percent of all interest income in the
U.S. during this period). Life cycle theory suggests, as we demonstrate, that
the wealth effect created by an increase in the rate of interest reduces the
savings of old persons and raises savings of the young and hence the effect on
aggregate savings depends on the age distribution in the population.

1. Introduction

    One of the puzzles in U.S. economic policy in the l98Os has been the

behavior of the personal saving rate, that is of the share of after—tax

personal income that individuals choose not to consume. When the Reagan

Administration introduced a far—reaching and dramatic change in economic

policy in 1981, which led to a sharp fall in the inflation rate and an equally

sharp increase in real interest rates, it had been generally anticipated that

those changes would induce individuals to increase their saving rate by

substantial amounts. Some observers had in fact predicted that the increase

in the rate of personal saving would be as high as 3 percentage points.

Actually, the expected increase in the impersonal saving rate did not occur.

On the contrary, between 1981 and 1983 the personal saving rate fell

substantially (from 7.5 percent to 5.4 percent, respectively). Furthermore,

the personal saving rate continued to fall and for the 1985—88 period it has

averaged only about 4 percent even though real interest rates have remained

high.

        In this paper we argue that one possible explanation for this negative

relation between interest rates and the personal saving rate is the large

fraction of wealth, and especially of financial wealth, held by persons over

65 years old. Economic theory suggests that while an increase in the rate of

interest raises the savings of young, working persons, it typically reduces

the savings of older and retired persons. It seems plausible that for the

U.S. the latter effect could be a major explanation for the observed decrease

in aggregate savings.

        The relationship between saving and the rate of interest is one of the

most important in economics. It is, for example, fundamental to the analysis
                                       2


role in the determination of saving in the classical, system, that role was

downgraded to a definitely secondary one by the Keynesian revolution. In

fact, in may textbook versions of the consumption function, the rate of

interest did not even appear as a determinant of consumption. The recent

popularity of so—called supply side economics has made the rate of interest

important once more, and many of the policy decisions introduced in recent

years in the United States and elsewhere have definitely been influenced by

the belief that a change in the rate of interest can have significant effects

on the propensity to save of individuals. However, in spite of the repeated

statements made in recent years, that an increase in the real after—tax rate

of return to saving would increase the rate of saving in the economy, the

relationship between the rate of saving and the rate of return is not as

straightforward as those statements imply. The usual assumption is that when

the rate of return increases, there will be a tendency for people to save more

as present consumption becomes more expensive than future consumption. This

is the well—known substitution effect. On the other hand, it is generally

recognized that a working individual may have some target amount of wealth

 that he wishes to accumulate by the time he retires, so that he can support

his desired level of consumption through his retirement years. An increase in

 the rate of return to saving Out of current income implies that that target

 can be achieved with a lower current rate of saving. Therefore, the

 individual may react to the increase in the rate of return by saving less.

 Theory tells us that a priori one cannot tell whether the substitution effect

 or the target effect will prevail. Empirical studies have done no better)'

      There is one important element in these discussions that has generally

 been ignored. The theoretical discussions have implicitly emphasized the
                                       3

behavior of individuals in the preretirement age and the rate of return to

"saving" rather than to "savings". However, an increase in the rate of return

affects not just the return to current saving (that is, saving out of current

income) but it affects also the return to all stock of existing financial

wealth. In other words, it affects the return to the past accumulated savings

held in interest—bearing forms.

     There is considerable evidence that a large share of this financial

wealth is in the hands of older, retired individuals who, as the life—cycle

theory of consumer behavior tells us, have a much higher propensity to consume

out of additional income than younger individuals in their active age. In

fact, this theory tells us that the older is an individual the higher will be

his/her propensity to consume, ceteris paribus. A change in the real rate of

 return to financial assets will disproportionately increase the income of

 those very people who are likely to spend more. Once this consideration is

 taken into account, it becomes obvious that the relative strength of the

 income and the substitution effect depends on the age distribution of the

 population as well as on the distribution of financial assets by age group.2

      About 11 percent of the U.S. population is in the 65 and over age bracket

 with an average age of around 74 years. These are individuals who have an

 average life expectancy of somewhere around 10 years and who can be expected

 to have a very high marginal propensity to consume. Therefore, an increase in

 interest rates that resulted in higher incomes to those older individuals

 could substantially increase their consumption, which in turn could easily

 neutralize or even overwhelm whatever increase in saving might come from those

 in the preretirement age.

neutralize or even overwhelm whatever increase in saving might come from those

in the preretiremeflt age.

     In SectiOn 2 we provide the evidence of the decrease in savings in the

U.S. during the 1981—1988 period. Section 3 evaluates the role of wealth and

income held by the elderly. Section 4 presents a simple ].ifecycle model that

exhibits the opposite effects that an increase in the rate of interest has on

young and old persons. Assuming a steady population growth rate, some

calculations demonstrate the possibility of a negative response of aggregate

savings to an increase in the real rate of interest. The detailed model and

some comparative statistics are given in the Appendix.



2.   The Savings Rate in the 1981—1988 Period

      In 1981 the Reagan administration introduced some major policy changes

that were expected to increase aggregate savings. The elements that would

induce the higher saving rate were several: first, there were the substantial

cuts in marginal tax rates for all taxpayers brought about by the 1981 Kemp—

Roth tax—cut legislation; these cuts would be spread over a three—year period.

Second, there was the immediate reduction in the marginal tax rate on unearned

incomes from 70 to 50 percent. Third, there were the additional savings

incentives (IRAs, etc.) also introduced by the 1981 tax package. All of these

guaranteed that the rewards to saving would increase for any given real rate

of interest. However, these rewards were raised even more dramatically when

the sharp fall in the inflation rate was accompanied by an equally sharp

increase in real interest rates. For a variety of reasons on which economists

are not in complete agreement (energy crisis, Mundell—Tobin effect, OPEC

 surpluses, etc.), the generally increasing inflation rate from the early to
                                       5


a reversal of this behavior had taken place and real rates became sharply

positive. Furthermore, the fiscal deficit also increased sharply after 1981.

According to the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis, as reformulated by Barro,

private saving should also have risen because of this.

     Did this unusually propitious combination of circumstances lead, as

expected, to a sharply rising personal saving rate? The measurement of the

saving rate is fraught with difficulties; however, the official statistics

prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce and reported in Table 1 indicate

that the expected increase in the saving rate did not occur. On the contrary,

the share of personal saving in disposable (i.e., after—tax) personal income

fell from 7.5 percent in 1981 to as low as 3.2 percent in 1987 which was the

lowest saving rate for the whole 1970—88 period shown in the table. The

saving rates in the table are shown also in Figure 1.

     A slightly different picture is obtained if one adds undistributed

corporate profits to personal saving (see Table 1 and Figure 1). A

justification for doing this would be that individuals do not distinguish

between their own saving and that of the enterprises in which they own shares.

As a consequence, saving by the latter, in the form of undistributed corporate

 profits, replaces the individuals' own saving. Net private saving is the

 summation of personal saving and undistributed corporate profits. The last

 column of Table 1 gives net private saving as a percentage of disposable

 personal income. The yearly data show that net private saving as a share of

 disposable income was around 11 percent in the 1976—78 period. It fell

 afterward and it was relatively low for the 1982—83 period. It increased

 again to almost 10 percent in 1984 but it fell to around 6 percent by   1987—88.

 Thus, the basic conclusion that one gets from the available official
                                        6

statistics is that the saving rate fell in the post—1981 period in spite of

the sharp increase in the real rate of return. This is not what one would

have expected from economic theory. Thus, the behavior of the saving rate

constitutes a puzzle.



3.   Income and Wealth of the Elderly

     What do we know about the financial assets of older individuals relative

to the rest of the population? Not as much as we would like but what we do

know clearly supports the contention that this group shares disproportionately

in any benefits associated with increasing rates of returns to financial

assets. For example, it will certainly come as a surprise to many that in

1985, the latest year for which this information is available, taxpayers aged

65 and over received almost 53 percent of all interest income reported to the

Internal Revenue Service (see Table 2 below) and close to a third of all the

capital gains reported to the IRS. Furthermore, the 1977 Wealth Survey by the

 Federal Reserve System shows the predominance of this group in holding

 financial assets. For example, in that year a far higher proportion of

 individuals 65 years and over than any other age group owned more than $10,000

 in certificates of deposits, more than $25,000 in liquid asset holdings, and

 more than $25,000 in savings accounts. The Survey of Consumer Finance of 1983

 reported in the Federal Reserve Bulletin of September 1984 shows that mean

 liquid asset holdings were $30,666 for families headed by persons between 65

 and 74 years of age and $26,481 for those headed by persons aged 75 and older,

 compared with an average for all families of only $14,695. Alternatively,

 median liquid asset holdings were $9,676 for families headed by persons aged

 65—74 and $7,885 for families headed by persons aged 75 and older, but only
                                       7


$2,850 for all families combined. If instead of liquid assets we take total

financial assets, the differences are even greater. Finally, the Consumer

ExDendtture Survey Series for 1972—73 published in 1977 by the U.S. Department

of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics reports (Table 5) sources of income

classified by age of family head. These figures are also very interesting.

"Incomes from interest, dividends, estates and trusts" rose from less than

$200 for individuals less than 44 years of age, to $340 for individuals

between 45 and 54, to $702 for individuals between 55 and 64 and to $933 for

individuals over 65.

     Figure 2 shows interest income received by individuals 65 and over as a

share of total personal saving for various years. That chart shows a strong

upward trend in this share and gives a hint of how easily an increase in

interest rate that resulted in higher incomes, and thus in higher consumption

for these older individuals, could reduce the rate of saving.

     Let us summarize the empirical evidence presented above. Between 1980

and 1981 the real rate of interest on both 3—month Treasury bills and 20—year

Treasury bonds rose by about 6 percentage points. This increase was the

result of a sharp fall in the inflation rate and of a significant increase in

the nominal rate of interest. Between 1981 and 1983 short—term real rates did

not change much while real rates on 10—year bonds rose further. This increase

was mainly the result of a sharp deceleration of the inflation rate. In fact,

nominal rates fell by about 5 percentage points for 3—month bills and by about

 3 percentage points for 10—year bonds. The increase in nominal rates between

 1980 and 1981 must have brought about considerable capital losses on the part

 of those who held long—term financial assets and these losses may have reduced

 or eliminated the gains associated with higher real rates. However, the sharp
                                        8

fall in nominal rates between 1981 and 1983 gave those holding long—term

financial assets considerable capital gains that were additional to the gains

associated with high real rates. In other words, the capital gains reinforced

the effect associated with higher real rates at least in the earlier years of

the 1980s. The net result is that the resources available to older

individuals, who more than other groups hold financial assets, increased

sharply and so did their consumption.       This may explain the saving puzzle. In

                                        have fallen below the levels of the
more recent years real interest rates

early l980s but they have remained very high compared to earlier periods.

 Furthermore, the proportion of the elderly in the total population has been

 rising.

      We shall now demonstrate that this explanation of the observed negative

 relation between aggregate savings and the real interest rate can be supported

 by means of a simple lifecycle model of individual behavior.



 4. The Interest—Rate in Lifecycle and in Agzre2ate Savings

      Consider an individual who chooses his optimum path of consumption and

 labor supply so as to maximize his/her lifetime utility over a finite horizon.

 The rate of interest is assumed to be fixed and, for simplicity, the wage rate

 is invariant with age. Assume further that there is no initial endowment and

 no bequest of capital.

       It is shown in the Appendix that for a logarithmic instantaneous utility

  function, the optimum consumption function, c, and capital accumulation, k,

  and labor supply, l, derived explicitly:

         kt a capital (assets) at age t,

    Optimum consumption is seen to increase (decrease) over time as r—& >

first increasing reaching a maximum and decreasing afterwards. The opposite

pattern holds when r—& < 0.

     It is easy to verify (see Appendix) that an increase in the rate of

interest increases the capital stock at all ages:                > 0,   all   0   < t < T.

On   the   other hand, an increase in the rate of interest always decreases

consumption at early ages and increase consumption at later ages (Figure 2.

 for some 0 < t < T. The opposite response of optimum consumption at

 different ages to an increase in the rate of interest is the basis for our

 explanation of the negative response of aggregate savings in the U.S. to the

 increase in real interest rates during 1981—84. Clearly, the aggregate

 response depends on the age distribution in the population. The higher the

proportion of older persons the more likely is a negative impact on savings

and vice—versa.

      To get some intuition on magnitudes, we can use (1) to calculate the

elasticity of c w.r.t. at t—0 and at t—T:

                         *                                       *

      ¶Jith r—.l and T—5O, the elasticity of optimum consumption w.r.t. r is

—1.03 at tt0 and 4.04 at t—5O. Thus, the impact at older age is significantly

larger (in absolute terms) than at younger age!

      More generally, from (2) and (3), one can derive optimum income,

     1.   For example, while an often cited and influential study by Boskin

(1978) had found a substantive sensitivity of saving to the rate of return, a

study by Fre.nd and Hasbrouck (1983) found no relationship.

     2. The life—cycle theory of consumer behavior has been questioned in

some recent empirical studies. Some cross—secttional data show that the

wealth of indviduals increases with age. However, Berrtheim (1987) and Hurd

(1987) using panel data have demonstrated that the propensity to consume rises

with age and that the elderly do dissave during retirement.
