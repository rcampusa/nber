                                                ABSTRACT

The flypaper effect results when a dollar of exogenous grants-in-aid leads to significantly greater public
spending than an equivalent dollar of citizen income: Money sticks where it hits. Viewing governments
as agents for a representative citizen voter, this empirical result is an anomaly. Four alternative explanations
have been offered. First, it's a data problem; matching grants have been mis-classified as exogenous
aid. Second, it's an econometric problem; exogenous aid is correlated with omitted variables leading
to a downward bias in estimates of income's effects and an upward bias in estimates of aid's effects.
Third, it's a specification problem: the representative citizen either fails to observe lump-sum aid,
or sees aid but mis-perceives its impact as an average price effect, or finally, sees and understands
aid's budgetary effects but allocates "public" and "private" monies through separate "mental accounts."
The empirical evidence suggests none of these explanations is sufficient. A fourth explanation seems
most promising: It's politics. Rather than an anomaly, the flypaper effect is best seen as an outcome
of political institutions and the associated incentives of elected officials.

        In the late 1960's James Henderson (1968) and Edward Gramlich (1969) changed the

direction of empirical research on how local governments tax and spend. While all prior work

detailed the demographic and economic correlates with government budgets, Henderson and

Gramlich sought an explanation for those correlations. As economists, the answer was clear. Citizens

demand services from their elected officials, and elected officials respond subject to the availability

of government resources. Resources came from citizen incomes and from fiscal transfers given by

the central government as grants-in-aid. From this perspective, Henderson and Gramlich specified

and estimated demand equations based on the maximization of a representative citizen’s utility subject

to that citizen’s “full income” constraint specified as the sum of personal income and the citizen’s

share of his government’s unconstrained fiscal transfers. So specified, personal income and the

citizen’s share of fiscal transfers should impact spending identically – money is money.

        The empirical analyses of Henderson and Gramlich revealed something unexpected, however.

An extra dollar of personal income increased government spending on the order of $.02 to $.05 but

an equivalent extra dollar of grants-in-aid increased government spending by $.30 to often as much

as a full dollar. When Gramlich first presented his results, his colleague Arthur Okun called this larger

effect of lump-sum aid on government spending a “flypaper effect” noting that “money seems to stick

where it hits.” The label stuck too, as has the puzzle of why intergovernmental transfers are so

stimulative. Over 3,500 research papers have now been written documenting and seeking to explain



                                                   1
the flypaper effect.1

        Why do we care about this apparent anomaly? For two reasons. First, as a matter of policy,

understanding how recipient governments spend intergovernmental transfers is essential for the design

of efficient fiscal policy in federal economies. Second, as a matter of science, understanding why

governments spend citizens’ incomes as they do provides valuable insights as to how citizen

preferences are represented in government policies. The taxation of citizen incomes and the

allocation of grants-in-aid provide two “tracers” as to the inner workings of political decision-

making, one (taxes) that is directly observed and controlled by citizens and the other (grants) perhaps

only imperfectly so.

        The benchmark for both the policy and political economy literatures is how a politically

decisive citizen would like to see government resources allocated, specified by the maximization of

that representative citizen’s welfare over private (x) and public (g) goods, indexed by U(x, g), subject

to a current period budget constraint specified as:

                                         Y = {I + h•z} = x + pg•g

where I is the citizen’s private income (or tax base), h is the citizen’s share of unconstrained or lump-

sum intergovernmental transfers per capita (z) specified as h = I/¦ with ¦ equal to the average income

(or tax base) in the citizen’s political jurisdiction, and pg is the “tax price” for government services

(g) equal to cC(1 - m)Ch where c is the per unit production cost of g and m is the matching rate for




        1
           From a Google search under the heading “flypaper effect.” From the initial list of citations, I
deducted the 100 or so papers in entomology that really do study the effects of flypaper on insect populations
and the five papers in physics that study the effects of surface tension in attracting unwanted particles.

open-ended matching federal aid. Private goods cost $1. 2 Y is called the citizen’s “full income.” The

citizen’s preferred allocations will be x = x(1, pg, Y) and g = g(1, pg, Y), where:

                            )gI = (*g/*Y)C(*Y/*I)C)I = (*g/*Y)C()I = $1),

for an extra dollar of personal income and:

                           )gz = (*g/*Y)C(*Y/*z)C)z = (*g/*Y)ChC()z = $1)

for an extra dollar of aid, implying that estimated marginal effects of aid to income should be related

as )gz/)gI = h. In most political jurisdictions the representative citizen has a tax base (often specified

as the median tax base) less than the average tax base; thus, h = I/¦ < 1 in most cases. If our

representative citizen has had her way, then we should expect )gz/)gI = h < 1. The overwhelming

empirical evidence summarized by Gramlich (1977), Inman (1979), Fisher (1982), and Hines and

Thaler (1995) shows just the opposite, however; )gI ranges from $.02 to $.05 while the companion

estimates of )gz typically fall between $.30 to $1.00. Income to the citizen stays with the citizen;

grants to the government stay with the government. Money sticks where it hits. Why?

        Four explanations have been offered. First, the answer is in the data. Researchers mis-

measure intergovernmental aid by confusing matching grants that lower the marginal price of public

services (pg) with lump-sum aid (z) that shifts outward the representative citizen’s budget constraint.

Matching aid has a price effect, lump-sum aid an income effect. For local politics controlled by a

representative citizen, consumer theory predicts a matching grant’s price effect will stimulate more

government services than an equivalent dollar of lump-sum aid. If the dollar transfer received from


        2
           This specification assumes taxes are imposed at a proportional tax rate, r, specified as: r = [c•(1-
m)•g - z]/¦. The citizen’s after-tax income for expenditure on the private good will then be x = I - r•I . The
budget constraint above follows directly, where pg = cC(1 - m)Ch. More elaborate specifications of this
constraint allowing for interactions of price effects up to a limit – a variant of categorical grants – should also
be considered; see Lankford (1987).

                                                        3
matching aid is erroneously classified as lump-sum aid, then )gz > )gI will result; see Moffitt (1984),

Megdal (1987), and Baker, Payne, and Smart (1999). Even after correctly classifying aid programs

and measuring pg and z appropriately, however, the flypaper effect remains; see for example, Wyckoff

(1991).

          The second explanation sees the anomaly as an econometric problem. Researchers may have

omitted important determinants of government spending likely to be correlated with citizen income

or intergovernmental aid leading to biased estimates of )gI and )gz. Bruce Hamilton (1983) and

Jonathan Hamilton (1986) attribute the flypaper effect to mis-specifications of the technology or costs

of providing local services. Bruce Hamilton argues estimated demand equations omit important

variables such as the citizen’s talents or willingness to volunteer that are positively correlated with

citizen income and also contribute to the provision of government services. If these omitted effects

are substitutes for (negatively correlated with) purchased government inputs, then the estimated

coefficient for income will be biased downward and perhaps sufficiently so that )gz > )gI. Jonathan

Hamilton suggests the misspecification arises from a failure to correctly account for residential exit

from high tax jurisdictions leading to a loss of tax base when specifying the price of government

services. Local taxes are inefficient and the correctly specified price of local services must reflect this

fact. If citizens tend to reside in localities of comparable income and higher income residents are

more mobile, then the representative citizen’s income will be positively correlated with the correct

price which is negatively correlated with government services. Again, there is a downward bias in

the estimated income effect with )gz > )gI as a possible result.

          Neither of the Hamiltons’ biases are likely to fully explain estimated flypaper effects, however.

A plausible upper estimate for )gI can be obtained as )gI = (*g/*Y) = gg,YC(g/Y), where gg,Y is the


                                                     4
income elasticity of demand for government services and g/Y is the average rate of spending by

recipient governments. This ratio for the U.S. state and local government sectors combined from

1970 to 2008 – the period used for most all studies – is at most .15. Since most state and local

services are arguably necessities, gg,Y # 1 seems reasonable. If so, then )gI #(g/Y) = .15 bounds an

unbiased income effect. Since most estimates of )gz exceed .15, the flypaper effect remains.

        Perhaps then the explanation lies in an upward bias in the estimates of )gz? Here the results

of four recent studies are particularly instructive. Each takes advantage of a plausibly exogenous, or

“natural experiment,” change in lump-sum national aid to state or local governments. Gordon (2004)

uses federal legislation’s required changes in Title I education aid caused by state-level (exogenous

to the local budget) demographic changes before and after census years as her measure of exogenous

aid. She finds strong evidence of a flypaper effect for local school districts in the first year after the

change in Title I aid – )gz = 1.00 – but that this effect evaporates after three years with most of the

new aid returned to voters as lower local tax revenues. In contrast, Ladd (1993) and Singhal (2008)

find evidence for a significant and quantitatively large flypaper effect for U.S. state governments as

does Dahlberg, et. al. (2008) in their study of national aid to municipalities in Sweden. Ladd uses

windfall tax revenues to state governments following the Tax Reform Act of 1986 as her exogenous

measure of aid, and estimates and )gz = .40 > )gI = .03. Singhal (2008) uses outside revenues

received by state governments from a recent legal settlement with the tobacco industry as her measure

of z and finds )gz = .20 for spending on tobacco control programs compared to an estimate of )gI

0 for income’s effects on the same programs. Dahlberg, et .al. (2008) exploit a discontinuity in the

national aid formula that gives significant additional assistance to communities that experience more

than 2 percent out-migration over the previous ten years; communities just below the threshold


                                                    5
receive no additional aid, those just above do. The analysis includes community and time fixed effects

– there is no direct estimate of )gI – and they find )gz = 1.00 and no local tax relief. Ladd’s,

Singhal’s, and Dahlberg’s estimated flypaper effects remain over time.

        The flypaper effect appears to be a real phenomenon. As a third explanation then, perhaps

our model of citizen fiscal choice is misspecified. First, voters may not understand the complexity

of grant programs. Both Courant, Gramlich and Rubinfeld (1979) and Oates (1979) conjecture the

representative citizen misperceives lump-sum aid’s income effect as an average price effect. They

conjecture that the voter uses taxes paid per unit of services received – (pg•g - z)/g or pg - (z/g) – as

their estimate of the true marginal tax cost of government services, pg. If so, lump-sum aid (z) will

impact spending as a price subsidy, and the estimated effect aid on spending will imply )gz > )gI.

Wyckoff (1991) and Turnbull (1998) test this hypothesis by including both pg and [pg - (z/g)] as

competing explanators of local spending. They find plausible (negative) marginal price effects but

implausible (positive) effects of the mis-perceived average price. Estimated flypaper effects are

comparable to those of previous studies. From this evidence, it is unlikely price misperception

provides the explanation for the flypaper effect.

        Filimon, Romer and Rosenthal (1982) and Hines and Thaler (1995) provide alternative

versions of the voter ignorance hypothesis. For Filimon, Romer, and Rosenthal the representative

voter fails to see through the veil of government budgets; he does not know the level of aid received

by the local government. For Hines and Thaler, the representative voter sees through the veil but

budgets using mental accounts; there is a “public budget” that is the responsibility of government

officials and a “private budget” that is the citizen’s responsibility. Both hypotheses need a theory of

public budgets to explain )gz. Hines and Thaler leave this an open question, but Filimon, Romer, and


                                                    6
Rosenthal are quite explicit: Public officials are budget maximizers and therefore )gz = 1. They test

their theory for a sample of Oregon school districts and cannot reject the null hypothesis that )gz =

1 for state education aid. In Romer, Rosenthal, and Munley (1992) the authors’ replicate their

analysis for a sample of New York school districts and here the conclusion varies by the size of the

school district. Large districts (> 20,000 students) show budget maximizing behavior and a full

flypaper effect: )gz = 1. In smaller districts, however, the estimated aid and income effects are about

equal: )gz  hA)gI. These results parallel those from Ladd and Singhal for larger state governments

and from Gordon for local school districts. Together, this evidence is sufficient to reject a strict

version of the mental accounting explanation. It leaves open, however, the question of why the

flypaper effect remains for larger governments.

        Here a fourth explanation for the flypaper effect seems the most promising: It’s politics. This

approach assumes voters are informed and rational, but they do conceal their preferences when it is

strategically useful to do so. Such strategic behaviors require the use of less than efficient institutions

for preference revelation such as majority rule or representative legislatures. From this perspective,

the flypaper effect is a consequence of an inability of citizens to write complete “political contracts”

with their elected officials. Consistent with the results of Ladd, Singhal, and Romer, Rosenthal, and

Munley, one might expect these contracting problems to be greater, and the flypaper effect more

likely, for large governments.

        Chernick (1979) and Knight (2002) offer specifications of a political contract between a donor

central government and recipient local governments as a way to understand the flypaper effect.

Chernick (1979) specifies donor-recipient contracting as an auction. Assuming an exogenous level

of federal aid, local governments bid for the right to provide aided services by offering to share the


                                                    7
costs of provision. Beginning with the highest offer price, the central government selects recipient

local governments until its grants budget is exhausted. The resulting allocation will equalize the

marginal contribution of each local government to the incremental benefits from the provision of the

local service. Local governments with the highest valuations will provide more services and receive

more aid. Chernick offers evidence in support of this prediction from the federal Water and Sewer

Grant program. Importantly, any reduced form estimate of )gz for this program that did not account

for the auction that sets aid would be biased upward and imply a strong flypaper effect.

       Knight (2002) specifies and estimates a model of political contracting for grants policy that

sets both the aggregate size of the aid budget and its allocation. The budget is chosen to ensure its

passage and to maximize local constituent net benefits for the central government’s agenda-setter.

Again, the allocation process is an auction. Legislators bid to be part of the winning coalition by

offering to vote for the grants budget in return for intergovernmental aid. The agenda-setter picks

the smallest 51 percent of the bids. He then sets his own grant award to maximize the net benefits

to his own constituents. Those legislators whose state or local governments value the aided local

service most highly make the winning offers. The result is again a positive correlation between grants

awarded and local spending. Failure to control for this correlation will lead to an upward bias in the

estimate of )gz. For a statistically consistent estimate of )gz one needs instruments that both predict

grants (z) and are independent of constituents’ demand for the aided service. Legislative institutions

that select agenda-setters independent of constituent preferences will serve this purpose. Knight uses

the legislators’ tenures and majority party memberships as his instruments in his empirical study of

highway grants and state highway spending. Least squares estimation of grants’ effect on spending

shows )gz = 1; instrumental variables estimation rejects that extreme flypaper result but cannot reject


                                                  8
a partial effect (1 > )gz > h@)gI). In a companion piece, Knight (2004) estimates that this agenda-

setting process for highway grants imposes an allocative inefficiency of $.40 per dollar of aid.3

        Over the past decade, the devolution of economic responsibilities to lower tier governments

has become increasingly important, not only in formally federal states but in unitary states as well.

Central governments typically grant fiscal assistance to these local governments for the provision of

those services. Knowing how grants will be spent is important for the appropriate design of central

government transfer policies. Credible estimates of aid’s effects on local spending requires good

instrumental variables to predict aid, or ideally “natural experiments” providing truly exogenous

measures of central government assistance. Knowing how money is spent as it is helps us to

understand allocative performance of intergovernmental transfers, given federal and local political

institutions. Knowing why grant money is spent as it is is just as important. Here the specification

and estimation of structural models of central government transfer spending and local government

allocations of transfer incomes are essential. This information provides a basis for reforming these

important institutions.4

        Once viewed as an anomaly, the flypaper effect should now be seen as a reality of fiscal

politics, and its study as an opportunity to fashion central government transfer policies and

        3
            Knight’s (2004) own estimates of the inefficiency of highway aid is $.96 per dollar, but he includes
in this estimate the inefficiency of under-providing assistance to the many states excluded from the majority
winning coalition. Implicit in that calculation is an assumption that the excluded states cannot provide highway
services on their own. The estimate above assumes efficient local provision in states not receiving aid.
        4
            There is perhaps no more striking example of the benefits of such structural analyses of the aid
process than the work of Reinikka and Svensson (2003, 2004) on the allocation of Ugandan central government
aid to local schools. Initially, only $.15 of each centrally allocated school aid dollar found its way into the local
schools; $.85 was “captured” by the district bureaucracy for its own use. The problem was inadequate
information and weak local political organizations. Reforms publicized aid allocations and empowered village
councils to monitor that spending. The end results was to reduce district capture to $.15 per aid dollar – a
plausible administrative cost – and to increase local school resources by $.85 per aid dollar.
