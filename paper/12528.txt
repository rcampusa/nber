Do Female Physicians Capture Their Scarcity Value? The Case of OB/GYNs

JEL No. I1,J16,J44

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes how the imperfectly competitive market for Obstetricians and Gynecologists
clears in the face of an excess demand for female OB/GYNs. This excess demand results from the
convergence of three factors: i) all OB/GYN patients are women, ii) many women prefer to be treated
by a female OB/GYN, iii) only a small portion of OB/GYNs are female. The paper finds that both
money and non-money prices adjust: female OB/GYNs charge higher fees and also have longer waiting
times. Furthermore, these effects are mediated by institutional structure: in contract settings in which
money prices are rigid (i.e. managed care), waiting times are more likely to adjust, and in settings
in which money prices are more flexible, the reverse occurs. In the end, female OB/GYNs are able
to capture some of the value of the preferred service they provide but do not entirely close the gender
income gap.

I. Introduction

        Over the past three decades, the number of female physicians has increased dramatically.

While women represented only 8% of physicians in 1970, by the year 2000 they represented

24%.1 Patient demand for female doctors has also risen over this period: not only do women

make 40% more visits to doctors each year than men, but more women express a preference for

women doctors.2        These increases in demand for female physicians appear to have outpaced

increases in supply, particularly in certain medical specialties.                This raises the interesting

question of how the imperfectly competitive market for physicians’ services achieves

equilibrium in response to this excess demand.

        To investigate this question, I focus on the specialty of Obstetrics and Gynecology

(OB/GYN) where the excess demand for female physicians is especially pronounced. On the

demand side, not only are all OB/GYN patients women, but more and more women prefer to see

a female physician when discussing matters of a personal and sexual nature (studies indicate that

more than 50% of women prefer a female physician).3 On the supply side, only a small portion

of OB/GYNs are female (22% in 1990). These factors combine to produce a large excess

demand for female OB/GYNs.4

         If the pricing of doctors' visits was set in an open, competitive market and if the supply

of doctors was elastic in the medium or long run, then the excess demand for female doctors

would have two primary effects. In the short run, the demand shock would raise the price of

visits to female doctors. In the medium or long run, the supply of female doctors would increase,

  Although the supply of female OB/GYNs has increased, it appears to have been outpaced by increases in demand.
It is likely that there has always been a latent demand for female OB/GYNs, but that since there was virtually no
supply this demand was not expressed. Once the supply of female OB/GYNs rose to non-negligible levels, this
latent demand may have suddenly been expressed, appearing as an outward demand shock. The apparent demand



                                                                                                        1
eliminating any price gaps. However, healthcare markets are far from competitive, both in the

short run and the long run. In the short run, both doctors' fees and the price to patients of a

doctor's visit are determined by a number of non-competitive factors: physician contracts,

hospital agreements, insurance payment schedules, and coinsurance rates. As a result, visits are

often rationed by mechanisms other than money price: waiting times to get an initial appointment

or waiting times between appointments are possible non-money prices.                          In the long run, the

supply of doctors in total and in each specialty is far from elastic. Not only is there a lag of

nearly eight years in the production of physicians from entry into medical school to the

completion of a residency, but the Accreditation Council of Graduate Medical Education

(ACGME) essentially sets the number of residencies available in any single medical specialty.

Lastly, only a small number of physicians are new each year, so even large adjustments in the

flow will take many years to significantly alter the stock. It is doubtful that this market will

produce the right number of male and female physicians in each specialty. More generally, it is

doubtful this market will do a good job providing the appropriate mix of physicians to satisfy

patient preferences and needs. Moreover, obstetrics and gynecology, as a surgical sub-specialty,

has not historically been particularly welcoming to women physicians, and may have presented

additional barriers that slowed women’s entry. Overall, both prices and quantities in this market

will probably be inflexible and/or slow to adjust in both the short run and the long run, and it

seems unlikely that the competitive equilibrium would be reached.                             That is where this

investigation steps in.

         This paper investigates how the imperfectly competitive market for OB/GYN services

clears in the short run in the face of the excess demand for female OB/GYNs. There are many

possible ways that this excess demand might affect the relative outcomes of female OB/GYNs.


shock could easily exceed the initial supply increase, and it might then take quite a while for supply to increase

                                                                                                             2
It could be reflected in higher fees, longer waiting times, higher incomes, more hours worked, or

even different health outcomes for patients.5 The question is of interest for a number of reasons.

First, the market itself is of interest. Economic theory provides clear predictions for how non-

price markets may clear, and this situation provides an opportunity to test these predictions. In

addition, health care markets themselves are of independent interest, particularly as health care

institutions experiment with and launch diverse market structures. This investigation is able to

study one of these markets – the market for physicians’ services – during a period of great

change, the advent of managed care in the late 1980s. The physicians services market itself is

also of much interest to health economists.                Second, gender discrimination in professional

occupations, and in medicine in particular, is of independent interest, and this analysis will

provide insight into the nature of such discrimination.

         I use detailed data on young physicians in the late 1980s and early 1990s to investigate

these questions. To preview the results, the paper finds that both money and non-money prices

adjust: female OB/GYNs charge higher fees and also have longer waiting times. Furthermore,

these effects are mediated by institutional structure: in contract settings in which money prices

are rigid (i.e. managed care), waiting times are more likely to adjust, and in settings in which

money prices are more flexible, the reverse occurs. In addition, female OB/GYNs do close the

gender gap in weekly income significantly, but not completely.

         The paper proceeds as follows. Section II discusses background material on female

physicians, female OB/GYNs, and gender differences. Section III outlines a simple theoretical

model for the markets for male and female OB/GYN services. Section IV sets out the empirical

  One additional possibility is that other types of female healthcare providers, such as nurse practitioners or
midwives, may enter the market and provide more female care. The current analysis does not investigate this
possibility.

results, and Section VII concludes.



II. Background

A. Many female patients prefer female physicians

         Much of the medical literature and the popular media appears to assume that female

patients' preferences for female physicians are so obvious that they do not need to be established.

There has, however, been some exploration of this assumption. Among a sample of a military

population in 1998, 52% of patients said they would prefer a female gynecologist, 4% would

prefer a male, and for 44% expressed no preference.6 Among a general sample of the Canadian

population in 1990, 26% of women said they were more comfortable with a female health

practitioner (16% with a male), but among younger women 56% reported being more

comfortable with a female (10% with a male). Overall, there is significant evidence in the

medical literature that many female patients prefer to be treated by a female physician, and that

these preferences are more pronounced in gynecology, psychotherapy, and in areas of sexual

abuse. It also appears that these preferences have become stronger over time as gender attitudes

changed significantly from the 1970s to the 1990s.7

         In addition, both patients and doctors confirm that many patients do express a preference

for being treated by a female OB/GYN.8 Some patients express a preference for a female

physician because they believe a woman will provide better care: "A female doctor understands -

blank-." Some admit that they have no real reason to prefer a female: "My preference for a

6
  Chandler et al (2000).
7
  Both a patient’s sex role (Weyrauch (1990)) and her attitude towards the appropriate role of the physician (Elstad
(1994)) are strongly related to her preference (or not) for a female physician. As these roles and attitudes change, it
is likely that patients’ preferences for female physicians will change as well.



                                                                                                             4
female is more of a quirk. I feel more comfortable confiding my concerns with a woman... This

isn't the case for other types of physicians." In fact, 86% of the patients reporting a preference

for a female doctor in the military sample attribute their preference to a belief that women are

better able to understand their problems.9 Many patients argue that feeling comfortable with a

physician, not the gender of the doctor, is most important. Lastly, some patients write that they

had a preference but that it was not confirmed by experience. Some of these patients report that

they then changed their preference, while others say they retained it.

         On the other end, male OB/GYNs do report discrimination against them, in the form of

lower patient demand and lower incomes. Many young male OB/GYNs are even concerned

about their employment prospects.                One male physician, who works in a practice group

consisting of three males and one female, recounts an instance in which a patient "waxed

rhapsodic" about the emergency treatment she received from one of the male physicians but then

requested that her follow-up appointment be with the female physician (whom she had never

met) because she "could never see a male gynecologist." Interestingly, he concludes that they

"have chalked it up to a testicle tax." Another male OB/GYN states that the low number of

female OB/GYNs, combined with their high demand, causes significant matching problems.10 In

addition, one male OB/GYN reports that his wife, also an OB/GYN with nearly identical

training, "could have commanded a 10% higher salary than I, had we chosen to work for

someone else, exclusively because she is a woman."                        However, he also reports that since

insurance payments are centrally set, women in private practice are less likely to reap these

benefits. Overall, the situation is serious enough that and the American College of Obstetricians

and Gynecologists directly acknowledges the mismatch and works hard to encourage men to

pursue OB/GYN.11

        Thus, whether or not male and female OB/GYNs actually provide different care, many

patients think that they do.         Since the good being provided is a personal service, patient

perception can affect the market valuation of the good: if a patient thinks a female doctor is

better, she may be willing to pay more to see a female doctor.                In addition, patient perception

can affect a doctor’s actual productivity: if a patient thinks a female doctor is better, that may

actually make that doctor better by improving communication, patient satisfaction, and health

outcomes. Does this productivity effect legitimate the discrimination? That is a more difficult

question.12 But it remains that patient preference can change market valuation of the good and

productivity.

B. Female physicians provide different care

        There is mixed evidence that female physicians provide quantitatively different care.

Several studies have concluded that female physicians are both more aware of patients' concerns

and are more likely to prescribe certain therapies and routine tests, and that female OB/GYNS

are less likely to perform cesarean sections and hysterectomies. Other studies have found only

small gender differences.13 There is some evidence that female physicians provide qualitatively

different care – that they have a different approach to caring for their patients. Several authors

find that women physicians appear more able to communicate sensitivity to patients, more able

11
   The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, in its policy statement “Women’s health care: a career
in obstetrics & gynecology,” specifically states that “a higher percentage of female obstetrician-gynecologists
reflects the new balance in medical schools and residency education programs in the United States… However, male
students should not be discouraged from choosing obstetrics and gynecology as a career; there are numerous
practice opportunities for competent clinicians of both genders.”
12
   Curtis (2001) argues that the discrimination is unjust and the OB/GYN community should engage in open
discussion to prevent discrimination against male OB/GYNs and to encourage males to enter the profession. On the
other hand, Reddy (2000) reports a legal case in which a male OB/GYN sued for gender discrimination. The
appellate court held that patient preference may legitimate accommodation of that preference: “female patients may
have a legitimate privacy interest in seeking to have female doctors perform their gynecological examinations.”


                                                                                                        6
to communicate effectively with their patients, and more likely to feel personal responsibility for

them.14 On the contrary, other studies have found that male OB/GYNS expressed more concern

and partnership with their patients, and engaged in more thorough communication.15

C. Discrimination against female physicians

         There is significant evidence for the persistence of discrimination against and sexual

harassment of female physicians and medical students. In national surveys and smaller studies,

more than 50% of female physicians report experiencing discrimination and more than 25%

report experiencing harassment.16 Several authors find that women medical school faculty are

promoted more slowly and that women's lower ranks in the academic hierarchy are not explained

by productivity or by differential attrition. Women also face significant obstacles in entering

surgical and other prestigious specialties, and drop out of medical school at consistently greater

rates than men.17 MacLeod reports comments from the Canadian Medical Association workshop

in which female physicians reported isolation, excessive time demands, and sexism.

         Thus, the literature confirms that some female patients do prefer to be treated by female

physicians, female physicians provide quantitatively and qualitatively different care, and female

physicians experience gender discrimination.

D. Gender wage differentials in medicine

         Although medicine is one of the highest paying professions, female physicians have

historically earned less than their male counterparts even after relevant characteristics (such as

hours worked, practice setting, and medical specialty) are taken into account. Raw income gaps

have barely changed: in 1977 women earned approximately 57% of what men earned, while in

1991 women earned 59% of what men earned.18 However, these gaps are largely explained by

differences in characteristics, particularly specialty choices and weeks or hours worked. Since

the 1980s, the unexplained gender differentials in hourly earnings are small - less than 13% in

most analyses.19 Among OB/GYNs, the unexplained differential may be even smaller: recent

income gaps appear to match up reasonably well with measured productivity gaps. Females’

mean net income is 85% of males’, and their productivity (measured by hours worked, or the

relative numbers of various procedures performed) was also 83% to 90% of males.20



III. Theory

        Physicians in different medical specialties engage in very different types of interaction

with both colleagues and patients. On the colleague side, certain specialties, such as surgery,

have reputations for more gender discrimination by male physicians against female physicians.

On the patient side, different specialties address different health concerns and therefore involve

different doctor-patient relationships. Some health concerns are such that patients may have a

strong preference for or against female physicians whereas for other health concerns patients

may not care either way (they may not even have much close personal interaction with their

physician).

        For this paper, the first key fact is that all OB/GYN patients are women. The second is

that many women express a strong preference for being treated by a female OB/GYN. The third

is that only a minority of OB/GYNs are female: less than 30% throughout the period covered by

the data (1986-1996).         Together, these facts produce a large excess demand for female

OB/GYNs. Although female patients may also have a gender preference for physicians in other

specialties, these effects are likely to be much smaller. For example, because patients have

significant long-term interaction with their primary care physician, female patients may also

prefer to be treated by a female General Practitioner (GP). However, since not all GP patients

are female and since the medical issues addressed by General Practitioners are less likely to be

personal or sexual, this effect is probably much smaller. The effect is certainly smaller for most

other specialties and close to negligible in specialties in which there is little interaction between

physicians and patients, such as anesthesiology, radiology, or pathology.

         As a theoretical structure, I consider a simple supply-demand model augmented by a

model of customer discrimination following Becker. The good is a visit to a physician in a

certain specialty, further defined by physician characteristics such as gender.21 The demand is

the number of patients desiring visits with physicians of that gender in that specialty, and is

determined by the percentage of patients who are women and the preference (if any) for female

physicians as opposed to male physicians. The supply is the number of physicians of a certain

gender in a certain specialty, and the relative supply of women within a certain specialty is the

percentage of physicians in that specialty who are women. (This supply is fixed in the short run,

and possibly flexible in the long run.22) The price is both money and time. The money price is

the fee for the visit, and is largely determined and paid by insurance companies. The consumer




21
   This model employs a simplified definition of the good in question: a visit to a physician in a certain specialty,
further defined by physician characteristics such as gender. This ignores several more subtle points. The good
might be health, a positive health outcome, an hour of the doctor's time, or an hour of "quality time" with the doctor.
It also assumes that the patient's assessment of value is most relevant. However, there are many other possibilities
for whose assessment matters: the medical profession, male or female doctors, male or female patients, or various
institutions.
22
   Long-term supply may not be very responsive to demand pressures. The supply of doctors is far from elastic.
AMA accredited medical schools have close to a monopoly over the production of doctors, the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) controls the specialty distribution, and it is doubtful that they
this process will supply exactly the right male/female ratio. There is some elasticity from foreign medical graduates
and from individuals’ choices of specialties within the ACGME framework.

                                                                                                             9
faces only a small or negligible portion of this price. The time price is how long a patient is

willing to wait for the visit. The consumer pays all of this price.

         Prices and quantities will adjust until the market clears. This adjustment should be

observable in prices such as fees, waiting times, and incomes and in quantities such as hours

worked, patients seen, or numbers of physicians in specialty-gender cells. The crucial features

that will produce actual price differentials between male and female OB/GYNs are the high

patient preference for female OB/GYNs and the relatively low and inelastic supply of female

OB/GYNs.23 Assuming quantity adjustment is somewhat inelastic (patients either do or do not

need to see a doctor, physicians only work so much and there are substantial entry barriers), price

differentials will need to be non-zero in equilibrium. Given that anti-discrimination law at least

indirectly restricts many money prices within a specialty to be equal across genders, non-money

prices may be more likely to adjust.

         Figures 1a and 1b illustrate this simple supply-demand model for the market for female

OB/GYN services. Both figures show price (both fee and wait) on the vertical axis and quantity

on the horizontal axis.       Figure 1a shows the equilibrium reached if male and female physicians’

fees are constrained to be equal at Fee*.              If fees are so constrained and no other prices are

available, the excess demand for female is shown by the length of line de. If other prices are

available – if waiting times adjust to achieve equilibrium – then a large waiting time Wait* for

female physicians eliminates this excess demand. In this case, the market is in equilibrium at the

quantity Q* and the combined price Fee* + Wait*.                         However, this equilibrium presents

significant welfare losses: the lost consumer and producer surplus is shown by the area B+C+E.

This entire area is wasted due to the inflexibility of fees. Patients spend the area B+C waiting,

23
  Entry barriers should make the supply of female OB/GYNs inelastic. As discussed above, there is a long lag in
the production of physicians, and the flow is small enough relative to the stock that compositional changes are likely



                                                                                                          10
and physicians give up the area C in the form of lost income. The area E is a traditional

deadweight loss. However, it is important to note that in fact the entire area B+C+E is a

deadweight loss, since time spent waiting is not revenue that is transferred to anyone, it is just

wasted.

        Figure 1b shows the equilibrium reached if male and female physicians’ fees are allowed

to be different. In this case, money prices clear the market and no waiting time adjustment is

necessary. Female physicians charge higher fees (Fee*female rather than Fee*male) and make

correspondingly higher income in the areas C+G. Patients pay higher money fees in the areas

C+G. However, patients no longer pay higher time prices (they now pay C as money and do not

pay B at all). The total payment made by patients -- money plus time -- is lower than it was

when fees were rigid. Furthermore, there is no deadweight loss and the equilibrium quantity is

greater. The adjustment of fees permits a Pareto improvement that benefits patients by saving

them time and benefits female physicians by increasing their income. In this scenario, female

physicians are able to capture the rents generated by their scarcity value.

        Of course, which of these scenarios best describes how the market for physicians’

services reaches equilibrium largely depends on the institutional constraints on the market. The

primary institutions acting in this market are those that employ physicians (HMOs, hospitals,

private practice) and those that pay for medical care (HMOs, PPOs, IPAs, traditional insurance

companies). This market is clearly not competitive. It is a vertically integrated market in which

doctors sell their services as an input to healthcare providers and the providers then sell these

services to patients. The price to the patient of a doctor's visit is determined by a number of non-

competitive factors, primarily various contract arrangements.



to be slow. Even if all new OB/GYNs were female, the share female among OB/GYNs would increase by only 20
percentage points in 10 years.

                                                                                                11
        Since physicians do not receive payment for their services directly from patients, third

party payers play an important role in this market. Under a traditional insurance plan with

retrospective payment, a physician submits a bill to the insurance company who then pays the

physician with little negotiation about the amount. Physicians are essentially independent and

compete on both price and quality. Under an insurance plan with prospective payment, the

insurance company pays the physician a pre-determined "usual and customary fee" for the

service, a price set by the insurance company based on what it deems reasonable and generally

discounted relative to what the physician would like to charge. Physicians’ prices are therefore

somewhat constrained, and therefore physicians compete more on quality than price.              A

physician may enter into a contract arrangement, called a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO),

with certain insurance companies under which he or she agrees to accept these usual and

customary fees.     Patients are then given financial incentives to go to physicians who are

members. In more strictly managed care, prices are even less competitive, in many cases non-

existent.   In this case, patients pay a flat fee to be a member of a Health Maintenance

Organization (HMO) which agrees to provide all necessary healthcare. Physicians are then

employed by the HMO, and are paid primarily on a salaried basis rather than receiving fees

directly from patients or insurance companies. Many physicians remain in private practice and

yet agree to provide services to an HMO through an Independent Practice Arrangement (IPA).

In this paper, a physician is said to be in a contract arrangement if he or she is a member of an

HMO, PPO, or IPA, and not in a contract arrangement if he or she is not a member of any such

organization. This distinction is intended to divide physicians into two groups based on their

freedom to set their own prices. We expect that physicians in contract arrangements are

somewhat limited in this respect, and that physicians not in contract arrangements have relatively

more freedom. It is important to note that, during the time period covered by the data (mid

                                                                                        12
1980s to the 1990s), physicians were neither largely out of contracts nor largely in contracts:

there were substantial numbers in each category.           This diverse organizational structure is

precisely what provides the opportunity to investigate this question. (It is also important to note

that the results are generally robust to alternate definitions of contracting.)

       The market for physicians’ services is imperfectly competitive for other reasons as well.

It is characterized by asymmetric information, because physicians know much more about health

and illness than patients do, and by significant search costs, because patients have difficulty

obtaining accurate information about physicians. Physicians are in limited supply and sell

differentiated, non-substitutable products. They compete on both quality and price. Patients

have heterogeneous preferences over perceived quality, match, and characteristics. Patients also

do not bear the full price, and shop for physicians both on price and quality. The combination of

heterogeneous products and preferences with significant switching costs gives physicians market

power. The market is therefore best described as monopolistically competitive, with lower

elasticities of demand for each individual physician than for the market as a whole. Price

differentials can persist in such a market, and the greater the informational imperfections and

price frictions, the lower each physician’s individual demand elasticity and the larger the

sustainable price differentials between physicians.

       However, the institutional structures discussed above inhibit the flexibility of money

prices, and physicians’ services are therefore likely to be rationed by additional mechanisms

other than money price. For physicians in contract arrangements, we would expect the relatively

low flexibility of fees in response to patient demand to produce a larger adjustment of waiting

times for physicians. Patients may queue up to wait for the physician they want to see. On the

other hand, for physicians not in contract arrangements, we would expect the relatively higher

flexibility of the fees in response to patient demand to produce larger adjustment of fees and

                                                                                         13
smaller adjustment of waiting times.24 Economic theory predicts that prices should clear the

markets in the most efficient manner, subject to institutional constraints. Thus, Figure 1a may

come closest to describing the market for the services of physicians in contract arrangements,

while Figure 1b may be best for describing the market for the services of physicians not in

contract arrangements.

         While both money and non-money prices effectively ration supply, they do not operate in

the same manner. As seen in Figure 1a, the implicit price for a good is the sum of the explicit

money price and the value of the time spent waiting. When money prices do not or cannot

adjust, waiting time functions as a tax to raise the implicit price and thereby reduce demand.

However, when time prices are used to reduce demand, both the traditional deadweight loss (area

E) and the revenue (area B+C) are pure waste: the patient pays her time but the physician does

not receive any payment. This structure has two important consequences. First, the optimal tax

structure is exactly opposite from the standard optimal taxation result. In this case, total waste is

minimized when the tax in the form of the time price is the highest for the most elastically

demanded goods. However, this also maximizes the rents lost by producers of the desirable

good: female OB/GYNs may lose out if demand for their services is reduced by longer waiting

times (which provide them few benefits) rather than higher fees (which do provide them

monetary benefits). Second, since time is cheaper for those with lower income, using time prices




24
  The non-competitive nature of the market is both an advantage and a disadvantage for the current analysis. On the
negative side, these non-competitive factors interfere with the adjustment mechanism (of prices, quantities, quality).
For example, managed-care places controls on healthcare that restrict the movement of prices and quantities, altering
the supply response. If a doctor signs a contract for a certain income and there is little flexibility, her wage may not
be able to adjust and she may just work more hours or have longer waiting times. This could also be complicated by
individual preferences causing selection bias into flexible or inflexible practice environments. On the positive side,
the market in itself is interesting. Determining the response to the exogenous demand shock may enable us to
characterize the market for physicians, obtaining structural information about the nature of the market that would be
universally applicable. This could eventually provide important insights about the interactions between
discrimination, patient preference, monopsonistic behavior of insurance companies, and monopolistic behavior of
medical schools in a highly organized labor market.

                                                                                                            14
essentially creates a sliding scale by income. This may provide social benefits in the form of

implicit transfers from the rich to the poor.

        In sum, in a competitive market, female physicians should be able to extract rents for

providing a desirable good available in limited quantities. However, due to the non-competitive

features of this market, adjustment may happen on several different margins.       I now outline a

strategy for studying what actually occurs.



IV. Empirical Approach

        An ideal investigation of this question would take advantage of an extensive and detailed

dataset on outcomes for physicians in different specialties. I would examine the movement of

prices and quantities in both the short run and the long run, and investigate the outcomes of

female OB/GYNs relative to male OB/GYNs.             In fact, my current data and analysis come

reasonably close to this ideal investigation for the short run. I will first outline the prices and

quantities I investigate and discuss the econometric specification, and then I will describe the

data.

A. Prices and Quantities

        To determine how the market for physician visits equilibrates, I examine relevant prices

and quantities. The prices are: standard fee for a routine visit with the physician, waiting time in

weeks for an initial visit, annual income (in logs), and weekly income (in logs). The fees and

waiting times are given the most attention because they are the purest prices and are most likely

to be flexible. To the extent that physicians can set their own fees, standard fees may be flexible.

However, as prospective insurance payments set fees centrally and managed care arrangements

start to eliminate fees, standard fees will become more sticky.      Waiting times are extremely

flexible: since there are few regulations and little awareness of these non-money prices for

                                                                                          15
physician services, they are most likely to be able to adjust in response to supply and demand

pressures. The income measures are actually both prices (the price that an employer such as an

HMO pays for a doctor) and aggregate outcome measures (the product of fees and patients seen).

Therefore, incomes may exhibit less clear adjustment in response to market pressures either

because they are set by a variety of non-competitive factors or because they are aggregated

measures rather than pure prices.

         The quantities investigated are: patients seen per week and hours worked per week. The

quantities that are more likely to adjust in the short run are those under the control of the

individual physician: patients seen and hours worked. However, these variables are also labor

supply variables, and consequently should be treated cautiously. In addition, I do not investigate

quantities of physicians because supplies of physicians are fixed in the short run and the data do

not span a long enough time period to evaluate long-run changes in supply.

B. Specification

         The basic model is a regression of a price or quantity on the female dummy, indicators

for thirteen medical specialty categories,25 the interactions of those specialty categories with the

female dummy, and other controls. The other controls include basic demographics: age, race,

region, a quadratic in experience, a married dummy, and a parent dummy. The other controls

also include professional demographics: indicator variables for AMA membership, board

certification, private practice, a contract arrangement, and salaried pay.26 Models in which

observations are pooled across years include a linear time trend and the interaction of this time




25
   The thirteen medical specialty categories are: general family practice, general internal medicine, specialty with no
subspecialties, medical subspecialty, general surgery, surgical specialty/subspecialty, pediatrics, OB/GYN,
radiology, psychiatry, anesthesiology, pathology, and other. See Appendix Table 1 for more detail. All dollar
values in pooled specifications are in 1986 dollars.
26
   A more detailed specification also includes parent, number of children, and interactions of these with gender, and
malpractice claims in the past. However, the results are not sensitive to the inclusion of these variables.

                                                                                                           16
trend with the female dummy, with the specialty categories, and with the interaction of the

female dummy and specialty categories.27

         The goal is to determine whether female OB/GYNs have significantly different outcomes

than male OB/GYNs in excess of general gender differentials among physicians. Thus, the

model estimated is as follows:

         Outcomei = α 0 + α 1 I(female) i + α 2 I(OB/GYN) i + α 3 I(female) i * I(OB/GYN) i

                           +   Σspecialties [ δj I(specialty) + γj I(female)* I(specialty)]      + Xi β + εi

                                                                                                     Eqn. 1. 28

The coefficient of interest is α3 : the interaction between the female dummy and the OB/GYN

dummy. The specification employed for Equation 1 is ordinary least squares with Huber-White

robust standard errors.

         The main question is: exactly how do female OB/GYNs compare to male OB/GYNs?

Does gender play a different role in OB/GYN than in other specialties? I will focus primarily on

the behavior of money and time prices -- standard fees and waiting times – since these prices

might be more likely to be flexible and accurately measured, thereby providing a clearer picture

of the manner in which the market equilibrates.

C. Data

         The primary data sources are the Young Physicians Surveys (YPS) conducted in 1987,

1991, and 1997 by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Mathematica Policy Research, and the

American Medical Association (AMA). These surveys collected information about the practice

patterns and perceptions of the medical profession from 5,868 physicians in 1987, 6,053 in 1991,

27
   For waiting times and standard fees, only those specialties that have relevant values of these variables were
included in the analysis. Physicians in certain specialties may not see patients directly, and therefore may not have a
standard fee for a regular visit or a waiting time for an initial appointment. Such specialties include Radiology,
Anesthesiology, Pathology, Public Health, Emergency Medicine, and Aerospace Medicine. These specialties are
excluded from analyses of standard fees and waiting times.


                                                                                                            17
and 1,452 in 1997. Some of these are multiple observations of particular individuals: the total

13,373 observations include 5,011 individuals with a single year of data, 2,996 individuals with

two years of data, and 790 individuals with three years of data (see Appendix Table 2).

         The samples were drawn from the AMA Socioeconomic Monitoring System master file

to include physicians who had been in practice for two to nine years and who were less than 40

years old (45 in 1991). By choosing young physicians less than nine years out of medical

school, the sample is designed to be relatively homogeneous. This conveniently eliminates

biases that would otherwise be present due to the difference between the installed base of

physicians (older and primarily male) and the flow of new physicians (younger and more

female). It also provides a sample that includes substantially more women of all specialties and

a significant number of female OB/GYNs.29                   The data use weights designed to adjust for

differential response rates within the eligible sample across identifiable sample subgroups and

for selection of an oversample of black and Hispanic individuals.30

         The survey covered a wide range of topics including practice setting, numbers and types

of patients seen, income, hours, and physicians' perceptions of their careers, the medical

profession, and discrimination.31,32 The key variables available in these data (and unavailable

28
   The base case is a male physician in general practice in the Northeast. The function I(⋅) is an indicator function;
e.g. I(female) is 0 for male physicians and 1 for female physicians.
29
   It is crucial for the current analysis that the data include a substantial number of female OB/GYNs. Because
female OB/GYNs represented only 1.2% of all physicians in 1990, available datasets covering physicians of all ages
generally include very few female OB/GYNs. A sample of young physicians not only includes many more female
OB/GYNs, but also provides a sample with less confounding heterogeneity in labor market experience and other
characteristics. Both of these aspects of the data are critical.
30
   These weights were provided by the Principal Investigator. More detail on the construction of these weights can
be found in the codebooks for the data sets. Weights were made consistent across the different years of data by a
similar procedure.
31
   In addition, data from the Student and Applicant Information Management System database (SAIMS) file is
included for about half of the observations. This database includes information collected throughout each
individual's medical school career.
32
   The 1987 YPS also includes encrypted geographic codes that provide access to characteristics of the local health
care market. Variables of particular interest in these data are: numbers of physicians within each specialty and by
gender; and population composition by age, race, income, and household size. These can be used to test specific
hypotheses about the role of local supply and demand conditions. Unfortunately, population numbers by gender are
not available.

                                                                                                          18
elsewhere) are standard fees and waiting times. Standard fees are in answer to the question “In

this practice, what is your current usual fee for an office visit with an established patient

including an examination and/or treatment for the same or new illness?”33 While the “typical”

office visit may certainly vary across OB/GYNs depending on the focus of their practice (e.g.

low-risk obstetrics vs. gynecologic oncology), this standard fee variable is the best variable

available (in this or other datasets) to measure the price of a relatively uniform medical good

across physicians.

        Waiting times are in answer to the question “How many days does a new patient wishing

to see you in this practice typically have to wait for an appointment?”                    The waiting time

therefore represents the time from an initial phone call to the physician's office to the soonest

possible appointment. It is not the number of hours a patient sits in the waiting room before

seeing the physician.34 Lastly, it is important to note that the standard fee and waiting time

variables are only available in the 1987 and 1991 surveys. For this reason, I use only those years

of data in the full analysis. Furthermore, although repeat observations are available on some

individual physicians, I use only the first observation on any one physician. This insures that

physicians are homogeneous in their years of experience: all first interviews have less than five

years of experience out of medical school.

        A second data source is from the American Medical Association (AMA), which collects

data about all of its members in its Physician Masterfile, the most comprehensive source of

information about physicians in the United States. The AMA publishes summary tables from

these data annually or biannually, providing detailed tabulations of the distribution of physicians


33
  Fees did not require any cleaning beyond removing extreme values.
34
  Although the physicians quoted their waiting times in days, I have recoded them to weeks. The raw data clearly
indicated that some individuals were counting 5-day weeks while others were counting 7-day weeks. The re-coding
algorithm created a consistent measure of waiting time in weeks. It also truncated waiting times at a maximum of
26 weeks to remove extreme values.

                                                                                                     19
by specialty, gender, type of practice, etc. These data are the source for the gender distribution

within each specialty in each year.

D. Basic facts

         Summary statistics of the main variables from the YPS are provided in Table 1, separated

by sex. Women are relatively well represented: the sample is 23% female in 1987 and 29%

female in 1991. In addition, the sample is relatively evenly split between physicians who are in

contract arrangements and those who are not in such arrangements: this share is approximately

one-third in 1987, and rises to one-half in 1991. This will be important for the later analysis

investigating the role of contract setting. Women's net income is significantly lower:

approximately 70% of men's in both years. Furthermore, women work fewer hours per week

(approximately 50 vs. 60), see fewer patients per week (approximately 10% fewer than men),

and have longer waiting times for an initial appointment (more than 40% longer). They are also

slightly less likely to be in private practice. They have similar age and race distributions, but are

less likely to be married and have fewer children. An Oaxaca decomposition of the income

differential shows that most of the 30% difference in annual income is explained by differences

in characteristics such as specialty.35

         Medical specialties are important in determining the values of many of these variables.

(Appendix Table 1 provides a list of specialties and major specialty categories.) Table 2 and

Figure 2 show the female share within each specialty from 1970 to 2000. The percentage female

overall has risen from 7.6% in 1970 to 24% in 2000. However, this increase has not been


35
  The Oaxaca decomposition of the income differential is shown in Appendix Table 3. The log annual income
difference of 30 to 45% is largely explained by differences in characteristics. Approximately 1/4 to 1/3 of the
difference is explained by specialty and practice setting characteristics (13 large specialty categories, 6 categories
for practice setting, and whether the physician is in a contract arrangement), while 1/2 to 2/3 can be explained by
adding personal and physician demographics (age, experience, experience squared, marriage, children, race, region,
AMA membership, board certification, prior malpractice claims, patients per week, hours per week). Differential
returns to family variables such as marriage, children, and a non-working spouse are a significant source of the
remaining differential.

                                                                                                           20
distributed equally across specialties. The primary differences are the higher shares of women in

psychiatry, obstetrics and gynecology, and especially pediatrics, and the extremely low share of

women in surgery. The dissimilarity index is another way to measure the distribution of men

and women across specialties. This index reflects the share of individuals who would need to

switch specialties to make the distributions equal for men and women. In the late 1990s, this

index was 0.20, which is small relative to dissimilarity indices for overall gender occupational

segregation, which generally exceed 0.60.36

         Within obstetrics and gynecology, the share of physicians who are female has risen from

7.1% in 1975 to 22.4% in 1990 and to 35.1% in 2000. The increase in the female share of

OB/GYN residents has been even more dramatic: from 13% in 1975 to 58% in 1995 and further

to 65% in 1998.37 Thus, the flow into OB/GYN is increasingly female, but since the annual flow

replaces only 2% of the stock, it takes quite a while for the stock to become more female. Table

3 shows the gender comparison within OB/GYN. The gender gap in income is somewhat

smaller than that among all physicians. Male and female OB/GYNs are also similar on many

important measures -- weeks worked, hours worked, patients seen. Men are slightly more likely

to be in private practice, board certified, or in a contract arrangement. Women are less likely to

be married or to have children. The waiting time differential is striking: the average waiting time

for a male OB/GYN in 1987 is 2.16 weeks, and for a female is 3.79 weeks. In 1991, these

numbers are 2.52 and 5.03 respectively. There is also a slight differential in standard fees: the

average standard fee in 1987 for a male OB/GYN is $40.25, and for a female is $45.25. In 1991,

these numbers are $58.33 and $62.40, respectively. These differentials will be investigated more

carefully in the subsequent analysis, but they are a first indication that excess patient demand for

female OB/GYNs may produce relatively longer waiting times for female OB/GYNs, and

possibly higher fees.38



V. Empirical Results

           I now discuss the primary empirical results. Tables 4, 5, and 6 show these results using

the 1987 and 1991 YPS data for waiting times, standard fees, log annual income, log weekly

income, log hourly income, log patients seen per week, and log hours worked per week. Each

table has six columns. Columns 1, 3, and 5 show the results for specifications that include a

single dummy for 1991, but do not include any interactions of the 1991 dummy with other

variables. They therefore show only three coefficients for each regression: the coefficient on the

female dummy, the coefficient for the OB/GYN dummy, and the coefficient for the interaction of

the two. Columns 2, 4, and 6 show the results for specifications that include a single dummy for

1991 and also include interactions of the 1991 dummy with other variables. These columns

therefore show six coefficients for each regression: the coefficient on the female dummy, the

coefficient for the OB/GYN dummy, and the coefficient for the interaction of the two, plus the

interactions of these three coefficients with a dummy indicating 1991.                         Furthermore, the

columns of the tables show analysis on different samples: columns 1 and 2 show results for all

physicians, both inside and outside of contract arrangements; columns 3 and 4 show results for

physicians not in contract arrangements; columns 5 and 6 show results for physicians in contract

arrangements. As discussed above, a physician is said to be in a contract arrangement if he or




38
     For reference, the same gender comparison by year for physicians in General Practice is shown in Appendix Table
4.

                                                                                                         22
she is a member of an HMO, PPO, or IPA, and not in a contract arrangement if he or she is not a

member of any such organization.39

         Furthermore, the coefficients shown in the tables represent the effect of OB/GYN relative

to the base specialty of General Practice, and the effect of the female interaction with OB/GYN

relative to a weighted average of all other specialties. That is, the coefficients are those from a

simplified specification that omits the interaction of the female dummy with the other specialty

categories:

         Outcomei = α 0 + α 1 I(female) i + α 2 I(OB/GYN) i + α 3 I(female) i * I(OB/GYN) i

                  + Xi β +     Σspecialties [ δj I(specialty) ]   + εi
                                                                                                    Eqn. 2. 40


This provides a clearer picture of gender-specific within-OB/GYN differentials. However, in all

cases the full specification shown in Equation 1 has also been tested, as well as a specification

without any specialty dummies at all. Wald tests on those coefficients confirm the results

discussed below, and hence it is acceptable to omit the more detailed set of interactions. Lastly,

recall that this specification is run as ordinary least squares on the pooled 1987 and 1991 data.

Other specifications and samples have also been employed, and the results confirm those

discussed herein.41

due to selection on ability are of concern, random effects is more appropriate because physicians rarely change
specialties and a fixed effects specification would not provide sufficient identification. Three versions of a random
effects specification have been run: pooled OLS with clustered errors, maximum likelihood random effects and



                                                                                                           23
         Results for waiting times and fees in the pooled OLS specification for the full sample are

shown in Table 4. Waiting times exhibit the most significant and interesting market adjustment.

The gender-specific within-OB/GYN waiting time differential is 1.27 weeks, highly significant

with a p-value less than 0.0005 (column 1).42 This gender-specific within-OB/GYN coefficient

of more than one week is in addition to the significant gender coefficient of 0.38 weeks. The

inclusion of time interactions changes the coefficient only slightly, showing that the coefficient is

slightly higher in 1991 (column 2). Since the waiting time is the time from an initial phone call

to the physician's office to the soonest available appointment with that physician, it represents

the length of the queue.43 This differential indicates that patients do in fact wait longer for an

appointment with a female OB/GYN, as one method of paying for this desirable good.                               Patients

should be willing to wait to the point where the marginal cost of waiting equals the marginal

benefit of seeing a female OB/GYN rather than a male OB/GYN. It appears that in this case

patients are able to pay higher time prices by waiting nearly a week and a half longer to see a

female OB/GYN.

         The results for standard fees are also interesting. The gender-specific within-OB/GYN

fee differential is $3.77, which is almost significant with a p-value of 0.13 (column 1).44 Since a

physician's standard fee is his or her usual fee for a normal visit with an established patient, the

differential indicates that female patients do in fact pay more money to see a female OB/GYN

rather than a male OB/GYN. Furthermore, this effect is specific to OB/GYN and not uniform



feasible generalized least squares. The results are robust to the choice of specification, and also confirm the OLS
results discussed in the paper.
42
   This differential is similar in a Tobit specification. A Tobit specification is employed for waiting times because
many physicians appear to report actual waiting times of zero days (which have been recoded into weeks). The
Tobit appropriately corrects for left truncation at zero. There appears to be little difference in the results. It also
might be expected that waiting time results would be non-linear as waiting times become excessively large, but no
correction has been made for such non-linearity. It does not appear to be a significant issue.
43
   Note that this is the waiting time until the first available appointment for a new patient, so it represents the length
of the queue for new patients only. The standard fee, on the other hand, is a recurring event.
44
   This effect is slightly sensitive to the specification, but is similar in all three random effects specifications.

                                                                                                               24
across specialties: the market for physician services does appear to allow money prices to adjust

competitively, at least somewhat. In addition to paying higher time prices, patients are able to

pay higher money prices to obtain the more desirable good.                      However, inclusion of time

interactions shows that this effect is almost entirely confined to 1987: the gender-specific within-

OB/GYN coefficient in column 2 is $4.81, while the interaction with the 1991 dummy is –$4.87.

Thus, it appears that by 1991 patients are not paying higher money prices to see a female

OB/GYN.

Segregating by contract arrangement: what is the role of market restrictions?

        Contract arrangements clearly restrict the flexibility of physicians' fees. In a contract

arrangement we would expect the low flexibility of fees in response to patient demand to

produce a larger adjustment of waiting times. On the other hand, for those physicians not in

contract arrangements, we would expect the relatively high flexibility of the fees in response to

patient demand to produce smaller adjustment of waiting times and larger adjustment of fees. To

test this hypothesis, I rerun the above model segregated by whether a physician does or does not

have a contract arrangement of any kind.45 A contract arrangement is defined as an HMO, a

PPO, or an IPA.46 The percentage of physicians of each gender who do or do not have such

contract arrangements is shown in Table 7. These percentages are similar for men and women,

and rise steeply from 35% in 1987 to 87% in 1997, reflecting the advent of managed-care. It is

important for this analysis that the time period considered is one in which both methods of

physician reimbursement coexisted (rather than earlier years when managed care was a minor




45
   I run separate regression segregated by contract arrangement (rather than including interactions with contract
arrangement) because there are reasons to expect that many aspects of the labor market are different inside and
outside of contract arrangements.
46
   The definition of various types of contract arrangements has evolved over time. Possibly more importantly,
physicians' knowledge of these definitions has become more accurate. For these reasons, it seems most accurate to
use a variable indicating any type of contract arrangement rather than a specific type of arrangement.

                                                                                                       25
presence or later years when managed care came to be nearly universal.) Table 7 confirms that

this is the case.

        The results shown in Table 4 directly confirm the hypothesis that waiting times will

adjust for physicians in contract arrangements, whereas fees will adjust for physicians not in

contract arrangements. Columns 3 and 5 of Table 4 show the results for physicians with no

contract arrangement and physicians with a contract arrangement, respectively.                Among

physicians who have no contract arrangement, standard fees for female OB/GYNs are $10.67

higher than their male counterparts’. At the same time, their waiting times are slightly higher but

insignificantly so – the coefficient is 0.76 weeks, with a standard error of 0.48.             These

physicians, not constrained by contract arrangements, are able to charge higher fees for their

more desirable services, and their appointments are not rationed by waiting times. The standard

fee effect is more than twice that found when all physicians, regardless of contract arrangement,

are included.

        Among physicians who do have contract arrangements, the story is exactly the reverse.

Standard fees for female OB/GYNs are insignificantly higher than those of male OB/GYNs,

while their waiting times are 1.59 weeks longer. These physicians, constrained by contract

arrangements, appear to be unable to charge higher fees, and simply have much longer waiting

times. They do not appear to gain monetarily from the excess demand for their services, and

their visits seem to be rationed by waiting times.

        Thus, patients who go to physicians without contract arrangements pay more money to

see a female OB/GYN while patients who go to physicians with contract arrangements pay more

time to see a female OB/GYN. The percentage premium for fees is approximately 20% whereas

the percentage premium for waiting times is close to 80%. Patients pay in whatever manner the

contract arrangement permits. Physicians do not earn money directly from waiting times, and

                                                                                         26
only physicians not in contract arrangements receive higher fees for their desirable services. The

elasticities of patient demand with respect to these two different prices are probably different, but

unfortunately the current data do not permit identification of these elasticities. However, in light

of the literature indicating patients' low willingness to pay for medical care and their strong sense

of entitlement to medical care, it is not surprising that patients pay proportionately smaller

money premia as compared with time premia. It is also important to remember that these are not

straightforward prices: patients pay very little of the money price directly (much is paid by

insurance companies), and the waiting time price is a complex combination of inconvenience,

impatience, and possibly deteriorating health.

Changes between 1987 and 1991

       The inclusion of interactions with the time dummy shows that these results carry through

for 1991 (columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table 4). For waiting times, in the full sample, the significant

differential is changed only slightly (1.14 plus 0.29). Furthermore, the waiting time differentials

remain consistent with the institutional story, but the contrast between non-contracted and

contracted physicians is neither as large nor as significant in 1991 as in 1987.       For fees, the

differential in the full sample is negative and insignificant in 1991 (a net effect of -0.06). The

results by contract arrangement are not significantly changed: the contrast between non-

contracted and contracted physicians may have widened somewhat, but the change is imprecisely

estimated.

       Overall, the evidence in 1991 shows that patients are still paying higher time prices, but

are no longer paying significantly higher money prices, to see a female OB/GYN. These results

could very well be related to the high penetration of managed care in 1991. Even for physicians

not in contract arrangements, by 1991 more and more fees were centrally set by insurance

companies. In addition, there were many fewer non-contracted physicians, and it is reasonable

                                                                                           27
to assume that there may have been selection effects between non-contracted and contracted

status. It is also possible that there were selection effects for patients: as more patients got their

health care through contracted physicians, those who remained with non-contracted physicians

may have been more likely to have strong preferences about the provision of their care. Both

types of selection – physician and patient – among different health plans are well documented in

the literature, and might contribute to the attenuation of the waiting time differential by 1991.

B. Income Measures

Results for the Full Sample

       We might expect female OB/GYNs to earn higher incomes for two reasons. First, we

saw above that in some cases they charge higher fees. This may carry over to higher incomes.

Second, physicians in some contract arrangements may be paid at least partially on a salaried

basis rather than fee basis, and employers may recruit female OB/GYNs by offering them higher

salaries. The data provide support for both of these stories. The results for annual, weekly, and

hourly income are shown in Table 5.          They show an insignificant gender-specific within-

OB/GYN premium of 8% in annual income and a significant premium of 13% in weekly income.

However, because the overall female differential is -26% in annual income and -22% in weekly

income, female OB/GYNs still earn less than male OB/GYNs. There is thus mild evidence that

women in OB/GYN earn differentially more than women in other specialties: while women in

other specialties earn approximately 22% less weekly income than men in those specialties,

women in OB/GYN earn approximately 9% less. It appears that women in OB/GYN may gain

some income from the excess preference for the service they provide. They close the gender

income gap partially, but not completely.

By contract arrangement




                                                                                           28
       Segregation by contract arrangement provides some additional insight into the gender

income differentials. Among physicians who have no contract arrangement, there is no gender-

specific within OB/GYN differential in annual income. For weekly income, however, the effect

is positive and insignificant: 15% with a standard error of 10%. Adding these to the overall

gender differential, among non-contracted physicians, women in OB/GYN earn 20% less annual

income but only 5% less weekly income than men in OB/GYN (controlling for other

characteristics). This 5% differential in weekly income is remarkably small: female physicians'

weekly incomes are much closer to those of their male counterparts within OB/GYN than they

are in other specialties. Given that this differential is much smaller for weekly incomes, one

possibility is that non-contracted female OB/GYNs choose to use their slightly higher standard

fees to increase their weekly income while slightly reducing the number of weeks they work,

keeping their annual income unchanged. However, these results are not statistically significant,

and should therefore be viewed as merely suggestive rather than conclusive.

       Among physicians who do have a contract arrangement, there are significant within-

OB/GYN gender differentials of 14% in annual income and 14% in weekly income. Among

contracted physicians, female OB/GYNs also earn higher incomes than women in other

specialties. Their incomes are still approximately 14% lower than those of contracted men in

OB/GYN, but this is the smallest gender gap within any specialty.             Thus, in contract

arrangements, female OB/GYNs definitively reduce the gender gaps in both annual and weekly

income by more than one-half.

       These results – that female OB/GYNs close the gender gap both outside and inside of

contract arrangements – lend support to the common beliefs among physicians that female

OB/GYNs both make larger incomes in private practice and are sought after by managed-care

employers with offers of higher salaries. These results provide some support for the hypothesis

                                                                                      29
that female OB/GYNs’ bargaining power works both on patients and on employers. It appears

that, while bargaining with patients may yield longer waiting times and slightly higher fees,

neither of these translates directly into increasing income substantially. On the other hand,

bargaining with employers in managed care contracts appears to yield more tangible effects on

income.

       Furthermore, the inclusion of time interactions (columns 2, 4, and 6) suggests that, for

physicians not in contract arrangements, the net gender income premia within OB/GYN might

actually be positive by 1991. These effects of greater than 10% in annual and weekly income are

far from statistically significant, however, so should be treated as suggestive only. It is possible

that, by 1991, female OB/GYNs not in contract arrangements are quite able to translate larger fee

differentials (suggested in column 4 of Table 4) into larger annual and weekly incomes

(suggested in column 4 of Table 5). For female OB/GYNs in contract arrangements, the results

for 1991 are not significantly different from the results for 1987.

       Lastly, the analysis of hourly income shows small and insignificant within-OB/GYN

gender differentials. The coefficients do suggest that female OB/GYNs might have received

slightly higher hourly incomes by 1991, particularly outside of contract arrangements.

C. Quantities: Patients and Hours

Results for the Full Sample

       In addition to charging higher fees, female OB/GYNs could be making this extra income

by seeing more patients each week or working more hours each week. This is confirmed by the

data, as shown in Table 6.       The gender-specific within-OB/GYN coefficient shows a 19%

premium for patients and a 15% premium for hours. When these coefficients are added to the

overall gender differentials of -16% and -23%, female OB/GYNs see similar numbers of patients

as male OB/GYNs (3% more) and work slightly fewer hours (8% fewer). The salient point is

                                                                                          30
that, while female physicians normally see fewer patients and work fewer hours, female

OB/GYNs see approximately the same number of patients and work almost the same hours.

Female OB/GYNs may be meeting excess demand by seeing more patients and working slightly

more hours each week.

By contract arrangement

       The results for patients and hours are not significantly affected by the segregation by

contract arrangement.     The results from the complete sample carry through: while female

physicians normally see fewer patients and work fewer hours than male physicians, female

OB/GYNs both inside and outside of contract arrangements see similar numbers of patients and

work similar hours.       There is some weak evidence that female OB/GYNs in contract

arrangements see slightly fewer patients and that female OB/GYNs not in contract arrangements

work slightly fewer hours, but this is not significant.



VI. Discussion

       The results just presented provide substantial insight into the question at hand: how does

the imperfectly competitive market for OB/GYN services clear in the short run in the face of an

excess demand for female OB/GYNs? The results indicate that female patients do in fact pay

higher time and money prices to see female OB/GYNs rather than male OB/GYNs.                 The

adjustment of waiting times is much larger than that of standard fees: the waiting time premium

is approximately 58% (a 1.3 premium on top of a male waiting time of 2.2) whereas the standard

fee differential is approximately 10% ($3.8 on top of $40). Patients are more able and/or willing

to pay with time than with money, and these time prices do adjust. At the same time, fees adjust

slightly and female OB/GYNs may earn slightly more income per week than they otherwise




                                                                                       31
would.    They also work almost the same hours and see almost as many patients as male

OB/GYNs, whereas female physicians usually work fewer hours and see fewer patients.

         How well do these various differentials explain the within-OB/GYN gender differentials

in income? On average, female OB/GYNs work 8% fewer hours, see 3% more patients, and

charge 8% higher standard fees. So, if we calculate a predicted weekly income as the product of

hours and fees, the gender differential should be about zero. If we calculate predicted weekly

income as the product of patients and fees, the gender differential should be a positive 11%.

However, in reality the gender differential in weekly income is a negative 9%. It is plausible that

factors other than revenue generated from standard appointments are contributing to income and

can explain this discrepancy. One possibility is that, while women may be able to charge higher

fees for a given task, they perform a less expensive mix of tasks and thereby generate less

income. Women may choose to work a more standard week with less time on-call, and therefore

do more standard office visits and fewer middle-of-the-night expensive procedures.               This

different mix of tasks might explain the gap between actual weekly income and weekly income

that would be predicted from multiplying number of patients seen per week times the standard

fee to see a patient in a routine office visit. This is also supported by the fact that the net gender

gap within OB/GYN is smaller for physicians in contract arrangements, who might be expected

to have less flexibility in their choice of work schedule or procedure mix.47

         Thus, while it is true that female OB/GYNs are charging slightly higher fees and are

gaining higher weekly income from the excess demand for their services, they are not fully

closing the gap. Although they do command higher prices, they do not appear to be capturing

the full value of the rents they generate. Figure 3 illustrates this with a simple supply-demand

model for the market for female OB/GYN services. Like Figures 1a and 1b, the graph shows




                                                                                           32
price (both fee and wait) on the vertical axis and quantity on the horizontal axis. The excess

demand present at the initial fee (the fee for a male physician), Fee0, is shown by the length of

line ae. The lost consumer and producer surplus in this initial case is shown by the entire area

A+B+C+D+E. Now assume that the market allows some adjustment of female OB/GYN fees

relative to male OB/GYN fees, and some increase in the quantity of female OB/GYN visits. The

equilibrium quantity is marked as Q*, while the equilibrium prices are marked as Fee* and

Wait*.       A small adjustment of female OB/GYN fees, ΔFee, does slightly reduce the welfare

losses due to market inefficiency. Patients wait slightly less and gain area A in the value of time

saved, while female physicians charge slightly higher fees and gain area D in the form of higher

income. Due to the limited quantity adjustment and the limited flexibility of fees, however, there

is still significant waste. Patients pay with both time and money (they pay Fee* + Wait*) and

spend significant time waiting (area B+C). The cost imposed on the patient of the higher time

price is, however, not clear: some patients may find it inconveniences them very little to wait an

extra week. On the other hand, physicians do not receive payment for the full value of their

services (they only receive Fee* x Q*, and lose the area C). While these losses are first-order,

there is also a second-order deadweight loss (area E). Overall, female OB/GYNS appropriate

only a small portion of the rents created by their scarcity value.

           Segregating physicians by whether or not they have a contract arrangement adds more

structure to the main results. Female patients do pay higher time and money prices to see female

OB/GYNs rather than male OB/GYNs.                        However, the fees of physicians in contract

arrangements are inflexible or nonexistent.                Therefore, patients seeing physicians in such

arrangements do not pay higher money prices but do pay significantly higher time prices, on the

order of two weeks more.                On the other hand, patients seeing physicians not in such

47
     Further work will use detailed data (obtained from ACOG) on the practice patterns of OB/GYNs to investigate

                                                                                                        33
arrangements do pay higher money prices but do not wait significantly longer. The flexibility of

fees outside of contract arrangements allows the market to equilibrate almost entirely through

money prices rather than time prices.

        However, this does not mean that female OB/GYNs in contract arrangements receive no

benefits from the excess demand for their services. Even though female OB/GYNs in contract

arrangements cannot charge higher fees for their more desirable services, they do receive an

income premium. Their incomes are closer to those of male OB/GYNs than they would be in

other specialties. Both inside and outside of contract arrangements, female OB/GYNs have

weekly incomes closer to those of their male counterparts than they would in other specialties.

They also work similar hours and see similar numbers of patients per week. Female OB/GYNs

in contract arrangements appear to close the gender gap with higher salaries, while those outside

of such arrangements close the gap with higher fees. However, as stated above, although they

capture some of the increased value they provide, they almost certainly do not capture all of it.

        On the patient side, the appropriate interpretation of the waiting time price is also

intriguing: to what extent is this actually a cost imposed on patients? In many countries with

national health insurance, time prices are one of the primary mechanisms by which health care

goods are allocated. If waiting times are costless and equally so for different groups, this could

be an efficient and equitable to allocate goods and provide a relatively easy way to reduce moral

hazard. However, if the waiting times are in fact very burdensome to patients, or if waiting times

are distributed inequitably, this mechanism could be both inefficient and inequitable. The results

of this paper imply that, as money prices play an increasingly smaller role in the allocation of

health care in the United States, we may see similar allocative inefficiencies and inequities arise.




these hypotheses.

                                                                                          34
VI. Conclusion

       I began this paper by arguing that the increase in demand for female OB/GYNs has

outpaced the increase in supply and asking what outcomes this excess demand would produce

given that the market for physicians’ services is imperfectly competitive. The answer is that

female patients pay both higher time and higher money prices to see female OB/GYNs rather

than male OB/GYNs. The adjustment of waiting times is much larger than that of standard fees,

and the relative price adjustments differ by contract arrangement in precisely the ways that

theory would predict. When money prices are sticky or nonexistent, patients pay with time.

When money prices can adjust, patients pay with money and do not pay with higher waiting

times. For physicians, this means that female OB/GYNs outside of contract arrangements can

more directly reap the benefits of the higher demand for their services. However, female

OB/GYNs subject to contract arrangements also appear to earn an income premium, possibly as

a result of reportedly aggressive and preferential recruitment by health care organizations.

       Thus, in some manner, prices adjust to equilibrate the high relative demand for female

physicians with the low relative supply.      The market for physicians’ services is far from

competitive, and it reaches equilibrium in a complex manner that includes the adjustment of non-

traditional prices and an important role for health care institutions.        Outside of contract

arrangements, patients pay more money for the desired services. Inside contract arrangements,

patients are unable to pay with money and therefore pay with time.            Either way, female

OB/GYNs appear to earn higher incomes relative to male OB/GYNs than they would if they

were in another specialty. However, they do not appear to capture the full value of the preferred

good they provide. Since much of the adjustment occurs on waiting times, patients pay in time

but little monetary payment is transferred to the physician. Gender discrimination on the part of

patients alleviates gender gaps among physicians partially, but not completely.                Market

                                                                                         35
adjustment occurs but is incomplete. If unfettered markets generally do a good job allocating

goods, this situation is an example of a restricted market that does not do a particularly good job

allocating goods. In this case, both patients and physicians lose out due to market rigidities. The

larger implications for the matching of patients to physicians and the optimal allocation of health

care goods, as well for gender discrimination in professional occupations, are of great interest

and will be the subject of further work.

Table 4 (Continued).


Notes to Table 4. Regressions shown are pooled ordinary least squares on the sample
of new observations on physicians in the 1987 and 1991 Young Physicians Surveys.
(They do not include observations from the 1997 sample nor repeat observations in
1991 on physicians who were first interviewed in 1987.) Standard errors are Huber-
White robust and are shown in parentheses. Significance levels are indicated by ** for p-
values less than 5% and * for p-values less than 10%. All models include controls for:
sex, age, race, region (northeast, south, midwest, west), a quadratic in experience, a
married dummy, a parent dummy, large specialty category (as listed in Appendix Table
1: general family practice, general internal medicine, specialty with no reported
subspecialties, medical subspecialty, general surgery, surgical specialty/subspecialty,
pediatrics, OB/GYN, radiology, psychiatry, anesthesiology, pathology, other), interaction
of the female dummy with the OB/GYN dummy, dummies for AMA membership and for
board certification, and practice setting dummies indicating private practice, a contract
arrangement, and salaried pay, and a dummy for 1991. Practice setting dummies are
omitted in specifications that are segregated by contract arrangement. The base case
is a male physician in general practice in the Northeast in 1987. The models shown
in columns 2, 4, and 6 include a dummy for 1991 and the interaction of that dummy with
the following variables: female, OB/GYN, female*OB/GYN, the region dummies, the
married dummy, the parent dummy, and other specialty dummies. Column 2 includes
the interaction of the 1991 dummy with the contract arrangement variable. All dollar
values are in 1986 dollars. Models are weighted by weights designed to adjust for
differential response rates within the eligible sample across identifiable sample
subgroups and selection of an oversample of black and Hispanic individuals. These
weights were provided by the Principal Investigator. More detail on the construction of
these weights can be found in the codebooks for the data sets. Weights were made
consistent across the different years of data by a similar procedure.

Notes. Panel A: Each value shown in Panel A is the raw gender differential, i.e. the
coeffficient on the female dummy in the regression of log annual income on the female dummy
and a constant. Panel B: Each value shown in Panel B is the portion explained by differences
in characteristics, applying the same returns to characteristics for both men and women. The
columns show the use of uniform coefficients, male coefficients, and female coefficients
respectively. In panel B, three sets of characteristics are used: i) specialty dummies: dummies
for 13 large specialty categories as listed in Appendix Table 1; ii) variables for practice setting
(private practice, a contract arrangement, and salaried pay) and contract type; iii)
demographics: age, race, region (northeast, south, midwest, west), a quadratic in experience,
a married dummy, a parent dummy, number of children, hours worked per week, patients seen
per week, AMA membership, board certification, and malpractice claim ever. All regressions
are weighted by weights designed to adjust for differential response rates within the eligible
sample across identifiable sample subgroups and selection of an oversample of black and
Hispanic individuals. These weights were provided by the Principal Investigator. More detail
on the construction of these weights can be found in the codebooks for the YPS data sets.
Weights were made uniform across the different years of data by a similar procedure.

      Notes. Data is from the Young Physicians Survey 1987 and Young Physicians Survey 1991. Values for 1991 include only new respondents.
      Means are shown, with standard deviations in parentheses. Means are weighted by weights designed to adjust for differential response rates
      within the eligible sample across identifiable sample subgroups and selection of an oversample of black and Hispanic individuals. These
      weights were provided by the Principal Investigator. More detail on the construction of these weights can be found in the codebooks for the data
      sets.
