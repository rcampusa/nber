                                              ABSTRACT

When a major study finds that a widely used medical treatment is no better than a less expensive alternative,
do physicians stop using it? Policymakers hope that comparative effectiveness research will identify
less expensive substitutes for widely-used treatments, but physicians may be reluctant to abandon
profitable therapies. We examine the impact of the COURAGE trial, which found that medical therapy
is as effective as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for patients with stable angina, on practice
patterns. Using hospital discharge data from US community, Veterans Administration, and English
hospitals, we detect a moderate decline in PCI volume post-COURAGE. However, many patients
with stable angina continue to receive PCI. We do not find differences in PCI volume trends by reimbursement
scheme or hospitals’ teaching status, ownership, or degree of vertical integration.

      When a major study finds that a widely used medical treatment is no better
than a less expensive alternative, do physicians stop using it? The Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (i.e., the health reform bill) includes a dedicated
funding stream for comparative effectiveness research, which subjects competing
treatments to head-to-head trials, of approximately $500 million annually. The
premise behind comparative effectiveness research is that expensive treatments
often diffuse into clinical practice without evidence that they are better than
existing therapies (Chandra et al. 2011). Policymakers hope that comparative
effectiveness studies will identify ineffective but costly treatments, leading to cost
savings. However, it is unclear how evidence from comparative effectiveness
research studies, and studies that report “negative” results in particular, influence
medical treatment patterns. The same factors that promote rapid adoption of new
medical technologies – fee for service reimbusement, third party payment, etc.
(Emanuel and Fuchs 2008) – may retard the abandonment of widely-used
technologies found to be ineffective.
      Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is an invasive procedure to open
clogged coronary arteries. Medicare spent over $5 billion on PCIs in 2005
(Committee on Finance 2010). In 1999 the Department of Veterans Affairs initiated
a multi-million dollar study, the COURAGE trial, to compare PCI and medical
therapy versus an inexpensive regimen of medical therapy alone in patients with
stable angina. The study, which was published in April 2007 in the New England
Journal of Medicine (Boden et al. 2007), found that the treatments were equivalent
in terms of survival time and heart attack risk. In this paper, we assess the impact
of the widely-publicized COURAGE trial on the abandonment of PCI as a treatment
for stable angina. We also compare trends in PCI volume between 1) health systems
where cardiologists are compensated via fee-for-service and systems where
cardiologists are salaried and 2) hospital organizational environments that may
affect physicians’ responsiveness to negative evidence. While it is difficult to

                                           3
precisely identify the impact of the COURAGE trial in light of pre-existing trends,
our results suggest that 1) COURAGE had a small-to-moderate impact on practice
patterns and 2) many patients with stable coronary disease continue to receive PCI
as primary therapy.


2. Technological abandonment


2.1 Adoption and abandonment


      New medical technology is responsible for most of the growth in health care
spending (Newhouse 1992). Naturally, there is an extensive literature on technology
diffusion in health care. Few papers address technological abandonment, either in
health care or non-health care settings.1 Abandonment may be uncommon outside
of health care settings because unsuccessful innovations are quickly jettisoned and
only successful innovations are widely adopted. In health care, by contrast, many
technologies diffuse into clinical practice without evidence of benefit (Fuchs 1968;
1986). Given that randomized controlled trials are costly and the knowledge they
produce is a public good, production of evidence will be suboptimal (Murphy and
Topel 2006), a market failure that federally- sponsored comparative effectiveness
research is designed to address.
      A number of factors may push physicians to adopt untested therapies,
including reimbursement incentives, manufacturer’s marketing efforts, a desire to
achieve prestige through technology acquisition, and a cultural faith in
technological progress (Emanuel and Fuchs 2008; Teplensky et al. 1995).2
      Once adopted, unproven technologies often remain in use. Most models of
adoption under uncertainty assume that producers eventually learn whether the

1 Technological abandonment refers to instances where a technology is replaced by
an older, pre-existing treatment alternative or technology.
2 David Eddy (1984), an early advocate of comparative effectiveness research, has

described the prevaling mindset as “When in doubt, do it”.
                                          4
new technology is better than the old one (Young 2009), but physicians may never
learn about the effectiveness of new treatments absent large randomized controlled
trials. Patient outcomes are variable, making it difficult to draw inferences about
effectiveness based on the patient panel of a single physician or hospital. In
situations where patients receive treatment in one setting but follow-up care in
another, physicians may not even observe outcomes in their own patient
populations.


2.2 Reimbursement incentives


      Comparative effectiveness studies that pool patients from multiple providers
can overcome the inherent limitations of inferring treatment effects based on the
historical experience of a single physician or hospital. Physicians’ incentives to act
on new information vary based on how they are compensated. Barros and Martínez-
Giralt (2010) model adoption of a new technology under different reimbursement
arrangements assuming that providers value their own financial performance and
patient health. They show that when providers earn higher margins on the new
technology, they may adopt the treatment even if it provides no benefit to patients.
      Under Medicare’s resource based relative value scale, which is widely used by
private payers in the US, payments for PCI are higher than payments for medical
management. Medicare’s 2011 payment to a physician for insertion of a stent is
$873 (Current Procedural Terminology code 92980). The payment for an office visit
for medical management is about $54 (code 90862). Comparing these payments does
not precisely represent the incentives facing physicians – physicians may bill for
multiple services during a PCI and patients on medication may require multiple




                                           5
visits – but it does give a sense of the magnitude of the difference in reimbursement
levels.3,4
       The market for PCI is particularly prone to physician-induced demand.
Cardiologists often act as both diagnosticians and proceduralists. Patients with
stable angina are referred for diagnostic imaging to define both the extent and
severity of obstructive coronary artery disease. The imaging process requires that
patients undergo cardiac catheterization. Once the patient has been prepped,
anesthetized, and the cardiologist has established arterial access, it is relatively
straightforward to perform PCI. Some observers argue that this process leads to a
“diagnostic-therapeutic cascade” where patients initially brought in for evaluation
end up undergoing PCI.5 Because PCI often immediately follows diagnosis, patients
and insurers have relatively little input into the care process.
       Most empirical analyses find evidence consistent with the prediction that low
powered reimbursement schemes (e.g. fee-for-service) are associated with greater
use of technology. A study of the diffusion of PCI and bypass surgery for heart
attack patients in industrialized countries found that diffusion tended to be more
rapid in countries where reimbursement systems favor adoption (Bech et al. 2009;
TECH Research Network 2001).6 Baker and Phibbs (2002), Baker and Wheeler




3 Medicare and other insurers make payments to physician groups, not individual
physicians. However, most cardiology groups closely link physician compensation
with procedure volume.
4 PCI is performed in hospitals while medical therapy is administered in physicians’

offices, and so, hospitals benefit when physicians recommend PCI. Medicare
hospital payments for PCI range from $10,000 to $18,000. Federal law prohibits
hospitals from providing monetary incentives to non-employed physicians for
referring patients, but they can offer marketing and support services that serve as
subtler inducements to recommend hospital-based care.
5 Cardiologists jokingly refer to the “oculostenotic reflex” that causes them to

automatically perform PCI once the see evidence of a blockage (i.e. stenosis).
6 Baker and Wheeler (1998) find that the number of MRI machines per capita was

negatively associated with the market share of health maintenance organizations in
the mid 1990s. It is unclear if the correlation is driven by reimbursement policies,
                                           6
(1998), and Mas and Seinfeld (2008) report that managed care slowed the adoption
of cost-increasing medical technologies, though Baker and Spetz (1999) find no
evidence of a managed care effect. Studies of the impact of the Medicare prospective
payment system on technology adoption and use report mixed effects (Acemoglu and
Finkelstein 2008; Kane and Manoukian 1989; Sloan et al. 1988), possibly reflecting
the complex set of incentives inherent in the payment scheme (McClellan 1997).


2.3 Organizational form


      Another factor that may retard abandonment of ineffective technologies is
organizational fragmentation in the health system. Physician practice is organized
around single specialty groups. Many observers have remarked that under this
arrangement, physicians do not focus on the “whole patient”. Rather, organizations
in health care are organized around delivering specific medical technologies
(Enthoven and Tollen 2005; Schroeder and Showstack 1977). For example,
cardiologists deliver PCI. Specialists may be reluctant to abandon the technologies
that help to define their specialty.
      Integrated health systems that are able to provide multiple treatments may
display more flexibility in responding to comparative effectiveness research,
especially in cases where patients in non-integrated systems must cross
organizational boundaries to access alternative treatments.
      Counteracting this effect, integrated delivery systems that are subject to fee-
for-service reimbursement may encourage its physicians to engage in “self referral”.
In the case of stable angina, an integrated system could increase its revenues by
promoting referrals from primary care physicians and non-interventional
cardiologists to interventional cardiologists. Studies of the entry of physician-owned
cardiac specialty hospitals (Barro et al. 2006; Mitchell 2007; Nallamothu et al. 2007;


other forms of cost control (e.g., utilization review), or unobserved market
characteristics.
                                           7
MedPAC 2006) and 1990s-era physician-hospital alignment (Madison 2004; Cuellar
and Gertler 2006) find that integration is associated with increased volume and
treatment intensity. For this reason, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
severely limits entry of new physician-owned specialty hospitals.
      Other characteristics of providers may influence their receptivity to negative
results. Private hospitals (especially for-profits), for example, have a strong
incentive to invest in innovation that might be difficult to relinquish because of
sunk costs (Grossman and Hart 1986; Hart 1995; Hart, Shleifer and Vishny 1997).
Physicians practicing in for-profit hospitals may be less willing to abandon lucrative
treatments. Hospitals whose mission involves educating the next generation of
physicians, i.e. teaching hospitals, or those that specialize in cardiac care might be
more receptive to studies that demonstrate “best practice” treatment options.


2.4 Empirical evidence


      Few studies have examined the impact of comparative effectiveness research
studies reporting negative results.7 Duffy and Farley (1992) describe the impact of
negative trial results on use of intermittent positive pressure breathing therapy as
a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. They found that use was
slow to decline, and many patients continued to receive the therapy four years after
the results were published. Stafford et al. (2006) studied abandonment of costly
calcium channel blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors for patients
with hypertension following negative trial results. They found that evidence had a
“modest” effect on use but many patients continued to receive these drugs as first-
line therapy. A high profile 2002 study failed to find evidence of a benefit of
arthroscopy for osteoarthritis of the knee (Moseley et al. 2002). There was a slight


7The impact of disclosure of previously unknown side effects on abandonment has
been widely studied. Here, we restrict attention to the impact of trials that report
equivalence results.
                                           8
decline in use in England and Ontario between 2002 and 2004 in patients with a
diagnosis of osteoarthritis, though there were increases in the use of the procedure
for other diagnoses (Hawker et al. 2008). Howard et al. (forthcoming) report that
use of high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell
transplantation declined rapidly following the release of negative clinical trial
results.


3. The COURAGE trial


      Chronic stable angina is characterized by chest pain during exertion caused
by a narrowing of the coronary arteries. Treatment options include
revascularization via PCI or a low cost regimen of medical therapy and lifestyle
modification. PCI entails cardiac catheterization, use of balloon angioplasty to
mechanically open the artery, and, in most cases, placement of a stent to maintain
blood flow. The Department of Veterans Affairs-sponsored Clinical Outcomes Using
Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial randomized
2,287 patients with stable angina to receive optimal medical therapy alone or PCI
plus medical therapy between 1999 and 2004.
      The main finding from COURAGE was that there was no difference between
treatment arms in all-cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The
results, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in April
2007, were widely publicized and “shook the world of cardiology” (Winstein 2010).8
      A subsequent analysis found that while patients in the PCI arm experienced
earlier resolution of symptoms, quality of life was no different after 3 years
(Weintraub 2008). Based on COURAGE results, Weintraub et al. (2008) calculate



8 Some cardiologists have questioned the external generalizability of the COURAGE
trial and its relevance to current cardiology practice (Curzen 2010).We do not wish
to weigh in on this debate, except to note that specialists may be more likely to
scrutinze studies that will potentially result in revenue-reducing practice changes.
                                           9
that lifetime costs for stable ischemic heart disease patients treated with PCI are
over $9,000 higher than for patients treated with optimal medical therapy alone.
      Prominent cardiologists perceive that fee-for-service reimbursement is a
major obstacle to implementing the COURAGE results. Peterson and Rumsfeld
(2008) write: “[The COURAGE trial] underscores a major challenge to clinicians —
how to successfully execute a strategy of optimal medical therapy in a health care
system that provides strong financial incentives for PCI but few rewards for careful
management of medications.” The principal investigator of the COURAGE trial, Dr.
William Boden, echoed these sentiments: “What’s going to continue to drive practice
is reimbursement,” (Winstein 2010).
      A handful of studies have examined the impact of the COURAGE trial and
the appropriateness of care for patients with stable angina. An analysis of data from
10 hospitals in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont found that there was a 16%
decline in PCI volume post-COURAGE (Ahmed et al. 2011). The proportion of
patients receiving PCI who had a diagnosis of stable angina (i.e. the target
population of the COURAGE trial) declined from 21% to 16%. Borden et al. (2011)
analyzed changes in the use of optimal medical therapy in patients undergoing PCI
before and after publication of the COURAGE trial. He found that there was a 1
percentage point increase in receipt of medical therapy post-COURAGE. The study
restricted attention to patients receiving PCI and did not report trends in PCI
volume. Chan et al. (2011) used a rating system to assess the appropriateness of
PCIs performed at 1,091 US hospitals between July 1, 2009, and September 30,
2010. Of the 500,154 procedures they examined, 144,737 (29%) were for stable
angina. Of these, 72,911 (50%) were rated as “appropriate”, 54,988 (38%) were rated
as “uncertain”, and 16,838 (12%) were rated as inappropriate. Only the Ahmed et al.
paper tracks trends in PCI volume over time, but the sample of hospitals is small
and self-selected. Whether COURAGE affected practice patterns in the US and
other health systems remains an open question.

4. Aggregate Trends


4.1 Overview


      Using data capturing discharges from US community hospitals, US Veterans
Administration hospitals, and English National Health Service hospitals, we
analyze trends in PCI volume by indication. In each case, we report the number of
discharges per quarter. The data include records for inpatient PCIs and so-called
“23-hour admissions” for PCI. We identified patients undergoing PCI using
procedure codes. 9 We do not have data on receipt of medical therapy. Medical
therapy is administered on an outpatient basis. It is difficult to identify patients
with stable angina who are receiving medical therapy as an alternative to PCI in
standard claims databases.


4.2 US Community Hospitals


      Figure 1 presents long-run trends in quarterly PCI volume from the National
Hospital Discharge Survey (NHDS), a random sample of hospital discharges in US
community hospitals. The sample size is over 300,000 in most years but, because of
budget cuts, is only 120,000 in 2008. NHDS includes sample weights for producing
national estimates of procedure volume.
      We group patients into two mutually exclusive categories. The “Other
diagnoses, Elective” group includes patients without a diagnosis of AMI where the
admission type was recorded as “Elective”. The “AMI and Other diagnoses, Non-
Elective” group includes all patients with a diagnosis of AMI and patients with
other diagnoses with an “urgent” or “emergency” admission. The first group




9The codes for PCI are 36.01, 36.02, 36.05, 36.06, 36.07, and 36.09. These are often
preceded by code 00.66.
                                           11
includes many patients who would have met the COURAGE inclusion criteria,
though there may be some patients who would have been excluded.
      The data show that PCI volume in the “Other diagnoses, Elective” group
plateaued between 2003 and 2006 but declined rapidly following publication of the
COURAGE trial. There was also a decrease in PCI volume in late 2007 among
patients in the “AMI and Other diagnosis, Non-elective” group (note that the y-axis
for this group is compressed). A paper presented at a September 2006 cardiology
meeting raised concerns about the safety of drug-eluting stents, a device used in a
large share of PCIs.10 Although cardiologists could have substituted bare metal
stents, the findings, which have been contradicted by subsequent research,
temporarily depressed demand for PCI among patients regardless of diagnosis.
      Figure 2 presents PCI volume trends in Arizona, California, Florida,
Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York using the State Inpatient
Discharge databases. These databases capture 100% or close to 100% of hospital
discharges, depending on the state.11
      Arizona, California, Florida, Massachusetts, Maryland, New Jersey, and New
York represent about 35 percent of US population. The average PCI rate per 1,000
fee-for-service Medicare enrollees in these states in 2007, as reported by The
Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care (2011), is 9.8, with a range of 7 (Massachusetts) to
11.9 (Arizona). Nationally, the rate is 10 with a range of 3 (Hawaii) to 14.3
(Arkansas).
      We grouped patients into two categories 1) Stable Angina/Other and 2)
AMI/Unstable angina.12 Patients in the first group include those with a diagnosis of

programs. Presented at Hotline Session I, World Congress of Cardiology 2006,
Barcelona, September 2–5, 2006. abstract.
11 The advantage of using these data, as opposed to databases that randomly

sample hospitals, is that trends in procedure volume are not affected by year-to-
year changes in the sample of hospitals.
12 The ICD-9 codes are AMI: 410.X, and unstable angina: 411.1.

                                          12
stable angina or with a general ischemic heart disease diagnosis code but no
diagnosis of AMI or unstable angina. Stable angina is rarely recorded as a
diagnosis, and so it is not possible to specifically identify these patients. The second
category includes patients with a diagnosis of heart attack (i.e. acute myocardial
infarction [AMI]) or unstable angina. These patients have serious, acute symptoms
that require immediate medical attention.
      Pre-COURAGE, patients with stable angina accounted for one-third of PCI
procedures (Peterson and Rumsfeld 2008), so it likely that a large share of patients
in the Stable Angina/Other group would have satisfied the COURAGE inclusion
criteria. None of the patients in the AMI/Unstable angina would have been
considered candidates for COURAGE.
      Figure 2 shows that PCI volume in the Stable Angina/Other group declined
following publication of the COURAGE trial. For reasons that are unclear, PCI
volume declined between the second and third quarters of 2006. However, based on
the results presented in Figure 1, it does not appear that this was a continuation of
a pre-existing trend.
      PCI volume also declined among patients with a diagnosis of AMI or unstable
angina between the first and second quarters of 2007. The decline may reflect
concerns about the safety of drug-eluting stents or an informational spillover of the
COURAGE trial to excluded patient groups.
      Our reading of the data in Figures 1 and 2 is that publication of the
COURAGE trial led to a decrease in PCI volume. However, many patients with
stable coronary syndrome continue to receive PCI.


4.3 Veterans Administration hospitals


      Figure 3 displays PCI volume trends in Veterans Administration medical
centers. We calculated trends using the Patient Treatment File, a census of
discharges from US Veterans Administration Medical Centers. Like the State

                                           13
Inpatient Discharge databases, the Patient Treatment File includes diagnoses codes
but does not allow us to specifically identify patients meeting the COURAGE trial
inclusion criteria.
      Veterans Administration hospitals are notable in several respects. First,
many Veterans Administration hospitals enrolled patients in the COURAGE trial.
Second, cardiologists in the Veterans Administration are salaried and hospitals are
subject to a global budget. Some cardiologists split their time between Veterans
Administration hospitals and academic medical centers. Their practice styles may
fall in-between the practice patterns of physicians subject to salary or fee-for-service
reimbursement alone.
      The data show that PCI volume declined post-COURAGE in the Stable
angina/Other group but was steady in the AMI/Unstable angina group.


4.4 English hospitals


      Figure 4 displays trends in PCI volume in English hospitals. We calculated
PCI volume using the Hospital Episode Statistics database, a census of discharges
from English National Health Service hospitals. The data include diagnosis codes,
but not other clinical indicators, and capture admissions by private pay patients.
      English cardiologists are salaried. Prior to 2002, hospitals were subject to
budgets. In 2002 the National Health Service adopted a fee-for-service-like
reimbursement scheme, “Payment by Results” that pays hospitals for each
admission, similar to Medicare’s prospective payment system. Based on the trends
depicted in the Figure, it does not appear that the COURAGE trial had an impact
on PCI volume. We discuss this result below.




                                           14
4.5 US-VA-England comparison


         Aggregate trends in PCI volume are summarized in Table 1. The table also
displays PCIs per 100,000 persons age 45 and older in the US and UK populations
and the number of patients admitted with a diagnosis of AMI, a rough measure of
trends and cross-sectional differences in the underlying prevalence of heart disease.
         According to the SID and NHDS, PCI volumes declined between 2006 and
2008 in US community hospitals. The magnitude of the decline in percentage terms
was much larger in the Stable angina/Other and Elective groups.
         PCI rates in the US are much higher than those in England, possibly
reflecting differences in disease prevalence. Banks et al. (2006) report that the
prevalence of heart disease is anywhere from 20% to 50% higher in the US versus
the UK. However, we find that the AMI rate (column 3 of the table) is similar.
Differences in PCI rates may also reflect differences in practice patterns. Heart
attack patients in Canada and the UK are substantially more likely to receive PCI
or surgery compared to patients in the US (Adams et al. 1998; Kaul et al. 2005;
Mark et al. 1994; Rouleau et al. 1993; TECH Research Network 200; Yusef et al.
1998.)
         PCI rates did not decline in England following COURAGE. Pre-COURAGE
PCI rates were lower in England, and so there may have been fewer opportunities
to substitute medical therapy for PCI. Yet, over half the patients undergoing PCI in
the UK receive the procedure for stable angina and other forms of stable coronary
disease (NHS Information Center 2007), and so there are probably many patients
receiving PCI who could be safely treated using medical therapy.
         The impact of COURAGE on PCI volume in England may have been
dampened by capacity constraints. Historically the demand for PCI has exceeded
PCI capacity, resulting in waiting lists. Capacity constraints have a smoothing
effect on realized procedure volume. Not surprisingly, we find that there is little


                                          15
quarter-to-quarter variation in PCI volume in England (Figure 4) compared to the
US (Figure 3).
       If demand exceeds capacity, then a shift from PCI to medical therapy would
show up as a decline in waiting times rather than a change in observed procedure
volume. In our sample, waiting time among patients in the Stable angina/Other
group declined from 53 days in 2006 to 37 days in 2008. Waiting time among
patients with AMI/Unstable angina declined from 49 days to 32 days.


5. Organizational environment


       Hospitals’ organizational environment may affect how physicians responded
to the COURAGE trial. We assess the impact of hospitals’ organizational
environment within the US by linking the State Inpatient Discharge data with
hospital characteristics from the American Hospital Association (AHA) annual
survey from 2006 to 2009. The estimation sample consists of hospital-quarter of
year observations.
       We estimated regression models of the following form:

Where PCI itSA / O and PCI itAMI / UA are the number of PCIs performed in hospital i at time

t in patients with stable angina/other diagnoses and AMI/unstable angina,
respectively. CRGt is an indicator equal to one following publication of the

COURAGE trial, xij are a set of time-invariant hospital characteristics, witk are a set

of time-variant hospital characteristics, i are hospital-specific fixed effects,  t are

year and quarter fixed effects, and  it is an i.i.d. error term.

       Hospital-level PCI volume is highly skewed, and so we chose to specify the
dependent model as a difference, rather than controlling for PCI itAMI / UA on the right

                                                           16
hand side of the regression, to “normalize” the residuals. Hereafter, we refer to the
dependent variable as “relative PCI volume.” Standard errors were adjusted for
clustering using the approach described by Stock and Watson (2008).
      We estimated specifications where observations were weighted by hospital’s
average PCI volume, but results were similar to those from the unweighted
specification, and so we report the unweighted results.
      In this model, the year and quarter indicators capture the macro and
seasonal trends of the PCI volume between 2004 and 2009. The hospital fixed
effects control for any unobserved time-invariant heterogeneity across hospitals.
Table 2 displays summary statistics of the sample, and annual PCI volume by
indication for each type of hospital (pooled across all years).
      The variables of interest are the interaction terms between the COURAGE
indicator and the hospital time-invariant characteristics. As discussed previously,
we expect that physicians in for-profit hospitals may be less likely to abandon
profitable treatments and physicians in teaching hospitals ought to be more
responsive to new evidence. We include indicators for ownership (for-profit, not-for-
profit, government) and for whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, as indicated
by membership in the Council of Teaching Hospitals.13 Physicians practicing in
integrated delivery systems may be better able to switch between alternative
treatments, but may face added pressure to refer patients for profitable treatments.
We include the following indicators to capture this dimension: 1) whether a hospital
is in a joint venture with physicians or physician groups and 2) whether a hospital
is part of a health delivery system with highly centralized physician arrangements.
We also examine whether hospitals that offer cardiac surgery were more or less
responsive to the results of the COURAGE trial. We use this measure, along with
the number of AMI admissions, as proxy for the size of the cardiac care program in


13 We also estimate the model with different definition of teaching hospitals, such as
if the hospital has a resident program, if the hospital is affiliated with a medical
school, and our results are similar using various teaching hospital definition.
                                           17
a given hospital.
      Table 3 displays results. Models 1 through 4 include different hospital
characteristics. Model 5 includes all characteristics. All models include a constant
term, a post-COURAGE indicator, which takes the value of 1 from the 2nd quarter of
2007 onward, and year-specific indicators. The post-COURAGE indicator and the
year-specific indicators combined capture the average impact of the COURAGE
trial. The interactions of the post-COURAGE indicator and hospital characteristics,
which are of primary interest, capture the differential effect of the COURAGE trial
on different types of hospitals.
      We do not find that COURAGE had a differential impact on relative PCI
volume by hospital ownership, teaching status, whether there is a joint venture
with physician groups, and whether the hospital is part of a centralized health
system. On the whole, these results are consistent with previous studies of
abandonment that have failed to identify differential effects of hospital ownership
or teaching status on abandonment rates (Howard et al., forthcoming, Duffy and
Farley 1992), though Duffy and Farley found that hospitals that were part of multi-
hospital systems were quicker to relinquish intermittent positive pressure
breathing therapy.
      Model 4 indicates that there was a larger decline in relative PCI volume in
hospitals that offer cardiac surgery. In addition, there were steeper declines in
relative PCI volume over the study period in hospitals with greater numbers of AMI
admissions. These trends may reflect increases in the number of hospitals offering
PCI and the greater acceptability of performing PCI without having bypass surgery
as a backup. We would expect that new entrants and hospitals that offer PCI
without performing bypass surgery would draw away patients with less serious
forms of cardiac disease from the larger, more established programs. We assessed
this hypothesis by estimating a version of the model with a control variable for the
number of hospitals offering PCI within a given hospital’s market area (defined as
within a 15-mile radius) in each year. The inclusion of this variable did not change

                                          18
the original results. It is also possible that larger cardiac program might have more
resources and a wider variety of care management options to substitute non-
invasive for invasive care.
       We estimated a number of alternative specifications, weighting the
regression by average PCI volume, limiting the sample to hospitals that performed
more than 25 PCIs in 2006, and using the percent of PCIs performed in patients
with stable angina/other indications as the dependent variable. In all cases, results
were similar to those from the baseline model.


6. Conclusion


       If medical practice patterns respond asymetrically to postive and negative
evidence – physicians adopt new treatments based on “positive” results but do not
abandon existing ones following “negative” studies – then comparative effectiveness
research is unlikely to reduce spending and may very well lead to increased costs.
We find, encouragingly, that COURAGE had an impact on the use of PCI within the
US. However, many patients with stable angina continue to receive PCI as primary
therapy, a result confirmed in a recent audit of PCIs performed in 2009 (Chan et al.
2011). There are unexploited opportunities to reduce costs without adversely
affecting outcomes by substituting medical therapy for PCI.
       Prominent cardiologists were pessimistic about the potential impact of
COURAGE in the US given the incentives facing cardiologists. However, we find
that the post-COURAGE decline in PCI volume was larger in US community
hospitals compared to Veterans Administration and English hospitals, where
cardiologists are salaried. It is difficult to interpret differential trends in PCI
volume in light of baseline differences in practice patterns, but the results suggest
that changing reimbursement incentives may not be sufficient to increase the
uptake of comparative effectiveness research studies that report negative results.
At least in the short run, inertia and the preferences of specialists who are

                                            19
professionally invested in use of a particular treatment may exert a larger influence
on practice patterns.
