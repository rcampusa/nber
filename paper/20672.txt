Raising Revenue by Limiting Tax Expenditures

                                             ABSTRACT

Limiting tax expenditures can raise revenue without increasing marginal tax rates. Such a policy is
equivalent to reducing government spending now done as subsidies through the tax code for a wide
range of household spending and income. This paper explores one way of limiting tax expenditures:
a cap on the total reduction in tax liabilities that each individual can achieve by the use of deductions
and exclusions. The analysis describes the revenue effects and the distributional consequences of
such a cap, and examines the sensitivity of these results to various design features.

                 Raising Revenue by Limiting Tax Expenditures

                                  Martin Feldstein1

        The national debt of the United States is now 74 percent of GDP, double what

it was a decade ago. The current annual deficit of about three percent means that

the debt will grow at about the same pace as nominal GDP, keeping the ratio of

debt to GDP unchanged. Although that is likely to continue for the next several

years, the Congressional Budget Office has recently warned us that the debt ratio

will start rising again and will grow to very high levels during the CBO’s

long-term forecast period.2


      More specifically, under the “extended baseline,” the CBO projects that the debt

to GDP ratio will rise during the next two decades to more than 100 percent of GDP.

And when the CBO drops some of the unrealistic assumptions that are required to

be used in its “baseline” analysis, the forecasts in its “alternative fiscal scenario”

show the debt rising to as much as 183 percent of GDP in 2039. The rising debt

levels reflect the greater interest payments on the national debt and the

increased cost of the middle class health and retirement transfer programs.

Limiting and reversing the rise in the national debt requires only relatively small

decreases in annual deficit ratios. If real GDP grows at 2.5 percent and inflation is

2 percent, an annual deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP will cause the national debt to

rise to 100 percent of GDP. But lowering the deficit to two percent of GDP will

reverse the direction of the debt, causing it to decline to less than 50 percent of

GDP.

       There is little scope for reducing the deficit by cutting spending on the

annually appropriated “discretionary” programs. While there is no doubt substantial

waste in many programs, total outlays for nondefense discretionary programs is

now just 3.4 percent of GDP and is projected to decline to 2.5 percent of GDP in

2024. Similarly, the defense programs are projected to decline to just 2.7 percent of

GDP in 2024. Reducing the annual deficit therefore requires some combination of

slower growth of the retiree and health programs and increases in tax revenue.



Tax rates have continued to rise in the years since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.

That legislation reduced the top marginal tax rate to 28 percent. Since then the

top personal income tax rate has increased to 40 percent. An additional tax

increase on investment income was part of the Affordable Care Act. And the

overall payroll tax on wage and salary income was increased when the old ceiling

on income subject to the 2.9 percent Medicare tax was completely abolished



It is a central tenet of public economics that raising marginal tax rates increases

the distorting effects of the tax system and thus the deadweight loss to the



                                           2
economy.



Fortunately, it is possible to increase revenue without raising marginal

tax rates. The key is to limit the reductions in tax revenue that result from the

use of tax rules that substitute for direct government spending.



Some examples will illustrate the nature of these “tax expenditures.” If I buy a

hybrid car or a solar panel for my house, the government rewards me with a

subsidy payment. The subsidy does not take the form of a check from the

government but of a reduction in my tax liability. If I pay more in mortgage

interest or in local property taxes, the government subsidizes my spending by

allowing those expenses to be deducted in calculating my taxable income and

therefore my tax liability.



According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the tax expenditure subsidies in

the personal income tax code reduces revenue this year by approximately $1.6

trillion.3 Those tax rules (especially the exclusion of employer payments for

health insurance) also reduce the income that is subject to the payroll tax, leading

to an additional loss of government revenue.



Eliminating any of the tax expenditures or limiting their use would shrink the

Years 2014-2018. JCX-97-14 Dated August 5, 2014, page 35.



                                           3
size of the annual deficits. Although the effect would show up on the revenue side

of the government budget, that is just an accounting convention. In terms of real

economic impact, limiting tax expenditures should be viewed as a

reduction in government spending.



The ability to frame tax expenditures as either revenue increases or spending

decreases should make limiting tax expenditures appeal to those Republicans who

want to reduce government spending as well as to those Democrats who want to

use additional revenue to help shrink fiscal deficits. Some of the revenue

produced by limiting tax expenditures could also be used to reduce marginal tax

rates.



Any attempt to limit a particular tax expenditure will be resisted by those who

now benefit from it. That suggests that a comprehensive approach may be more

politically feasible because no group of taxpayers will feel that they have been

unfairly singled out. It also suggests that it would be politically difficult to

eliminate completely any of the major tax expenditures. Instead the analysis in

this paper focuses on a method of limiting the extent to which each individual can

benefit by using the full set of current tax expenditures.



The first section describes a potential basic cap on the benefit that individuals can

receive from an extensive set of tax expenditures. Section two discusses several

features of using such an overall cap. The third section examines several variations



                                             4
of the basic cap. Section 4 considers two alternatives to the cap stated as a

percentage of GDP: limiting the overall dollar amount of deductions; and limiting

the benefit of deductions and exclusions to the 28 marginal tax rate. There is a

brief concluding section.



1. A Basic Two Percent Cap on Tax Expenditures

The Tax Expenditure Cap that I have been studying would limit each individual’s

ability to reduce his tax liabilities by the use of deductions and exclusions to a

fixed percentage of that individual’s adjusted gross income. Note that the cap is

on the reduction of tax liabilities and not on the amount of the deductions and

exclusions.



For example, a tax expenditure cap of two percent of AGI implies that someone

with a marginal tax rate of 25 percent can have deductions and exclusions totaling

8 percent of his AGI, whereas someone with a marginal rate of 40 percent would

be limited to 5 percent of AGI.



To implement this cap, the taxpayer would calculate his taxable income in the

usual way and find the corresponding marginal tax rate. He would then multiply

his total deductions and other tax expenditures by this marginal tax rate. If the

resulting amount is less than two percent of his AGI, there is nothing more to do.

If the resulting amount exceeds two percent of his AGI, the excess amount is

added to his tax obligation.



                                            5
The basic cap that I have analyzed would apply to all itemized deductions except

charitable gifts. Although it could also be applied to charitable gifts, there are

both economic and political reasons that policymakers may wish to maintain the

current treatment of charitable gifts, a point to which I will return below.



The cap also applies to the exclusion of interest on state and local bonds and the

exclusion of employer payments for health insurance in excess of $8,000 per

taxpayer.



The cap that I study in this paper would not apply to tax-filers with AGI less than

$25,000.



If that two percent cap had been in place in 2013 it would have increased personal

tax revenue by $141 billion, about one percent of that year’s GDP. The 2 percent cap

would have been binding on about 22 million taxpayers or about 15 percent of the

total number of tax returns.



As a rule of thumb, the annual revenue gain can be converted to a revenue gain for

the next decade that is 13 times as large. The ten-year revenue gain would therefore

be $1.8 trillion. The national debt would be reduced by more than this amount

because of the interest saving each year on the reduced national debt.



A major advantage of the tax expenditure cap is that it would greatly simplify tax



                                            6
preparation for millions of taxpayers who would shift from itemizing their

deductions to using the standard deduction. The two percent cap would reduce

the number of itemizers from the current 46 million to just 15 million, or 10

percent of the 146 million annual returns. After one or two years experimenting

with itemization, the 30 million who shift to the standard deduction would no

longer bother to calculate their deductions.



These calculations assume that the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) remains in

place as under current law. The cap achieves much of the effect of the effect of the

AMT. More specifically, if the AMT were eliminated, the 2 percent cap would

recover two thirds of the revenue lost by eliminating the AMT.



The two percent cap would also raise the progressivity of the individual income

tax. The following figures show the increase in tax revenue as a percentage of the

current net-of-tax AGI in each AGI group:

       Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

              AGI    25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

                     0.66   0.81 1.33       1.55   2.28   2.98

Of the $141 billion, $41 billion would come from individuals with AGIs below

$100,000. Of the remaining $100 billion, $63 billion would come from individuals

with AGI above $200,000.



The two percent cap would also lower the marginal tax rate of all the affected



                                            7
taxpayers. For anyone subject to the cap, a one hundred dollar increase in income

would reduce the allowable amount of tax expenditures by enough to reduce taxable

income by two dollars. As a result, the extra $100 of income would raise taxable

income by only $98, implying that the marginal tax on the extra $100 would be

reduced by two percent, e.g., someone in the 30 percent marginal tax rate bracket

would face an effective marginal tax rate of 29.4 percent.



2. The Political Economy of an Overall Cap on Tax Expenditure Benefits



The example of the basic two percent cap on tax expenditure benefits illustrates

why this approach to limiting tax expenditures as a way of raising revenue may

make this approach politically feasible.



It avoids focusing on any particular tax expenditure and therefore appears more

equitable because it treats all major tax expenditures equally.



It encourages large numbers of individuals to shift to the standard deduction,

simplifying tax compliance and reducing the distorting incentives associated with

features like the mortgage interest deduction and the deduction for local

property taxes. For those who continue to itemize deductions, a binding cap

removes the distorting incentives that depend on marginal itemization.



Revenue is raised in a way that is progressive in the sense that it reduces after tax



                                           8
income proportionately more for high income taxpayers. The degree of

progressivity can be modified by using different caps for lower and higher income

taxpayers.



The limit on tax expenditures can begin with a higher cap and gradually reduced

(tightened) over time to avoid hurting a weak economy.



3. Variations on the Basic Two Percent Cap



3.1 The Low Cost of Preserving the Charitable Deduction

The charitable deduction, unlike other deductions and exclusions, does not benefit

the taxpayer directly but is important for maintaining private support for

universities, hospitals and cultural institutions. That is why I preserve the

charitable deduction in the basic plan and most other plans.



Extending the cap to include charitable contributions would increase revenue by

only a relatively small amount (by $24 billion to $165 billion). It would also

increase progressivity at the top of the income distribution because charitable

gifts are relatively more significant than other deductions for high income

individuals.



With a binding cap on all tax expenditures, the cost to the taxpayer of additional

charitable gifts rises from 1-mtr (one minus the individuals marginal tax rate) to



                                           9
one. For a taxpayer with a 40 percent marginal tax rate, the increased cost of

giving rises from 0.6 to 1.0, a 67 percent increase. Since a substantial body of

research indicates that the elasticity of charitable giving with respect to the net

cost to the donor is about one, that 67 percent increase in the net cost implies a

two-third decline in giving by high income donors. That would be a substantial

blow to a variety of cultural and educational institutions.



More specifically, taxpayers claimed charitable deductions of $160 billion on

individual income tax returns in 2011 of which $73 billion were claimed by



individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $200,000. That group would

have marginal tax rates of 40 percent, implying a reduction of their giving by

some $49 billion. Additional reductions would occur from individuals with lower

levels of adjusted gross income.



Progressivity if charitable contributions are included in the cap:

       Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

            0.69 0.88 1.40 1.71 2.43            3.88

Comparing these increases to those for the overall previous distribution of revenue

shows that the increase in revenue would be particularly high for those with AGI

above $200,000.




                                           10
3.2 Excluding the Deduction for State and Local Income Taxes

State income taxes are similar to charitable contributions and unlike most other

deductions in not benefiting the taxpayer directly. In contrast, most local taxes

represent a payment for services (schools, maintenance, trash collections,

recreation facilities). Although the IRS data combine state and local income taxes,

the local income taxes are only about 10 percent of the total tax revenue collected

by local governments.



Excluding the deduction for State and Local Income Taxes from the cap would

reduce the 2013 revenue from $141 billion to $102 billion but would still reduce

the number of itemizers from 47 million to 24 million.



The distribution of increased tax liabilities would be substantially less

progressive than it would be if these state and local income taxes are subject to

the cap.



Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200-500k 200k+

            0.63    0.72   1.17   1.29   1.83    2.36        1.70



This shows that the progressivity declines above $200,000 because of the

impact on individuals with more than $500,000 of AGI.




                                          11
3.3 Alternative Treatments of Employer Health Insurance Payments



The basic plan and all of the previous variations treated employer payments for

health insurance in excess of $8000 as part of the tax expenditure subject to the

cap. This section considers two alternative treatments: (i) subjecting all

employer paid health insurance to the cap and (ii) subjecting none of it to the cap.



(i) Subjecting all employer-paid health insurance to the cap



Subjecting all employer-paid health insurance to the cap would raise the

2013 revenue increase from $141 billion to $196 billion. The $8000

exclusion thus reduces revenue by $55 billion.



The distribution of increased tax liabilities would still be progressive but

substantially less progressive than it would be if the cap only applied to

insurance in excess of $8000.



Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

            2.49   2.31    2.46   2.20    3.01    3.22



(ii) Excluding employer paid health insurance from the cap

Excluding all employer-paid health insurance from the cap would reduce



                                          12
the 2013 revenue increase from $141 billion to $126 billion. Subjecting

employer paid health insurance to the cap but only to the extent that the

benefit exceeds $8000 (i.e., the basic case) increases revenue by $15

billion. The revenue effect of subjecting all benefits to the cap is $70

billion.



The distribution of increased tax liabilities would be more progressive

than it would be if the cap applied only to insurance premiums in excess of

$8000.

Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

           AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

              0.36   0.53   1.21 1.39     2.00    2.79



3.4 Excluding Municipal Bond Interest from the Cap

The basic option and all of the previous alternatives subject all municipal bond

interest to the 2 percent cap. Excluding municipal bond interest reduces the

revenue increase by $18 billion (from $141 billion to $123 billion). The tax

saving for taxpayers over $200,000 is $15 billion.



The distribution of increased tax liabilities would still be progressive but would

be less progressive than it would be if the cap applied to municipal bond interest.




                                           13
Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI     25k- 30k-      50k- 75k-       100k- 200k+

              0.66    0.80    1.33   1.53     2.05      2.27



3.5 Phasing in the Cap Over Time

The basic plan with a two percent cap would be a substantial fiscal shock in a weak

economy. The cap could instead be phased in, starting with a 5 percent cap and

gradually reducing it over several years. The near term effect would be less

reduction in the number of itemizers, less revenue, and a smaller increase in

progressivity. The phase in would reduce the extent that the cap lowers the value

of owner occupied residences.



Replacing the two percent cap with an initial 5 percent cap would reduce the

revenue gain from $141 billion to $53 billion in 2013. The number of itemizers

would decline from 46 million to just 39 million.



With a five percent cap, the progressivity schedule would look like this:

Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

             0.12    0.18    0.48 0.48      0.76     1.18



3.6 Increasing Progressivity by Varying the Cap with Income

The progressivity of the cap method could be increased by allowing a



                                             14
higher cap on lower income taxpayers. Raising the cap from 2 percent to 5

percent on the first $75,000 of AGI would reduce revenue to $130 billion

and increase progressivity.



The number of itemizers would still decline from 46 million to 28 million



Progressivity: Increased revenue as percent of current net-of-tax AGI

       AGI 25k- 30k- 50k- 75k- 100k- 200k+

            0.31    0.41 0.86     1.00   1.87    3.50



4. Alternative Methods of Limiting Deductions and Exclusions



The previous analysis focused on capping the tax reduction that the taxpayer gets

from deductions and exclusions. This section analyzes two alternatives: (i) a cap

on the dollar amount of total deductions or of deductions and exclusions. Four

alternatives are presented, each with a $25,000 total cap. (ii) limiting the

deduction and exclusion to the 28 percent bracket.



(i) Capping the total dollar amount of all deductions

A $25,000 cap on all deductions, including charitable contributions, would

increase revenue by $106 billion of which $76 billion would come from taxpayers

with AGI above $200,000. In contrast, the basic plan with the 2 percent cap would

raise $141 billion of which $63 billion would come from taxpayers with AGI above



                                          15
$200,000.



A $25,000 cap on all deductions but preserving the deduction for charitable

contributions would increase revenue by only $81 billion of which $55 billion

from taxpayers with AGI above $200,000.



A $25,000 cap on all deductions plus the excluded municipal bond interest and

employer paid health insurance in excess of $8000 would raise $175 billion of

which $94 billion would come from taxpayers with AGI above $200,000. Note that

this combination of deductions and exclusions is directly comparable to the 2

percent cap with the charitable deduction preserved that would raise $165 billion.

Although this raises only an extra $10 billion of revenue, $12 billion comes from

individuals with AGI above $200,000.



A $25,000 cap on all deductions (but preserving the deduction for charitable

contributions) plus municipal bond interest and employer paid health insurance

in excess of $8000 would raise additional revenue of $145 billion, almost exactly

the same as the $141 billion of the basic two percent plan. The extra revenue from

taxpayers with AGI over $200 billion would be $71 billion, or $8 billion more than

basic two percent plan.




                                         16
(ii) Capping the Marginal Tax Rate for Deductions and Exclusions to 28%



In this option, which was proposed at one point by the Obama administration,

individuals with marginal tax rates above 28 percent are limited to the tax

reduction that they would obtain with a 28 percent rate. This is achieved

operationally by denying them the specified deductions and exclusions and then

giving them a tax credit equal to 28 percent of the amount of those deductions and

exclusions.



The 28 percent cap applied to the same tax expenditures as the basic 2 percent

cap produces revenue of only $21 billion of which $20 billion comes from

taxpayers with incomes above $200k.



5. Conclusion

The prospect of very large future deficits and a rapidly increasing national debt is

an important fiscal challenge for the U.S. Limiting those deficits and therefore the

growth of the national debt requires slowing the growth of the retirement and

health programs. Additional tax revenue could contribute to that process.

Limiting tax expenditures would raise revenue without increasing marginal tax

rates. It would also be equivalent to reducing government spending now done as

subsidies through the tax code for a wide range of household spending and

income. An effective way of limiting tax expenditures would be a cap on the total

tax reduction in tax liabilities that each individual can achieve by the use of



                                           17
deductions and exclusions.
