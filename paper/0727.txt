               On the Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach



                                    ABSTRACT



     The implications of uncertainty for the design of contracts and of

remedies for their breach are studied. After characterizing complete

contingent contracts, incomplete contracts are examined. Specifically,

in view of difficulties in making contingent provisions (costs of enumer-

ation and of bargaining; verification of occurrence of events), it is

shown for which contingencies provisions are made. Then, in the major

part of the paper, two important implicit substitute for contingent terms

are analyzed. The first is provided by remedies for breach of contract;

for when a party must pay damages for breach, he will be induced to fulfill

his obligations in approximately those contingencies which would have been

agreed upon under the terms of a detailed contract. The second substitute

for contingent terms lies in the opportunity for renegotiation in light

of circumstances, since renegotiation will occur in more or less those

contingencies where the contract terms would have differed under a more

detailed agreement.

              On the Design of Contracts and Remedies for Breach

                               Steven Shavel1



        The concern of this paper is with the implications of uncertainty

 for the design of contracts and of remedies for their breach.1    Uncer—
 tainty is of course an inherent feature of the contractual
                                                              relationship,
 for by definition there is always a lapse of time between the making of

 a contract and the promised performance. During that period the cost of

 production may unexpectedly increase, an offer to the buyer may be made
 that is more advantageous than the seller's, or any number of other
 problematic   contingencies may arise and may result in the seller's or
 the   buyer's failure to perform.

       Our analysis of the contractual situation will begin with. a con-

sideration of agreements which provide explicitly for such problematic

contingencies. Specifically, a characterization will be given of con-

tracts which are both complete--contain terms
                                                regarding all possible

contingencies--and Pareto efficient--cannot be improved in the eyes of

the buyer and of the seller.

       It will next be asked why contracts ordinarily should not be ex-

pected to approach true completeness. The explanation will be that

because of certain difficulties in making contingent provisions and also

of the existence of various substitutes for them, it is in the mutual

interests of the parties to leave many things unstated. Two types of

difficulty in making provisions will be emphasized in this explanation:

the Costs of enumerating and of bargaining over contingent arrangements;

and the necessity that a party be able to verify the occurrence of a

contingency claimed by the other party so that a provision depending on

the contingency is workable.2 In view of these difficulties, it will be

shown for which contingencies contractual provisions are made.
                                   2




     Then, in the major part of the paper, two important types of sub-

stitute for contingent terms in contracts will be studied. The first is

provided by legal or customary remedies for breach of contract, that is,

by rules requiring a party in breach to pay money damages to the other

party or perhaps requiring "specific performance." To see why remedies

serve as substitutes for contingent terms, consider, for instance, that

when a seller must pay damages if he defaults, he will be induced t.o do

so only if that still would be advantageous to him, say only if his

production costs were larger than he anticipated or he received a higher

bid than he expected from another party before he was to perform. But

that the seller not perform in such contingencies is probably what would

have been agreed to in provisions for them; and that the seller make a

payment might also have been agreed to in provisions so as to accomplish

a desirable sharing of risk. Thus, remedies for breach can serve as

implicit substitutes for explicit contractual provisions by creating

appropriate incentives to perform, and soi.etimes by allocating risk as

well. The second type of substitute for provisions for contingencies

lies si,mply in the opportunity for renegotiation in light of circum-

stance. The seller who finds that it would be expensive to perform

would usually be willing to pay an amount the buyer would accept for his

release; so, through bargaining ex post, the parties may achieve a

similar result to what they would have written into the contract. A

third type of substitute for contractual provisions should also be

mentioned, but it will only be adverted to in the paper; it is that

certain contingencies (notably, acts of God, force majeure) may already

be recognized in contract law (or trade practice or custom) as

 excusing the obligations of one of the parties. 4

                                                 .



          The paper will conclude with a brief comment on the interpretation

 of the analysis.

 I.       Outline of the Model

       The concern is with two parties, a buyer and a seller, who each act

 so as to maximize the expected utility of a single variable, "wealth"5

 The parties are assumed already to have met6 and not to be immediately

 able to make contracts with others; thus they will make a contract

 themselves if doing so would result in a higher expected utility for

 each than that of the alternative of not making any contract, and this

will generally be presumed to be the case. The elements of the contrac-

tual situation faced by the parties are described in Figure 1. That is,

in order to get the benefits of performance, the buyer must commit

certain resources before he learns whether the seller will carry out his

promise. (The buyer might have to hire and train men to be able to use

a machine that is to be delivered; he may have to advertise the expected

appearance of a singer at his nightclub; he may have to make various

arrangements in anticipation of going on a charter hunting trip.) The

amount of such resources is assumed fixed7 and will be referred to as

reliance expenditures, or simply as reliance.8 Let

      r           =       reliance
and assume that it is positive.

      After the buyer "relies," the seller learns the uncertain con-

tingency. In regard to production contracts, one of two types of con-

tract to be studied, the uncertain contingency will be the seller's

production Cost. Let

             c         =   production    cost, and

          f()              probability density of c,

 where f is assumed to be positive on a non-degenerate interval [ci,     J,
 with ci         0, and to be zero elsewhere.9 The seller is assumed to learn

 the production cost before he actually begins the production process.

 In regard to contracts for transfer of possession, the other type of

 contract, the contingency will be the value of a bid made by another

 party for a good (an object of art; land) that the seller initially has

 in his possession. Let

         b            =    bid,
 and let f (distributed on [ci, ]) stand for the probability density of b

 as well.10 (The next section will discuss whether the buyer is aware of

the bids and would himself be able to sell the good to a bidder were the

seller to deliver it to him.) It will also be assumed that the seller

would get no value from conswnption of the good; if he does not sell the

good, its worth to him is zero.1'

         If the seller satisfies his contractual obligation, that is, if he

"performs," the buyer will enjoy a benefit called the expectancy. Let

         v           =     buyer's   expectancy,

a positive variable. (This would be interpreted as the enhancement in

profits (gross of reliance) due to delivery of the machine or the ap-

pearance of the singer; it would also be the monetary equivalent value

(gross of reliance) to the individual of going on his hunting trip; it

would be the value (gross of reliance) of the object of art or the-

parcel of land.) The net benefit if the buyer enjoys performance is v -

r.   The expectancy is assumed to be known to the parties with certain-

ty. 12
                                             5




     On the other hand, if the           seller   does not perform, the buyer does

not get his expectancy (so his position is -r), for it Is assumed that

the buyer is not able to purchase immediate substitute performance; the

contract good or service is not traded on a well-organized market.13

II. Pareto Efficient Complete Contingent Contracts

A.   The case where       parties      are risk neutral

     In this subsection a complete contingent contract will mean an

enforceable agreement specifying whether or not the seller is to perform

under each contingency and specifying also a price. It will be assumed

that the price is paid when the contract is made and that no monetary

transfers are carried out thereafter.14 Accordingly, a complete con-

tingent contract may be formally identified with a breach set

     B                    the set of contingencies under which the seller will

                          not perform;

and with

     k           =        the    contract price.

Now let us define

                 =        the expected value--exclusive of price--to the buyer
     Eb(B)
                          of a contract with breach set B

                 =        the expected value--exclusive of price--to the
     E5(B)
                          seller of a contract with breach set B.

Therefore, when price is taken into account, the expected positions of

the buyer and of the seller who have made a contract are, respectively,

Eb(B) - k and E(B) +        k.     It follows that a contract (B, k) is Pareto

efficient if there does not exist any other contract (B', k') under

which Eb(B') -   k'   >
                          Eb(B)
                                   -   k and E(B') +   k'   >   E(B)   + k.   We will
                                                                          .,.15
denote the breach set of a Pareto efficient contract by B'.                       Before

  characterizing Pareto efficient complete contingent contracts of the

  various types of interest to us, let us first state several facts about

  such contracts in general)-6



  Remark. A complete contingent contract is Pareto efficient if and
                                                                     only
  if it is described by either of the
                                      following equivalent conditions.
       (a) The sum of the buyer's and of the
                                                 seller's expected values is
 maximized by the contract (i.e.,
                                      Eb(B)+E (B) is maximized by B*).
      (b) The sum of the buyer's and of the seller's values
                                                                           each
 contingency is maximized by the contract--the seller performs in a con-

 tingency if and only if that would increase or leave equal the sum.17

      This implies

 psition 1. Under a Pareto efficient production Contract, the seller

 will not perform when production Cost exceeds the buyer's expectancy

 (i.e., B {clc >        v}).
Note. The result may be explained
                                       as follows. Suppose that the parties

Contemplated making a contract calling for the seller to perform in some

contingency where his cost c exceed the expectancy v. Then the seller

would be willing to accept a reduction in the contract price sufficient

to induce the buyer to
                           agree to change the contract so as to allow the
seller not to perform in the
                                contingency. Similarly, a contract allow-
ing the seller not to perform in a contingency where c <    v   would be
altered so as to require the seller to perform in the contingency.

These two statements are in turn true because there is a loss (in the

sum of values) if either the seller performs when c > v
                                                        or fails to
perform when c <   v.
           Reliance r does not affect whether it is Pareto efficient for there

    to be performance            because reliance is like a "sunk cost."
    Proof. By part (b) of the Remark, it suffices to show that when c > v,
    the sum of values is increased by failing to perform. Now if the seller

    does   not perform, his wealth is k and the buyer's is - k -                         r,    so the sum

    is —   r.       If the seller does perform, his wealth is k - c and the buyer's

    is v —      k   -
                        r,   so the sum is v -       r   -    c.    Hence the sum is increased by

    failing to perform when -            r   >   v   -   r    -    c or when c > v.   Q.E.D.

           In regard to contracts for transfer of possession, two situations

    will be distinguished. In the first, it is assumed that bids b are made

    only to the seller; they are not available to the buyer; were the good

    delivered to him, the buyer could not then sell to the bidder.'8 By

    contrast, in the second situation, it is assumed that bids are available

    to the buyer; were the good delivered to him, the buyer could sell to

    the bidder and would do so if v <                    b.        In both situations it is assumed

    for simplicity that if the seller does not perform and sells to the

    bidder, then that is the end of the matter; the buyer does not attempt

    to make a purchase from the bidder.19

    Proposition 2.             (a) If bids are made only to the seller, then under a

    Pareto efficient contract for transfer of possession, the seller will

    not perform when the bid exceeds the expectancy (i.e., B*                             bjb >v}).

    However, (b) if bids are available to the buyer as well, then a contract

    in which the seller always performs is Pareto efficient; and, more

    generally,
-
                        any contract in which the seller performs at least whenever

    the bid is less than or equal to the expectancy is Pareto efficient

    (i.e., B can be any set which is included in {b b >                           v}).
                                                     o




      Note. Result (a) is analogous to Proposition 1, and is based on the

      fact that if either the seller performs when b >                 v   or fails to perform
  when b <           v,   there is a loss in the sum of values. Result (b) is differ-

  ent from (a) because under our assumptions there is no loss in the sum

  of values if the seller performs when
                                                         b>v; for in that case the buyer
  would himself sell to the bidder.

  Proof. We again apply part (b) of the Remark.                       To prove (a), note that
  if the seller does not perform (selling instead to the bidder), his

  wealth is k ÷ b and the buyer's is - k -
                                                           r,   so the sum is b -     r.        If the

  seller does perform, his wealth is k and the buyer's is v - k                      -
                                                                                           r,   so
  the sum is v -               r.   Hence the sum is increased by failing to perform when
  b -    r   >   v   -    r   or when b >   v.
         To prove (b), note that if the seller does not perform, his wealth

 is, as before, k + b and the buyer's is - k -
                                                                 r,   so the sum is b —         r.
 However, if the seller does perform, whereas the seller's wealth is

 still k, the buyer's is now max(b, v) - k -r, so the sum is max(b, v) —

 r.     The difference between these sums is b -
                                                 max(b, v), wh.ich is nega-
 tIve for v > b and is 0 otherwise. Hence, for the
                                                   sum to be maximized,

 the only requirement is that the seller perform when v >                      b.   Q.E.D.
 B.      The case where prties are risk averse

         Let us very briefly consider the possibility that parties might be

 risk averse. The first observation that should be made is that prties'

attitudes toward risk do not alter the conclusions (in Propositions 1

and 2) whether it is Pareto efficient for the seller to perform. The

only effect of the parties' attitudes toward risk is to make it Pare to

efficient for rnney transfers to be made ex post. These transfers will

'be designed so as to accomplish a mutually beneficial sharing of risk.21
                                      9




       Thus, if the buyer is risk averse and the seller risk neutral, it

will be Pareto efficient for the seller to act as a perfect insurer of

the buyer; the transfers must therefore be such as to leave the buyer

with an unvarying level of wealth.22 In particu'ar, when under a Pareto

efficient contract the seller does not prform, he will py the yr

his expectancy.23

       Conversely, if the buyer is risk neutral and the seller is risk

averse, it will be Pareto efficient for the yer    to   act as the perfect

insurer, and the transfers must therefore be such as to leave the seller

with an unvarying level of wealth. Hence, under a Pareto efficient

contract, the buyer will absorb the entire risk in production cost or

bids, as the case may be.24

       If both the buyer and the seller are risk averse, then of course it

will not be Pareto efficient for either to act as a perfect insurer of

the other. The transfers made will, accomplish a sharing of risk in

accord with the parties' degrees of risk oversion, etc., and the situa-

tion will be an appropriate compromise between those described in the

last two paragraphs.



III.       Contracts Are Incomplete

       As stated in the introduction, the view that will be taken here is

that it is in the mutual interests of parties to leave contracts incoin-

plete. This will be so because the possible adverse consequences of

failure to provide for certain contingencies may not be sufficient to

justify bearing the sure costs of including terms for those contingen-

cies in the contract plus the expected costs of verifying their 'occur-

rence.
                                             10



    A.    The case   where p ties are risk    neutral
          Let us make the following
                                        assumptions. First, the parties must
    choose a set S of contingencies for
                                             which to write explicit Provisions:

    Only i.f a contingency 0 is in S does the
                                                  contract specify whether or not
    the seller shall perform; and let BS be the subset of contingencies

    under which according to the contract the seller does not perform. If 0

    is not in S, then something outside
                                             the contract (e.g., contract. law,

    Custom, renegotiation) determines what will happen should 0 occur. (It

 will of course turn out that 0 will
                                            be in S only If the provision for 0
 would alter what would otherwise happen if 0 occurs.)

         Second, there is a positive rate of cost for each party of l/2c(0)

 of providing for 0; for each party l/2fu(0)dO is therefore the cost of
                                       S
 including contingent terms. Third, there is also a positive cost (8)

 that the buyer would bear in order
                                           to verify the occurrence of 0, and it
 is assumed that he will do
                                   so whenever the contract calls for the seller

not to perform. Thus, if h(0) is the
                                             proLability density of 0, then
J(0)h(e)do is the expected verification cost

         Under these assumptions, what will be a Pareto efficient selection

of contingencies for which to include terrns.and a determination concern-

ing the seller's performance? In other words, what will be a Pareto

efficient incomplete contract (S, B, k)? The next Proposition answers

this question, making use of the easily shown fact that an incocplete

Contract is Pareto efficient if and only if S and B are chosen so as to

maximize the sum     of   the buyer's and the seller's expected values. In

stating and proving the Proposition the following additional terms are

needed: x(0),the sum       of   the buyer's and seller's values given 0 if the

Contract provides for performance; y(0),the sum         of   values (exclusive of
                                               11




verification costs) given ® if the contract allows non-performance;

z(O),the sum of values given 0 if the contract does not provide for .25

Proposition 3. Under a Pareto efficient incomplete contract, (a) sup-

pose that there is a provision for a contingency 0. Then the provision

will call for performance when x(0)                 y(0) -

     Hence, (b) the set of contingencies for which there will be provi-
sions in the contract is

(1) S = {Ola(0)   <h(0)[max(x(0),             y(O) -     (0))    z(0)]}.

Note. The formula (ii) implies that the following factors militate a-

gainst making a provision for a contingency: a high cost c(0)              of   making

a provision, a low probability density h(0) of occurrence, a high cost

(0) of verification (should the provision call for non-performance),

and a high sum of values z(0) in the absence of a provision.
                                                    26
Proof. The sum of expected values is



                                                             -
(2) Eb(S, B) + ES CS, B) =         -fa(0)dO     +   5(y(0)
                                   s                B

              + 5 x(0)h(0)dO + fz(0)h(0)dO.
                  S—B                     —S


Now suppose 0 is chosen in S. Then if 0 is also chosen in B, the sum of

integrands is-c(0) +    y(O)   -
                                       (0);    and if 0 is chosen in S—B, the sum of

integrands is -c(0) +    x(0).         Thus, since a Pareto efficient contract

maximizes (2), part (a) is true. And from part (a) and (2), part (b)

similarly follows. Q.E.D.

B.   The case where parties are risk averse

      If one or both parties are risk averse, although an analogue to the

Proposition can be proved according to which the same qualitative results

are valid (a high a(0) or a low h(0) or a high (O) militate against

  including   U in S, etc.), there is no simple formula determining whether

 a provision for a contingency will be made.27

 IV.    Remedies for Breach of Contract and   Renegotiation as Substitutes
 for Contingent Provisions

        The last Proposition motivates interest in the question to be asked

 here, namely, if there are no contingent terms whatever in a contract,

 will the incentives to perform that are inherent in remedies for breach

 and will the possibilities for renegotiation result in outcomes which

 approximate the Pareto efficient outcomes of a
                                                   completely specified
 contract? As indicated in the introduction, the answer to the question

 will be a qualified, "Yes." This, and consideration of the costs and

 difficulties in making contingent provisions just discussed will help to

 explain the observed incompleteness of contracts, the use of remedies

 for breach, and resort to renegotiation.

       Since the assumption here is that a contract contains no provisions

for contingencies, it will merely be a statement of the form "the seller

promises to deliver a good" or to "perform a service" and an agreement

over price. As before, the price will be assumed to be paid at the

outset. The parties will be assumed to be aware that there is a remedy

available for breach of contract28 and that there may be an opportunity

for renegotiation if a problem arises.

       As noted in the beginning, two types of rem..dy will be considered.

The first is fic performance, under which the seller must do what
he promised, and the second is payment of an amount of money as deter-

wined by a         measure. Three measures will be compared. Under the

first, the restitution measure, if the seller commits a breach he must

return the payment k that he had received from the buyer. Under the
                                           13




reliance measure, the defaulting seller must return the payment and

compensate the buyer for reliance expenditures, so the buyer, gets r + k

in damages; thus the buyer is put in the position he was in before he

made a contract. Under the expectation          measure,   the defaulting seller

must pay the buyer what the court perceives to be the expectancy; thus,

were the expectancy accurately estimated, the buyer would be put in the

position he would have enjoyed had the seller performed.29 Interest in

the possibility of the court's misperceiving the expectancy is due to

the commonly held belief that because the determination of the value of

performance to the buyer requires the court to answer a hypothetical

question, it is easy for errors to be made. By contrast, the determina-

tion of the contract price or of reliance do not require the courts to

engage in such speculation; the price paid and money spent in reliance

should usually be fairly readily assessed. Now let

      u          =        courtT s estimate of the expectancy v

and

      q(., u)    =        joint   probability density of u and other random

                          variables--either b or c, as specified,

where q is assumed to be positive when and only when u is in a non-

degenerate interval [u, u]. Moreover, it is assumed that v is contained

in (u, i) and this interval is itself contained in [cr, ].               Last,   it is

assumed that u >     r   +   k, in keeping with the idea that the court knows
that v must certainly be higher than r +         k--the    buyer would never be

willing to make a contract if what he had to spend, r +            k,   was greater

than or equal to the value of performance, V.30

      In   what follows, the behavior of the parties under the various

remedies. will be determined and compared with that under Pareto effi-

cient complete contracts. Also the factors that would make a particular
                                                       14



     remedy Pareto             or
     this term in the present context is
                                        to anther will be determined. The definition of

                                                           that one remedy is Pareto superior
     to a second if given
                                      any contract price and use of the second remedy,

     both parties would prefer to make some adjustment in the price and to

     employ instead the first remedy.

    A.           The          where ties are        risk   neutral
    The      first       situation to be analyzed is that where parties do not engage

    in renegotiation of the contract because it is assumed to be too
                                                                     costly
    to do so.  (Thus the seller decides about
                                              performance only on the basis
    of whether this would make him better
                                                            off given the buyerts remedy for
    breach.) Then the more complicated
                                                       situation with renegotiation will be
    analyzed.

    1. pfmance and breach                     when there is no renegotiation. Consider

    initially production contracts.
                                                     Under specific performance, the breach
    set is by definition empty. Thus there is too little breach relative to

    the Pareto efficient breach
                                              set B cIc >v}; whenever production cost
 exceeds the expectancy, there ought to be breach but ther is not. The

expected value to the buyer of the contract
                                                                 under specific performance
is




(3) Eb(sp)_k=v_r_k

and to the seller it is


(4) E5(sp) + k =                 -fcf(c)dc   + k.



Under the restitution measure, the breach set is B
                                                                      re S
                                                                             =
                                                                                 cJc   >   k.   But
k   <    v   -   r   <   v,   for otherwise the buyer would not have made the con-

tract.31 Thus B
                              res contains B*, and there is too much breach; whenever
                                                          15




production cost exceeds k and is less than v, there ought not to be

breach but there is. The expected values of the contract to the buyer

and the seller are, respectively,



(5) E(res) - k                vPr[ctc      k} -       r   ÷ kPr{ctc >                     k}   -
                                                                                                       k,   and



(6) E(res) + k                 -fcf(c)dc -     kPrtcc              >    k}   +       k.

(It should be noted here that k >                    a,           otherwise the seller would not have

made the contract.32) Under the reliance measure, the breach set is

B
 re 1
        =
            c1c   >   r   +   k},   which contains B since r + k                                   <    v.33       Thus there

is again too much breach (but, given k, less than under restitution).

The buyer's and seller's expected values are


(7) E(rel) - k =              vPr{clc      r +       k}       -    r   +   (r    ÷ k)Pr3Icc >                  r   +   k}    -
                                                                                                                                 k,   and

                                r+k
(8) E(rel) + k =               -fcf(c)dc   -
                                                (r    +
                                                              k)Prc1c            >    r    +   k) + k.

Last, under the expectation measure, the breach set is Bexp =                                                          {c,       ulc > u}

since the seller will default and pay the court's estimate u of the

expectancy when the production cost is higher. Thus, if u were accurate

and equalled v, Bexp would equal B* and breach would occur when it ought

to. However, if u is an underestimate of v, then there might be breach

when there ought not; and if u is an overestimate, there might be per-

formance when there ought not. The expressions for the buyer's and

seller's expected values are34

                                                                       tc>u}

      Figure   2 summarizes the relationship between breach and performance

      under the four remedies and under a Pareto efficient complete contingent

      contract, and will help in comparing the remedies as to their mutual

      desirability.

      Proposition 4. In a production contract (a) the reliance measure is

      always Pareto superior to the restitution
                                                  measure. However, the relation-
      ship among the other remedies depends on the nature of the contractual

     Situation: (b) The expectation measure is Pareto superior to the other

     remedies if the estimate of the
                                       expectancy is sufficiently precise (i.e,
     if u and are sufficiently close to v).
                                                  (c) The reliance measure is
     Pareto superior to the other remedies if the problem of excessive
                                                                       per-
     formance under specific performance and under the expectation measure

     (due to overestimation of the
                                     expectancy) is more important than the

     problem of inappropriate breach.35 (d) Specific performance is Pareto

     superior to the other remedies if the problem of excessive breach under

     the expectation measure (due to underestjn1atjon of the expectancy) and

    under the reliance measure is more important than the problem of excessive

    performance.

    Note. Because the reliance measure induces even more excessive breach

    than the restitution measure, part (a) is true.36
                                                          And because the

    expectation measure induces Pareto efficient breach if the expectancy is

    accurately estimated, part (b) is clear. The other two results are

    self-explanatory.

    Proof.     To demonstrate (a), we must show that for any price    of a
    contract under the restitution measure, there exists a price k2 such

    that both parties are better off under the reliance measure. To do this

    we will show several facts that will enable us to employ a graphical

the relationship among the points above k1 in Figure 3 and also our

having drawn E(rel) and E(rel) + k as rising and meeting above the

point v -    r.    Now if given                   the reliance measure is employed rather

than restitution, the seller is made worse off; he moves from A to

point at which the seller becomes just as well off as he had been under

  Hence, if the price is raised a little above
                                                                      k2, both buyer and seller
  are made better off by use of the reliance measure.

         To demonstrate (b), since the contract price does not affect the

  breach set and thus the sum of expected values under the expectation

 measure, it suffices to prove that E(exp) exceeds
                                                                           E(sp) and E(rel) if u

 since it was noted that under the reliance
                                            measure the buyer would not
 be willing to make the contract unless r ÷ k <v.

        To show (c), let us first compare E(rel) assuming that k =
                                                                   0 with

E(sp) (which is Independent of k). Then

                                       vPrcjc       > r} ÷ fcf(c)dc        .f(c -     v)f(c)dc

                                               V
                 =   f(c   -
                               v)f(c)dc    -
                                               f(v    -
                                                           c)f(c)dc.
                     v                         r

The first term after the last equal sign is positive and represents the

waste of excessive performance under
                                                          specific performance, while the
second term is negative and corresponds to -the loss due to excessive

breach under reliance. Our assumption will be that the first term is

sufficiently large to exceed the second. Now consider a contract with

price     under which specific performance is the remedy for breach. To

prove that there is a price k2 such that both parties would be better
                                                          19




off under the reliance measure, consider Figure 4. Since our assumption

is that C >      B   and since from (13) E(rel) rises with k, we know that

D > B.    And observe that at k2 the seller is just as well off under the

reliance measure as he was under specific performance at k1, but the

buyer is strictly better off since D - A > B                             -   A. Consequently, at a

price slightly above k2 both parties will be better off under the re-

liance measure. The argument for Pareto superiority of the reliance

measure over the expectation measure is analogous: We have (after some

manipulation) that

(17) E(rel) - E(exp) =              ff(c -    v)q(c,u)dcdu           -
                                                                             ff(v   -
                                                                                        c)q(c,u)dcdu,
                                    {uc>v}
                                                  -
                                                                             {uc,vc>r+k
where the first term is positive, representing the relative gain when

there is appropriate breach under reliance but excessive performance

under the expectation measure, and where the second term is negative,

corresponding to the relative loss when there is inappropriate breach

under reliance and worthwhile performance under the expectation measure.

Employing, then, the assumption that the first term exceeds the second,

we can use a graph similar to that of Figure 3 to complete the argument.

       To prove (d), because E(sp) does not depend on the contract price,

it will suffice to show that E(sp) exceeds E(rel) and E(exp). Observe

first that


(is)     E(sp)   -
                     E(rel)    =
                                   vPr{ctc    >       r   + k} -   5cf(c)dc             f(v -   c)f(c)dc
                                                                   r+k                  r+k

                     V
                 =   f(v   -
                               c)f(c)dc   -
                                              J'(c - v)f(c)dc.
                     r+k                      v

This will be positive if the first term, the cost of excessive breach

under the reliance measure, exceeds the second, the cost of excessive

performance under specific performance. Likewise,

    which will be positive if the first term, the cost of excessive breach

    under the expectation measure, exceeds the second, the relative cost of

    excessive performance under specific performance. Q.E.D.

         Consider now contracts for transfer of possession and assume ini-

    tially that bids are made only to sellers. Then the situation is essen-

    tially the same as it was for production contracts: Figure 2 still

    applies (but with the axis representing bids rather than production

    cost); there is excessive performance under specific performance, ex-

    cessive breach under the restitution measure, etc. For completeness,

    however, we will write the various expected values. Under specific

    performance, they are simply

    (20) Eb(sp) -    k = v    -   r   -
                                          k,     and

    (21) E5(sp) +    k = k.
    Under the restitution measure, since the seller defaults and sells to

    the bidder when the bid b exceeds k, the expected values are


    (22) Eb(res) - k =    vPr{bjb                k} -r +           kPr{bIb                >       k}   -
                                                                                                            k,      and


    (23) E(res) + k =     fbf(b)db           -
                                                     kPr{bb            >       k}    +   k.
                          k

    Similarly, under the reliance measure, the formulas are

    (24) Eb(rel) - k     vPr{bb                  r +      k}      -r +          (r    +       k)Pr{b[b              >    r   +   k}   -
                                                                                                                                          k,   and

-
    (25) E(rel) + k      fbf(b)db -                  (r   +    k)PrbIb               >        r   +    k}       +   k.
                         r+k

    And under the expectation measure, the formulas are

    (26) Eb(exp) -   k = vPr{b, u!b                   u}      -    r       +   ffuq(b,u)dbdu                        -
                                                                                                                         k,and
                                                                                (b>u}

    (27) E5(exp) + k =   ffbq(b,u)dbdu                    -
                                                              ffuq(b,u)dbdu                        +       k.

       When bids made to the seller are available to the buyer also, some

  of the buyer's expected values are changed since if he had the good he

  would sell to the bidder whenever b >         v.   (Of course, the seller's

  behavior and expected values are as before.) To be precise, under sped'-

  fic performance,


  (28) Eb(sp) -   k              v} ÷ fbf(b)db -      r   -
                      vPrbjb                                  k,

 and under the expectation measure,

 (29) Eb(exp) - k     vPr{b, ujb     u, b       v} ÷ ffbq(b, u)dbdu
                                                      {ub>vJ
              -   r + ffuq(b,   u)dbdu -   k.
                      {b>u}


 Under the restitution
                         measure, however, the buyer's expected value is

 unchanged; since he will get delivery only when b                 k and since k <   v
 (otherwise it can be shown that he would not have been willing to make

 the contract), the buyer will never wish to sell the good to the bidder.

Similarly, the buyer's expected value is unchanged under the reliance

measure.

     With these formulas, the next result may be proved.

Propotion 5. In a contract for transfer of possession, (a) if it

is assumed that bids are made only to the seller, then the relationship

among remedies for breach is exactly as described (in Proposition 4) in

respect to production contracts. However, (b) if it is assumed that

bids are available to the buyer as well, then specific performance is

Pareto superior to the expectation measure, which is Pareto superior

to the reliance measure, which is Pareto superior to the restitution

measure.

Note. As remarked, part (a) is true for reasons analogous to those

explaining the previous Proposition; and since the proof is virtually

the same as that of the Proposition (with (20)-(27) playing the role of

(3)-(1O)), it is omitted. With regard to part (b), it is obvious that

when bids are available to the buyer, specific performance is Pareto

superior to the other remedies. On the one hand, Proposition 2 (b)

states that the seller's behavior is actually Pareto efficient under

specific performance because there is no problem of excessive per-

formance; if the seller is delivered the good when the bid is higher

than the expectancy, he will sell it. On the other hand, under the

other remedies, there is a possibility that the seller will default when

the bid is less than the expectancy. And since the likelihood of this

is higher under the reliance measure than under the expectation measure,

and higher still under the restitution measure than under the reliance

measure, the relative ranking of the remedies is explained.

Proof. To prove (b), it suffices to show that E(sp)> E(exp) >E(rel),

for E(sp) and E(exp) do not depend on k. (We already know by appeal to

part (a) that the reliance measure is Pareto superior to the restitution

measure, since we observed that under these two measures neither the

buyer's nor the seller's behavior changes on account of the availability

of bids to the buyer.) Now, recalling that E(sp)E(sp)+E5(sp) and that

E(exp) and E(sp) are defined similarly, we have from (28), (21), (29),

and (27),

                                                                -

                      {bu, r+k<bv}         {bu, r+k<bv}
 Note here that in combining terms to get the second equality, we made

 use of the fact that u must exceed r +               k,   for we had assumed that u >
 r    + k.   Q.E.D.

 2.      performance and breach when       there      is renegotiation. It will be
 assumed here that the parties will engage in renegotiation if (given the

 contingency) the resulting benefits would exceed the costs.                          Specif-

 ically, it will be assumed that if the buyer and the seller engage in

 renegotiation, each will bear a positive cost t in the process; and they

will agree on whether the seller is to perform or to be released on the

basis of which would maximize the sum of values (i.e., they will agree

onthe Pareto efficient outcome). Further, if they engage in renegotia-

tion, they will split equally the gain in the sum of values from having

done so; this will be done by means of a sidepayment.37 Last, they will

decide to engage in renegotiation if and only if the resulting increase

in the sum of. values exceeds the joint Costs of 2t (i.e., the decision

whether to renegotiate is Pareto efficient).

        It will be seen that the pibility of renegotiation does not

alter the gualitative nature of the results of the last subsection;

Propositions 4 and S remain valid. This is because when there wasno

renegotiation, the mutual desirability of a remedy depended on how well

it functioned as a device to induce the seller to behave in a Pareto

efficient way; a remedy was undesirable to the extent that it resulted
                                         24



 in Pareto inefficient breach or Pareto inefficient performance. In the

 present case, such departures from Pareto efficiency under a remedy are

 still undesirable: if a departure would be large, then the parties will

 engage in the costly process of renegotiation; and if the departure

 would not be so large as to justify renegotiation, the departure will be

 observed to occur.    In sum, then, the possibilites for renegotiation

mitigate but do not eliminate losses that would otherwise occur under

the remedies.

       Consider for example the functioning of specific performance in

respect to production contracts. When there was no renegotiation, the

problem with this remedy was that if the production cost c exceeded the

expectancy v, enforced performance involved a loss to the parties of
c —   v.   In the present case, if c -   v    exceeds the costs of renegotiation

of 2t, the parties will find it worthwhile to bear the costs of that

process, and the result will be that the seller will pay the buyer for

release from his obligation to perform. Or, consider the remedy of

restitution. Before, the problem was one of excessive breach; if c

exceeded the price k but was less than v, there was a loss of v -        c.       In

the present case, if the loss v - c exceeds 2t, then the parties will

decide to renegotiate, and the buyer will pay the seller to perform.

      Let us now describe precisely how the opportunity to renegotiate

affects the behavior of parties and the expected value formulas. This

will be done only for production contracts, as the situation for con-

tracts for transfer of possession is similar and may easily be under-

stood by analogy to the previous subsection. Under specific perfor-

mance, the situation is shown in Figure 5.         As we just noted, the buyer

and the seller will renegotiate for release of the seller when c —        v   >   2t,

Under the restitution measure, since the seller can default and pay k,

the situation is as illustrated in Figure 6. Here, as remarked, the

parties will renegotiate only when there would be breach--when both

k < c and when the consequent loss v - c
                                         would exceed 2t, that is, when
k .<   c <     v   -   2t.         (Thus, if k                  v    -
                                                                          2t,       the parties will never renego-

tiate; as this was analyzed in the last subsection, we assume that

k <    v   -   2t).     Given that this occurs, under our assumptions the buyer

will pay the seller c +                          1/2      (v -       c)    -       k to perform.4° If c                          v -   2t,
the seller will default and pay damages. Therefore, the expected value

formulas are

  Last, under the expectation measure, the situation depends on whether

  the court's estimate u is within 2t of v. If it is, there is never

  renegotiation, and the seller will default and pay u when c >                                                                u.        How-
  ever, if u <              v   -
                                     2t,   then Figure 8a applies. Here, there will be re-
  negotiation when u < c < v                           -   2t      and the buyer will pay the seller
  c — u +    1/2        (v-c) to perform;42 when c                                     v -       2t      the seller will commit

  breach and pay damages. On the other hand, if                                                     u v - 2t,              then the

  relevant situation is shown in Figure 8b. In this instance, there will

 be renegotiation when v +                         2t      <   c        u and the seller will pay the buyer
   +   1/2   (c -       v)          to be released;43 when c                               u the seller will default and

 pay u in damages. It follows from our description of behavior under the

 expectation measure that44

 Using these formulas, we show in the Appendix that parts (a) and (b) of

 Proposition 4 remain true, leaving the verification of parts (c) and (d)

 to the interested reader; and as remarked, it is straightforward to

determine the expected value formulas for contracts for transfer of

possession and to check that Proposition 5 remains valid.

B.   The case where parties are risk averse45

     In considering the role of remedies for breach as implicit sub-

stitutes for well specified contracts when one or both of the parties is

risk averse, the allocation of risk must be taken into account along

with incentives to perform. The general conclusions that emerge from

considering this dual role o'f remedies are simple to state. First,

suppose that the buyer is more risk averse than the seller. Then, other

things equal, the case for specific performance is strengthened over

that for the expectation measure, the case for it is in turn strengthened

over that for the reliance measure, and the case for it is stengthened

over that for the restitution measure. The reasons for these conclu-

sions are of course that specific performance is by definition perfect

insurance for the buyer; the expectation measure provides only imperfect

insurance due to the courts' imperfect knowledge of the expectancy; and

the reliance and restitution measures leave respectively greater gaps in

coverage against loss of the expectancy (and create respectively greater

probabilities of such loss).
                                         28



                  on the other hand, that   the buyer     is better able to bear
     risk than the seller. Then our conclusions 4pend          on the           of contract
     in ue st ion. In pp4tion contrac     ts spec i f i c perfo nn an c e
                                                                            appears   to be
     least desirable, and the expectation measure, the reliance measure, and

     the restitution measures seem to be succei\Tey more desiab1e remedies

 on grounds of risk-sharing. Specific performance makes the seller

 absorb (or renegotiate to be released from) the potentially great risks

 associated with variation of the production cost; the expectation measure

 limits the risk to the (estimated)
                                         expectancy; the reliance and restitu-
 tion measures limit the risk to lower amounts. Thus what is a mutually

 desirable remedy from the point of view of risk sharing may be an un-

 desirable remedy from the point of view of the creation of incentives to

 perform. In            to   contracts for transfer of possession, the situation

 seems different; specific performance appears to be most desirable, and

 the pectation measure, the reliance measure, and the restitution

measure seem to be successively less desirable remedies on grounds of

 risk sharing. Under specific performance, there is, as is advantageous,

no variability in the seller's position--lie gets his payment and delivers

the good which he has in his possession to the buyer. Under the expec-

tation measure, there is variability in the seller's final position, for

he might. default, pay damages, and sell to a high bidder. Under the

reliance and restitution measures, this variability is greater, since

the difference between a bid and damages paid grows larger.

V.      Comment
                                                                                 —
a.      Our general point that it is in the mutual interests of parties to

leave agreements incomplete and to rely instead on various substitutes

for contingent terms is confirmed by consideration of a broad range of

type of agreement. Certainly parties making informal             verbal     contracts
                                     29




typically omit to mention possible contingencies unless these are very

likely or very important; and even parties carefully drawing up formal

contracts frequently do not provide explicitly for many contingencies.

It is generally appreciated from the outset that if an unexpected event

occurs leading a party to wish to default on his contractual obligation,

the difficulties that then arise will usually be settled in a reasonably

satisfactory way through use of recognized excuses, renegotiation, or

remedies for breach of contract.46

b.   Noreover, our particular results concerning the relative desira-

bility of remedies for breach of contract are consonant with two general

facts about their actual use.47 First, the expectancy is the favored

measure of damages, provided that it can be fairly accurately assessed.

(This is, of course, in accord with our result that the expectation

measure induces performance when it would be mutually desirable.) And

second, specific performance (rather than a damage measure) is employed

as the remedy for breach primarily for certain trpes of contracts for

transfer of possession, notably for contracts for the conveyance of

land. (This is in accord with our result on the mutual desirability of

specific performance as a remedy for breach of contracts for transfer of

possession when the buyer has access to bids made to the seller; and as

was explained, it also appears sensible on grounds of the allocation of

risk.)

 *        Assistant   Professor, Harvard Law School and Research Associate,

          National Bureau of Economic Research. I wish to thank the National

          Science Foundation (grant nos. Soc 76-20862 and SES 8014209) for

          financial support and S. Grossman, A.N. Polinsky, and R. Posner for

          Comments.

 1.       The first systematic formal analysis of damage measures .for breach

          is presented in Shavell 1)980); but see extensions and additions

          made in Rogerson [1980]. See also Kornhauser [1980]; and see Posner

          [1977J for informal analysis of contracts and breach that will be of

          interest to economists.

2.        The necessity of verification of a contingency was first emphasized

         by Radner [1968].

3.       While this substitute for provisions is of undeniable significance,
     •
         it is subject to the important limitation that it can be success-

         fully employed only in respect to those contingencies that are

         easily observed and for which the agreement that the parties would

         have made can be confidently imputed.

4.       The Contribution of this paper to the formal literature on contracts

         would appear to lie in the analysis of contractual incompleteness;

         the distinctions drawn between production contracts and contracts

         for transfer of possession; the consideration of specific perfor-

         mance; the treatment of imperfect knowledge of the courts; and.. the

         allowance for costly renegotiation (but see Rogerson [1980] on

         costless renegotiation).
                                    2



 5.   Any non-monetary variable affecting the well-being of a party is

      thus assumed to have a monetary equivalent.

             As the level of initial wealth will have no bearing on the

      analysis, initial wealth will be suppressed in the notation; thus it

      will appear as if initial wealth is zero.

 6.   Thus issues concerning the effort devoted to search for contractual

      partners are not studied here; for analysis of these issues, see

      Diamond and Naskin [1979].

 7.   This is determined endogenously in Shavell [1980], where it is a

      focus of interest.

 8.   This and other terminology to be introduced below conforms to stan-

      dard usage; see for example Fuller and Perdue [1937] or Dawson and

      Harvey [19771.

 9.   The function f and other functions to be defined will also be assum-

      ed continuous.

10.   Note that the bids are taken as exogeiious to the model. This sun-

      plifying assumption is appropriate if one is thinking of cases in

      which bids are made without real negotiation with the contracting

      party. Were the asumption relaxed, it can be shown that the quali-

      tative nature of the results would not be altered.

11.   It will be seen that none of the results depend on this assumption,

      and that only inessential modification of the proofs would be re-

      quired to account for the possibility of a positive consumption

      value (but one less than the expectancy (to be defined shortly)).

12.   This   will be seen to imply that the buyer will never himself wish to

      commit a breach (whereas he might if his expectancy suddenly fell);

      onlythe seller will be led to do so. Relaxing this assumption
                                       3




        would not change the qualitative nature of our results, as is evident

        from Shavell [1980].

 13.    If the good or service were traded on a well—organized market, the

        only reason for parties to make a contract would be to share the

        risk of fluctuations in the future market price; and because such

        problems of pure risk-sharing are well understood, they are not

        examined hee. However, Rogerson [1980], and Shavell [1981], an

        earlier version of this paper, briefly discuss contracts in a market

        setting -

14.    This assumption is inessential. Were payment to be made only if there

       was performance, the contract price could be raised as if to compen-

       sate the seller for the chance he would not be paid, and so forth.

       See Shave].1 [1980].

               However, if one or both parties are risk averse, we would not

       wish to make the assumption (and do not--see subsection B). This is

       because subsequent monetary transfers would clearly matter; they

       would allocate risk, about which risk averse parties care, by defini-

       tion.

15. B may not be unique; but when this is so it will be noted and there

       will be no cause for confusion.

16.    The proof of the following Remark is obvious and is therefore omitted

       (but it is presented in Shavell [1981), and the proof of a similar

       result is presented in Shavell [1980]).

17.    This statement is not quite precise, for it does not matter what the

       seller does if the sum of values is not affected by whether the

       seller performs. In that case, we will adopt the Convention that

       the seller performs; and we will adopt similar conventions later on

       in the paper without comment.
                                             4




18.   This assumption seems appropriate if one is considering cases in

      which bidders would find it costly to identify the contract buyer,

      or when they would find it best to look elsewhere if the seller

      reported that he was obligated to deliver to the contract buyer,

      etc.

19.   Were we to complicate the model so as to allow for such purchases,

      it will be clear that the next Proposition would still be true.

      This is because there would be a loss in the sum values if the buyer

      purchased from the bidder rather than receiving delivery directly

      from the contract seller; for it is natural to assume that the buyer

      would have to pay more than b--what the seller received--to induce

      the bidder to sell. (Noreover, the purchase would involve additional

      transaction costs.)

20.   It is also easy to show that the parties should be indifferent as

      between making contracts with distinct Pareto efficient breach sets:

      Suppose that B1 B are each Pareto efficient. Then for any con-

      tract (B1, k1) we must show that there exists a k2 such that under

      (B2, k2), both parties are equally well off. To do this, let k2 =

      Eb(B2)
               -
                   Eb(Bl)
                            +

21.   Specifically, if we let S denote a contingency, then a complete con-

      tingent contract is specified not only by k and B, but also by a

      function, say g(O), indicating how much (positive or negative) the

      seller is to pay the buyer given the contingency 0. It is easy to

      show that a necessary condition for Pareto efficiency of a contract

      (B, K, g(•)) is that B be such that for each 0, the sum                          of   values is
                                      5




        maximized. Thus, by the Remark, the choiceof B is the same as when

        parties are risk neutral. And given this choice of B, g must be

        such as to share risk in a Pareto efficient way, that is, (as Borch

           [1962] originally showed) the ratio of the buyer's marginal utility

        to the seller's must be maintained constant over 0.

 22.    This is of course a well known aspect of Pareto efficient risk

        sharing.

23.    If this is true, the buyer will get his expectancy whether or not

       the    seller performs, so that the buyer's final wealth will be

       constant (and will equal v - k -    r).
24.    For example, under a contract for transfer of possession, if it is

       Pareto efficient for the seller to sell to a bidder, the buyer will

       get the proceeds from the sale.     (Of course, because the seller

       expects to give up these proceeds in such circumstances, he will

       have received a higher contract price than otherwise.)

25.    Thus z(O) might equal either x(O) or y(O), depending on what the

       seller would do in the absence of a contingent term in the contract.

       Also, z(O) might be less than either or both of x(O) and y(6) if

       given 0 there would be costs involved in settling disputes.

26.    S     B =   {o)es,   0B}.
27.    There is no simple formula because the decision whether to include a

       particular contingency depends (as it did not in the risk neutral

       case) on whether there are provisions for other contingencies. Such

       interdependence may come about through the following kind of "wealth

       effect": If provisions are made for other contingencies, a
                                             6



      party's wealth will be lowered due to the costs f(0)dO. This could
                                                                      S
      in    turn increase his need for "insurance" against an adverse 0 and
      thus his desire to include a provision allowing for an appropriate
      sharing    of risk given 0.

28.   With one exception, it will make no difference whether one thinks of

      the parties as being aware of the remedy the courts will apply (the

      interpretation made in the paper) or as having specified in the

      contract which remedy (so called liquidated damages) will apply.

      The exception concerns the expectation measure; see note 29.

29.   If the reader wishes to consider the situation where the parties set

      out in the contract the amount to be paid for breach, then it might

      be appropriate to assume that u                  v sine the seller would often

      have a better idea of the expectancy than the court (and, in any

      event, we have assumed here that the seller knows v).

30.   It can easily be shown that v >              r   + k must hold for the buyer to be

      willing to make a contract (i.e., for Eb - k > 0) under any of the

      remedies considered. See for example note 31 below.

31.   For the buyer to make the contract, we must have Eb(res)                       k >   0.
      Thus, using the next equation, we have vPr{c)c                   k} -    r+   kPr{c}c     >   k}
      —    k > 0 or vPr{cjc   k} -       r   -
                                                 kPr(clc    k}   > 0 or (v -   r)/   Prclc          k}   >


      which implies that v -    r    >   k.
32.   If   k   ci, the seller will commit breach with probability one under

      restitution, so that the expected value of the contract to the

      seller would be zero (and to the buyer it woul.d be negative). It

      will also follow by similar reasoning that k must exceed c under the

      other remedies as well, and we will not bother to mention this fact

      again.
                                                               7




 33.    This follows from the condition Eb(rel) - k > 0 by an argument

        analogous to that in note 31.

 34.    In the double integral in (9), it will be convenient to indicate the

       set over which integration is performed by the shorthand {c > uJ

       rather than by {c, uc > u} or by upper and lower limits of inte-

       gration. We will also employ similar shorthands in other integral

       expressions.

35.    The precise meaning of "the problem of excessive performance" and

       "the problem of inappropriate breach" is best explained in the

       proof.

36.    As the reader who examines the proof will see, there is a complica-

       tion in the argument showing part (a) (and (c)) due to. the fact that

       under the reliance measure, the contract price affects breach be-

       havior and thus the sum of expected values of the contract. (The

       higher the price, the less frequent is breach and the higher the sum

       of values.) This means that to show that the reliance measure is

       Pareto superior to another measure, one must use the definition of

       Pareto superiority directly; it does not suffice to demonstrate that

       the sum of expected values is higher under the reliance measure.

37.    The assumptions that they split the gain equally and that they bear

       equal costs of renegotiation are not important to our results.

38.    If we let z be the payment made by the seller for his release, then

       the improvement in the buyer's position will be (z -                                  t-      r   -   k)   -


       (v   -   r    -
                             k)   = z -   t   -   v.     But we assumed that the parties split

       equally the gain in the sum of values from renegotiation, and these

       gains are (c -               v)    -   2t.      Hence z must satisfy z -      t   -   v   =   1/2
       (c -     v)       -
                             t,   or z    =v      +    l/2(c   -   v).   (Note therefore that the higher
                                                                        8




      the seller's cost of production would be, the more he pays the buyer

      for release.)

39.   In (32), the first term on the right hand side is the expected

      benefit from performance, the third is expected payments made by the

      seller when renegotiation occurs, and the fourth is the expected

      cost of renegotiation. The other formu'as below are similarly

      explained.

40.   Let z be the buyer's payment. Then the improvement in the seller's

      position if he does not default is (                                             -c    -   t       + k)      -
                                                                                                                        (k   -
                                                                                                                                  k)
      z - c -         t+              k and this must equal l/2(v - c)                               -    t.       Hence           = c +

      1/2(v       -
                      c)          —    k.
41.   If z is again the buyer's payment, thenthe improvement in the

      seller's position if he does not commit breach is (z — c —                                                                   t+      k)       —


      (k    -    (r   +       k))          =     -c        -    t   ÷ k +    r,   which must equal l/2(v - c) -                                    t,
      so z      =c        -       r    +       l/2(v   -
                                                               c)   -   k.
42.   If z       is   the buyer's payment, then the improvement in the seller's

      position if he does not default is (                                             -c    —   t       + k)      —
                                                                                                                        (k   —
                                                                                                                                  u)
      z —    c    -   t       +       u,    which must equal 1/2 (v - c) -                               t,    so z = c - u +                  1/2
      (v -      c).
43.   Let z equal the seller's payment, so the buyer's improvement in

      position if the seller is released is (z -                                                 t r
                                                                                                  -            -

                                                                                                                             Cv

                                                                                                                                                   k) =
      z-t         -
                      v,       which must equal 1/2(c -                           v)   -    t.    Thus z v +                      l/2(c        -
                                                                                                                                                    v).
44.   The terms on the right hand side of (38) are the expected value of

      performance, reliance, expected payments made to the seller to

      induce him to perform (when the expectancy is significantly under-

      estimated), the expected cost of such renegotiations, expected

      payments received from the seller for his release (when the expec-

      tancy is significantly overestimated), etc.

for the last two terms are clearly positive, and so is the first term.                                                                        (To

see that the first term is positive, note that since k                                                      c        r +         k,   the inte—

 These inequalities justify a graph similar to that of Figure 3, from which the

 result follows.

which establishes the result.

     Similarly, parts (c) and (d) follow in a straightforward way from the

former proof.
