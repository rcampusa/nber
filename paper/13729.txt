                                             ABSTRACT

The explosion in the 21st century of terrorist activities by Islamic radicals in the United States, Europe
and Asia requires reforming the institutions for domestic counterterrorism (CT) and new international
relations among individual national CT organizations. This paper discusses the institutional reforms
for CT in the United States, focusing particularly on the changes in the FBI. These changes are compared
with the way that the British CT activities of the MI5 and MI6 have evolved in response to terrorism
in Britain. The paper also discusses the reasons why there is strong cooperation among the CT activities
of all the major governments and with the United States in particular, even when those governments
do not agree about military cooperation or about the use of economic sanctions.

                           Designing Institutions to Deal with Terrorism

                                           Martin Feldstein*

         Although local acts of terrorism have been a persistent problem in several European

countries (Irish terrorists in Britain, Basque terrorists in Spain, Palestinian terrorists in Israel,

etc.), global terrorism driven by radical Islam suddenly exploded in the 21st century with attacks

in Europe, in North America and in Asia. This new terrorist threat requires changes in the

organization and operation of domestic counterterrorism (CT) and in the international relations

among the CT activities of national governments.

         Both types of change are particularly difficult to achieve. Changing the behavior of

government organizations is always more difficult than it is in the private sector where change is

driven by the combination of the profit motive and the pressure of competition. The inherently

covert nature of surveillance and other counterterrorist activities means that international

cooperation cannot be organized through traditional international institutions or in public

conferences. Nevertheless change in domestic CT activities is occurring and there is evidence of

strong international cooperation in dealing with terrorism.

         Countering the new terrorism is enormously important to the domestic economy, to

international trade, and to all of us as individuals. Potential terrorist acts include small scale

attacks on local targets (e.g., bombs in shopping centers) , major attacks like the nine-eleven

airplane attacks in New York and Washington and the foiled attempts to blow up several planes

conventional explosives, cyberterrorism that could shut down communication and transportation

networks, bioterrorism that could cause widespread disease, attacks on ports and other key

infrastructure, and the explosion of even a small nuclear device that could kill millions of people

and destroy a major part of a city.

         Although some terrorism can be state sponsored, the more difficult problem facing the

United States and other target countries is the terrorism that follows from radical Islam without

specific government sponsors. This means that, unlike the conflict with the Soviet Union in the

half century after World War II, the new terrorists do not provide an adversary with whom to

negotiate or against which to retaliate. The insights of Tom Schelling’s Strategy of Conflict do

not lend themselves directly to dealing with today’s adversaries.

         We do not know why radical Islam is spreading as it is or how long it will remain a major

source of violence. Alan Krueger has shown us that the terrorists are not driven by their personal

poverty. We understand that the leaders of Al Qaida are eager to replace the leadership in Saudi

Arabia, Egypt and elsewhere. We know that the high oil prices are contributing to the funds that

finance the new terrorism and the spread of its ideological underpinnings. But there is so much

about the cause, nature, and financing of the Islamic jihad that we do not know.

         Since I cannot begin to deal with all of these issues in the current brief paper, I will focus

on the issue of institutional change and international cooperation indicated in the title of this

session.

         The two aspects of counterterrorism are (1) the gathering and analysis of intelligence

about the activities of would be terrorists and (2) the interruption or prevention of such terrorist


Terrorism.AEA2008                                 -2-
acts. For the United States, both aspects involve new institutions, new legal rules, and new

forms of international cooperation.



Intelligence Gathering and Analysis. The operation of British intelligence is a useful place to

begin because it provides an informative contrast to American experience. British intelligence

has long been divided into two separate services: the MI5 (now known as the Security Service)

does intelligence gathering and analysis within the U.K. while the MI6 (now called the Secret

Intelligence Service) deals with intelligence activities in the rest of the world.

         Until the attacks in Britain by the radical Islamists, the MI5 had concentrated in recent

decades on the activities of the Irish separatists while the MI6 dealt with foreign powers,

primarily the Soviet Union and the affiliated communist organizations in other countries. The

primary job of these intelligence services is still to understand the activities and plans of

potential terrorists by infiltrating the terrorist organizations and the communities from which

they come and by recruiting others to report on these groups. These forms of direct human

intelligence gathering are supplemented by electronic surveillance and other forms of acquiring

information. An important activity of these intelligence services is to analyze the information

gathered in these ways in order to anticipate specific terrorist acts and to develop ways of

reducing all terrorist activities and terrorist recruiting. Although the MI5 does not have “police

powers” of arrest, it collaborates with the British police authorities (Scotland Yard) when such

arrests are needed.

         The explosion of Islamic terrorism in Britain led to a reform of the MI5 and MI6. The

MI5 shifted its intelligence gathering from the Irish community to Muslim groups and



Terrorism.AEA2008                                -3-
individuals, especially those from Pakistan. Although this required infiltrating new groups and

recruiting new sources, the basic MI5 tasks of human intelligence gathering and analysis did not

have to change. This made the British task much easier than the reforms in the U.S. intelligence

community that I will describe below.

         The MI6 shifted its activity radically to focus on what is happening in Pakistan and other

places where British terrorists are trained. Instead of being an intelligence agency with its own

agenda, the MI6 became the producer of information for the MI5. Although this was a major

change in MI6 activities that some insiders may have seen at the time as reducing its relative

status, the importance of the Pakistan training and the broader links of the terrorists with

Pakistan made this transformation necessary and its new role one of critical national importance.

         This British experience provides a useful comparison to the experience of the United

States where intelligence activities are divided between the FBI and the CIA. Until the 9/11

attacks there was relatively little official concern about the possibility of terrorist acts against

the United States. The 9/11 attacks changed that and led to a major increase in CT activity,

particularly by the FBI. The need for a new counterterrorism role for the FBI is the major

challenge for institutional design in dealing with terrorism in the United States.

         Before focusing on the FBI, it is useful to understand the broader scope of the U.S.

intelligence community. Since its founding in 1947, the CIA has had primary responsibility for

human intelligence gathering (i.e., by infiltration, the recruitment of others, mail intercepts, etc..)

on intelligence targets outside the United States, particularly in the Soviet Union. The CIA also

received and analyzed information collected by satellite interception of foreign telephone

communication (the “signal intelligence” of the National Security Agency), by the satellite



Terrorism.AEA2008                                 -4-
photography of the National Reconnaissance Organization, and by other parts of the intelligence

community. All of this was restricted to the activities of foreigners. The CIA is not allowed to

collect information on U.S. citizens, green card holders, and other persons in the United States.



The Federal Bureau of Investigation. The FBI is the primary law enforcement organization of

the federal government. It is responsible for investigating a wide range of criminal violations of

federal law (including kidnaping, bank robberies, narcotics violations, child pornography and

certain hate crimes) as well as dealing with terrorism, industrial espionage, and counter-

intelligence. The Special Agents of the FBI have the power to arrest and work with the local

federal attorneys general who prosecute the resulting criminal cases. As this description

indicates, the FBI is and has been very different from the British MI5. The FBI’s focus has been

on the capture and punishment of criminals after crimes have been committed rather than on the

prevention of unwanted acts.

         The FBI is organized into 56 local offices around the country. Although each office

reports to FBI headquarters in Washington, the local offices have historically been relatively

independent because the crimes with which they dealt were local. Until recently, the work of the

FBI did not use a group of analysts similar to those of the CIA and of the MI5 since the FBI’s

Special Agents drew their own inferences as they pursued individual criminals. There was only

a small analytic group at FBI headquarters that could in principle analyze information forwarded

from the field.

         The FBI agents were typically recruited among former law enforcement and military

personnel, as well as lawyers and accountants whose skills were helpful in dealing with white



Terrorism.AEA2008                               -5-
collar crimes. All FBI recruits have to pass relatively rigorous physical tests (running, chin ups,

etc) that were appropriate to their work as law enforcement officers.

         Counterterrorism was a small part of the FBI’s work prior to nine-eleven. The law

governing FBI activities also limits CT work to actions against individuals who are believed to

be acting on behalf of a foreign power. Although wiretapping and other forms of electronic

surveillance are readily authorized by ordinary courts for FBI use in criminal investigations,

their use in CT investigations requires specific authorization by a special federal court, a process

that involves substantial red tape and can involve long delays.

         After the attacks of nine-eleven, new legislation and presidential orders made CT a

primary responsibility of the FBI. The government substantially increased the FBI’s budget for

this purpose, created new positions in FBI headquarters to oversee CT activities, and required

each local FBI office to create an intelligence gathering and analysis group.

         But increased dollars, new leadership positions, and some organizational changes in the

local offices did not automatically change the operation of the FBI on the ground. The shift from

traditional criminal work to CT requires a major change in the culture of the organization, a shift

from arrest and prosecution after a crime has been committed to the gathering of information and

analysis designed to prevent terrorist acts before they happen. The FBI Special Agents doing CT

work collect intelligence and task “sources” (i.e., ask individuals who are not government

employees) to collect intelligence, a very different activity than the overt police work of

criminal investigation and prosecution.

         This creates a difficult problem for FBI personnel management. FBI Special Agents who

do criminal work can be evaluated and promoted on their record of arrests and convictions. In



Terrorism.AEA2008                               -6-
CT work, the primary product is information and analysis rather than arrests and convictions,

making it far more difficult to measure the productivity of individual Agents and to compare the

performance of Special Agents doing counterterrorism with the performance of those doing

criminal work.

         For FBI Agents with many years of experience doing criminal work, the shift to CT

required a fundamental reorientation of daily activities and of how the agents judged their own

performance. For men accustomed to the gun-carrying police work of arrests, the shift to

intelligence gathering may seem to be a very tame activity even though its contribution to

national security is greater than what they had done in their criminal work.

         None of this cultural change was needed in Britain’s MI5. The members of the MI5 only

had to shift their focus from Irish terrorists to Muslim terrorists. There were no doubt difficult

practical issues in infiltrating a new population group, especially one that is ethnically so

different from the MI5 staff. But the culture of recruiting sources in the terrorist base

community and tasking those sources to collect information was a familiar one. The MI5 also

had the tradition of a strong analytic group whose task was to integrate the intelligence collected

in the field.

         For the FBI, achieving the necessary cultural change requires significant institutional

changes. These changes are a work in progress. A visit to the FBI’s recruiting web site now

shows a new emphasis on counterterrorism careers, with separate career paths for criminal, CT,

and cybercrime. Recruiting goes beyond the ethnic and professional groups that previously

produced FBI Special Agents. The training program that Special Agents receive gives more

attention to problems of terrorism than it did in the past. The principle criticisms raised by



Terrorism.AEA2008                                -7-
Richard Posner and others is that these changes have not gone far enough, leaving the FBI with a

bias in favor of criminal work and a staff that prefers criminal work to CT investigations.

         The new CT responsibilities of the FBI also required the creation of a group of analysts

who can interpret the evidence collected by the special agents and who can use their analytic

product to direct additional investigations. At first, the individuals assigned to these positions

were previous clerical staff and low level administrators of the FBI. They lacked the training

and skills to do this important work. Over time, the FBI has been recruiting a more qualified

group of analysts, although critics note that the training of these analysts needs to be

substantially strengthened.



Communication and Coordination within the Intelligence Community In addition to changing

the culture to give greater value to CT work and strengthening the personnel by new recruiting

and training, the FBI (and the intelligence community more generally) had to create institutions

to increase communication within the intelligence community. The official 9/11 Commission

concluded that the failure of the intelligence community to predict and therefore prevent those

attacks despite scattered recognition of suspicious activity pointed to the failure of

communication across FBI offices and between the FBI and other parts of the intelligence

community. That lack of communication was not a problem when the FBI’s activity focused on

local crimes but was inappropriate for its new CT mission.

         Five new institutions were created to increase communication and to coordinate CT

operations. First, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) was created in 2003 to combine a

variety of existing agencies that collect information and that take actions relating to terrorism



Terrorism.AEA2008                                -8-
and CT, including the immigration service and the Coast Guard. Second, the National Center for

Counterterrorism (NCTC) was created in 2004 to integrate and analyze on a real time basis the

information dealing with terrorism that is collected by all parts of the intelligence community.

Staff from the FBI, CIA, and other intelligence agencies sit at the NCTC facility where they

share information reports and have access to the information generated within the separate

intelligence organizations. A principal function of the NCTC is to perform integrative analyses

of the information that is collected. Third, also at the national level, legislation enacted in 2004

created a new organization (the Office of the Director of National Intelligence) to coordinate the

entire intelligence and counterterrorism activity of the government, headed by a Director of

National Intelligence. The NCTC is part of that Office.

         Fourth, there is now a Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) in each of the 56 FBI local

areas. The JTTF provides a physical location and organizational structure that brings together

FBI agents, CIA agents, local police officers, members of the Defense Intelligence Agency and

others to share current intelligence information collected in that geographic area. And, fifth, the

federal government has mandated and subsidized each state government to create a Fusion

Center that combines state police, local police, and members of the intelligence community to

coordinate information and actions on terrorism, criminal activities, and major natural disasters.

         As a result of these new institutions there is undoubtedly much greater coordination of

information and a greater sense within the police organizations as well as the intelligence

community of the importance of counterterrorism activities.



International Cooperation. Although there is the risk of self-radicalized terrorists in the United



Terrorism.AEA2008                                -9-
States who are inspired by the Islamic jihad, the primary terrorist threat to the United States now

comes from abroad. Similarly, within Britain, Europe, and the Middle East the terrorists either

come from abroad or are local residents who have gone abroad for training.

         It is therefore clear that effective counterterrorism requires international cooperation.

Newspaper reports indicate that such cooperation is now actively pursued. The intelligence

services of Britain, the United States and Pakistan cooperated to prevent the planned

simultaneous bombing of airplanes traveling from London to New York. The U.S. and Russian

intelligence services coordinated the arrest of an individual who was attempting to sell fissile

material. Additional reports involving virtually all of the major countries can be found in news

stories during just the past two years.

         Two things stand out about the nature of this international cooperation. First, there is no

formal organization through which this cooperation occurs. Information sharing is done on a

bilateral and multilateral basis among the individual national intelligence agencies. Second,

close cooperation with the United States occurred even by governments that in public were very

critical of U.S. policy in Iraq and elsewhere.

         It is interesting therefore to ask what it is that drives this close international cooperation

in counterterrorism. I believe that three things have been essential to the ability of the U.S. to

get such close cooperation from foreign intelligence services. The first of these is the self-

interest of all the cooperating countries. Each country can gain from trading information about

potential terrorist threats. This is very different from attempts at cooperation in military activities

in Afghanistan or Iraq where national self interest is less obvious to other countries or in

discussions about the use of economic sanctions which countries resist because of potential loss



Terrorism.AEA2008                                 -10-
of export sales. Second, the United States has superior space-based technology for surveillance

of electronic communication by voice and internet and for photographic reconnaissance. Other

nations need to cooperate with the United States in order to get the information that only we can

obtain in these ways. And, third, the collaboration among intelligence services is generally

done without the public visibility that accompanies attempts at military and diplomatic activities

through organizations like the United Nations.

          Terrorism is unfortunately likely to be one of the major problems facing the United

States and other nations in the years ahead. Continued progress in strengthening counterterrorist

organizations within the United States and cooperation in counterterrorism among allies will

therefore remain one of our key national priorities.
