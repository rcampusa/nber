                                            ABSTRACT

This paper discusses formal quantitative algorithms that can be used to identify business cycle
turning points. An intuitive, graphical derivation of these algorithms is presented along with a
description of how they can be implemented making very minimal distributional assumptions. We
also provide the intuition and detailed description of these algorithms for both simple parametric
univariate inference as well as latent-variable multiple-indicator inference using a state-space
Markov-switching approach. We illustrate the promise of this approach by reconstructing the
inferences that would have been generated if parameters had to be estimated and inferences drawn
based on data as they were originally released at each historical date. Waiting until one extra quarter
of GDP growth is reported or one extra month of the monthly indicators released before making a
call of a business cycle turning point helps reduce the risk of misclassification. We introduce two
new measures for dating business cycle turning points, which we call the “quarterly real-time GDP-
based recession probability index” and the “monthly real-time multiple-indicator recession
probability index” that incorporate these principles. Both indexes perform quite well in simulation
with real-time data bases. We also discuss some of the potential complicating factors one might want
to consider for such an analysis, such as the reduced volatility of output growth rates since 1984 and
the changing cyclical behavior of employment. Although such refinements can improve the
inference, we nevertheless find that the simpler specifications perform very well historically and may
be more robust for recognizing future business cycle turning points of unknown character.

1     Introduction

The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) is a private research organization that, among

other activities, identifies dates at which the U.S. would be said to be experiencing an economic

recession.1    These dates, reported at http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html, are regarded

as authoritative by both academic researchers and the public at large.

    For example, in July, 2003, the NBER announced that the most recent recession had finally

ended. Remarkably, what the NBER announced in July, 2003 was that the recession had actually

ended in November, 2001. There had been a similar two-year delay in the previous recession, for

which the NBER announced in December, 1992 that the recession had ended in March, 1991.

    These quasi-oﬃcial dates are the outcome of discussions of the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating

Committee, a group of highly respected academics who review a variety of economic indicators

to form a qualitative judgment about the state of the economy. The delays are explained by the

fact that the Committee wants to be quite confident about its assessment before making a public

declaration. There is nevertheless a cost to this accuracy, in that many members of the public can

continue to believe that the economy is in a recession long after a solid recovery is under way. For

example, in the 1992 election, the opposition party declared that the U.S. was experiencing the

worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. A look at most of the facts would lead one

to dismiss this claim as political hyperbole. However, if it had been the case that the recession

beginning in July 1990 was still persisting as of November 1992, as one might have legitimately

inferred from the failure of the NBER to announce the recession as over, it indeed would have

qualified as the longest economic downturn since the Depression. More recently, the widespread

belief by the American public that the U.S. was still in recession in 2003 may have played a role

in tax cuts approved by the U.S. Congress, the outcome of a special election for the governor of

California, and a host of other policy and planning decisions by government bodies, private firms,

and individual households.

    During the last decade, academic researchers have come to treat the question of whether the

economy is experiencing a recession as a formal statistical issue rather than a subjective qualitative

assessment. This approach started with Hamilton (1989) and has since been adopted in hundreds

of academic studies.2        Given the importance to the public at large of identifying where the

economy is at any given point in time, it seems worthwhile to investigate whether these formal

quantitative methods could be used to produce announcements that might be useful to the public

in real time. The purpose of this chapter is to review the performance of several such methods.

We begin in Section 2 with a background discussion of this approach in a very simple application

that uses only data on U.S. real GDP growth and minimal distributional assumptions. In Section

3 we implement a parametric version of this approach to GDP data.                     Section 4 describes a

method for combining the inference from a number of diﬀerent economic indicators.3                  Section 5

presents results from such multivariate inference, while Section 6 explores the robustness of these

multivariate inferences to several alternative specifications.4


2     What can we infer from U.S. GDP growth rates?

Figure 1 plots quarterly growth rates (quoted at an annual rate) of U.S. real GDP since 1947, with

dates of economic recessions as determined by the NBER indicated with shaded regions. Consider

what we can say from this GDP data alone about the broad properties of NBER’s classifications.

Forty-five of the 229 quarters between 1947:II and 2004:II were classified as “recession” and the

remaining 184 as “expansion.”         First consider the 45 recession quarters as representatives of a

certain population, namely, what GDP growth looks like when the economy is in recession. The
  2 For some alternatives see Lundbergh and Terasvirta (2002), van Dijk, Terasvirta and Franses (2002), Harding

and Pagan (2002) and Artis, Marcelino and Proietti (2004).
   3 More specifically, we use a dynamic factor model with regime switching, as in Chauvet (1998), which is a

nonlinear state space model. This class of models is very popular in several fields. Some of the important work
in this area includes Gordon and Smith (1990), Carlin, Polson, and Stoﬀer (1992), Kitagawa (1987), Fridman and
Harris (1998), Kim and Nelson (1999a), Durbin and Koopman (1997), among others.
   4 A companion paper by Chauvet and Piger (2005) compares the results from the method described in Section

4 with mechanical business cycle dating rules proposed by Harding and Pagan (2002).



                                                      3
average quarterly growth rate in recession is -1.23% (expressed at an annual rate), with a standard

deviation of 3.55. The top panel of Figure 2 plots a nonparametric kernel estimate of the density

of these 45 quarters.5        One is more likely to see GDP falling than rising during a recession, but

this is by no means certain; in fact, 15 of the 45 recession quarters are associated with positive

GDP growth.

       [ insert Figure 1 about here ]

       The bottom panel of Figure 2 plots the corresponding density for the 184 postwar quarters

classified as economic expansion.          These are characterized by a mean annualized growth rate

of 4.49% with a standard deviation of 3.24. This distribution is overwhelmingly dominated by

positive growth rates, though there again is some small probability of observing a negative growth

rate during what is considered to be an economic expansion.

       [ insert Figure 2 about here ]

       If one simply selects a postwar quarterly growth rate at random, there’s a 20% probability it

would be one of the 45 quarters classified as a recession and an 80% probability of falling in an

expansion. The unconditional distribution of GDP growth rates can be viewed as a mixture of the

two distributions in Figure 2. This mixture is represented in the top panel of Figure 3, in which

the height of the long-dashed line is found by multiplying the height of the top panel of Figure 2

by 0.2. The short-dashed line represents 0.8 times the bottom curve of Figure 2. The sum of

these two curves (the solid line in the top panel of Figure 3) represents the unconditional density

of one quarter’s growth rate without knowing whether or not the quarter would be classified as

recession.

       [ insert Figure 3 about here ]

       From the top panel of Figure 3, one could make an intelligent prediction as to what classification

NBER will eventually arrive at (expansion or recession) as soon as the GDP figures are released.
   5    This was calculated using the “density” command in RATS with a Gaussian kernel and bandwidth set equal
to 3.




                                                        4
If GDP falls by more than 6%, most of the height of the solid line is coming from the long-dashed

density, suggesting that it is overwhelmingly likely that the quarter will be classified as recession.

If GDP rises by more than 6%, almost none of the density comes from the short-dashed line,

leading us to expect NBER to classify that quarter as expansion. Intuitively, we might use the

ratio of the height of the long-dashed line to the height of the solid line as a measure of the

likelihood that NBER would classify a quarter with GDP growth of an amount specified on the

horizontal axis as being part of a recession. This ratio is plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 3.

   Using this ratio in this way is more than intuitively appealing. It turns out to be precisely an

application of Bayes Law for this setting. Specifically, let St = 1 if the NBER ends up classifying

quarter t as an expansion and St = 2 if recession. Let yt denote the quarter t GDP growth rate.

Then f (yt |St = 2) is the density of GDP growth rates in recession, a nonparametric estimate of

which is given by the top panel of Figure 2, while the expansion density f (yt |St = 1) corresponds

to the bottom panel. Let Pr(St = 2) = 0.20 be the probability that any given quarter is classified

as recession. Bayes Law states that the probability that NBER will declare a recession given that

the GDP growth for the quarter is known to be yt can be calculated from

                                                   f(yt |St = 2) Pr(St = 2)
                 Pr(St = 2|yt ) =                                                         .           (1)
                                    f (yt |St = 1) Pr(St = 1) + f (yt |St = 2) Pr(St = 2)

But f(yt |St = 2) Pr(St = 2) is simply the height of the long-dashed line in Figure 3, while

f (yt |St = 1) Pr(St = 1) is the height of the short-dashed line.          Hence the ratio plotted in the

bottom panel of Figure 3,

                                                        0.2 f(yt |St = 2)
                        Pr(St = 2|yt ) =                                            ,
                                            0.8 f (yt |St = 1) + 0.2 f (yt |St = 2)

is indeed the optimal prediction Pr(St = 2|yt ) about what NBER will declare if the quarter’s GDP

growth is yt .

   Predicting NBER’s declaration if we get growth rates as extreme as ±6% is obviously quite

robust and sensible. Unfortunately, it is not particularly useful, since the vast majority of GDP

growth rates are not this extreme, and for typical data the prediction about what NBER will

                                                      5
declare in the bottom panel of Figure 3 is not very precise. Fortunately, there is another piece

of information about the NBER’s classifications that can be extremely helpful here, which is the

fact that the Committee usually makes the same declaration in t + 1 that it made in t. Of the

45 quarters characterized as recession, 35 or 78% were followed by another quarter of recession.

Of the 183 expansion quarters between 1947:II and 2004:I, 173 or 95% were followed by another

quarter of expansion.

   Suppose we observe a particular GDP growth rate for quarter t of yt ; perhaps this is a value

like yt = −6, which we are reasonably confident will be described as a recession.              Given this

information, the probability that next quarter t + 1 will also be classified as a recession is no

longer 0.20 but is much higher. Specifically,


Pr(St+1 = 2|yt ) = Pr(St+1 = 2|St = 2, yt ) Pr(St = 2|yt ) + Pr(St+1 = 2|St = 1, yt ) Pr(St = 1|yt )

                  = 0.78 Pr(St = 2|yt ) + (1 − 0.95) Pr(St = 1|yt )


where we’ve assumed that Pr(St+1 = 2|St = 2, yt ) = Pr(St+1 = 2|St = 2) = 0.78. For example,

if there was convincing evidence of a recession in period t (say, Pr(St = 2|yt ) = 0.9), then the

probability that we will still be in recession in t+1 would be (0.78)(0.9)+(1−0.95)(1−0.9) = 0.71.

If we then learn the quarter t + 1 growth rate yt+1 as well, the inference about St+1 is found not

from the height of the bottom panel of Figure 3, but instead from a mixture whose recession

probability is 0.71 rather than 0.20, that is, equation (1) would be replaced with

                                        f(yt+1 |St+1 = 2, yt ) Pr(St+1 = 2|yt )
         Pr(St+1 = 2|yt+1 , yt ) =    P2
                                       j=1 f(yt+1 |St+1 = j, yt ) Pr(St+1 = j|yt )
                                                     0.71 f (yt+1 |St+1 = 2, yt )
                                 =                                                              .     (2)
                                      0.29 f(yt+1 |St+1 = 1, yt ) + 0.71 f(yt+1 |St+1 = 2, yt )

If we assume that recessions are the only source of GDP dynamics, so that f (yt+1 |st+1 , yt ) =

f (yt+1 |st+1 ), we could again use the height of the top panel of Figure 2 at the given value of yt+1

as our estimate of f(yt+1 |St+1 = 2, yt ), in which case we just replace the mixture in the top panel

of Figure 3 (which assumed a 20% weight on the recession density and 80% on the expansion


                                                   6
density), with a mixture that puts 71% weight on the recession density and 29% on the expansion

density, as in the top panel of Figure 4. The ratio of the height of the long-dashed curve to the

solid curve in the top panel of Figure 4 gives the inference (2), plotted in the bottom panel of

Figure 4. If we were reasonably confident that quarter t was a recession, we are much more prone

to call t + 1 a recession as well.

   [ insert Figure 4 about here ]

   Another perspective on this form of inference is obtained as follows.           Suppose that GDP

growth for quarter t is given by yt = y, from which we calculate Pr(St = 2|yt = y) as in the

bottom panel of Figure 3.      We can then use this magnitude Pr(St = 2|yt = y) in place of the

constant 0.20 to weight the recession distribution. The ratio of the heights of the recession curve

to the combined distribution would then correspond to Pr(St+1 = 2|yt+1 = y, yt = y), that is, it

is the probability of recession if we happened to observe GDP growth equal to y for two quarters

in a row. This quantity is plotted in the bottom panel of Figure 5, which is substantially steeper

than the plot of Pr(St+1 = 2|yt+1 = y) shown in the top panel. For example, if we had only a

single quarter’s observation of GDP, we would not have 50% confidence in predicting a recession

unless GDP growth was below −3.4%.           By contrast, two consecutive quarters GDP growth of

-1.8% would also give us 50% confidence that the economy had entered a recession.

   [ insert Figure 5 about here ]

   We could use the same principle to get a better picture of whether the economy was in a

recession in quarter t once we know the economic growth rate in quarter t + 1. Specifically, we

first make a prediction about both St and St+1 based on yt alone,


                   Pr(St+1 = j, St = i|yt ) = Pr(St+1 = j|St = i, yt ) Pr(St = i|yt ).




                                                   7
This magnitude can be calculated by multiplying Pr(St = i|yt ) by the appropriate constant:

We then use Bayes Law to update this joint inference based on observation of yt+1 :


                        Pr(St+1 = j, St = i|yt+1 , yt )

                               Pr(St+1 = j, St = i|yt )f (yt+1 |St+1 = j, St = i, yt )

We can again estimate f (yt+1 |St+1 = j, St = i, yt ) by f (yt+1 |St+1 = j), that is, by the top panel of

Figure 2 when j = 2 and the bottom panel when j = 1. The desired inference about the economy

at date t based on information observed at date t + 1 is then

   We have thus seen how, given nonparametric knowledge of how the distribution of GDP growth

is diﬀerent between expansions and contractions,


                                         f(yt |St = i) for i = 1, 2,


of how frequently the economy stays in the same regime,


                                    Pr(St+1 = j|St = i) for i, j = 1, 2,


and the approximation that the state of the economy (recession or expansion) is the only proba-

bilistic link between one quarter and the next,6


                 Pr(St+1 = j|St = i) = Pr(St+1 = j|St = i, St−1 = k, ..., yt , yt−1 , ...)
   6 In the parametric application of this approach described in the next section, we tested this assumption by

using several alternative specifications of the Markov switching model, including higher autoregressive processes
or allowing the variance and mean to follow the same or distinct Markov processes. We find that the simplest
representation describes the data quite well and is most robust on a recursive sample of real-time data.

one can use knowledge of GDP growth rates through date t to make a prediction about whether

the economy is in recession at any date τ ,


                                         Pr(Sτ = i|y1 , y2 , ..., yt ).


If t = τ, these are referred to as the “filter probabilities”, whereas when t > τ they are described

as “smoothed probabilities.”


3    Parametric representation.

Although it is interesting to know how to perform these calculations nonparametrically, this degree

of generality is really not needed for the problem at hand, since it appears from Figure 2 that a

Gaussian distribution works quite well to describe these densities.                 The fact that the recession

distribution has a standard deviation very similar to that for the expansion distribution implies

that we would also lose little by assuming that the two distributions diﬀer only in their means

and share the same standard deviation σ. The suggestion is then that we replace the arbitrary

density f (yt |St = 2) in the top panel of Figure 2 with the N (µ2 , σ2 ) distribution,
                                                             µ                  ¶

                             f (yt |St = 2) = √    exp                              ,                       (6)

where µ2 , the mean growth rate in contractions, should be about -1.2 with σ around 3.5. Likewise

we could easily parameterize the bottom panel of Figure 2, f(yt |St = 1), with the N (µ1 , σ2 ) density

for µ1 = 4.5. Let p11 denote the probability that the economy remains in expansion from one

quarter to the next,

                                      p11 = Pr(St+1 = 1|St = 1),

and p22 the analogous probability for recessions:


                                      p22 = Pr(St+1 = 2|St = 2).



                                                       9
Again the historical experience would lead us to expect that p11 = 0.95 and p22 = 0.78. Let

θ = (µ1 , µ2 , σ, p11 , p22 )0 denote the various unknown parameters.

      These probabilities in turn imply a predicted probability for the second observation of

Iterating in this fashion we obtain the log likelihood for the complete sample of observed GDP

growth rates, y1 , y2 , ...., yT , as a function of the parameter vector θ:

                                                 T
                                                 X

      We motivated this way of thinking about the data by taking the NBER’s conclusions as given

and trying to characterize what the NBER has done.8                           However, no aspect of the NBER’s

dating appears in the final result (11), which is solely a function of observed GDP growth rates

and the unknown parameters θ.            One could accordingly choose as an estimate of θ the value

that maximizes the sample log likelihood of GDP growth rates (11). This maximum likelihood

estimate is compared with the values we would have expected on the basis of the NBER inferences

in Table 1.9      The two sets of parameter values, although arrived at by diﬀerent methods, are

remarkably similar.       This similarity is very encouraging, for two diﬀerent reasons.               First, it

enhances the intellectual legitimacy of the perspective that the economy can be classified as being

in an expansion or recession at any point in time, and that whether or not the economy is in

recession can account for much of the variability and serial dependence of GDP growth rates. We

did not impose any kind of conditions on the two means µ1 and µ2 , and one could imagine the

data being better described by all sorts of choices, such as “very rapid growth” versus “normal

growth”, or “normal growth” versus “slow growth.” Table 1 implies that, using just GDP data

alone without any reference to what NBER may have said, we would come up with a very similar

conceptual scheme to the one that economists and the NBER have traditionally relied on.

      [ insert Table 1 about here ]

      A second reason that the correspondence between the two columns in Table 1 is encouraging
   8 An alternative approach developed by Bry and Boschan (1971) attempts to formalize and elaborate on the rule

of thumb that two quarters of falling GDP constitute a recession. However, this rule of thumb does not describe
the decisions of the NBER Business Cycle Dating Committee, which defines a recession as “a significant decline in
economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real
income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales” (http://www.nber.org/cycles.html/). We
view our approach, unlike Bry and Boschan, as a direct statistical formalization of the NBER’s stated method for
qualitative evaluation.
  9   Maximum likelihood estimates were found using the EM algorithm described in Hamilton (1990).

is that it raises the promise that we might be able to use GDP growth rates alone to arrive at

classifications in a more timely and objective fashion than the NBER. The top panel of Figure

6 plots the filtered recession probabilities Pr(St = 2|yt , yt−1 , ..., y1 ; θ̂) implied by the maximum

likelihood estimate of the parameter vector θ.      For any date t this is the probability that the

economy is in recession based on observations of GDP growth rates at the time.           The dates of

economic recessions as determined after the fact by NBER are indicated by shaded regions on

the graph.   It seems clear that the two methodologies are identifying the same series of events

over the postwar period, with the filter probabilities rising above 75% at some point during every

postwar recession and typically remaining below 30% in times of expansions.           There are some

minor diﬀerences, with the two consecutive quarters of falling GDP in 1947:II-III and the -1.9%

growth in 1956:I temporarily pushing the filter probabilities a little over 50% in episodes that the

NBER did not characterize as recessions. Also, in the 1990-91 recession, the filter probabilities

did not come back below 50% until 1991:IV, although the NBER says that the recession ended in

1991:I. Overall, though, the correspondence seems quite strong.

   [ insert Figure 6 about here ]

   The bottom panel of Figure 6 plots the smoothed probabilities, for which the full sample of

observations through 2004:II was used to form an inference about the state of the economy at any

given date. Using the full sample substantially smooths out a number of the minor temporary

blips evident in the filter estimates, and brings the 1947 and 1956 inferences just under 50%, ever

so slightly favoring the NBER final call. Dates at which recessions began and ended according

to the NBER are compared with the dates for which the smoothed probabilities are above 50% in

Table 2. The smoothed probabilities date the 1980 recession as beginning 3 quarters earlier than

the date assigned by the NBER. The two methods never diﬀer by more than a quarter for either

the starting date or ending date for any other recession.

   This suggests that using a mechanical algorithm to identify business cycle turning points holds


                                                  12
considerable promise. However, even the filter probabilities in the top panel of Figure 6 do not

accurately capture the predictions that one could actually make with this framework in real time,

for two reasons. First, the complete sample of data through 2004 was used to estimate the values

of the parameter vector θ.    This perhaps is not an overwhelming concern, since, as we saw in

Table 1, one would have arrived at very similar magnitudes for θ just based on the properties that

one expects expansions and recessions should have. The second, more serious, problem is that

the GDP figures as originally released by the Bureau of Economic Analysis can diﬀer substantially

from the historical series now available.

   Croushore and Stark (2003) have established that the second issue can be extremely important

in practice, and have helped develop an extensive data set archived at the Federal Reserve Bank

of Philadelphia (available at http://www.phil.frb.org/econ/forecast/reaindex.html).              This data

set includes the history of GDP values that would have actually been available to a researcher or

forecaster at any given point in time. The database consists of one set of GDP levels for 1947:I-

1965:III that would have been reported as of the middle of 1965:IV, a second set of GDP levels

for 1947:I-1965:IV reported as of the middle of 1966:I, and so on, ending with a data set of GDP

levels from 1947:I-2004:II as reported in the middle of 2004:III, with the latter data set being the

one on which Figure 6 was based. There are a few gaps in this series, such as resulted from the

benchmark GDP revision released in 1992:I. As originally released this revision only went back to

1959:I rather than all the way to 1947:I. To construct the inferences reported below, we assume

that a researcher in 1992:I had available the GDP figures for 1947:I-1958:IV that technically were

not published until 1993:I.

   For each date T between 1968:II and 2004:II, we constructed the values for GDP growth for
                                                                                     [T ]

through T . We estimated the value θ̂          that maximized the log likelihood of {y1 , y2 , ..., yT }

and used this estimate to form inferences about the economy for each date t between 1947:II

and T . The last value for GDP growth in this sample,yT , (for example, the value of GDP for

2004:II as reported in 2004:III), is apt to be particularly noisy. Furthermore, there is a substantial

gain in accuracy from using the one-quarter smoothed probability rather than the current filtered

probability. For these reasons, one obvious way to reduce the risk of misclassification is to wait

to make a real-time assessment of the state of the economy in 2004:I until the first estimate of

2004:II growth (and revised estimate of 2004:I growth) is released in August 2004.

    The top panel of Figure 7 plots these real-time one-quarter-smoothed inferences Pr(ST −1 =
   [T ]   [T ]    [T ]     [T ]
2|y1 , y2 , ..., yT ; θ̂          ) as a function of T − 1.              The quality of the inference degrades a bit

using real-time released data in place of the full revised data set as now available. In particular,

successfully calling the end of the 1990-1991 recession would have been quite diﬃcult with the

data as actually released in 1992. Notwithstanding, the inference in each of the other recessions

based on using real-time GDP estimates with one-quarter of smoothing seems to produce quite a

satisfactory result overall.

Likewise, if last quarter we had declared the economy to be in a recession, then this quarter we

will declare the same thing as long as the one-quarter-smoothed probability of recession remains

above 35%:                    

the proposed announcement Dt             for each quarter. The algorithm does quite a satisfactory job

of identifying the dates at which recessions began and ended.            Its performance is compared

with NBER news releases in Table 4.            NBER would have beaten our mechanical algorithm by

one quarter on two occasions, declaring the start of the 2001 recession and the end of the 1991

recession one quarter earlier than we would have. On two other occasions (the start of the 1990-91

recession and end of the 1979-1980 recession), the mechanical rule beat NBER by one quarter.

Our algorithm also would have declared the start of the 1979-80 recession two quarters earlier,

and end of the 2001 recession four quarters earlier than did NBER. In all the other episodes, the

two approaches would have made the same announcement in the same historical quarter.

   These calculations suggest that an algorithmically-based inference could do quite a satisfactory

job of calling business cycle turning points in real time. Not only does its quantitative performance

seem to be a little better than NBER’s, but there is an added benefit of objectivity. Given the

potential of recession pronouncements to influence elections and policy decisions, there is always

a possibility that there could be pressure to delay or accelerate making a subjective declaration

in order to try to influence these outcomes. Our approach, by contrast, is completely objective

and its mechanical operation transparent and reproducible.

    Our approach does have an ambiguity that the NBER announcements lack, however, in that

it highlights the uncertainty inherent in the enterprise and calls direct attention to the fact that

sometimes the situation is very diﬃcult to call one way or another (for example, when the recession

probability index is near 50%). We would suggest, however, that this is inherent in the nature of

the question being asked, and that openly recognizing this ambiguity is intellectually more honest

and accurate than trying to conceal it. As long as we take the view that an economic recession

is a real, objective event that may or may not have accounted for the observed data, there will

always be some uncertainty in determining when and if one actually occurred.           For better or

worse, an objective assessment of the state of the economy of necessity must communicate not

just a judgment (expansion or recession), but also some information about how compelling that

conclusion is, given the data. The combined information conveyed by our proposed measures qt

and Dt seems a very promising way to communicate this information.


4     Using multiple indicators to identify turning points.

One drawback of the GDP-based measure is that it is only available quarterly. Given the lags

in data collection and revision, this introduces an inherent 5-month delay in reporting of the

index.   A variety of measures available on a monthly basis might be used to produce much

better inferences. By modeling the behavior of a number of diﬀerent variables simultaneously, we

can capture pervasive cyclical fluctuations in various sectors of the economy. As recessions and

expansions are caused by diﬀerent shocks over time, the inclusion of diﬀerent variables increases the

ability of the model to represent and signal phases of the business cycle in the monthly frequency.

In addition, the combination of variables reduces measurement errors in the individual series and,

consequently, the likelihood of false turning point signals, which is particularly important when

monthly data are used.

    Certainly the NBER dating committee does not base its conclusions just on the behavior of


                                                 16
quarterly GDP. Inspired by the seminal work of Burns and Mitchell (1946), the NBER Business

Cycle Dating Committee today primarily looks at four key monthly indicators10 , including the

growth rates of manufacturing and trade sales (sales), total personal income less transfer payments

(income), civilian labor force employed in nonagricultural industries (employment), and industrial

production (IP). Let yt denote the (4 × 1) vector whose first element y1t is sales growth, y2t is

income growth, y3t is employment growth, and y4t is IP growth. In this section, we show how

one can adapt the method of the previous section to use all four variables to infer the state of the

business cycle.

    A simple vector generalization of the approach in the preceding section would be quite straight-

forward. We could simply posit that the vector yt has one mean µ(1) in expansions and a second

mean µ(2) in recessions, where we indicate the economic regime with a superscript, reserving

subscripts in this section to denote individual elements of a vector or to indicate the value of a

variable for a particular date t. For example, the first element of the vector µ(2) would denote

the average growth rate of sales during a recession. If H denotes the variance-covariance matrix

of these growth rates in either expansion or recession, then we could simply replace the scalar

N (µ2 , σ 2 ) distribution in (6) with the vector N (µ(2) , H) distribution,

                                    1                n                                  o
                                            −1/2                   (2) 0 −1        (2)
              f(yt |St = 2) =            |H|     exp  −(1/2)[yt − µ   ] H   [yt − µ    ]  ,                    (12)
                                 (2π)n/2

where n = 4 denotes the number of elements in the vector yt . In every formula where we

previously had the scalar f(yt |St = j) we would now have the scalar f(yt |St = j). For example,

to calculate the probability of a recession given only GDP growth yt in Figure 3 we took the

ratio of the height of two lines. In the vector case we would be taking the ratio of the height of
  10 In NBER’s FAQ page on business cycle dating at http://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html#faq, it is stated

that “The committee places particular emphasis on two monthly measures of activity across the entire economy: (1)
personal income less transfer payments, in real terms and (2) employment. In addition, the committee refers to two
indicators with coverage primarily of manufacturing and goods: (3) industrial production and (4) the volume of sales
of the manufacturing and wholesale-retail sectors adjusted for price changes. The committee also looks at monthly
estimates of real GDP such as those prepared by Macroeconomic Advisers (see http://www.macroadvisers.com).
Although these indicators are the most important measures considered by the NBER in developing its business cycle
chronology, there is no fixed rule about which other measures contribute information to the process.” We follow
Chauvet (1998) in using civilian labor force in nonagricultural industries rather than employees on nonagricultural
payrolls as used by NBER, for reasons detailed in Section 6 below.


                                                        17
two multidimensional surfaces, where the ratio of f (yt |St = 2) Pr(St = 2) to the sum [f (yt |St =

1) Pr(St = 1) + f (yt |St = 2) Pr(St = 2)] would tell us the probability of a recession given that

the vector of growth rates is observed to equal yt , a calculation that could be performed for any

possible yt . In essence, we would be judging the probability of a recession by whether, taken as

a group, the elements of yt are closer to the values we typically associate with expansions, µ(1) ,

or closer to the values we typically associate with recessions, µ(2) , with closeness based on the

respective values of [yt − µ(j) ]0 H−1 [yt − µ(j) ] for j = 1 or 2, but also taking into account how

likely we expected an expansion or recession to be Pr(St = j) before seeing the data yt .

   Though this would be one possibility, it is not the best way to approach monthly data, since

our simplifying assumption in equation (5) that recessions account for all of the observed dynamic

behavior of yt is no longer a very good one when we get to these higher frequency, more detailed

data.   We therefore adopt a generalization of the above method which has the basic eﬀect of

allowing µ(j) , the vector of growth rates that we expect when the economy is in regime j at date

t, to depend not just on the current regime j but also on the previous economic regime St−1 = i

as well as the whole history of previous values for yt−m . The same is potentially true for the

variance-covariance matrix H. Thus the general approach is based on a specification of


              f(yt |St = j, St−1 = i, Yt−1 )
                       ¯       ¯        ½      h            i0 h       i−1 h             i¾
                 1     ¯ (i,j) ¯−1/2                  (i,j)      (i,j)             (i,j)
            =          ¯Ht ¯         exp −(1/2) yt − µt         Ht           yt − µt            (13)
              (2π)n/2

where Yt−1 denotes the history of observations obtained through date t − 1 :

                                                0        0        0
                                    Yt−1 = (yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 )0 .


   The dependence on both St and St−1 presents no real problems.           Rather than forming an

inference in the form of a probability that the current regime St = j, we will be calculating a joint

probability that St = j and St−1 = i,


                                      Pr(St = j, St−1 = i|Yt ).

                                                    18
Indeed, we already saw exactly how to do this in equation (3). Here we are basically calculating
                                                                                            (i,j)
how close the various elements of yt are to the corresponding elements of µt                        , that is, how close

they are to what we would have predicted given that St = j and St−1 = i and the past observations

yt−m . The inference then favors those combinations i, j with the best fit to yt , taking into account

also how likely the combination i, j was regarded to be before seeing yt .
                                                           (i,j)
     The question then is what growth rates µt                     we expect for yt in diﬀerent phases of the

business cycle. We follow Chauvet (1998) and Kim and Nelson (1999a) in their specification of

how a recession may aﬀect diﬀerent economic indicators at the same time.

     Our basic assumption is that there exists an aggregate cyclical factor Ft that evolves according

to

                                    Ft = α(St ) + φFt−1 + ηt              St = 1, 2,                               (14)

where η t ∼ N (0, σ2η ) and α(St ) = α(1) when the economy overall is in an expansion (St = 1) and

α(St ) = α(2) in contraction. Note that if Ft corresponded to GDP growth, equation (14) would

include the dynamic process assumed for quarterly recession dynamics in the previous section as a

special case when φ = 0, with α(1) then corresponding to µ1 (the mean growth rate in expansions)

and α(2) corresponding to µ2 . When φ is a number greater than zero (but presumably less than

unity), expression (14) also allows for serial correlation in growth rates even without a business

cycle turning point, and implies that in an expansion, the aggregate factor eventually trends

toward a growth rate of α(1) /(1 − φ).

     We assume that the growth rate of the rth monthly indicator yrt is determined by the aggregate

factor Ft and an idiosyncratic factor vrt ,

                                      yrt = λr Ft + vrt        for r = 1, 2, 3, 4                                  (15)

with vrt itself exhibiting AR(1) dynamics:11

                                               vrt = θ r vr,t−1 + εrt .                                            (16)
  11 Residual diagnostics and likelihood ratio tests favor first-order autoregressive processes for both the disturbance

terms and the dynamic factor.


                                                          19
When the aggregate factor Ft changes, this induces a change in each variable in yt , with the rth

series changing by λr ∆ when the aggregate factor changes by ∆; the bigger λr , the more series r

responds to these aggregate fluctuations. The rth series also experiences shocks vrt that have no

consequences for the variables in yt other than yrt .

       We will continue to assume as in the preceding section that business cycle transitions are the

outcome of a Markov chain that is independent of previous realizations:12


                              Pr(St = j|St−1 = i, St−2 = k, ..., Yt−1 ) = pij .


       The above system can be cast as a Markov-switching state space representation such as those

analyzed by Chauvet (1998) and Kim and Nelson (1999a). The key to such a representation is

a state vector ft which contains (along with the regime St ) all the information needed to forecast

any of the individual series in yt . For this set-up, the state vector is a (5 × 1) vector,


                                          ft = (Ft , v1t , v2t , v3t , v4t )0

(1998). Garcia uses the results from Hansen (1993, 1996), treating the transition probabilities as nuisance parame-
ters to test regime switching models. We construct Garcia’s test statistic and compare with the the critical values
reported in his paper. The critical values are significantly smaller than the likelihood ratio test for the dynamic
factor with Markov regime switching yielding some evidence in rejecting the one state null hypothesis.

The rth row of (18) just reproduces (15). Again (18) can be conveniently written in matrix form

as

                                                yt = Λf t .                                    (19)

The model also requires a normalization condition, because if we doubled the standard deviation

of each element of at and halved the value of each λr , the implied observed behavior of yt would

be identical. Our benchmark model resolves this normalization by setting σ2η , the first element

of Ω, equal to unity.

     Note that equations (14) through (16) imply
                                   h                   i
                           yrt = λr α(St ) + φFt−1 + ηt + θr vr,t−1 + εrt


or
                                                (S )
                                       yrt = µrt t + λr η t + εrt                              (20)

where
                                          h              i
                                 (S )
                                µrt t = λr α(St ) + φFt−1 + θr vr,t−1 .

Equation (20) can be stacked into a vector for r = 1, 2, 3, 4 using the notation of (17) and (19),


                                 yt   = Λα(St ) e5 + ΛΦf t−1 + Λat

                                                     21
                                                     (St )
                                            = µt             + Λat                                                (21)


for
                                            (St )
                                        µt          = α(St ) Λe5 + ΛΦf t−1 .

In other words,
                                                         ³         ´

                                     yt |St = j, ft−1 ∼ N µt , ΛΩΛ0 .                                             (22)

                                                                                   (i,j)      (i,j)
If we observed ft−1 , this distribution would play the role of the N(µt                    , Ht       ) distribution in
                                                                                           (i,j)
(13), and indeed, would be a little simpler than the general case in that µt                       would not depend
              (i,j)                                                                                               (S )
on i and Ht           would not depend on i, j, or t. In this simple case, we see from (20) that µrt t ,

the growth rate we expect for yrt when St = 2, would be the sum of: (a) λr α(2) (the product of

λr , the response of series r to the aggregate factor, with α(2) , the contribution of a recession to

the aggregate factor); (b) λr φFt−1 (the product of λr with φFt−1 , where φFt−1 is our forecast of

the non-recession component of the aggregate factor Ft ); and (c) θr vr,t−1 (our expectation of vrt ,

the factor that is unique to series r).13

      Unfortunately, using this framework is a little more complicated than this, because even if we

knew for certain that St−1 = i, and had observed the values of yt−1 , yt−2 , ..., y1 , we still would

not know the value ft−1 . We could, however, use methods described below to form an estimate
                      (i)
of it, denoted ft−1|t−1 :
                                      (i)
                                     ft−1|t−1 = E(ft−1 |St−1 = i, Yt−1 ).

                                                                           (i)
The true value ft−1 diﬀers from this estimate by some error ht−1|t−1 :

                                                        (i)          (i)
                                            ft−1 = ft−1|t−1 + ht−1|t−1 .                                          (23)


Suppose we approximate the distribution of this error with the Normal distribution:

                                                    ³           ´
                                         (i)             (i)
                                        ht−1|t−1 ∼ N 0, Pt−1|t−1 .                                                (24)

  13 Extensions of the model such as allowing for more than two regimes, time-varying transition probabilities, and

diﬀerent lags for the factors are straightforward extensions of the specification described here.



                                                              22
                                 (i)
The rth diagonal element of Pt−1|t−1 would be small if we had a good inference about the value
                                                                                          (i)
of fr,t−1 . Treating ft−1 as known corresponds to the special case when Pt−1|t−1 = 0.

   Imperfect inference about ft−1 aﬀects our ability to forecast ft . Substituting (23) into (17),

                                              h                   i

                               = α(St ) e5 + Φf t−1|t−1 + qt|t−1                                       (25)

                               qt|t−1 = Φht−1|t−1 + at ∼ N (0, Qt|t−1 )

                                        Qt|t−1 = ΦPt−1|t−1 Φ0 + Ω                                      (26)

                                                                        (i)
with the last expression following from the definition of Pt−1|t−1 in (24) and the fact that at is

independent of anything dated t − 1 or earlier. Substituting (25) into (19),

                                                               (i)            (i)
                               yt = α(St ) Λe5 + ΛΦf t−1|t−1 + Λqt|t−1 .                               (27)


Considering the case when St−1 = i and St = j, expression (27) implies that

                                                        ³                ´
                                                          (i,j)    (i)
                          yt |St = j, St−1 = i, Yt−1 ∼ N µt|t−1 , Ht|t−1                               (28)


where
                                       (i,j)                          (i)
                                      µt|t−1 = α(j) Λe5 + ΛΦf t−1|t−1                                  (29)

                                                 (i)            (i)
                                               Ht|t−1 = ΛQt|t−1 Λ0 .

   Expression (28) is the generalization we sought in (13). In this case, the value we expect for yrt

when St−1 = i and St = 2 is the sum of: (a) λr α(2) , just as in the case when we regarded ft−1 as if
                  (i)                                           (i)                 (i)
known; (b) λr φFt−1|t−1 (the product of λr with φFt−1|t−1 , where φFt−1|t−1 is our expectation of
                                                                                                 (i)
the non-recession component of the aggregate factor Ft , with this expectation based on Ft−1|t−1 ,
                                                                                                (i)
which is where we thought the factor was at date t − 1, given that St−1 = i); and (c) θr vr,t−1|t−1

(what we expect for the dynamic factor vrt that is unique to series r based on where we thought
                                                                                                      (i)
the idiosyncratic factor was at t − 1). The variance of our error in forecasting yt , denoted Ht|t−1 ,

                                                        23
depends on the date because having a larger number of observations {y1 , y2 , ..., yt−1 } can help us
                                                       (i)
to improve the accuracy of the inference ft−1|t−1 .

   The one additional step necessary before proceeding on to observation t + 1 is to update the
           (i)
inference ft−1|t−1 to incorporate date t’s information.                   This is accomplished through a device

known as the Kalman filter.                The basic idea is to use the known correlation between the new

observation yt and the unobserved magnitude ft to revise the prediction of ft that we would have
             (i)                                                                                        (i)
made using ft−1|t−1 alone. One could imagine doing this with a regression of ft on yt and ft−1|t−1 .

Although we don’t have any observations on ft with which to perform such a regression, we know

from the structure of the model what the regression coeﬃcients would turn out to be if we had

an infinite number of such observations.                 In the appendix we show that these ideal regression

coeﬃcients are given by

                    (i,j)
                   ft|t         = E(ft |St = j, St−1 = i, Yt )
                                                                  h       i−1 h            i
                                               (i)        (i)       (i)              (i,j)
                                = α(j) e5 + Φf t−t|t−1 + Qt|t−1 Λ0 Ht|t−1      yt − µt|t−1 .                  (30)


Expression (30) gives the inference about ft given both St−1 = i and St = j in addition to the

observed data yt , yt−1 , ..., y1 . The inference conditioning only on the current regime St = j is

found from

                          (j)
                      ft|t       = E(ft |St = j, Yt )
                                     2
                                     X
                                 =         E(ft |St = j, St−1 = i, Yt ) Pr(St−1 = i|St = j, Yt )
                                     i=1
                                     X2
                                            (i,j)
                                 =         ft|t Pr(St−1 = i|St = j, Yt ).                                     (31)
                                     i=1


The probability necessary to calculate this last magnitude can again be found from Bayes Law:

                                                                  Pr(St = j, St−1 = i|Yt )
                                 Pr(St−1 = i|St = j, Yt ) =                                .
                                                                      Pr(St = j|Yt )

   The appendix also shows that the population mean squared error of the inference (31) is given

                                           i=1

     There is just one problem with this algorithm.                  We assumed in (24) that the date t − 1

inference had an error with a Normal distribution, conditional on St−1 = i. But when we sum

the inferences over the two values of i as in the last line of (31), this would produce not a Normal

distribution but a mixture of Normals. The mean and variance of this distribution are correctly
              (j)         (j)
given by ft|t and Pt|t , and the updating rule in (30) can still be motivated as the population
                                 (i)
regression.         But when ht−1|t−1 is not Normal, the distribution in (28) is no longer exact but

only an approximation.            This approximation, suggested by Kim (1994), is certainly necessary,

because without the summation in (31), the number of possibilities would end up cascading, with

the inference about fT depending on ST , ST −1 , ..., S1 . Fortunately, experience has shown that

approximating the mixture distribution with a Normal distribution works very well in practice

and we seem to lose little when we adopt it.14

     To summarize, our inference for the vector case is based on an iterative algorithm, calculated

sequentially for t = 1, 2, ..., T. As a result of step t − 1 of these calculations, we would have

calculated the following three magnitudes:


                                                  Pr(St−1 = i|Yt−1 )                                      (33)

                                                           (i)
                                                          ft−1|t−1                                        (34)
  14 For example, Chauvet and Piger (2005) estimate the dynamic factor model with regime switching in real time

using both Kim’s algorithm and Bayesian estimation methods (see Shepard 1994, Albert and Chib 1993, or Kim
and Nelson 1999a). The results obtained using these two methods were found to be very similar.


                                                             25

At step t we then calculate


                        Pr(St = j, St−1 = i|Yt−1 ) = pij Pr(St−1 = i|Yt−1 )

                                        (i,j)                                (i)

                                           (i)                   (i)
                                         Qt|t−1 = ΦPt−1|t−1 Φ0 + Ω

                                                  (i)                  (i)
                                                Ht|t−1 = ΛQt|t−1 Λ0 .

These magnitudes are then all we need to construct the density of the tth observation given

St−1 = i, St = j,


             f (yt |St−1 = i, St = j, Yt−1 ) =

           Pr(St = j|Yt ) =                                                                 .       (37)

   This last calculation gives us the input (33) that we will need to proceed with the iteration for

t + 1. We update (34) by calculating

                                f(yt |St = j, St−1 = i, Yt−1 ) Pr(St = j, St−1 = i|Yt−1 )

                                         i=1

Finally, we update the third input (35) from

                                            i=1

       Note that as a consequence of performing this iteration for t = 1, 2, ..., T, we have calculated

the filter probabilities (37), one-month smoothed probabilities (38), and conditional density of the

tth observation (36). The latter can be used to construct the log likelihood for the entire sample,

                                                                   T
                                                                   X

                                                                   t=2


The value obtained from (39) will depend on the values of the population parameters that were

used to perform the above calculations.                  These consist of θ = (α(1) , α(2) , p11 , p22 , φ, θ1 , θ2 , θ 3 ,

θ4 , λ1 , λ2 , λ3 , λ4 , σ2ε1 , σ2ε2 , σ 2ε3 , σ2ε4 )0 . We then choose values of these parameters so as to maximize

the log likelihood (39).

       All that is needed to implement the above procedure is the starting values of (33) through (35)

for observation t = 1, given initial values for θ. For the probabilities we use as initial condition the

probabilities associated with the ergodic distribution of the Markov chain , Pr(St−2 = h, St−1 =

i|Yt−1 ) = Pr(S0 = i) = πi = (1 − pjj )/(2 − pii − pjj ), i = 1, 2, where πi is the ergodic probability.

For the state vector, its unconditional mean and unconditional covariance matrix are used as
                             (i)                   (i)            (i)
initial values, that is, f0|0 = E(ft ) and P0|0 = ΦP0|0 Φ0 + Ω.15


5        Empirical performance of the monthly recession proba-
         bility index.

In this section we investigate the ability of the multivariate version of the Markov switching model

in dating business cycle turning points at the monthly frequency.                           We used numerical search

algorithms (e.g., Hamilton, 1994, Section 5.7) to find the value of the parameter vector θ̂ that

maximizes the log likelihood (39) of the observed historical sample of growth rates of sales, income,

employment, and IP. These maximum likelihood estimates are reported in Table 5. For any date

t we can evaluate current filtered probabilities of expansions, Pr(St = 1|Yt ; θ̂), and recessions,
  15   Since ft is unobserved, we use the average of the unconditional mean of the four series in Yt .



                                                             27
Pr(St = 2|Yt ; θ̂), as calculated in equation (37) now based on the maximum likelihood estimate

θ̂. We can also construct a smoothed inference that uses both current and future observations of

the series yt . For example, the conditional probability that the economy is in a recession at date

t based on all future observations of the series yt is Pr(St = 2|YT ; θ̂).

   [ insert Table 5 about here ]

   As a first step in evaluating the ability of the model to reproduce the NBER dates, consider

Figure 8, which plots the estimated full sample smoothed probabilities of recessions. The shaded

areas represent periods dated as recessions by the NBER. The probabilities indicate that our

model reproduces the NBER chronology very closely. During periods that the NBER classifies as

expansions, the probabilities of recession are usually close to zero. At around the beginning of the

NBER-dated recessions the probabilities rise and remain high until around the time the NBER

dates the end of the recession. In particular, every time the probability of recession increases

above 50%, a recession follows. Conversely, the recession probabilities decrease below 50% at the

recession trough.

   [ insert Figure 8 about here ]

   The model-based inferences about recession dates are compared with the dates determined by

the NBER in Table 6. The first column reports the month in which the recession started according

to the NBER dates. The second column shows the first month in which the full sample smoothed

probability of a recession rose above 50%. The NBER recession dates and the model-based dates

are very close, either exactly coinciding or diﬀering by only one month. The one exception is the

2001 recession, in which the estimated probabilities started increasing in 2000, six months before

the recession began as declared by the NBER. Our quarterly GDP-based full-sample inferences

reported in Table 2 also suggested that this recession actually began in the fourth quarter of 2000.

Some special features of this recession will be discussed in more detail below in connection with

data that would have actually been available in real time.

   [ insert Table 6 about here ]


                                                  28
   The third column of Table 6 indicates the NBER date for the end of the recession, and the

fourth column reports the last month for which the smoothed probability of a recession was above

50%. Once again the model-based inference and the NBER dating for troughs are strikingly

similar, even more so than for business cycle peaks.

   These full sample smoothed probabilities are an important tool that can be used to revise

historically the model assessment of business cycle phases. However, since these smoothed prob-

abilities rely on future information T − t steps ahead, they can not be used to evaluate the state

of the business cycle on a current basis. In order to investigate the real-time performance of the

multivariate Markov switching model for dating business cycles, two features should be taken into

account that not even the use of current filtered probabilities would accomplish. First, only infor-

mation available at the time the forecast is formed should be used. Thus, recursive estimation is

applied to estimate the parameters of the model and infer the probabilities. Second, the real-time

exercise needs to be implemented using only the same knowledge of data revisions that would have

been available at the time. Thus, for each end of sample date in the recursive estimation the first

release of the data that was available is used.

   For each month between January 1978 and January 2004, we obtained values for the complete

history of each of the four monthly variables in yt going back to January 1959, as that history

would have been reported as of the indicated date.      These data were assembled by hand from

various issues of Business Conditions Digest and the Survey of Current Business, Employment

and Earnings (both published monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis), and Economic

Indicators (published monthly by the Council of Economic Advisers).          As with our real-time

GDP series described in Section 3, there were gaps in the full series for some vintages that were

filled in with the next available observation. There were also occasionally large outliers, which

were also replaced with the next release.

   Using these data, we ran recursive estimations of the model starting with the sample from

January 1959 to November 1977. The filter probability for the terminal date of this first data set,


                                                  29

Pr(St = 2|y1 , y2 , ..., yt ; θ̂ ) where t corresponds to November 1977, is the first data point of

the real-time filter probabilities corresponding to the single date t. We will refer below to 100

times this magnitude,

Pr(St+1 = 2|y1                , y2      , ..., yt         ; θ̂           ) which will produce the preliminary index pt+1 for date

t + 1. This procedure is repeated for each of the 315 recursive estimations until the final sample

is reached, which extends from January 1959 to January 2004.

       Notice that for each end of sample date in the recursive estimation procedure we use the first

release of the data that was available for all four variables. The series employment and industrial

production are more timely - they are released with only one month delay, whereas personal income

and manufacturing and trade sales are released with a delay of two months.16                                                           In order for the

four real-time variables to enter the model estimation, we use the data vintage that contains the

latest information on sales and personal income. For example, for the second sample from January

1959 to December 1977, we use the first release of data that included information on all four series

for December 1977, which is February 1978.

       Figure 9 plots the real-time recursive probability of a recession. Each point in the graph

   The real-time recursive filtered probabilities are spikier than the filtered or smoothed prob-

abilities obtained using revised data, which is expected given that unrevised data are generally

noisier than revised releases. The real-time filtered probabilities are also intrinsically more noisy

than their smoothed counterparts. We could immediately call a business cycle turning point if

the real-time filtered probabilities move from below 50% to above 50% or vice versa. This rule

maximizes the speed at which a turning point might be identified, but increases the chances of

declaring a false positive. It seems more prudent to require confirmation of the turning point,

by verifying it with more information As in Section 3, we investigate the gain in accuracy from

using a low-order smoothed probability in addition to the current filtered probability. We combine

the information on the readily available filtered probabilities with the more precise information

obtained from h-step ahead (where h is a low number) smoothed probabilities in real-time assess-

ment of the business cycle phases. For example, the one-month ahead smoothed probabilities are

used to create what we call our “revised monthly real-time recession probability index”:

   Figure 10 displays real-time h-month-smoothed inferences for h = 1, 2, 3. The shaded areas

correspond to recessions as dated by the NBER. The quality of the inference in terms of accuracy

improves as more information is used to form the smoothed probabilities. Figure 11 shows the real-

time current filtered probabilities and the h-month-smoothed probabilities recession by recession.

A distinct common pattern across the probabilities for the 1980, 1981, and 1990 recessions is that

the current filtered probabilities declare the beginning of recessions a couple of months after the

NBER says that a recession began, while they call the end of recessions at about the same time

as the NBER dating. This is less accentuated for the 1980 and 1981 recessions than for the 1990

recession. The smoothed probabilities, however, increasingly adjust the date of recession peaks to


                                                      31
earlier months, converging to a match to the NBER date. Regarding the end of recessions, the

dates called by the current filtered probabilities for these recessions are timely with the NBER,

and the smoothed probabilities obtained 1, 2, and 3 months later simply confirm these dates.

Thus, there seems to be a gain in combining information from the current filtered probability and

the smoothed probabilities in tabulating a chronology of expansion peaks in real time.

     [ insert Figure 10 about here ]

     [ insert Figure 11 about here ]

     The inference from the multivariate Markov switching model for the 2001 recession is a bit

distinct from previous downturns. The current filtered probabilities declare the beginning of the

recession to have occurred at about the same time as the NBER date. The smoothed probabilities,

however, increasingly adjust the peak date to a couple of months before the NBER date.            We

earlier observed the same thing with inferences based on quarterly GDP growth rates.           In the

case of the monthly index, these dynamics of the estimated probabilities are associated with the

behavior of the growth rates of industrial production and personal income, which showed a decline

already in 2000, before the recession had begun. The end of the 2001 recession is in accord with

the NBER dating even when only the current filtered probabilities are used, as it is the case

for previous recessions. However, this result for the last recession is sensitive to the choice of the

employment series used in the estimation of the multivariate Markov switching model, as discussed

in the next section.

     While visual inspection of the probabilities yields some insight, it is diﬃcult to ascertain how

close the turning points determined by the multivariate model are to the NBER dates without

compiling specific dates. In order to do this a formal definition is needed to convert the estimated

probabilities into business cycle dates. We use a combination of the current filtered probabilities

pt     and one-month-smoothed probabilities qt        to evaluate the performance of the multivariate

Markov switching model in signalling business cycle turning points. We follow a similar rule to the

one adopted for the univariate inference using real-time quarterly GDP, though there we only made

      Note that a more precise turning point signal comes at the expense of how quickly we would

call it, since the timing when we would be able to make the announcement in real time would be

delayed by one extra month.          For example, for assessment of the current state of the economy

at t = 1990:7, the first release of the real-time data for all four variables would be available in

1990:9. By using the one-month smoothed probability, we would have to wait until data released

in 1990:10 to make a decision. Thus, there is a three-month delay in announcing turning points.

We find that the gain in precision by using qt      in addition to pt           more than compensates the

small loss in timing by one month.

   Table 8 compares NBER news releases with the performance of the multivariate Markov switch-

ing model in dating and announcing business cycle chronology. Regarding dating the phases, the

model would have made the identical declaration of the date of the 2001 business cycle peak as

did the NBER, but lags the NBER dates by two or three months for the other three recessions.

The diﬀerence between the model-based dates and the NBER’s is smaller for troughs, coinciding

in two occasions and diﬀering by one or two months in the other two recessions.

   [ insert Table 8 about here ]

   The great advantage of the objective method regards the timely announcement of turning

points. The algorithm does very well in announcing the beginning and end of downturns compared

with statements released by the NBER. The model would have beaten the NBER in calling the

beginning of a recession in two out of four occasions (the start of the 1990 and 2001 recessions,

respectively) and would have coincided in two cases (the start of the 1980 and 1982 recessions).

The advantage of the dates inferred from the multivariate model is even more significant for dating

the end of recessions.   The model beats the NBER announcements in all occasions, with leads

from three to seventeen months. The model would have announced the end of the 1980 recession

8 months before the NBER’s announcement, the end of the 1982 recession three months earlier

than the NBER, the 1990 recession 17 months earlier, and the more recent recession in 2001 would

have been declared to have ended 14 months before the announcement by the NBER.

   Comparing the quarterly and monthly results, the multivariate Markov switching model and

the univariate one applied to GDP usually convey similar information, but complement each other

on some occasions. This indicates that there are clear gains in combining information from our
                                                                   (q)           (q)

time multivariate-based recession probability indicators (Dt       , pt     , and qt         ) in dating business

cycle and announcing these dates in real time. For example, the quarterly real-time index dates


                                                 34
the end of the 1990 recession only in the second quarter of 1992, and the announcement of this date

would have been available in February 1993, three months after the NBER announcement. The

monthly index, on the other hand, dates the end of this recession as March 1991, coinciding with

the trough declared by the NBER. This date would have been available from the monthly index

in July 1991, 17 months before the announcement by the NBER in December 1992. Regarding

the 2001 recession, the monthly index dates the end of the 2001 recession in January 2002, two

months after the trough in November 2001 declared by the NBER. The quarterly index, on the

other hand, declares the end of this recession in the fourth quarter of 2001, coinciding with the

NBER date. The monthly index would have announced this trough 14 months before the NBER

declared the end of this recession, and the quarterly index would have announced it 12 months

before.

   In general, there is a gain in speed of announcement by using the monthly-based recession

index, given that the monthly data are available more quickly than quarterly GDP mainly with

respect to business cycle troughs. While the NBER’s announcements sometimes beat the quarterly

index, the monthly index consistently anticipates the recession end before the NBER’s decisions.
                                                                               (m)       (m)
On the other hand, the monthly index (particularly if one relied only on pt          or qt     alone)

shows more short-run volatility than does the quarterly index. Although combined inference is

best, either index alone would have overall delivered more timely indications than did NBER in

declaring the start or the end of the recessions in the real time sample, and the business cycle

chronology obtained would have matched closely the NBER dating.

   These results suggest that the algorithm-based inference contributes to the assessment of busi-

ness cycle phases in real time, and oﬀers quantitative improvements compared to the NBER

methods. In addition, our approach is more objective and mechanical, which makes its potential

use widespread.

6     Alternative approaches to monthly inference.

In this section we report briefly on our investigations of some alternative specifications for the

monthly index. We explored diﬀerent autoregressive processes for the components of the state

equation and tried specifications with one or two of the elements of yt deleted or one or two other

monthly series added. None of these changes seemed to make much diﬀerence for the inference.

    One feature that does modify the results somewhat is the changing cyclical behavior of em-

ployment. In particular, the employment series used by the NBER, employees on non-agricultural

payrolls (ENAP), displayed a very slow recovery in the last recession. In fact, real-time assess-

ment of the recent economic recession using this series would have indicated that the downturn

did not end until 2003. The real-time probabilities of recession obtained when this measure of

employment is included in the estimation suggested that there was a slight recovery in economic

activity from October 2001 to July 2002, but this was followed by a weakening of the economy

in the subsequent months until early 2003. The use of this employment series also yields delays

in signaling turning points for previous recessions.    This is in agreement with Chauvet (1998),

who found that this employment series lags the business cycles and documented the improvement

in using alternative employment variables.       Stock and Watson (1991) also found that payroll

employment is a lagging indicator rather than a coincident variable of business cycle since its

estimated residuals are serially correlated. For this reason, both Chauvet and Stock and Watson

included lagged values for the factor in the measurement equation for payroll employment. On

the other hand, this correction is not necessary when using other employment measurements.

    Our analysis in Section 5 was instead based on an alternative employment series, Total Civilian

Employment (TCE). This variable coincides with business cycle phases and delivers a much faster

call of turning points in real time, as described in the previous section. The inclusion of this series

allows us to keep the specification simple and yet robust to the use of real time data.

    There are several reasons why these two series diverge sometimes, and a lot of controversy has



                                                  36
emerged in the last few years on the best measure of employment. ENAP is based on a survey

of business establishments, whereas TCE is based on a survey among households.           These two

employment series have generally moved together, with some minor diﬀerences around business

cycle turning points until very recently. In particular, ENAP tends to overestimate employment

around the beginning of recessions and underestimate around their end. As the results of esti-

mation of our model based on the two diﬀerent measures has reflected, these dynamics became

very accentuated in the last recession in 2001.        The main diﬀerences between these two series

are that ENAP does not count agricultural and self-employed workers. More important, ENAP

counts an individual twice if he or she works two jobs or changes jobs during the pay period. As

a result of a debate regarding the sources of the diﬀerences, the Bureau of Labor and Statistics

has produced some studies and concluded that a correction in population trend and addition of

non-farmer workers in the TCE series would bring the two closer together in level and ex-post for

the recent period (Di Natale, 2003; U.S. Department of Labor, 2004). This is also discussed in

Juhn and Potter (1999). A comprehensive summary of these results and the debate can be found

in Kane (2004).

   However, the adjustment by BLS does not deal with the reliability and diﬀerences between

these two series in real time, which is the focus of our analysis. The ENAP series only includes

job destruction and creation with a lag, it does not include self-employment and contractors or

oﬀ-the-books employment, and it double counts jobs if a person changes jobs within a payroll

survey reference period.   These can be very important cyclical factors around business cycle

turning points. In particular, the first three diﬀerences can lead ENAP to signal a more severe

recession and delay detection of a recovery, while the fourth one can overestimate employment

around peaks. In addition, the first release of ENAP is preliminary and undergoes substantial

revisions in subsequent months.    There is also a significant revision of this series once a year

when the smaller initial sample collected is adjusted by using as a benchmark the universe count

of employment derived from Unemployment Insurance tax records that almost all employers are


                                                  37
required to file. These corrections make real-time data on ENAP very diﬀerent from the revised

versions.   Thus, although the revised ENAP may reflect better labor conditions ex-post, its

performance in capturing real time cyclical changes in the economy is meager compared to the

household survey (TCE).

   In addition, we have also examined the performance of the model when a break in volatility

in 1984 is taken into account. Kim and Nelson (1999b), McConnell and Perez-Quiros (2000), and

Chauvet and Potter (2001) have found that the US economy became more stable since this date,

particularly the quarterly GDP series. When this feature is incorporated in the model the results

improve substantially with respect to the last two recessions, which took place after the structural

break in volatility. We have nevertheless chosen not to correct for the decrease in volatility in

the US economy in order to keep the analysis simple and robust.

   Diﬀerent rules were also investigated to declare the beginning and end of recessions.       The

one chosen, as described in the previous section, was not the one that necessarily maximizes the

precision or speed of business cycle signals, but the one that worked as well with both simple

and more complicated specifications.    That is, we have chosen the rule that gives us the most

confidence that it will be robust in future applications. We are less interested in fine-tuning the

improvement of the algorithm than in obtaining a specification and rules that have a better chance

to work well in the future. For this reason our analysis employs the simpler specification, which

does not make any allowance for changes in the variance of economic fluctuations over time.

   Overall, most of the options we investigated would result in quite reasonable estimates. Our

conclusion is nevertheless that the benchmark model and inference rules presented in Section 5

appear to be the most robust with respect to changes in specification and data revision, and

therefore recommend them as likely to prove most reliable for analyzing data and recognizing the

business cycle trends in an ever-changing economy.

Note: Leads or lags are represented by + or -, respectively, and indicate how many months the Markov switching model anticipates or lags the NBER dating,
whereas 0 indicates that the two dating systems coincide. A business cycle downturn is announced when there are two succeeding months all with probabilities
greater than 0.65. An upturn is announced when there are two successive months with probabilities below 0.35.
