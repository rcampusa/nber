                                          ABSTRACT

The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America on
11/8/2016 came as a surprise. Markets responded swiftly and decisively. This note investigates
both the initial stock market reaction to the election, and the longer-term reaction through the end
of 2016. We find that the individual stock price reactions to the election – that is, the market’s
vote – reflect investor expectations on economic growth, taxes, and trade policy. Heavy industry
and banking were relative winners, whereas healthcare, medical equipment, pharmaceuticals,
textiles, and apparel were among the relative losers. High-beta stocks and companies with a
hitherto high tax burden benefited from the election. Although internationally-oriented companies
may profit under some plans of the new administration, several other arguments suggest a more
favorable climate for domestically-oriented companies. Investors have found the domestic-
favoring arguments to be stronger. While investors incorporated the expected consequences of the
election for US growth and tax policy into prices relatively quickly, it took them more time to
digest the consequences of shifts in trade policy on firms’ prospects.

1 Introduction
The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America on
11/8/2016 surprised most observers. The election’s unexpected outcome1 combined with the
wide policy differences between the two candidates caused substantial reactions on financial
markets. Large price moves were recorded across asset classes, including stocks, bonds, and
exchange rates. While analyst commentary on the implications of this historic election for
individual firms or industries abounds, to our knowledge, no academic study has investigated
which industries and firms will benefit or suffer under the new administration. Assessing the
winners and losers from the election is interesting, because there were sizable differences in the
policies favored by the two candidates in at least four economically important areas: government
spending (and the size of the deficit), taxation, trade policy, and regulation.
     This paper uses the reactions of individual stock prices during the days and weeks following
the election to identify the relative winners and losers from the Trump administration’s expected
policies. In an era where politics is extremely polarized and forward-looking assessments of
economic prospects are often tilted and exaggerated, it is instructive to investigate investors’
assessment of the prospects for different firms and industries.
     While there is a large literature on the effect of elections on financial markets, the 2016
Presidential election is particularly interesting because it is rare, in developed economies, to have
an instance of such a surprising outcome when the two candidates favored such disparate
policies.2 What is more, with the notable exception of the Mexican Peso, changes in the prices of
many assets following the election were the opposite of those that had been forecast if Trump
were to win. This occurred even though the forecasts had empirical support. For instance, in a
study of asset price moves during the first Presidential debate on September 26, 2016, Wolfers
and Zitzewitz (2016) had found a strong positive relationship between the odds of Clinton
winning on Betfair and the returns on all major US equity index futures. While stock index
futures fell sharply on election night as the outcome of the election became known, stock

  For example, Niederhoffer, Gibbs, and Bullock (1970) consider Dow Jones Industrial Average responses to
elections and nominating conventions. Moreover, a substantial literature studies the stock market development
during Democratic and Republican administrations over the longer run. For example, Santa-Clara and Valkanov
(2003) document a “presidential premium” (especially for large-cap stocks) during Democratic presidencies.

                                                                                                           1
markets finished up on the day following the election and rallied strongly during the rest of the
year.
    It is impossible to determine whether the market’s rally will continue beyond the time of this
writing, and whether what has happened so far has been due to overall beliefs about the economy
and firm fundamentals, to the view that a Trump administration will be good for business (e.g.,
much lower corporate taxes and reduced regulation), and/or just some combination of excess
animal spirits and group exuberance. As such, the “Trump Rally” isn’t that unusual: the overall
market tends to rise after elections historically. What is surprising about the post-election rally is
its magnitude, and its sharp difference from the significant decline that most forecasters had
predicted if Trump won the election.
    It is impossible to diagnose the reasons for a particular overall movement in the stock
market, as there is just one observation. Recognizing this, this paper investigates the differential
performance of a large number of stocks to determine which factors produced relative winners
and relative losers among companies as the stock market moved sharply upward after the
election. These results shed some light on the effect of expectations about policy, particularly
taxation, trade policy, and regulation – on individual firms. At the industry level, the stock
market reactions from the day after the election through the end of the year broadly follow
expected benefits and costs relative to the alternative outcome, the election of Hillary Clinton.
Heavy industry (which Trump has promised to resurrect) and financial firms, which he has said
he would deregulate, performed well. By contrast, healthcare, medical equipment, and
pharmaceuticals lost dramatically (presumably due to the expectation that Obamacare would be
dismantled or at least significantly altered), as did textile and apparel firms, reflecting their
significant dependence on imports, which Trump has vowed to strongly discourage. Business
supplies and shipping containers also lost, probably reflecting his tough stance on trade. It is
noteworthy that even after controlling for the rally in the broad market, several low-beta
industries (beer, tobacco, food products, utilities) were losers, while cyclical industries tended to
be winners. Presumably, expectations of higher growth induced investors to rotate from low-risk
to high-beta industries.
    All assessments of industries or companies below address relative not absolute assessments,
since the stock market was up so dramatically, implying that many relative losers actually gained
in price, but not nearly so much as relative winners. Turning to the different policy areas, we find

                                                                                                    2
evidence that both growth prospects and expectations of a major corporate tax cut were viewed
positively by the stock market. By contrast, the stock market’s reactions imply negative
expectations about the effects of the incoming administration’s anticipated policies for
internationally-oriented firms. Interestingly, markets did not process information on these
various aspects at the same speed. While the positive impacts of corporate tax cuts and higher
growth were apparent in the cross-section of stock returns on the first day after the election, the
negative impact of expected policy changes on internationally-oriented firms mostly became felt
later on. Investors also downgraded companies with high interest expenses. This result does not
necessarily have to do with an expectation regarding interest deductibility being abolished (as is
the case under some Trump/Republican plans), as deductions also lose value when taxes are cut.
Investors thus far think that expensing capital investments is either unlikely to be implemented,
or not consequential.


2 Asset price responses to news
If the market responds optimally to the election outcome, the change in the market price of any
asset will reflect both the difference in its expected discounted payoff between the two possible
outcomes and the ex ante probability of the outcome. The advantage of considering asset price
changes is that they capture current expectations; the researcher need not trace all the future
changes to cash flows and discount rates separately (Schwert 1981). Formally, let PC and PT
denote the asset’s expected price conditional on Clinton and Trump winning, respectively,
implying that C and T = 1 – C are the probabilities of the two outcomes. Ignoring discounting
over the short period at hand, and assuming that risk aversion is a minor factor,3 the asset’s price
before the election is given by
                                             P   C PC   T PT .



     The price change for the asset given that Trump won is given by
                                     P  PT  P  ( PT  PC )(1   T ) .




3
 Risk aversion on overall market movements would, of course, be reflected in beta. Stocks expected to perform
better in an unfavorable overall outcome would be priced higher and vice versa.

                                                                                                           3
    In words, the price change once the election results become known is the difference in prices
between the two outcomes, times the size of the election surprise, which is one minus the ex ante
probability of Trump winning. Intuitively, if Trump’s election had been certain ex ante, there
would have not have been a price reaction on the day after the election. Scaling this expression
by the initial price, the return on the asset once the election results become known is given by
                                       PT  P ( PT  PC )(1   T )
                                  R                               .
                                         P             P


    Note that while the election surprise is the same for all assets, individual assets will respond
to the election outcome differently, depending on the sign and magnitude of the spread between
PC and PT. For assets that would have benefitted from a Clinton outcome relative to Trump, PC >
PT, with the inequality reversed for assets that would be helped by a Trump outcome. To presage
some of our findings, stocks had very different reactions to the outcome. By considering the
cross-section of stock returns, we can thus infer whether the incoming administration’s expected
policies are viewed as favorable or not for a particular firm or industry, and the extent and speed
with which markets incorporated differences between the candidates in the different policy
dimensions into prices.
    Two factors make the 2016 Presidential election an ideal setting for such an analysis. First,
there was a significant gap between the pre-election probabilities and the election outcome.
Clinton was the clear favorite on betting markets, in polls, and on election-modeling websites.
For instance, on November 7, the probability of Clinton winning on Betfair was 83%, while on
the day of the election, even the FiveThirtyEight forecast, which was the major site that gave
Trump the highest probability of winning, put the Clinton odds between 71% and 72%. Second,
there were major differences between the policies favored by the two candidates. This
combination explains why the asset price reactions on numerous markets, from stock indices to
bonds to exchange rates, were so strong.
    While the election outcome did reduce uncertainty about firms’ prospects, it hardly rendered
those uncertainties modest for a number of reasons. First, the elected candidate is expected to
backtrack on some pledges made on the campaign trail, even some made repeatedly, or change
his mind on intended policies or the strength with which he will pursue them. Second, many
policies need Congressional approval. Although the Republicans currently control Congress,


                                                                                                   4
their majority in the Senate is merely two, and a number of Republican senators dislike Trump
and/or some of his policies. Thus, he may push policies, but Congress may not approve.
Accordingly, the specific design and perceived probabilities of various policies being
implemented remained subject to large shifts even after the election results were known. Thus,
sizable relative asset-price reactions could be expected in the weeks that followed.
    Though our focus is on individual companies and industries, it is important to note the
dramatic stock market development since Trump’s election became known. The overall stock
market, as represented by the S&P 500, marched upward by 4.64% to year-end, and a further
1.45% through the Inauguration on January 20, 2017. This development is noteworthy for
multiple reasons. First, prior to the election, it was broadly felt that the stock market would fall
significantly if Trump were elected. Wolfers and Zitzewitz (2016) investigate the reaction of a
number of asset prices during the first Presidential debate on September 26, 2016. They find a
strong positive relationship between the odds of Clinton winning from Betfair and the returns on
all major US equity index futures. During the debate, which lasted from 9 to 11 p.m., the odds of
Clinton winning rose from 63 to 69%, and S&P 500 futures by 0.71%, implying a S&P 500
value about 12% higher under Clinton than under Trump. On the day following the election,
Bank of America Merrill Lynch cut its forecasts for US GDP growth by half a percentage points
in both the first and second quarters of 2017, and warned of “despair in the financial markets”.
Second, there were no significant surprises about economic prospects, or President-elect
Trump’s plans during this period. Third, the sustained surge was conceivably a reaction to both
the election results and the surprising favorable market movement immediately following the
election. If so, it would represent a dramatic form of Post Information-Revelation Drift.
Alternatively, it might just represent the common phenomenon of the market having a sustained
movement up or down, despite little new information being revealed.



3 Data and empirical strategy
The surprising election outcome provides an ideal setting for an event study. Our empirical
strategy, therefore, is to regress abnormal returns (ARs) on firm characteristics. Since markets
may need time to digest new information, and further information on the incoming
administration’s proposed policies became clearer only after the election, we consider different
sets of abnormal returns: those from the day after the election through to the end of 2016, those

                                                                                                  5
on the day after the election, and the drift from two days after the election to the end of 2016.
This allows us to shed light on both the overall reaction and the speed with which the market
reacted. We note that the end of 2016 is a somewhat arbitrary end point. (In the text, we refer to
December 31, 2016 as the end of the year, though December 30, 2016 was the last trading day.)
     Our sample includes the S&P 500 constituents as of the day of the election. 4 The S&P 500
index includes the largest, most liquid U.S. stocks; they get the greatest analyst coverage and the
strongest investor attention. Together, the index constituents represent roughly 80% of the U.S.
equity market capitalization.
     We obtain stock prices adjusted for splits and net dividends from Bloomberg. We then
compute each stock’s market beta from an OLS regression of daily stock returns in excess of the
risk-free rate on the excess returns on the S&P 500 total return index for the period from
September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016 (estimation window).5 The risk-free rate is the one-
month T-bill rate.6 We then compute abnormal returns for all days surrounding the November 8,
2016 election as the daily excess return on the stock minus beta times the S&P 500 excess return.
Although stock returns are driven by common factors beyond moves in the broad market – the
most examined factors being size, value, and momentum – we choose to correct only for market
moves in our analysis because the election outcome is likely to have caused shifts in these factors
as well. Controlling for them would therefore eliminate part of the effects that we wish to
document.
     Figure 1 plots some quantiles of the distributions of the returns in the election week and in
the November 9 to December 31 time window, and indicates substantial heterogeneity in firms’
reactions. It is noteworthy (though not surprising) that the spreads of the abnormal returns after
the election greatly exceed those before.




4
  The exact date chosen is not critical since there were no changes in the composition of the index between
September 30, 2016 and December 2, 2016, and only a single change through December 31.
5
  Data are available for the entire estimation window for 493 out of the 500 firms. The seven other firms have a short
return history because they result from spin-offs and met the index inclusion criteria soon after their first trade date.
An example is Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, which was spun off from HP Inc. on 11/02/2015 and entered
the S&P 500 index on that same date. Beta for these firms is estimated using returns from the date the firm was first
traded to September 30, 2016.
6
  The results are virtually identical if we use the returns on the S&P 500 price index instead of those on the total
return index and/or the Fed funds rate instead of the T-bill rate.

                  We obtain explanatory variables mostly from Compustat Capital IQ. We use the most
current accounting data for all companies. For most companies, this means we use December 31,
2015 data. Several companies have fiscal years that end in other months. Thus, we have 79
companies for which calendar year 2016 data are included.7 The cash effective tax rate (cash
ETR) is computed following Dyreng, Hanlon, Maydew, and Thornock (2017) as the percent cash
taxes paid relative to current year pretax income.8 As an alternative proxy for the tax rate, we use
the disclosed effective tax rate (which uses tax expenses, instead of cash taxes paid), collected
from the tax footnotes of 10-K statements by Audit Analytics. We obtain the percentage of firm
revenue from foreign sources from Bloomberg, and we supplement these data with information
from Compustat geographical segment data. As a proxy for production costs incurred abroad,

7
  Even among the companies with December 31 as fiscal year end, there are already a few companies in Compustat
with year-end 2016 data. It is in principle conceivable that they adjusted their accounting after the election, but a
robustness check reveals that using year-end 2015 data yields similar results.
8
  As in their study, when using this variable, we restrict the sample to those firms with positive pre-tax income (all
but 43 companies) as well as a tax rate below 100% (all but 3 companies).

                                                                                                                    7
we compute the percentage of non-US assets in total assets from Compustat geographical
segment data. As for many companies, this variable is not yet available for 2016; we use data for
the years 2013, 2014, and 2015. There are some missing data on foreign revenues, foreign assets,
and/or foreign profits. From Audit Analytics, we obtain data for indefinitely reinvested foreign
earnings as of May 2016, and we divide this number by total assets to obtain our proxy for cash
held abroad. All other variables are standard. Table 1 provides the details of the computation..
All explanatory variables (except market cap) are winsorized at the 1% and 99% levels.


                                   Table 1: Descriptive statistics
Our sample includes the S&P 500 constituents as of November 8, 2016. Abnormal returns for all
days from November 9, 2016 to December 31, 2016 are computed as the daily excess return on
the stock minus beta times the S&P 500 excess return, where beta is estimated on daily excess
returns from September 30, 2015 to September 30, 2016. The risk-free rate is the 1-month T-bill
rate. The following variables are from Compustat or computed based on Compustat data
(Compustat mnemonics in capitals in parentheses): Total Assets (AT), Market value of equity
(CSHO*PRCC_F), Percent revenue growth (100*(SALE-SALEt-1)/SALEt-1, Profitability
(100*pretax income / assets = 100*(PI/AT)), Cash taxes paid in percent of current year pretax
income (100*(TXPD/PI)), Percent profits from foreign activities (100*PIFO/PI), Foreign
operations in percent of assets (100*abs(PIFO)/AT), Leverage (DLTT+DLC)/AT, Interest
expenses in percent of assets (100*XINT/AT), Capital expenditures in percent of assets
(100*CAPX/AT). The sources of additional variables are as follows: The disclosed effective tax
rate in percent and Indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings (which we divide by AT) are obtained
from Audit Analytics. Percent revenue from foreign sources is from Bloomberg, supplemented
by data computed from Compustat segments data. Percent foreign assets is computed from
Compustat segments data. Dividend yield is from Bloomberg.

4 Stock return reactions to Trump’s election at the industry level
The most salient feature of reactions of individual stocks to the election – covered also in the
popular press by way of anecdotal evidence, and not controlling for risk – is that President
Trump’s statements about specific industries or groups of industries produced large gains or
losses at the industry level. His promises to deregulate and to discourage imports are, not
surprisingly, strongly reflected in the data. However, as we demonstrate below, initial stock-price
reactions (a) reversed for some industries, and/or (b) did not capture the magnitude of stock price
changes until the end of the year. Presumably, market participants were both digesting the
election and responding to new data available from post-election statements by President-elect
Trump, as well as some from Congress.
     Figure 2 plots median abnormal returns in the Fama-French 30 industries between the
market close on November 8 – before the election results were known – and the end of 2016
(light grey), as well as those on the day following the election (dark grey). 9 Adjusting for the
market’s overall move, the number of (relative) winners and loser industries is roughly balanced.
The returns for the overall period are in line with what one would expect based on Trump's
statements on the campaign trail: heavy industry (which Trump has promised to resurrect) and
financial firms, which he has said he would deregulate, were perceived to benefit from Trump’s
election. Healthcare, medical equipment, and pharmaceuticals lost dramatically (a consequence
of the expectation that Obamacare would be dismantled or at least significantly altered), as did
textile and apparel firms, reflecting their large dependence on imports, which Trump has vowed
to strongly discourage. Business supplies and shipping containers also lost, probably reflecting
his tough stance on trade.
     It is noteworthy that several low-beta industries (beer, tobacco, food products, utilities) are
among the losers, while cyclical industries tend to be among the winners. Presumably,
expectations of higher growth induced investors to rotate from low-risk to high-beta industries.
In a low-growth, low-interest rate environment like the one prevailing in recent years, investors
had been piling into low-beta industries to earn the high dividend yields that they often offer. As
Trump’s election also led to a notable rise in long-term interest rates, stock prices in these
industries suffered.

  We use medians to avoid the impact of outliers in this detailed industry classification. The picture with average
returns looks very similar. When using Fama-French 17 industries we also obtain the result that steel works, mining,
and drugs benefited most significantly.

                                   The results in Figure 2 also reveal that the cumulative abnormal returns from the election to
year-end differ substantially from the immediate response after the election, shown in dark grey
in the figure. Apparel and textiles, which are the worst performers during the overall period, only
had a modest drop on the day after the election. A similar pattern holds for medical equipment
and medical products: the immediate reaction to Trump's election was one of relief and indeed a
light increase, as markets were seriously worried about Hillary Clinton’s critical stance on drug
prices. However, concerns about the industry's profitability escalated when Trump started
making critical statements about pharmaceutical products’ prices after the election.10 At the other
end of the spectrum, markets seem to have been initially too optimistic about the prospects for
the steel industry (which had been one of the hot spots of the campaign), and barely reacted at
the outset to the prospect of deregulation in the financial industry. Another interesting case is the
automobile industry, which suffered initially (probably reflecting fears of Trump's meddling in


10
   Considering the abnormal returns using the Fama-French 48 industries, in which healthcare and pharmaceuticals
constitute two different industries, provides support for this interpretation. In this case, the abnormal returns on the
day after the election are +5.02% for pharmaceuticals and -4.71% for healthcare, while the cumulative abnormal
returns from the election to the end of the year are -3.95% for pharmaceuticals and -2.34% for healthcare.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              10
plant location decisions), but had become one of the top performers by year-end (probably
reflecting expectations of higher profits due to tariffs on imports).
    Thus, while the initial strongly positive response of the overall stock and bond market to the
election outcome persisted through the rest of the year, there was no continuation of industry-
level abnormal returns, quite the opposite. As can be seen in Figure 3, the relationship between
the abnormal returns on November 9 and those between November 10 and year-end at the
industry level is actually negative (the correlation is –0.25).
    This finding has two potential explanations. The first is that investors overreacted to the
initial news. What speaks against this interpretation is that at the overall market level – both for
stocks and bonds yields – the response on the day following the election continued into year-end
(and indeed through the Inauguration on January 20, 2017). Thus, for the observed phenomenon
to arise, one would need investors to overreact about the prospects for some industries and
underreact about the prospects for others, an unlikely parlay. The second, and more plausible,
explanation is that the market’s assessment about the strength and/or likelihood of some of the
incoming administration’s future policies changed after the election or took more time to be
incorporated into prices because processing the information on these policies was more difficult.
What speaks in favor of this latter interpretation are the strong negative returns until the end of
the year in import-intensive and trade-sensitive industries (textile, shipping containers), and the
positive returns in industries that would benefit from trade restrictions (automobiles) or proposed
deregulation (banking).
    While these descriptive industry-level results reveal large differences in the asset price
response across industries, heterogeneity across firms within the same industry is typically as
large as that across industries, both in terms of abnormal returns and firm characteristics. Below,
we capitalize on firm-level heterogeneity in order to assess the impact of different prospective
policy developments. Since our analysis reveals large differences between the immediate
response to the election and that until year-end, we investigate these responses separately.

5 Explaining the cross-section of stock return reactions
This section investigates the cross-section of stock price responses to the election outcome. It
examines the impact of expectations about overall growth, taxation, and trade policy.


5.1 Growth expectations
If the market believes that Trump is good for the aggregate economy, those companies that are
more strongly exposed to the (US) economy will do better. To have a first look at this
hypothesis, Figure 4 presents a binned scatter plot. That is, all stocks are sorted into 20 equal-
sized bins by their market beta, and we then compute the average abnormal stock return in each
of the bins.
                                     A positive relationship emerges. Clearly, investors flocked to high-beta equities after the
election. This result adds to the insights of Figure 2. There, we had seen that many of the worst
performing industries were low-beta industries. However, note that Figure 4 shows results
controlling not only for market beta (via the abnormal return computation), but also for industry
fixed effects.

                 (controlling for Fama-French 30 industries fixed effects)

    Table 2 presents the corresponding regression output, documenting strong statistical
significance of the positive market reaction of high-beta stocks. Strikingly, almost all of this
reaction took place on the first day, while beta does not significantly predict abnormal returns
into year-end. While we do not report the coefficients on the industry dummies for space
reasons, this regression analysis shows that the industry fixed effects that are significant without
controlling for beta remain significant (with one exception) even when controlling for beta. This
suggests that some industries were expected to benefit over and above what the aggregate
economy does, even after adjusting for their average cyclicality.
    Table 2 also reveals that size does not seem to matter directly for firms’ stock market
performance. Profitability itself does not explain abnormal returns either. Thus, the market does
not seem to believe that CEO Trump would “fire” weakly performing firms. It is somewhat
puzzling that faster-growing firms (those with higher revenue growth) have reacted less
positively, even after controlling for industry. One might have thought that investors would see
an improved future for these companies given the Trump victory. Conceivably, investors are
worried that these firms, which rely on a stable environment to make their long-term growth
plans, will find themselves in a less predictable economic and regulatory setting. We do not,
however, have a conclusive explanation for this finding.

5.2 Corporate tax rates
While the details of any future tax plan remain somewhat hazy, it is clear that President Trump
wants to cut corporate taxes significantly below their current 35% level, and is very likely to
succeed, given that the Republican majority in Congress, as well as many Democratic legislators,
have the same preference. Had Hillary Clinton won the election, corporate taxes might well have
been trimmed, but not cut nearly to the level that Trump has proposed, namely 15%. (President
Obama had supported a cut to 28%.)
       Given the surprisingly large expected reduction in corporate taxes due to Trump’s
election, we would expect those companies currently paying higher taxes to perform better. At
first sight, Column (1) of Table 3 appears to suggest only a modest (and statistically
insignificant) relationship between the cash effective tax rate and the cumulative abnormal
returns from November 9, 2016 to December 31, 2016. Here, one needs to keep in mind that
long-term returns are notoriously difficult to predict and noisy. However, as can be seen in

                                                                                              14
Column (2), there was actually a strong market response to differences in taxation across firms,
but it took place swiftly on the first day after the election. Economically, this effect is sizable: In
this sample, the standard deviation of the cash effective tax rate is 15.4. Therefore, a one
standard deviation higher effective tax rate is associated with a 0.41 percentage point
(15.4*0.032) increase in the abnormal return on the day after the election, more than 10% of a
standard deviation of the abnormal returns. A substantial portion of the overall reaction was,
therefore, already impounded in stock prices on the first day. Tables available on request show
that controlling for special items does not affect the results.11
         Columns (4) to (6) use the disclosed effective tax rate instead of the cash ETR. This item,
reported in the tax footnotes to 10-K statements of most, though not all companies, captures the
total tax expenses (rather than the cash taxes) that a company records. We again find a more
positive investor reaction for those firms with a higher tax burden according to this measure.
Interestingly, although the relationship between taxes and abnormal returns proved strongly
positive in the first day after the election, it remained large and significant in the period running
into year-end. This suggests that the market needed more time to incorporate information
reported in the footnotes to 10-K statements than information available from financial
statements.
         In sum, these results show not only that the market reacted in the expected way to
Trump’s election, but this relatively clean natural experiment also confirms that taxes are a very
important component of firm value. Figure 5 illustrates this result in binned scatter plots.




11
   As a measure of the level of a firm’s tax sheltering, we also compute the book tax gap following Manzon and
Plesko (2002) and Jalan, Kale and Meneghetti (2016). This captures the difference between the income a firm
reports to its shareholders based on GAAP and the one it reports to the income tax authorities based on tax laws. The
latter is not observable. Following the literature, we compute [PI-PIFO-TXFED/0.35] – TXS – TXO – ESUBC. The
part in the square brackets is the “unadjusted spread”. The three items subtracted at the end (state income taxes,
other income taxes, unremitted earnings in non-consolidated subsidiaries) can affect the gap for reasons unrelated to
tax sheltering. Dividing the total quantity of the above calculation by total assets yields the book tax gap. We do not
find a significant association of this proxy for tax sheltering and announcement returns. However, the sample in this
is quite small (around 200 observations) due to missing data (which, according to Manzon and Plesko (2002), should
not be treated as zero entries in these cases).

                                                                                                                   15

5.3 Foreign operations
It is not clear a priori whether stocks oriented towards the US economy will fare better or worse
than those that are more exposed to the world economy.
          On the one hand, there are several arguments favoring stocks with a domestic focus.
First, market participants may simply have higher expectations for US growth versus foreign
growth. Second, stocks active abroad are more subject to the risk of trade wars that bring
retaliation by other countries. In either case, firms with larger foreign presence would do worse.
(Without further evidence, one cannot distinguish between the two explanations.) Third, Trump’s
infrastructure plan would naturally benefit domestically-focused firms. Fourth, Trump’s


                                                                                                                                               17
expansionist fiscal policies and the associated increase in inflation expectations are likely to
foster Fed rate hikes. In a number of speeches following the election, Federal Reserve officials
made no secret that they might tighten policy faster if fiscal policy became more expansionary.12
While higher inflation per se would hurt the dollar in the long-run, the rate hikes could initially
strengthen it, hurting exporters. Indeed, the ICE US Dollar index appreciated by 4.44% between
November 8 and year-end, while the expected path of the Federal Funds rate implied from Fed
Fund futures prices steepened.13 According to the minutes of the December 2016 FOMC
meeting, “[s]urveys of market participants had indicated that revised expectations for
government spending and tax policy following the U.S. elections in early November were seen as
the most important reasons, among several factors, for the increase in longer-term Treasury
yields, the climb in equity valuations, and the rise in the dollar.” At that same meeting, the
median of FOMC participants’ projections for GDP growth rose, but only slightly. Furthermore,
“[t]hose increasing their projections for output growth in those years cited expected changes in
fiscal, regulatory, or other policies as factors contributing to their revisions. However, many
participants noted that the effects on the economy of such policy changes, if implemented, would
likely be partially offset by tighter financial conditions, including higher longer-term interest
rates and a strengthening of the dollar.”
        On the other hand, the House Republicans’ tax plan (Republicans 2016) has been
interpreted to help make US companies more competitive abroad. If so, that would (relatively)
favor internationally-oriented stocks. While the exact implementation is not known to date, the
basic gist of the plan is that US companies would not pay tax on profits earned on overseas sales
anymore. Conversely, products, services and intangibles that are imported will be subject to US
tax regardless of where they are produced.14 (See Tax Foundation (2016) for a description of the
plan.) The Tax Foundation, however, dismisses the argument that exporters would benefit from
the plan. They write: “Of course, U.S. producers may think of this as a subsidy for exports

12
   The minutes of the December 2016 FOMC meeting, which were released on January 4, 2017, are in line with
these statements made by Fed officials before year-end. The minutes state: «Many participants noted that there was
currently substantial uncertainty about the size, composition, and timing of prospective fiscal policy changes, but
they also commented that a more expansionary fiscal policy might raise aggregate demand above sustainable levels,
potentially necessitating somewhat tighter monetary policy than currently anticipated.»
13
   On November 8, futures markets viewed the most likely range of the Fed Funds target rate following the
December 2017 FOMC meeting to be 0.5-0.75% or 0.75%-1% (with both outcomes about equally likely). At the end
of the year, the most likely range according to futures prices was 1-1.25%.
14
   Another aspect of tax policy is the tax treatment of profits made by US firms’ foreign subsidiaries. We consider
this aspect at the end of this section.

                                                                                                                18
because they would not be taxed on sales overseas. But if businesses were able to reduce the
prices of their goods they sell overseas due to the border adjustment, this would trigger a higher
demand for dollars in order to purchase those goods. This higher demand for dollars would
increase the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies and offset any perceived trade
advantage granted by the border adjustment.” In line with this view, some market observers
have claimed that (expectations of) the plan’s enactment would lead to a strong appreciation of
the dollar. Since some version of the plan appears likely to succeed, this raises the question why
the dollar has not appreciated more strongly during the period.
          Summarizing, the proposed policies could have both advantages and disadvantages for
exporters and firms with significant foreign operations, and it is not obvious which would
predominate.15 But investors through the stock market did take a view. Table 4 and Figure 6
suggest that investors strongly believed that domestically-oriented companies would have a
relative advantage: abnormal returns are significantly negatively related to the fraction of
revenues being earned outside the US. Interestingly, the negative relationship between foreign
revenue and stock returns was strong not only on the day following the election, but persisted
into year-end. A potential explanation is that two effects underlie the observed returns. The first
– faster US GDP growth – was recognized early on by markets, while the second – negative
spillover effects from more restrictive trade policies – needed some time to be incorporated into
prices.
          It is worth noting that the effects in Table 4 are quantitatively important. For example, a
one standard deviation increase in the fraction of foreign revenues is associated with a 0.96
percentage point lower first-day return, a quarter of a standard deviation of these returns, and
with a 2.15 percentage point lower cumulative abnormal return until year-end, again around a
quarter of a standard deviation of these returns.

  Analysts tend to see advantages for domestic stocks. For example, in a note released on November 9, 2016 (and
reported on zerohedge.com), Goldman Sachs chief strategist David Kostin argued that domestic stocks will do better
than foreign-exposed stocks (Kostin 2016).

        We find similar results for other measures of foreign operations, reported more briefly in
Table 5; the regressions include the same control variables as before, but these are not shown to
save space. The share of profits due to foreign operations (Panel A) and the degree of foreign
activity (Panel B) are both strongly negatively related to firms’ stock market performance.
Interestingly, although some observers argued that importers would suffer from the new
administration’s tax plan, the fraction of non-US assets is not significantly related to stock
returns; see Panel C. We caution that the sample is relatively small for the latter analysis. Also,
while foreign assets arguably proxy well for foreign production costs, such foreign production
might not lead to imports, and conversely companies may import significant amounts of goods
without owning production assets abroad.16
        Another much-discussed policy issue at the intersection of foreign operations and taxes is
the issue of repatriation of past earnings. Many commentators – on both sides of the political
spectrum – have worried about the tendency of US companies to “stash cash abroad”. The reason
for this behavior lies in current tax rules. Under the current tax regime, firms are taxed on
worldwide income but that tax can, with some exceptions (typically for passive income such as
interest and royalties), be deferred until the foreign subsidiaries distribute the monies back to
their US parent. When repatriating foreign profits, firms get a credit for the foreign taxes paid on
that income. In spite of the credit, firms have been reluctant to repatriate earnings earned by
foreign subsidiaries because the US corporate tax rate is much higher than the tax rate in most
countries, with the consequence that credits brought in with the distribution are lower than the
incremental US tax before credits.
        If there were some type of tax holiday allowing companies to pay a much lower rate
when repatriating foreign earnings, investors might expect companies with cash stashed abroad
to do better. In fact, this expectation is mirrored in the fact that Goldman Sachs has, several years
ago, compiled a thematic basket, GSTHSEAS, containing the 50 companies among the S&P 500
with the largest cash positions held in foreign subsidiaries. Importantly, however, it is not clear
whether the election would have affected companies differentially in this respect. After all, a
partial tax holiday was widely expected to occur as well if Hillary Clinton had been elected

  While Table 5 only reports the results including industry fixed effects for space reasons, we have also conducted
the analysis without industry fixed effects, and the results are very similar.

President.17 Accordingly, the market reaction to the election on that count would be driven not so
much by the enactment of a tax holiday as such, but by the perceived difference in the holiday
tax rate between the two candidates, with Trump likely to favor a lower rate than Clinton. Panel
D of Table 5 shows, however, that companies with large cash holdings in foreign subsidiaries in
fact responded worse to the Trump election. When controlling for foreign revenues (not shown),
the effect is insignificant, suggesting that foreign cash holdings at least partly proxy for a firm’s
foreign activities overall.
         Recall that we found above that companies with a lot of business abroad – which are
more likely to be the ones holding cash abroad – actually responded worse to Trump’s election.
Thus, if the repatriation tax holiday is implicitly at play in the market’s expectations, something
else must be particularly bad for firms with foreign activities.


5.4 Interest expense deductibility and capital investment expensing
Another approach that has been proposed to make the US more competitive is to strengthen
firms’ incentives to invest. Specifically, under the House Republicans’ tax plan, businesses
would no longer need to depreciate capital investments. Instead, they will be able to expense
them fully in the period that they are made. Thus, firms would be able to defer corporate income
taxes, which should have a positive effect on stock prices, with a larger effect for firms making
greater capital expenditures relative to their size. In order to avoid a tax subsidy for debt-
financed investment, the House Republicans’ plan would no longer allow net interest expenses to
be deducted. This would hurt those firms with more leverage (which generates value through the
tax shield in place up to now) and those with greater proportional interest expenses.
         Columns (1), (3), and (5) of Table 6 reveal a negative but insignificant relationship
between firm leverage and abnormal returns in the full specification.18 However, firms with
substantial interest expenses reacted more negatively, as seen in column (2) of Table 6, though
the reaction did not come immediately after the election (columns (4) and (6)). This result is
illustrated in the top panel of Figure 7. We note that this result does not necessarily have to do
17
    A different, but related question is what companies would do with the repatriated cash. Despite explicit
prohibitions against the use of repatriated cash for repurchases, it appears that this is exactly what companies did use
this cash for after the 2004 tax holiday (Dharmapala, Foley and Forbes 2011). Thus, an indirect effect leading to
differential stock market reactions to repatriation could be due to differences in firms’ financial constraints.
18
   The correlation between leverage and beta in our sample is slightly negative but statistically insignificant. There is
no significant relationship between abnormal returns and leverage even if we do not control for beta. However, there
is a negative relationship between leverage and abnormal returns when not controlling for foreign revenues.

                                                                                                                     23
with an expectation regarding interest deductibility being abolished, as deductions also lose
value when taxes are slashed (as the market seems to expect, see Section 5.2).

       We find no significant relationship between immediate or long-run abnormal returns and
CAPEX, as can also be seen by the virtually flat regression lines in the bottom panel of Figure 8.

expensing would be offset from the non-deductibility of interest, assuming the investments
would have been financed with bonds, but the same result holds when not controlling for these

   While the House Republicans’ plan removes interest deductibility for all firms and allows all firms to expense
capital investments, Trump’s plan, as described on https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/tax-plan/ (visited on
February 1, 2017), is to restrict the possibility to expense capital investment to manufacturers. These companies
would be allowed to opt (once in three years) to expense, but would then give up the interest deduction. When
restricting the sample to the 165 firms in SIC codes 2000 to 3999 (manufacturing), the coefficient on capital
expenditures is positive in regressions like those in Table 6, but still below conventional significance levels.

                                                                                                                                                                                25
5.5 Extreme returns
A potential concern regarding the analysis so far is that extreme returns might confound our
inferences. We now briefly present summary results for our key findings when adjusting outlier
returns. Panel A of Table 7 shows results when abnormal returns are winsorized at the 1% and
99% levels, and Panel B trims the observations with the 1% highest and lowest returns. Virtually
the same findings as before emerge, though often with higher statistical significance: Taxes and
growth expectations were already reflected in stock prices on the day after the election, while
foreign revenues and interest expenses took longer to have an effect.

6 Conclusion
The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th President of the United States of America surprised
the nation and its investors. As expected, company stock reactions to the election reflect
expected benefits and costs for shareholders. Investors clearly expect US corporate taxes to be
cut (resulting in relative advantages for companies that had so far been paying high taxes). They
worry substantially about US companies with significant non-US revenues. And they so far seem
to think that changes in plans regarding the deductibility of capital expenses are either not likely
to be implemented, or that they will not, in fact, benefit companies that need to make such
investments. Overall, our results suggest that while investors incorporated the expected
consequences of the election for US growth and tax policy into prices relatively quickly, it took
them more time to digest the consequences of shifts in trade policy on firms’ prospects.
Alternatively, statements by the incoming administration or members of Congress in the post-
election period provided the market with new information, implying that internationally-oriented
firms were likely to suffer differentially.
                                                                                                               27
       Besides a study of stock market reactions, this election is likely to spur additional work
exploiting this shock in the study of empirical corporate finance topics. Whenever researchers
need an unanticipated change of expectations regarding future taxes, for example, the Trump
victory should prove useful.
       It is important to caution the reader that substantial new information will unfold as the
Trump Presidency progresses. Important elements of the short-term expectations about policies
and their effects on company fortunes, whether for the day beyond or the seven weeks beyond
Election Day, may well reverse themselves when policies are actually implemented. Whatever
one’s politics, the initial days of the Trump Presidency lend confidence to one prediction:
significant policy surprises, and significant changes in company stock prices, lurk in the near-
and not-so-near term future.
