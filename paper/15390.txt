Music for a Song: An Empirical Look at Uniform Song Pricing and its Alternatives

                                              ABSTRACT

Economists have well-developed theories that challenge the wisdom of the common practice of uniform
pricing. With digital music as its context, this paper explores the profit and welfare implications of
various alternatives, including song-specific pricing, various forms of bundling, two-part tariffs, nonlinear
pricing, and third-degree price discrimination. Using survey-based data on nearly 1000 students’ valuations
of 100 popular songs in early 2008 and early 2009. We find that various alternatives – including simple
schemes such as pure bundling and two-part tariffs – can raise both producer and consumer surplus.
Revenue could be raised by between a sixth and a third relative to profit-maximizing uniform pricing.
While person-specific uniform pricing can raise revenue by over 50 percent, none of the non-discriminatory
schemes raise revenue’s share of surplus above 40 percent of total surplus. Even with sophisticated
pricing, much of the area under the demand curve for this product cannot be appropriated as revenue.

        The prominence of the iTunes Music store, where until recently all songs sold for

$0.99, has focused attention on uniform pricing and its alternatives. Economists have

well-developed normative theories that raise questions, at least in theory, about the

wisdom of uniform pricing. Alternatives to uniform pricing include song-specific

pricing, various forms of bundling, two-part tariffs, and nonlinear pricing. Many of these

approaches are well understood in theory.1 But determining the amount of additional

profit or consumer surplus available from using alternatives to uniform pricing is an

empirical question in each context where it might be applied.

        Quantifying the surplus foregone by uniform pricing is a matter of current

practical as well as academic interest. Apple has now sold over 6 billion songs at iTunes,

over 2 billion in 2008 alone (Christman, 2008; Musgrove, 2009), until recently using only

uniform pricing. During the summer of 2007, some record labels declined to renew their

contracts with Apple out of a desire for more flexibility in pricing.2 In September 2007,

Amazon launched a music downloading service featuring, among other things, song-

specific, or “variable” pricing.3 Earlier this year Apple moved toward song-specific

pricing with a three-tier pricing structure. Nokia implements a different alternative, pure

bundling, with unlimited song downloads on phones sold with a “Comes with Music”

surcharge.

        In general, it is hard to know how much money uniform pricing leaves on the

table because the data needed to evaluate this question – the full distribution of

reservation prices across buyers and products – are hard to come by. Usually, researchers

estimate some sort of demand system allowing inference about individuals’ valuations of

various quantities of various products.4 If one could directly observe buyers’ reservation

prices for products, some sophisticated forms of pricing would be easily implementable.

This paper pursues this goal using survey-based direct elicitation of students’ valuations

of 100 popular songs at iTunes during January 2008 and January 2009.

        The effect of sophisticated pricing on revenue has implications beyond pricing

strategy. The welfare economics of imperfect competition depends crucially on the

extent to which the social benefit of a product – the area under the demand curve – can be

captured as revenue for the seller.5 It’s obvious that the producer surplus under single-

price monopoly can fall short of fixed and variable costs even when the joint surplus

would exceed costs. Hence, the market can fail to provide goods with benefit in excess

of costs. Of course, whether sellers can capture surplus as revenue depends on the

effectiveness of price discrimination. Perfect first degree price discrimination eliminates,

or at least substantially mitigates, the underprovision problem.6 But we do not know

what share of surplus is appropriable as revenue in practice. One of this paper’s

contributions is to show the share of surplus that is appropriable in one context.

        The paper proceeds in five sections. First, we briefly discuss the pricing problem,

along with the relevant theoretical and empirical literatures on various kinds of pricing.

In section 2 we discuss our data collected from two surveys in 2008 and 2009. Section 3

discusses our parametric approach to characterizing the valuation distributions needed for

our pricing exercises. Section 4 presents our results on revenue and the distribution of

surplus available under various pricing schemes, including revenue-maximizing uniform,

song-specific pricing, two-part tariffs, nonlinear bundle-size pricing, pure bundling,

(simple versions of) mixed bundling, and individual customer-specific pricing. Section 4

also presents bootstrap-based evidence on the precision of our estimates. Section 5 finds

Pareto-improving pricing schemes that deliver at least the levels of consumer and

producer surplus achieved under profit maximizing uniform pricing. A brief conclusion

follows.

       Because our songs and respondents are not representative, we cannot prescribe an

optimal pricing policy (or pass judgment on the wisdom of, say, a $0.99 uniform price).

But we can compare the breakdown of the area under the demand curve into producer

surplus, consumer surplus, and deadweight loss under different pricing schemes. We find,

for example, that revenue-maximizing uniform pricing collects just over a quarter of

surplus as revenue, while leaving almost 45 percent of surplus as consumer surplus and

the remainder as deadweight loss. Using revenue-maximizing uniform pricing as the

benchmark, we find that various alternative schemes such as pure bundling and two part

tariffs could raise revenue by about 17 percent in one sample and by about 30 percent in

another. While none of the self-selecting schemes can raise revenue much beyond a

third of total surplus, person-specific third degree price discrimination can raise producer

surplus by more than 50 percent over its level under uniform pricing, allowing sellers to

appropriate over half of surplus as revenue. Third degree price discrimination based on

observables, by contrast, has very little effect on producer surplus.



I. Theoretical Setup and Literature Review




                                              4
1. Setup

       Each consumer i has a reservation price for each song s ( Vis ). These reservation

prices, in conjunction with the pricing schemes, determine whether the individual

purchases 1 or 0 units of each song (and we assume resale impossible). Consumers

evaluate bundles of songs by adding their valuations of each of the songs included in

bundles.

       The seller’s problem is to choose a vector of prices P for the songs, or groups of

songs, to maximize his profit. For example, if the seller is a uniform single-price

monopolist selling 50 different products, then he chooses only one price, and the price of

each bundle depends proportionally on the number of songs on the bundle. That is, if

bundle k contains 5 songs, and p is the single price per product, then Pk=5p. With other

pricing schemes, the P vector becomes more complicated. If the seller engages in

component pricing, with a potentially different price for each song, then the bundle price

is the sum of the prices of each of the elements of the bundle. If the seller employs a two

part tariff, the first song purchased has one price, while each additional song has another.

If the seller engages in “bundle size pricing,” then Pk simply depends – generally

nonlinearly – on the number of elements in the bundle purchased, so there are 50 separate

prices to set. If the seller engages in mixed bundling, then each combination of products

can potentially have its own price. With n products, there are (2n – 1). With 3, this

amounts to 7. With 50 products, the number of combinations is about a quadrillion.

With pure bundling, the seller sets a single price for the entire bundle of 50 songs.

Finally, under person-specific pricing, and extreme form of 3rd degree price

discrimination, the seller sets a (potentially different) price for each consumer.



                                              5
        Define Vik as individual i’s valuation of song bundle k. (The bundle could be an

individual song, or any combination of the 50 songs available). Each consumer’s problem

is to maximize Vik  Pk by his choice of k, or which product (or bundle of songs) to

consume.

        Given a pricing scheme along with consumers’ valuations of products, a computer

can mechanically determine how much revenue each scheme would collect. For some of

these schemes – notably, nonlinear pricing and mixed bundling – the number of possible

pricing schemes is large so that even a fast computer can examine only a limited range of

schemes (in particular for nonlinear pricing with more than about 5 separate prices, and

for mixed bundling just a few products).



2. Related Literature

        The textbook theory of single price monopoly (see, for example, Pindyck and

Rubinfeld, 2006) provides a guide to profit-maximizing uniform pricing. The simplest

alternative to uniform pricing (UP) is song-specific, or component pricing (CP).

Analytically, it involves the same apparatus as UP, albeit with a single separate price per

song. Song-specific pricing is currently employed by digital music sellers Amazon as

well as Aimee Street.com, and many observers consider Apple’s recently abandoned

practice of uniform pricing a blunt instrument for revenue maximization.7                 Because UP

is a constrained special case of CP – with equal prices for all songs – UP cannot produce

more revenue than CP, and CP would in general be expected to produce more.



7
 The puzzle of uniform prices arises in other product markets, for example in movie theater pricing. See
Orbach and Einav (2007).


                                                    6
        There is a substantial theoretical literature on sophisticated alternatives to uniform

pricing. This body of work provides guidance about how pricing schemes other than

uniform pricing can be expected to affect profits and other aspects of surplus. Stigler

(1963) presented a two-product example showing that bundling could produce more

revenue pricing the products separately when consumers’ valuations of the products are

negatively correlated. Adams and Yellen (1976) introduced mixed bundling (MB) with

examples where mixed bundling produced more profit than either pure bundling (PB) or

product-specific pricing. Schmalensee (1984) shows that PB can be more profitable than

product-specific pricing even when the correlations of consumer valuations are positive.

McAfee, McMillan and Whinston (1989) show that mixed bundling (MB) always beats

pure bundling although – again – it results in complex pricing schemes.

        A few recent papers outline the situations in which a firm can extract surplus by

selling large multiproduct bundles. Bakos & Brynjolffson (1999) show that if the

valuation of a large bundle is more predictable than the valuation of individual products,

then as the number of products grows large, pure bundling extracts the entire surplus as

revenue. Fang and Norman (2006) obtain related results with finite numbers of products.

Armstrong (1999) also shows that when tastes are correlated across products – for

example because of income differences across consumers – a menu of two-part tariffs is

almost optimal.8

        A few papers use characterizations of demand to create pricing schemes. Chu,

Leslie, and Sorenson (2007) estimate demand for eight plays at a Palo Alto theater using

data on purchases of individual play tickets as well as bundles. They use their estimated


8
 Sundararajan (2004) develops a model of optimal pricing for large bundles when there are costs of
administration.

model to create profit-maximizing pricing schemes under uniform pricing, component

pricing, pure bundling, bundle-size pricing, and mixed bundling. Relative to uniform

pricing, component pricing raises revenue 1.4 percent, bundle size pricing raises revenue

2.3 percent, and mixed bundling raises revenue 4 percent, but none of the alternatives to

uniform pricing raises revenue by more than 5 percent.9 McMillan (2007) estimates a

model of demand for soft-drinks at a grocery store which he uses to calculate that

uniform pricing would cost the store $60 in profit (on revenue of roughly $10,000).

Crawford (2008) estimates a model of demand for cable television bundles which he uses

to simulate effects of adding channels to available bundles. He estimates that bundling

an average top-15 special interest cable network gives rise to a 4.7 percent increase in

profit, a 4.0 percent decrease in consumer surplus, and a 2.0 percent increase in total

surplus.



II. Data

    1. Sources and Validity

        The basic data for this study are drawn from two surveys, each of about 500

Wharton undergraduates, performed in January of 2008 and January of 2009. In the 2008

survey, undergraduates – mostly freshmen – at Wharton were required to fill out an

online survey which presented them with the top 50 songs at iTunes (as of January 11,

2008). Students were given instructions and paper worksheets in class on January 16 and

17. For each song, students were told to listen to a clip to remind themselves of the song,

then to write down the maximum amount they would be willing to pay to get the song

9
 They emphasize that bundle size pricing achieves 98 percent of the revenue of mixed bundling. Said
another way, bundle size pricing achieves 60 percent of mixed bundling’s improvement over uniform
pricing.


                                                   8
from the sole authorized source. Completion of the assignment was necessary for

problem set credit to motivate students to participate carefully.

       In particular, students were given the following instructions:

       Imagine that, unlike in current reality, there is only one authorized source for each song. Put aside
       what you know about prices at existing outlets because for this survey we’re pretending that they
       don’t exist.

       For each song listed in the survey, indicate the maximum amount you would be willing to pay to
       obtain it from the sole authorized source. For this exercise, I’m asking you to report what it is
       worth to you, not what price you think would be fair or what price you are accustomed to
       paying. That is, I’m asking you to indicate the maximum amount you would be willing to
       pay to obtain it from the authorized source.

       For example, if you already purchased it, then at the time you bought it, you were willing to pay at
       least the price you paid but you might have been willing to pay more. If you would prefer not to
       have it even if it were free, you would indicate 0.

       On the following pages, you will be presented with a list of songs and artists. In the space
       provided for each song, enter the maximum amount you are willing to pay for the song (for
       example 1.75, NOT $1.75). You must enter a dollar amount for each song.



The resulting 2008 dataset includes 23,150 observations on individual-song valuations

for 463 people, as well as a small amount of information on the respondents: age (mostly

18-20), gender, race, self-reported level of interest in music (not interested, somewhat

interested, very interested), and the size of their music library.

       The 2009 data, which includes 21,650 observations from 433 respondents, differs

in two respects. First, rather than the top 50 songs at iTunes, the 2009 data include the

top 25 songs at iTunes, along with 10 songs that were the top 10 songs 6 months earlier,

and 15 songs drawn randomly from those ranked between 26 and 100 at the time of the

survey. The goal of the different sampling scheme is to explore if the effectiveness of

alternative pricing schemes in the 2008 data arises from the narrow choice of songs. A

second difference in the 2009 data is that respondents were asked not only their valuation




                                                    9
of each song but also whether they possessed the song and, if so, whether they had

purchased or obtained it via file sharing.

         One concern with valuation data drawn from surveys is that respondents would

anchor on prices they know to be charged at actual websites, for example the well-known

$0.99 iTunes price employed when the data were collected. We are not interested in the

students’ beliefs about current pricing; we are interested in their maximum willingness to

pay.

         This leads us to visual inspection of the data, and nearly all of the valuations are

“reasonable”: 98 percent of valuations fall on [0,10], and 86 percent fall on [0,2]. There

is some clustering at the familiar price around $1 but not substantially more than the

clustering on other multiples of $0.25. Of nearly 24,000 responses for 2008, there are

7257 zeroes. Data for 2009 are similar (see Figure 1).10 The clustering of valuation

responses at round and focal numbers (notably, zero, multiples of $0.25, $0.99, and

$1.99) gives rises to plateaus on the demand curve that create “sawtooth” spikes in the

relationship between revenue and price. If we believed that the reported valuations were

literally true, we could use the raw data to find optimal pricing schemes. Instead, as we

explain below, we will fit the data to some parametric distribution. (The four panels of

Figure 1 cover data for 2008 and 2009, both raw – top – and fit to a parametric

distribution – bottom – via a process we describe below at III.)

         It is prudent to ask whether surveys can elicit meaningful valuation information.

It is well known that question wording affects responses. In earlier work on music

valuation, questions asking for willingness to pay tended to elicit much lower valuations

10
  Another test of reasonableness, pursued below, is whether optimal prices charged to these valuations are
close to actual prices. Of course, such a test involves the joint hypothesis of “reasonable” data and profit-
maximizing pricing decisions.


                                                     10
than questions asking for amounts required to give up music (Rob and Waldfogel, 2006).

This is the familiar endowment effect (Knetsch and Sinden, 1984). Sensitivity of results

to question wording has led some researchers to be skeptical of survey responses

(Diamond and Hausman, 1994). One response to this concern stems from the fact that

the profit-maximizing prices implied by buy-based valuations in Rob and Waldfogel

(2006) – similar to those used here – tend to be close to observed prices while those

implied by sell-based valuations are far off. We find that below as well, providing some

assurance that the survey wording gets at the valuations relevant to the pricing decision.

A second response is that here, people are valuing familiar items rather than, say, pristine

Alaskan wilderness they have never seen.

       Our 2009 data allow a more direct test of reasonableness. We need to be able to

rely on our reported valuations to make statements about which songs – and bundles of

songs – respondents would purchase when facing various prices. Because the 2009 data

include information on whether the respondent possesses the song, we can perform a

simple check on the data: do respondents actually possess the songs that they report

valuing at or above $0.99? Because it is easier for the respondent to accurately report

whether he or she has a copy of a song than to accurately report the valuation he or she

attaches to the song, this check can validate the valuation responses.

       Each observation is a song-respondent pair. Recall that respondents report

valuations for each song, along with whether they possess the song. For examining the

relationship between valuation and ownership, we discard song-respondent observations

that the respondents obtained via file sharing, since obtaining a song without payment is

consistent with low or high valuation. With the remaining data we ask whether the




                                             11
probability that the observations in each valuation range are owned relates to the reported

valuation.

        Figure 2 summarizes the relationship between valuation and purchase, and it is

clearly positive. The data are divided into 50 equal-sized groups, ordered by valuation.

In each cell, we compute the probability that song-respondent observations are owned.

The horizontal axis records the logarithm of the cell’s average song valuation, while the

vertical axis indicates the probability that the song is owned. As the valuations rise, the

probability of purchase rises as well, to about 20 percent for average valuations near – but

below - $0.99. When the average valuations reach $0.99 – and the log valuation

approaches 0 – the probability of ownership jumps to about 50 percent. As the average

valuation continues to increase, so does the probability of ownership. Figure 2 shows that

valuation information is predictive of purchase behavior.

        A related check on whether the data are reasonable is whether the songs for which

respondents frequently report high valuations are also the songs with higher sales among

buyers generally. Although we cannot observe song sales directly, we have two indirect

measures of sales. The number of weeks a song has been on the “Billboard Hot Digital”

chart, along with its peak single chart position, provides indirect measures of its

cumulative sales.11 A regression of the share of respondents reporting valuations of at

least $0.99 on these two sales proxies (for the 2008 data) yields:

  The Billboard Chart, “Hot Digital Songs,” is available at http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts,

chart_weeks indicates the number of weeks the song had been on the Billboard chart as

of March 8, 2008; and chart_peak indicates the song’s peak chart position. Standard

errors are in parentheses, and the R-squared from this regression is 0.34. Results support

the notion that the data are reasonable in some rudimentary sense: Songs on the chart

longer have a higher simulated sales penetration in this sample, and songs with a lower

chart peak (a higher peak rank) have higher penetration.

       Our survey approach to eliciting reservation valuations has antecedents in the

marketing and operations literatures. Hanson and Martin (1990) employ direct elicitation

of reservation values for an exercise reported in their study. Kalish and Nelson (1991)

explore direct elicitation along with preference rating and ranking measures and find that

reservation values do well in terms of fit while the other measures are superior in

predicting choice on a holdout sample. Venkatesh and Mahajan (1993) survey

respondents on their willingness to pay for performances of Indian music. The authors

calculate revenue under component pricing, pure bundling, and mixed bundling. Jedidi,

Jagpal, and Manchanda (2003) estimate an empirical model of survey respondents’

reservation values of individual goods and bundles of two. While Jedidi, Jagpal, and

Manchanda (2003) observe that self-stated reservation prices are subject to measurement

error, especially for infrequently purchased products, the songs in our survey are familiar

and commonly purchased.



   2. Data Summary



                                            13
       Table 1 reports the average valuations per song in the 2008 sample, as well as the

median, 25th, and 75th percentile valuations. The most highly valued songs on the list

have average valuations over $2.00. They include “Stronger” by Kanye West,

“Apologize” by Timbaland (feat. One Republic), and “The Way I Are” by Timbaland

(feat. Keri Hilson & DOE). The lowest valued songs, with mean valuations below $0.7,

are those targeted at consumers younger than our college-student respondents. Examples

include artists such as Alvin and the Chipmunks and Disney artists such as the Jonas

Brothers and Miley Cyrus. The 25th percentile valuation for most songs is around $0.10,

and the 75th percentile valuation is typically over $1.5. To conserve space, we do not

report the analogous table for 2009, but like 2008 the 2009 data displays substantial inter-

song variation.

       Valuations vary substantially both within and across respondents. Figure 3

characterizes the distribution of cumulative valuations (e.g. how highly a respondent

values his top 10 songs, for example). This figure shows that the median valuation of

(each individual’s) top 10 songs among these 50 in the 2008 sample is about $20, while

the 75th percentile valuation is about double that ($40), and the 25th percentile valuation is

around $15. Valuations in the 2009 sample are lower: for example, the median person’s

valuation of his or her top 10 is around $15. The flattening of each of these curves

indicates substantial difference between the valuations of the most highly and least highly

valued songs. Analyzed a different way, the valuation data indicate that the vast majority

of the variation in the reported valuations arise across individuals, as opposed to songs.

A regression of 2008 (2009) valuations on song fixed effects yields an R-squared of 4.0




                                             14
(5.9) percent. The R-squared from a regression on only individual effects is 40.2 (31.5)

percent, and the R-squared with both individual and song effects is 44.2 (37.4) percent.

       The correlations of song valuations across persons help to determine the extent to

which non-uniform pricing schemes can capture additional revenue. For example, a

common intuition from bundling theory is that bundling raises revenue more as products’

valuations are less positively correlated. Song valuations in our datasets are positively

correlated. With 50 songs there are 1,225 pairwise song correlations. The mean

correlation is 0.37 for the 2008 sample and 0.25 for the 2009 sample. Figure 4 shows the

whole distribution of pairwise correlations for each year.

       Because the two samples are made up of different groups of songs (by vintage and

ranking), it is interesting to explore the cause of the lower correlation among songs in the

2009 sample. Each of the samples contains the top 25 iTunes songs at the time of the

survey. When we restrict attention to these songs, the pairwise correlations average 0.40

for the 2008 sample and 0.26 for the 2009 sample. Hence, the lower correlations in the

2009 sample are not attributable to the latter sample’s wider breadth in popularity and

vintage. Whatever the cause of the lower correlation, we can expect bundling to raise

revenue more for the 2009 songs.



III. Characterizing the Valuation Distributions

       In order to implement pricing schemes we need a characterization of the

distribution of reservation prices across persons and products. Given the nature of our

data – based on direct elicitation of each person’s valuation of each product – one

approach is obvious: use the observed valuation responses directly. The major




                                             15
shortcoming of this approach is the irregularity of the resulting revenue functions and

surfaces arising from the spikes in the top panel of Figure 1. This irregularity strains

credulity if we think that underlying utility functions are smooth; such irregularity also

makes it hard to efficiently identify revenue-maximizing solutions. An alternative that

allows for smoother revenue functions is to fit the valuation data to a parametric

distribution.

        We explored the multivariate normal, and while the approach has the appeal of

simplicity, we are concerned about various aspects of fit. First, the probability of having

a positive valuation appears not to be governed by the same underlying index that

generates the positive valuations. Second, the positive values appear to be better

described by a lognormal than a normal distribution. Accordingly, we employ a “zero-

inflated multivariate lognormal” model.

        That is, we assume that positive valuations are distributed multivariate lognormal.

Thus, individual i’s log valuation of song (s) is               . The parameter         is the

standard deviation of log valuations for song (s). Finally,         is the correlation of

valuations between song (s) and song (t). We estimate         and      using the positive

valuations of song (s). We estimate       directly using logs of valuations for individuals

who report positive valuations for both songs (s) and (t).

        We then estimate the probabilities that respondents report positive valuations

using the following model:                 where y is binary: it equals 1 if the valuation is

positive and 0 if the reported valuation is 0. The standard deviation is unity by

construction. By estimating this equation for two songs at a time, we obtain estimates of

the correlation between the tendencies for each pair of songs to have positive valuations




                                             16
   . The parameters     and   are unconstrained, so the probability that respondents report

positive valuations for a song can be correlated with the average value that respondents

report, but we treat and as uncorrelated.

       We then simulate valuations by first simulating multivariate lognormal draws

according to our estimated values of , , and . We exponentiate the resulting log

valuation estimates. We then simulate the process generating zero valuations by

simulating the indices of y using our estimates of    and     . We “zero-out” the

simulated valuations for observations where the probit predicts a zero valuation. This

gives us a simulated dataset generated by underlying distributions that are smooth. We

then apply pricing algorithms outlined below to these data. For each dataset, we create

valuation data on the 50 songs from 5000 simulated individuals. An appendix reports

selected pricing exercises on raw data. Figures 1, 3, and 4 include sub-figures with both

simulated and raw data, allowing visual comparison.

       For each pricing scheme, the optimal price generated by the process is a statistic

subject to sampling variation. For the pricing schemes that allow quick calculation of

optimal prices, calculating optimal prices from simulated data resulting from bootstrap

re-estimation of the parameters { , , ,      ,    } using 500 repetitions and re-sampling

on individuals.



       1. Raw Data or Parametric Estimates

       A natural interpretation of the bunching of reported valuations at multiples of

$0.25 is that respondents tend to round their reported valuations, in particular that

respondents often report, say, $1.25, when their true valuation is between $1.125 and



                                             17
$1.375. In such rounded data, the implied quantity sold at a price of $1.25 overstates the

quantity of songs for which respondents actually value at or above $1.25 because the

quantity of songs with reported valuations at or above $1.25 includes songs with

valuations as low as $1.125. Likewise, the implied quantity sold at $1.20 is overstated,

because some valuations that are truly below $1.20 are rounded up to $1.25 in the

observed data. In contrast, the implied quantity sold at $1.26 will be understated, because

the quantity of songs reportedly valued at $1.26 excludes some songs that are truly

valued between $1.26 and $1.375. This sort of bunching gives rise to plateaus on the

demand function and ensuing spikes on the revenue function. Thus the raw data will

exaggerate the revenue available from uniform pricing at multiples of $0.25 and values

slightly below these multiples, and understate the revenue available at prices slightly

higher than a multiple of $0.25. If the spikes are sufficiently large (i.e. when rounding is

common), the estimated maximum revenue available will exceed the true maximum

revenue available even if the true optimal price is slightly higher than a multiple of $0.25.

       Optimal bundle prices depend on individuals’ valuations of bundles of songs.

Valuations of bundles of songs are sums of the often-rounded-to-the-nearest-quarter

valuations of particular songs. The process of summing valuations will tend to average

out the rounding error in particular songs, removing misleading spikes from the bundle-

pricing revenue functions. Thus, bundle pricing on (sums of) raw data will not overstate

the profit available from offering a bundle at any particular price.

       Uniform pricing provides the benchmark we use to evaluate other pricing

approaches. The use of raw data and its resulting spiky revenue functions overstates the

maximum revenue available with uniform pricing and therefore understates the benefit of




                                             18
pricing techniques that involve individuals’ valuations of bundles (bundling, two-part

tariffs, and nonlinear pricing). Hence, we believe that the raw data provide misleading

answers, and we focus on estimates using the parametric approach throughout the paper.



IV. Results Using Different Pricing Schemes



         1. The Single-Price Monopoly Baseline

         The four panels of Figure 5 show the empirical demand curves, treating all songs

as a single good (music), using both raw and parametric approaches, and using 2008 and

2009 data. The raw data, in the top two panels, produce demand curves with noticeable

plateaus, while the parametric approach produces smooth demand curves. Given that

marginal cost of digital music is zero, the surplus at stake in this pricing problem is the

entire area under the raw-data demand curves, or $60.34 per person in 2008 and $43.56

per person in 2009. 12

         We can calculate the profit-maximizing price – and breakdown of the available

surplus – with a simple manipulation of the valuation data. We order the valuation data

from highest to lowest among the n (song x individual) valuations: V1,…Vn. Because n

songs are sold when the price is Vn, we can calculate the revenue when we charge Vn per

song as n* Vn. Figure 6 shows the empirical revenue functions relating n* Vn to n for the

various approaches.



12
   Music selling has three parties: the artists, their labels, and the retailer. At the time of the surveys, Apple
reportedly paid a flat rate of $0.7 per song. Analysis of the retailer’s pricing decision could then take the
marginal cost to be $0.7. We will instead treat the problem as if the three parties acted collectively to
maximize the pie that they split. To that end we treat the marginal costs as its technical value, zero.



                                                       19
       The revenue functions based on raw data have various local maxima, confirming

our concerns about the revenue overstatement due to bunching (the highest of which

occurs at a price of $1.99 in the 2008 data and at $0.99 in the 2009 data). The data from

the parametric estimates give rise to smooth, single peaked revenue functions, and the

revenue-maximizing uniform prices from the parametric approaches are $2.30 in the

2008 sample and $1.46 in the 2009 sample. We discuss the precision of these estimates

at section IV.8 below.

       Table 2 summarizes the breakdown of total surplus into its constituent parts under

uniform pricing with the 2008 and 2009 data, respectively. Based on the 2008 parametric

estimates, uniform pricing allows producers to captures 27 percent of surplus, while

consumers get 44 percent of surplus, and the remaining 29 percent of the area under the

demand curve is deadweight loss. Using the 2009 data gives nearly identical results.

       We put the uniform pricing results to two uses. First, they are interesting on their

own. Because we don’t normally have data on the full distribution of valuations, we

cannot generally calculate the shares of surplus accruing to different parties. Instead, we

typically appeal to functional form assumptions on the demand curve itself. For example,

with linear demand and zero marginal cost, under uniform pricing PS is half of total

surplus, while CS and DWL are each a quarter. Because the demand curves here (in

Figure 5) are far from linear, results are quite different. Second, and more important, the

uniform price results provide the benchmark we use for evaluating more sophisticated

pricing approaches. For each approach below, we can ask how the components of

surplus grow or shrink relative to their values under uniform pricing.




                                            20
2. Song-Specific “Component” Pricing

       A conceptually simple alternative to uniform pricing across all songs is

component pricing (uniform pricing within songs). It might be complicated in practice

because it requires song-specific valuation information, but putting this practical

complication aside, we can implement this with our data by simply calculating maximum

revenue for each song as we calculated maximum revenue overall above. Figure 7 shows

histograms of resulting optimal song prices from the two years’ samples. The median

optimal song price for the 2008 sample is $2.28, and the inter-quartile range runs from

$1.94 to $3.00. For 2009 the median is $1.20, and the inter-quartile range extends from

$0.98 to $1.52.

       Interestingly, in light of the clamor to convince Apple to employ song-specific

pricing at iTunes, component pricing – using 50 prices rather than one – has little effect

on the components of surplus. It raises PS by 3 percent in both the 2008 and 2009 data

based on parametric estimates. Component pricing reduces CS by 6 percent in the 2008

sample and raises CS by 5 percent in the 2009 sample. DWL under component pricing is

6 percent higher than the DWL under uniform pricing using the 2008 sample and 11

percent lower using the 2009 sample. It is notable that component pricing’s benefit

remains small even with the 2009 sample and its inclusion of older and less popular

songs. It should be noted that these estimates of the benefit of component pricing, while

small, overstate the practical benefit of song-specific pricing since in actuality sellers

would need to set prices for songs in advance of knowing each song’s realized demand.



3. Pure Bundling




                                              21
           Another simple alternative to uniform pricing is “pure bundling” (PB), in which

the entire group of songs is offered, as a group, for a single price. Since Stigler (1963)

and Adams and Yellen (1976), economists have understood the intuition that negative

correlations in valuations allow a seller to capture more revenue by bundling products.

As we have seen, sample song valuations are positively correlated across individuals, and

the correlation is higher for the 2008 than the 2009 data. Schmalensee (1984) shows that

bundling can increase revenue even with positive correlations of valuations.15 And as

Bakos and Brynjolffson (1999) and Armstrong (1999) argue, as the number of products

grows large, PB will approach perfect price discrimination as long as consumers’ tastes

aren’t too highly correlated across products. How does pure bundling affect surpluses in

our context? And how does this vary with the size of the bundles?

           To calculate the optimal full (50-song) bundle price we sum the song valuations

across songs within each individual to arrive at that individual’s valuation of the entire

bundle. We then calculate the revenue-maximizing bundle price, as we would under

single price monopoly. The optimal 50-song bundle price is $74.25 using the data

derived from the parametric approach for 2008 and $36.84 for the 2009 data. Pure

bundling raises revenue substantially, by 17 percent relative to uniform pricing with the

2008 sample and by 29 percent using the 2009 sample. These gains to consumers come

partly at the expense of consumers: CS under bundling is 15 percent below its value

under uniform pricing in the 2008 sample and 5 percent below for the 2009 data. While

pure bundling improves revenue – and substantially more than component pricing – the

resulting revenue falls far short of the perfect price discrimination revenue predicted by

some theoretical models. The reason for this failure is that tastes are correlated across
15
     Fang and Norman (2006) demonstrate similar results.


                                                    22
products, which arises, as Armstrong (1999) notes, “because of income or other

systematic differences across consumers.”

       We also explore how the effect of pure bundling on revenue varies with the size

of the bundle, by calculating the maximal revenue for random song bundles, with 500

draws for each of the following bundle sizes: 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, and 25. See Table 3. Each

column corresponds to one of the sample years and either the raw or parametric

approach.

       Using the 2008 sample, bundles of 2 raise revenue 5 percent relative to uniform

pricing. As bundle size increases, the benefit of bundling increases. More than half of

the benefit is achieved with bundles of 5. Similar results hold using the 2009 sample.

While larger bundles raise revenue, the rate of increase declines as bundle size increases.

If the flattening continues, it appears that there would not be much more revenue benefit

available to bundles larger than 50 (so that 50 is a “large” number, in the sense of the

theory) and that most of the revenue benefit of large bundles is achieved with 5-song

bundles.



4. Two-Part Tariffs

       Another scheme we can explore is the two part tariff with a hookup fee (T)

independent of the number of songs purchased and a per-song price (p). We have already

explored two of its special cases: When p=0, this is pure bundling, and when T=0, this is

uniform pricing. We explore this family of schemes as follows. Try a pair (T, p). Given

the p, each individual would purchase some number of songs and would have some level

of consumer surplus from the songs with valuations at or above p. If the individual’s




                                             23
total consumer surplus exceeds T, he would pay the hookup fee, and then the revenue

from that individual would equal p*(number of units purchased) + T. If T exceeds his

consumer surplus, by contrast, then he would make no purchase.

       Our goal is to find values of (T, p) that maximize revenue. If the revenue function

were well-behaved, we could enlist hill-climbing algorithms to find the revenue-

maximizing price pair. Despite our parametric estimation and its attendant smoothing,

resulting functions remain irregular. There is a multitude of substantially different,

though functionally related, two-part pricing schemes that yield similar revenue. The hill

climbing program is generally unable to find, or come close to finding, which of these

many functionally related pricing pairs maximizes revenue. To approximate the best

price pair we begin our maximization with a rather fine grid, searching over 161 values of

p {0, 0.05, 0.1,…, 8} in conjunction with 1000 values of T {0, 0.1, 0.2,…,100}. We

then use the per unit price and fixed fee from each of the top ten revenue generating

prices from this grid search as starting points for a hill-climbing program.

       Using the 2008 data, the best two-part schemes identified involve (T, p) =

($52.31, $0.48). Using the 2009 sample, the best tariff is ($21.19, $0.37). It is

interesting to examine the top 10 tariffs – and the top 1 percent of tariffs – among those

identified by the grid search, along with the best identified. Figure 7 shows these tariffs,

and the top tariffs lie along a downward-sloping line between a high unit price with a low

hookup fee and a much lower unit price with a higher hookup fee. The two-part tariff

achieves results very similar to those achieved with pure bundling - PS, CS, and DWL

are almost identical under two-part pricing and bundle pricing.




                                             24
5. Nonlinear “Bundle Size” Pricing

        Two part tariffs are a special case of more general nonlinear prices that vary with

the number of units purchased, what Chu, Leslie, and Sorenson (2007) call, “bundle size

pricing.” As outlined in Wilson (1993), calculating a nonlinear tariff is straightforward

in principle. Provided that the tariff crosses each individual’s demand curve only once,

from below, the nonlinear tariff can be calculated as a sequence of optimal prices, for the

first, second, and nth units, in this case for n up to 50. When we perform this exercise

with our data, however, the resulting tariff has some problems. First, the optimal prices

do not decline monotonically. Second, and more important, the number of buyers of

successive numbers of units does not decline monotonically. Indeed, the number of

persons buying, say, the 3rd unit exceeds the numbers of buyers of the first unit. Single

crossing does not hold, and as a result, the simple method cannot be employed for

calculating the nonlinear tariff in this context.

        Without a workable simple algorithm for determining the exact tariff, we are left

with some other alternatives for computing an approximate nonlinear tariff, including a

simple parameterization of the tariff and grid search. Given the computational cost of a

fine grid search for a pricing scheme with more than a few prices, we turn to a

parameterization.

        Prices must be non-increasing in the number of songs purchased, and prices must

be positive. This suggests some restrictions. If t is an index for a song’s position in the

sequence, then a simple parameterization is p(t )   * e t , where α >0, β<0. We perform

a grid search over α  {0.25, 0.5, 0.75,…, 100}, β  {-2,-1.95,…,0} to find the revenue-

maximizing tariff in this family, using each of the four data sets. The parameters that



                                              25
maximize revenue using the 2008 and 2009 data, respectively, are α=(12.0, 10.75) and

β=(-0.15, -0.25). The associated tariff for 2009 is illustrated in a budget constraint in

Figure 9. The prices of the first ten songs are, in order: $8.37, $6.52, $5.08, $3.95, $3.08,

$2.39, $1.87, $1.45, $1.13, $0.88, $0.67. The per-song price reaches about $0.10 by

about the 30th song in the 2008 data, and by about the 20th song in the 2009 data. The

total price of all 50 songs in both datasets is slightly higher than the respective bundle

price. Not surprisingly, as Table 2 shows, the nonlinear tariff performs very similarly to

pure bundling and two part tariffs: it does slightly better than pure bundling and not quite

as well as the two part tariff.16



6. Comparing Mixed Bundling with Alternatives

         One of the goals of this paper is to determine what share of the area under the

demand curve can be appropriated as revenue with sophisticated pricing. Each of the

schemes we have considered so far is a special case of mixed bundling (MB), which is

known to produce the most revenue. To see how much revenue can be obtained, we need

to explore mixed bundling. We do this in two parts. We first explore general mixed

bundling (with 2n-1 prices) for small bundles and using coarse grids for search. We then

explore a practical specific form of mixed bundling: selling with a bundle price alongside

a uniform à la carte price.



         A Simple Implementation of General Mixed Bundling



16
   In principle a nonlinear tariff can reproduce the two part tariff as a special case, so nonlinear pricing
should produce weakly better results than the two part tariff. Our restrictive parameterization of the tariff is
likely responsible for the nonlinear tariff producing less revenue than the two part tariff.


                                                      26
       Because of the large number of bundles, mixed bundling is difficult to implement

with 50 products. For this reason, we examine the simpler problem of finding optimal

mixed bundling pricing schemes for a much smaller set of products, 3. Even with 3

products, there are 7 bundle prices. To keep the problem manageable, we search over the

following grids among prices between 0 and 3 in increments of 0.25 for one song

bundles, between 0 and 6 for two song bundles, and between 0 and 9 for three song

bundles. We employ a 10% sample of the 2009 parametric dataset to speed computation.

       In the course of searching for the best mixed bundling schemes, we also find the

best UP, CP, PB, 2-part, and BSP schemes on this coarse grid. This allows us to compare

the performance of MB with all other schemes. Because each other scheme is special

case of MB, we expect MB to provide the most revenue.

       We want systematic insight into the relative performance of each of the pricing

schemes, so we need to perform the 3-song analysis repeatedly, on different randomly

selected groups of three songs. We repeat the analysis 5 times, and Table 4 reports

average results. Results on schemes apart from mixed bundling largely reflect what we

have found so far. Component pricing generates a bit – 3 percent - more revenue than

uniform pricing. Bundling, two-part tariffs, and nonlinear pricing generate substantially

more, at 10, 12, and 13 percent more revenue than uniform pricing, respectively. Mixed

bundling is better still. On average, MB generates 15 percent more revenue than uniform

pricing.

       The glass is both half empty and half full. MB achieves more relative to UP than

the next-best schemes. MB raises revenue 20 more than its next best alternative. But

even with mixed bundling, revenue’s share of surplus reaches an average of only 34




                                            27
percent of surplus across the 5 song groups in Table 4 (compared with 29 percent for

profit-maximizing uniform pricing).



         Bundling alongside à la Carte Sales

         We have analyzed pure bundling as though the à la carte option ceased to exist. It

seems entirely possible that bundling, if pursued, would be added alongside existing à la

carte sales. This possibility suggests a number of alternative pricing schemes to explore

that constitute simple versions of mixed bundling. Consider a family of two parameter

pricing schemes where pA is the uniform à la carte price and pB is the bundle price.

         One question is, what unconstrained combination of {pA, pB} maximizes

revenue? A second question is, what pB maximizes revenue, given that pA is constrained

to some value, such as its profit-maximizing uniform price.

         The question of the best bundle price to complement an existing à la carte scheme

is interesting in contrast to the question surrounding current policy debates concerning

cable television.17 Bundling is the default in that circumstance, and various

constituencies are advocating à la carte pricing as a complement. Of course, the optimal

values of pA and pB are related, so it may be difficult to change one without affecting the

other.

         As Table 5 indicates, when pA and pB are unconstrained, the revenue-maximizing

combination using the 2009 data is a bundle price of $37.30 with a single song price of

$7.50. With prices chosen to maximize revenue, the introduction of an à la carte option

does not bring about a low à la carte price. Bundle sales generate the vast majority of

revenue (99 percent), and few songs are sold à la carte. Revenue is slightly higher than it




                                               28
is under pure bundling without à la carte sales: Revenue in this case is 29.1 percent

above revenue under uniform pricing (compared with 28.8 percent for pure bundling).

       Our second exercise is the determination of an optimal bundle price when the à la

carte price is constrained to its current level of $1.46. Given this constraint, the best

bundle price is $31.05, and bundle sales generate just over two thirds of revenue. This

scheme generates 14.5 percent more revenue than uniform pricing, only half the

improvement over uniform pricing produced with either pure bundling or unconstrained

simple mixed bundling. That is, maintaining the à la carte price at $1.46 significantly

handicaps the ability for bundling to raise revenue.



7. Third Degree Price Discrimination

       One class of pricing schemes we have not yet explored is schemes that treat

people differently according to exogenous characteristics (as opposed to endogenous

behavior of how many songs to buy, given the schedule). Examples of these could, in

principle, include price discrimination by race, gender, geography, or income. It should

be noted that many such forms of price discrimination are both illegal and, at times,

morally questionable. Our exploration of this class of pricing schemes is merely aimed at

determining what classes of pricing schemes could, in principle, fulfill non-uniform

pricing’s promise of making surplus appropriable.

       Before proceeding further it makes sense to note that the vast majority of the

variation in valuations occurs between individuals as opposed to between products

(within individuals). This suggests that schemes that can divide consumers according to

their valuations will be able to extract more of their valuations as producer surplus.




                                              29
       A conceptually simple scheme is person-specific pricing. Third-degree pricing

schemes – price discriminating by type of person – are special cases, so this will give an

upper bound on the effect of such schemes on the distribution of surplus. To calculate

the person-specific profit-maximizing price, we create person-specific demand curves,

ordering their valuations from highest to lowest. We then find the maximum revenue.

The valuation associated with maximal revenue for each person is the person-specific

revenue-maximizing price. Because our parametric estimates do not include person

characteristics, we can only implement third degree price discrimination based on

observable characteristics using the raw data. Table 6 reports results for various kinds of

third degree price discrimination.

       Revenue-maximizing person-specific pricing gives rise to substantial variation in

prices. Using the 2008 data, the inter-quartile price range runs from $0.56 to $2.78.

Using 2009 data, it runs from $0.61 to $2.15.

       Person-specific pricing gives substantially more benefit to producers than do the

non-discriminatory schemes explored above. They raise revenue by two thirds using the

2008 sample and by half using the 2009 sample. This benefit to producers comes at

substantial cost to consumers: CS falls by a third relative to its value under uniform

pricing in the 2008 data and by a quarter in the 2009 data. The gains to producers under

person-specific pricing outweigh the losses to consumers, so deadweight loss falls using

both samples.

       Person-specific pricing may be difficult to implement if it’s hard to know each

individual’s demand curve a priori. This raises the question of what revenue

improvement third degree price discrimination schemes based on observable




                                             30
characteristics can achieve. To this end we use the raw data to explore schemes based on

the scant observables in our data, using the raw data: gender, ethnicity, whether a

respondent is a resident alien, and age (whether under 20). As with the parametric

approach, the raw data allow large increases in producer surplus with person-specific

prices: 81 percent for 2008 and 68 percent for 2009. But the effects of price

discrimination based on observables are small: none raise revenue more than 6 percent,

and most accomplish less. Despite the large revenue enhancing effects of individually

customized uniform prices, forms of third degree price discrimination that might more

feasibly be implemented produce only negligible revenue improvements.



8. Precision

       The results that are the main focus of this paper – the shares of surplus going to

producers and the portion foregone as deadweight loss, along with the changes in these

shares with alternatives to uniform pricing – are each statistics subject to sampling error.

This section explores the precision of our estimates.

       As mentioned above, our calculated optimal prices (and other ensuing statistics,

such as the PS shares under various pricing schemes) are each functions of the estimated

parameters of our basic statistical model (the zero-inflated multinomial lognormal

model). To get estimates of the precision of our estimates, we have re-estimated the

basic model 500 times. For the pricing schemes that allow quick calculation of optimal

prices (uniform pricing, component pricing, bundling, and person-specific pricing), we

can then calculate revenue-maximizing pricing schemes for each set of parameters.




                                             31
          Table 7 reports estimated standard errors for both the surplus shares (CS, PS, and

DWL) and the percent change in these shares relative to uniform pricing based on the 500

bootstrapped parameter estimates. The top and bottom panels report 2008 (2009)

estimates, and the surplus shares are estimated precisely. For example, the standard error

of the CS share under uniform pricing (roughly 44 percent of surplus) is 1.41 percentage

points, while the standard error of the PS share (just over a quarter) is 0.33 percentage

points.

          The latter columns report the standard errors for the percent changes in surplus

components relative to uniform pricing. As Table 2 indicated, component pricing raises

2008 PS by 2.65 percent. Table 7 indicates that the standard error for this PS

improvement is 0.33 percent. Bundling raises 2008 revenue by nearly 17 percent, and the

standard error for this improvement is 4.87 percent. Similar patterns hold for 2009.

Improvements in PS are all large relative to their standard errors. The same cannot be

said of the changes in CS and DWL.

          Table 8 focuses specifically on the improvement in PS under each scheme,

reporting the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles of the distributions of percentage PS

improvements relative to uniform pricing. For example, the table shows that in the 2008

sample, the 5th percentile increase in PS under component pricing is 2.47 percent, while

the 95th percentile improvement is 3.59 percent. The table shows that the PS increases

are rather precisely estimated.

          Although we are unable to calculate standard errors for measures surplus shares

under nonlinear pricing and two-part tariffs, we note that these schemes yield surplus




                                              32
shares – and improvements over uniform pricing – that are very similar to those achieved

by bundling, for which we can calculate measures of precision.



       V. Pareto Improving Pricing Schemes

       Within each family of prices (e.g. single price uniform pricing or two part tariffs),

each particular scheme gives rise to particular values of consumer and producer surplus.

For example, when p=0 under uniform pricing, then the entire surplus is distributed to

consumers. By contrast, as p rises, consumer surplus falls as producer surplus rises, at

least to a point. The CS and PS resulting from various uniform prices define a frontier in

PS-CS space.

       For schemes that raise PS relative to uniform pricing – bundling and related

schemes – we can look for ranges that raise both consumer and producer surplus, relative

to their values under uniform pricing. Pure bundling, which produces results nearly

identical to two part tariffs and nonlinear pricing, provides a ready example. Using the

2009 sample, we have shown that we can raise PS by 29 percent while reducing CS by 5

percent. Figure 10a depicts a locus of possible changes in PS and CS, relative to their

values under profit maximizing uniform pricing. For example, it is possible to raise PS

nearly 30 percent while holding consumers – as a group – harmless. By contrast, with a

lower bundle price, aggregate consumer surplus rises. Indeed, it is possible to raise

consumer surplus by over 50 percent while maintaining revenue at its maximized level

under uniform pricing (with a bundle price of $16.95, compared with its revenue-

maximizing value of $36.84).




                                            33
       While it is interesting that there exist bundle pricing schemes that could raise PS

while holding overall CS constant at its level under revenue-maximizing uniform pricing,

this is arguably the wrong Pareto-improvement calculation. Apple Corp. derives revenue

from selling hardware to individuals whose surplus from music buying is sufficiently

large to make the complementary hardware attractive. What matters is therefore not

aggregate CS but rather the number of persons who find their CS sufficiently large to

induce hardware purchase.

       For each potential bundle price, we can determine the share of consumers

experiencing higher CS than they would under revenue maximizing uniform pricing.

Figure 10b depicts the relationship between the percent improvement in PS (relative to

uniform pricing) and the share of consumers better off. Each point along the curve

represents a different bundle price. As the bundle price falls, producer surplus initially

rises, until we reach the profit-maximizing bundle price. As the bundle price continues to

fall below the profit-maximizing bundle price, more consumers obtain higher surplus

with the bundle than they would under uniform pricing. The revenue maximizing pure

bundling price (which lowers CS by 5 percent) makes roughly two thirds of consumers

worse off relative to their well-being under uniform pricing. But lower bundle prices,

which generate less PS, make higher shares of consumers better off. At the extreme,

nearly 80 percent of consumers could be made better off than under uniform pricing

while holding producers harmless at their uniform pricing PS. With a bundle price of

$28.55, half of consumers would be better off than under profit-maximizing uniform

pricing, and revenue would be 24.6 percent above its uniform pricing maximum. Thus,

alternatives to uniform pricing can make both sellers and most consumers better off.

VI. Conclusion

       Using survey data on individuals’ valuations of popular songs in 2008 and 2009,

we are able to directly calculate the revenue – and overall division of surplus – from

various pricing schemes. We have two major results, one positive and one negative.

       First, various alternative schemes – including simple schemes such as pure

bundling and two-part tariffs –raises producer consumer surplus by about 17 percent in

one sample and by about 30 percent in another.

       Uniform pricing delivers about a third of surplus as revenue, and while various

alternative pricing schemes can raise revenue substantially, none of the self-selecting

schemes raise revenue’s share of surplus above 37 percent. Although individual-specific

pricing – an extreme form of third degree price discrimination – raises revenue by 50

percent or more, third degree price discrimination based on available observable criteria

raises revenue very little. Hence, results based on these data indicate that even with

sophisticated pricing, much of the area under the demand curve for this product is beyond

the reach of appropriation by sellers. For products with substantial fixed costs, this

leaves open the possibility of inefficient under-provision.

       We are aware that this analysis covers a particular product and a small and

potentially unrepresentative sample of consumers. Further study with other samples and

other products can help clarify our understanding of both pricing strategy and surplus

appropriation in product markets.

Note: Based on 10 groups of 3 songs. For each group of songs and each pricing scheme,
we calculate profit-maximizing pricing on a coarse grid of possible prices that allows us
to find the best schedule for mixed bundling. We then average the results across the 10
groups of 3 songs. See text for details.

Note: The first two rows repeat the profit-maximizing schemes under uniform pricing and
pure bundling, respectively. The latter two rows explore simple mixed bundling. The
third finds an optimal bundle price, given an á la carte pricing fixed at the profit-
maximizing uniform pricing value. The last row finds unconstrained optimal á la carte
and bundle prices.

Note: The first two rows are based on exercises in which each consumer is charged his or
her profit-maximizing price, based on the data simulated from the parametric estimates
for 2008 and 2009, respectively. The remainder of the table explores third-degree price
discrimination using the raw data to allow differential pricing based on observable
characteristics of consumers.

Note: Figure shows the frontier relating producer and consumer surplus across pure
bundling schemes differing in their price. The vertical line identifies the profit-
maximizing scheme. As the price declines, the PS improvement declines, and CS
improvement increases.

Note: Figure shows the frontier relating total producer surplus with the share of
consumers better off under a bundling scheme (relative to uniform pricing) across pure
bundling schemes differing in their price. The vertical line identifies the profit-
maximizing scheme. As the price declines, the PS improvement declines, and the share
of consumers better off under the bundling scheme increases.
