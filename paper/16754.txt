                                            ABSTRACT

We survey three distinct types of financial crises which took place in the 1990s and the 2000s: 1) the
credit implosion leading to severe banking crisis in Japan; 2) The foreign reserves’ meltdown triggered
by foreign hot money flight from frothy economies with fixed exchange rate regimes of developing
Asian economies, and 3) The 2008 worldwide debacle rooted in financial institutional opacity and
reckless aggregate demand management, epi-centered in the US, that spread almost instantaneously
across the globe, mostly through international financial networks.

Financial Crises: 1990-2010

         Financial institutions, banks and shadow-banks 2 (financial institutions providing credit

through the derivative trade) are typically arbitrageurs. They borrow short at low rates, lending

money long for higher returns. Many also offer a wide range of fee generating services,

including packaging and distributing derivatives.3 Like any other business, their fortunes are

affected by fluctuations in aggregate demand and supply; flourishing in good times, and

floundering in bad. Their health in this way partly depends on the prosperity of others, but the

relationship is asymmetric because financial institutions together with monetary authorities

determine the aggregate supply of money and credit. Financial institutions are special. They are

strategically positioned to directly and indirectly lever more than most other businesses, expand

the aggregate money and credit supplies, create debt and speculatively affect stock, commodity

and real estate prices. Self-discipline and competent regulation are essential, but are too often

compromised by the lure of easy profits, and a regulatory desire to foster financial innovation.

Financial crises contract aggregate money and credit, diminish the income velocity of money,

and jeopardize the profitability, solvency and survivability of firms throughout the economy. In

the direst cases, they can wreck national economic systems (what U.S. Federal Reserve

Chairman Ben Bernanke calls "systemic risk").


3
  Derivative is a generic term for swaps, futures, options, and composites which don't have any intrinsic value
(proprietary claims to interest, dividends or asset appreciation), their worth depending derivatively on promises to
acquire, sell, swap and insure securities not yet owned. They take many forms including equity, foreign exchange,
interest, commodity, credit [credit default swaps (CDS)], mortgage backed, and packaged derivatives. Simple, or
common derivatives are called "vanilla;" more complex instruments are dubbed "exotic." Their primary purposes are
leveraging and hedging risk (e.g. traditional short sales) for personal portfolio management or speculation, but this
has broadened into "shadow banking," where large institutions use derivative instruments to manage their financial
operations. They serve legitimate business purposes, but also facilitate arbitrage as a business in itself (hedging
business), and leveraged speculation [including gambling with other people's money (Nick Leeson, Barings Bank
fiasco)]. All are traded either on exchanges, or over-the-counter, and bear "counterparty" risk as well as security risk
because "promises" can be broken. "Performance" risk is another seldom considered problem, because even if
promises are kept, ownership rights to the assets underlying derivatives like mortgage backed securities are often
obscure and unenforceable. According to the Bank for International Settlements the total notional worth of
derivatives worldwide was 684 trillion dollars in June 2008.

2
          Financial crises vary in frequency and intensity. There were three major events during the

last twenty years: the Japanese "zombie bank" debacle, the 1997 Asian financial crisis

(broadened to include Russia 1998-9, and Argentina 2001-2), and the global financial crisis of

2008. The first two were respectively local and mostly regional, the third worldwide. Two were

exacerbated by Keynesian liquidity traps, and debased sovereign debt (as tax revenues dropped

and bailout money surged) and all were severe, but none approached the 1929 Great Depression's

ferocity. They provide interesting clues about how a Black Swan catastrophe might have

unfolded,4 but are more useful for learning how to deter and mitigate future financial crises and

recessions(depressions) in perpetually changing technological, regulatory, developmental,

transitional, and psychological environments.

          This broad perspective is essential because although historical patterns are instructive,

they cannot be relied on entirely either to accurately identify causes, or predict future events.

Things never are completely the same (continuity), as human societies change, learn, adapt and

evolve.

          On one hand, recent crises have much in common with the Great Depression. All

followed asset bubbles. They started in the financial sector and gradually spread to the real

sector. During these crises, many financial institutions either defaulted or had to be bailed out.

The Japanese and 2008 global crises appear to have begun with burst bubbles that dried up credit

and drove short term interest rates toward zero.

          On the other hand, the crises of the 1990s and 2000s displayed even more differences

judged from the Great Depression benchmark. Institutions, policies, financial innovation,

globalization (versus autarkization), regulation, deregulation, floating exchange rates, and

reduced financial transparency have profoundly altered potentials, conditions, dynamics and

rules of the game. Domestically, nations have established and expanded an alphabet soup of

oversight and regulatory agencies including the 1932 Glass-Steagall Act (repealed 1999), 1933

Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the 1934 Securities and Exchange

Commission (SEC).

        Internationally, the world today is still being swept by a wave of globalization,

characterized by rapidly growing foreign trade, capital movements, technology transfer, direct

foreign investment, product and parts outsourcing, information flows, improved transport and

even increased labor mobility. This contrasts sharply with a post World War I universe in retreat

from the prewar globalization wave which began in the 1870s, and the protectionist, beggar-thy-

neighbor, isolationist and autarkic tendencies of the 1930s. The pre-Great Depression

international exchange and settlements mechanism underpinning the old regime has vanished.

The gold standard, and 1944 Bretton Woods system [which established the International

Monetary Fund (IMF), and World Bank Group] fixed, and adjustable peg exchange rate

mechanisms are no long with us, replaced since the early 1970s by flexible exchange rates

exhibiting a distinctive pattern of core-periphery relations that some describe as Bretton Woods

II.5 Free trade globalization has been evangelically promoted by the 1947 General Agreement on

Trade and Tariffs (GATT), its 1995 World Trade Organization (WTO) successor, and diverse

regional customs unions, while the IMF provided currency and crisis support, and the World

Bank development assistance. Many claim that as a consequence of these institutional advances,

emerging nations including China and India have not only been able to rapidly catch up with the

west, but in the process accelerated global economic growth above the long run historical norm,

buttressing prosperity and dampening business cyclical oscillations.

       Scholarly and governmental attitudes toward managing financial crises and their

consequences likewise bear little resemblance to those prevailing after World War I and through

the early years of the Great Depression. Back then, Say's law, and government neutrality were

gospel. What goes up must and should come down. If financial and related speculative activities

raised prices and wages excessively, it was believed that the government should let those

responsible reap what they sowed by allowing prices and wages to freely adjust downward, and

firms go belly up. There was some, but very little room for stimulatory monetary and fiscal

policy. The Keynesian revolution as it has gradually unfolded and evolved radically altered

priorities and attitudes toward macro causality and appropriate intervention. Its seminal

diagnostic contribution lay in showing the decisive roles of price rigidities, and credit crises in

causing and protracting depressions. Sometimes, depressions began when real wages were too

high, inducing output and credit to fall. On other occasions depressions were engendered by

financial crises [sharp contractions in loanable funds (credit), and consequent liquidity crises],

and then inured by "sticky wages and prices." Regardless of the sequencing, Keynes claimed that

two gaps, the first a supply shock, the second impairments of the Walrasian automatic wage and

price adjustment mechanism (invisible hand), created double grounds for fiscal intervention.

Policymakers accordingly made the restoration of full employment and economic recovery their

priorities, dethroning neutrality in favor of activist fiscal and supportive monetary intervention.

Where once it was resolutely believed that eradicating anticompetitive practices and empowering

the market were the best strategies for coping with financial crises and their aftermaths,

Keynesians, neo-Keynesians and post-Keynesians all now believe that fighting deflation and



5
stimulating aggregate effective demand are highest goods, even if this means rescuing those who

cause crises in the first place, and tolerating other inefficiencies. These attitudes are epitomized

by Ben Bernanke's unflagging commitment to bail out any institution that poses a "systemic

threat," and to print as much money as it takes [quantitative easing(QE)],6 while governments

around the world push deficit spending to new heights(sometimes passively due to unexpected

slow economic and tax revenue growth), tempered only by looming sovereign debt crises. They

also are evident in growth accelerating excess demand strategies, and prosperity promoting

international trade expansion initiatives.

           This characterization of novel aspects of the post Great Depression order would have

been complete two decades ago, but is no longer because it conceals a penchant among

policymakers to square the circle. Governments today are intent on restoring aspects of pre-Great

Depression laissez-faire, including the financial sector liberalization and decontrol, at the same

time they press disciplined, globally coordinated monetary and fiscal intervention. One can

imagine an optimal regime where regulatory, simulative, and laissez-faire imperatives are

perfectly harmonized, but not the reality. Consequently, the most novel aspect of the 1990s and

2000s may well be the emergence of a global economic management regime built on

contradictory principles that can be likened to stepping full throttle on the accelerator, while

intermittently and often simultaneously slamming on the regulatory brakes.

           Which subsets of these factors, including the null subset appear to best explain the

Japanese, Asian and 2008 world financial crises and their aftermaths? Let us consider each event

separately, and then try to discern larger, emerging patterns.

           Japan was lashed by a speculative tornado 1986-91, commonly called the baburu keiki

(bubble economy). It was localized, brief, and devastating, with allegedly paralytic consequences

often described as ushiwanareta junen (two lost decades). The phenomenon was a selective price

bubble, disconnected from low and decelerating GDP inflation, as well as more vigorous, but

diminishing rates of aggregate economic growth converging asymptotically toward zero, or

worse (1982-2010). The bubble was most conspicuously manifested in rabid land and stock

prices speculation, but also affected Japanese antiques and collectibles (like high quality native

ceramics and lacquer ware). The Nikkei 225(Neikei Heikin Kabuka) stock market index rose

from below 7,000 in the early 1980s to 38,916 on December 29, 1989, plummeted to 30,000

seven months later, continuing to fall with fits and starts thereafter before reaching a 27 year low

March 10, 2009 at 7,055. It currently (January 2011) hovers around 10,000. At its height, Japan's

stock market capitalization accounted for 60 percent of the planetary total, now its worth is a

pale shadow of its former glory. The real estate story was similar. Condo prices increased 140

percent between 1987 and 1991, on top of already globally sky high values, then plummeted 40

percent by 1994.7 At the bubble's apex, the value of a parcel of land near the Emperor's Tokyo

imperial palace equaled that of California. By 2004, prime "A" property in Tokyo's financial

district had slumped to less than 1 percent of its peak, with the total destruction of paper wealth

mounting into the tens of trillions of dollars. The speculative frenzy, predictably ended badly, but

also displayed uniquely Japanese characteristics.

           Its technical cause was financial; an institutional willingness to accommodative finance

domestic hard asset speculation in lieu of low, zero and even negative returns on business

investment and consumer savings accounts. Corporations and households having piled up

immense idle cash balances during the miraculous "Golden Sixties," and subsequent prosperity

through 1985,8 encouraged to believe that the best was yet to come despite diminishing returns to

industrial investment, seized on stock and real estate speculation as the next great investment

frontier. They succumbed to what savvy Wall Streeters call a "bigger pig" mentality, persuading

themselves that fortunes were at their finger tips because whatever price little pigs paid today for

stocks, real estate and collectibles, there always would be bigger pigs tomorrow willing to pay

more. Banks capitulating to the frenzy began binge lending; rationalizing that clients always

would be able to repay interest and principle from their capital gains, until one fine day they

ruefully discovered that there were no bigger pigs at the end of the rainbow. This epiphany,

coupled with a panic driven free fall in assets values and capitalization, left bankers both in a

predicament and a quandary.

        The predicament was that slashed asset values by regulatory rule required them to

contract loan activity, and force borrowers to meet their interest and principal repayment

obligations even if this meant driving clients into bankruptcy. The quandary was that Japanese

cultural ethics strongly proscribe maximizing bank profits at borrowers' expense.9 Through thick

and thin, Japanese are trained from birth to communally support each other, subordinating

personal utility and profit seeking to the group's wellbeing. Watching out first for number one is

never the right thing to do, as it is in competitive, individualistic societies. Tough love isn't an

option; burden sharing is the only viable course,10 which in this instance meant refusing to "mark

capitalizations to market," seeking government assistance, and stalling for time hoping that with

patience, clients' financial health eventually would be restored. This judgment wasn't wrong.

Japanese corporations operating under the same cultural obligation immediately began

earmarking revenues from current operations for debt reduction at the expense of new capital

formation, and refrained from new borrowings to cover the gap. Banks for their part, not only

maintained the fiction that outstanding loans were secure, but provided cash for current corporate

operations and consumer loans at virtually no cost above the bare minimum for bank survival.

Moreover, they kept their lending concentrated at home, instead of seeking higher returns

abroad.

          These actions averted the broader calamities that typically accompany financial crises.

Japan didn't swoon into hyper depression (GDP never fell, growing 1.7 percent per annum 1990-

93),11 or experience mass involuntary unemployment. The country wasn't swept by a wave of

bankruptcies. There was no capital flight, sustained yen depreciation, deterioration in consumer

welfare,12 or civil disorder. There was no need for temporary government deficit spending, long

term "structural deficits," "quantitative easing," comprehensive financial regulatory reforms or

high profile criminal prosecutions. Interest rates already were low, and although the government

did deficit spend, arguably it didn't matter in a Keynesian universe because Japanese industrial

workers in large companies were employed for life (shushin koyo). For pedestrians on hondori

(Main Street) who blinked, it seemed as if nothing had happened at all beyond a moment of

speculative insanity.

          However, matters look very differently to western macro theorists and Japanese

policymakers, particularly those who erroneously believe that structural deficits, and loose

monetary policy are the wellsprings of sustainable rapid aggregate economic growth(as distinct

from recovery). Their prescription for Japan's "toxic asset" problem was to bite the bullet, endure

the pain, and move on swiftly to robust, ever expanding prosperity. Given ideal assumptions,

biting the bullet is best because it doesn't sacrifice the greater good of maximizing long term

social welfare for the lesser benefits of short term social protection. Advocates contend that the

Japanese government fundamentally erred in condoning bank solicitude for the plight of

endangered borrowers, and abetting banks with external assistance because these actions

transformed otherwise healthy institutions into "zombie banks"(the living dead),13 unable to play

their crucial role in bankrolling investment, technology development and fast track economic

growth.

         Their claim has some disputed merit,14 but also is seriously incomplete. More ails Japan

than "zombie banks," deflation, the "liquidity trap" Paul Krugman conjectured in the 1990s,15



13
   Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap contend the zombie banks crowd the market and the resulting congestion has real
effects on the healthy firms in the country. They find the cumulative distortionary impact of investment and
employment to be substantial. See Ricardo J. Caballero, Takeo Hoshi and Ail K. Kashyap, “Zombie Lending and
Depressed Restructuring in Japan,” NBER Working paper No.12129, April 2006, revised September 2007. Cf.

Japan," REITI Discussion Paper, 2008. For a detailed historical review of the Japanese banking crisis see: Akihiro

Fund Working paper, January 2000.

   Hideaki Miyajima and Yishay Yafeh, "Japan's Banking Crisis: An Event-Study Perspective, "Journal of Banking
and Finance, 2007. The authors find that small, undercapitalized firms were the primary victims of the credit
crunch. These firms contribute little to Japanese productivity growth, undercutting the claim that the financial crisis
caused Japan's two lost decades.
15
   Paul Krugman contends that after Japan's bubble burst savings rose (consumption collapsed) and the natural
interest rate (needed for full employment general equilibrium) turned negative, the money interest rate reached the
lower bound of zero, rendering monetary policy impotent. The actual real interest rate immediately after the crash
and for decades to come often was slightly positive; the combined effect of modestly falling prices(due partly to
collapsed demand and retail liberalization in an otherwise keiretsu price-fixed environment), and a zero money
interest rate. This created a small Keynesian output gap(albeit with negligible unemployment) that was addressed
with fiscal deficit spending, but it is still possible to argue that deflation and a "liquidity trap" kept, and still keep
Japan's GDP and employment below its full competitive potential. Krugman contends that Japan's "liquidity trap"
was the first manifested since the Great Depression, and sends a signal to monetary authorities like Ben Bernanke to
be alert to the danger. He recommends that Japan's and America's output gaps should be closed with quantitative
easing (central bank purchase of medium and long term government securities) and nurtured inflationary
expectations through a Phillip's mechanism. The suggestion is sound in principle (albeit controversial) for
contemporary America. Japan's institutions prevent its economy from attaining natural output levels. There may be a
gap between Japan's achieved and potential institutionally constrained GDP, but it's impossible to reliably measure
these gaps. See Paul Krugman, "It's Baaack: Japan's Slump and the Return of the Liquidity Trap," Brookings Papers
on Economic Activity, Vol.1998, No.2, 1998, pp.137-205. Paul Krugman, "How Much of the World is in a Liquidity
Trap," New York Times, March 17, 2010. Cf. Joseph Stiglitz, "New 600B Stimulus Fuels Fears of US Currency
Wars," Democracy Now, November 5, 2010. Cf. Masahiko Aoki and Gary Saxonhouse, Finance, Governance and

allegations of faulty banking policy,16 and the hangover from the excesses of accommodatively

financed stock market and real estate speculation. Stock market and real estate values

denominated in yen are where they were three decades ago, while prices elsewhere across the

globe have soared. Japan is more competitive on inflation and exchange rate adjusted basis

against much of the world than it was in 1990. Moreover, the government has ceaselessly

pursued a zero interest, loose money policy, in tandem with high deficit spending that has raised

national debt to 150 percent of GDP. If Japan's growth retardation were really primarily due to

insufficient "zombie banks" business credit, government stimulus should have mitigated much of

the problem.

        There is a better explanation for Japan's two lost decades that has little to do with two

concurrent, and isolated speculative incidents, one in the stock market, the other in real estate

with scant sustained effects on production and employment. The advantages of Japan's postwar

recovery and modernizing catch up diminished steadily in the 1980s and were fully depleted by

1990, when its per capita GDP hit 81 percent of the American level. Thereafter, Japan's

culturally imposed, anticompetitive restrictions on its domestic economic activities became

increasing pronounced, causing its living standard to diminish to 73 percent of America's norm.17

Japan, at the end of the 1980s was poised to fall back, with or without a financial crisis, and it is

in this sense that the two lost decades are being erroneously blamed on the bubble, and its

"zombie banking" aftermath.18 Yes, there were eye-popping speculative stock market and real

estate price busts, but they weren't the national economic debacles they are usually painted to be,

either in the short or intermediate term.

         This interpretation raises a larger issue that cannot yet be resolved, but nonetheless is

worth broaching. Does Japan's fate, presage China's future? When the advantages of catch up are

depleted, its population grays,19 and the delusion of permanent miraculous growth subsides, will

the end of days be punctuated with a colossal, accommodatively financed speculative bust,

followed by uncountable lost decades? Perhaps not, but still it is easy to see how history may

repeat itself.

The 1997 Asian Financial Crisis and Out of Region Spillovers

         The Asian financial crisis which erupted in 1997 was a foreign capital flight induced

money and credit implosion.20 It began as a run on Asian banks by foreign short term depositors,

and expanded into an assault on government foreign currency reserves, sending shock waves as

far as Russia's and Argentina's shores.21 Banks were decimated by acute insolvency. They didn't

have the cash on hand to cover mass withdrawals of short term deposits because these funds and

been lent long, sparking asset fire sales, slashed capitalizations and credit and money
19
    Japan's population growth had slowed noticeably by 1990, was still positive when its financial crisis hit. Deaths
first began exceeding births in 2007, and the trend won't be swiftly reversed. Demographers are currently forecasting
that more than one in three Japanese will be over 65 in 2055, with the working age cohort falling by over a third to
52 million. Immigration could alleviate the pressure, but the Japanese are resolutely opposed to it because of
unvoiced fears of being inundated by the Chinese. The long term demographic prospect for China, including the
possibility for expanded immigration mimics the Japanese pattern due to Deng Xiaoping's one child per family
policy, and xenophobia. See Nicholas Eberstadt, "China's One-Child Mistake," Wall Street Journal, September 17,

contractions, which in turn triggered widespread business failures, depressions and mass

unemployment. Thailand's GDP plummeted 8 percent, Indonesia's 14 percent and South Korea's

6 percent 1997-98.22 Foreign capital flight(repatriation of short term deposits), compounded by

insufficient government foreign currency reserves, soon compelled steep devaluations that

increased import costs, reduced "command national income,"(domestic purchasing power

including "command" over foreign imports), disordered balance sheets, and otherwise

diminished real national consumption.

        These events, unlike Japan's financial crisis eight years earlier, were triggered by foreign

capital flight rather than domestic stock and real estate meltdowns, and weren't quarantined. The

crisis started in Thailand, spreading rapidly to Indonesia, South Korea, Hong Kong,23 Malaysia,

and the Philippines, with lesser reverberations in India, Taiwan, Singapore, and Brunei, but

fledgling market communist regimes in China, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia were spared runs

on their banks and foreign currency reserves by stringent state banking and foreign exchange

controls. They experienced secondary shocks from diminished regional economic activity, but

otherwise escaped unscathed.

        The root cause of the runs on Asia's banks and foreign reserves lay in foreign financed

Asian economic development, and east-west interest rate differentials. After World War II Asia

became a magnet for both foreign direct and portfolio investment, driving foreign debt-to-GDP

ratios above 100 percent in the four large ASEAN economies (Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and

the Philippines) 1993-1996, and local asset market prices to soar(real estate and stocks). Rapid,

near double digit GDP growth contributed to the asset boom, inspiring confidence that

investments were safe because Asia's miracles were expected to continue for the foreseeable

time, Asia's high interest rates attracted the "carry trade;" short term borrowing of low yielding

currencies like the Japanese yen, and their subsequent short term investment in high yielding

foreign bank deposits and similar liquid debt instruments. Short term "hot" money(including

large sums from Japanese financial institutions searching for positive returns on near money

instruments well after Japan's financial crisis ended) poured into the region, creating what

increasingly came to be perceived as a pan-Asian bubble economy, exacerbated by "crony

capitalism,"25 severe political corruption and instability(especially Thailand, Malaysia and

Indonesia).

         Foreign investors steeled by their faith in Asian miracles at first weren't perturbed by the

frothiness of the orient's markets, but the swelling bubble, compounded by surging current

account trade deficits undermined their confidence. Speculators, hot money carry traders, and

other investors gradually grasped that the high returns they were reaping could be wiped out by

catastrophic devaluations, and began planning for the worst, realizing that those who fled early

would preserve their wealth; those who dallied would be left holding an empty bag. The

incentive to flee was increased further by developments outside the region. America's Federal

Reserve Chairman, Alan Greenspan began nudging U.S. interest rates higher to deter inflation,

creating an attractive safe haven for hot money hedging, made more appealing by the prospect of

an appreciating dollar.

  Crony capitalism is a vague term often used to describe market economies, especially in the Third World, where
business depends heavily on patronage in closed privileged networks of officials, relatives and friends that thrive
even though under other circumstances their companies would fail the competitive test. These systems are
considered morally hazardous, corrupt, inefficient and ripe for disaster. See. T.J. Tempel, ed., The Politics of the
Asian Economic Crisis, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1999.

        The precise combination of factors that ignited full throttle capital flight is open to

dispute. Southeast Asian export growth dramatically slowed in the Spring of 1996, aggravating

current account deficits. China started to out compete its regional rivals for foreign directly

invested loanable funds. The domestic asset bubble began to pop with stock and land prices in

retreat, forcing large numbers of firms to default on their debts. No doubt for these and many

other reasons including asymmetric information,26 opacity, corrupt corporate governance, and

"crony capitalism;" foreign investors rushed for the exits in early 1997, symbolically culminating

in the Thai government's decision on July 2, 1997 to abandon its fixed exchange rate, allowing

the value of its baht to "freely" float. Over the course of the next year, the Baht's value fell 40

percent. The Indonesian, Philippine, Malaysia and South Korean currencies swiftly followed

suit, declining respectively 83, 37, 39 and 34 percent.

        Devaluation, stock and real estate market crashes, bankruptcies, mass unemployment,

wilted interest rates, and heightened risk aversion dissolved the fundamental disequilibria that

had beset the region before the fall, only to be immediately replaced by urgent new priorities.

Downward spirals had to be arrested, economies stabilized, and steps taken not only to achieve

rapid recovery, but to foster structural changes supporting long term modernization and growth.

Thai economic planners and their counterparts elsewhere in the region had a coherent overview

of what needed to be done (mundane partisan squabbles aside), but unlike the Japanese seven

years earlier, sought external foreign assistance from the International Monetary Fund, the World

Bank, the Asian Development Bank and individual nations including China to finance balance of

payments deficits and facilitate structural adjustment. Japan didn't run a current account deficit

during its crisis, didn't need foreign exchange rate support, nor structural adjustment assistance

funding, and so relied entirely on its own resources, whereas the dependency of noncommunist

developing Asia on the developed west was placed in stark relief. The region of course could

have gone it alone; however its aspirations for fast track convergence, and counter crisis stimulus

were clearly tied to its integration into the global financial system, and perhaps acceptance of

some bad IMF conditionality as the price for the good.

         Much ink has been split over whether Washington Consensus style monetary and fiscal

stringency, combined with mandated economy opening structural reforms imposed by the

International Monetary Fund helped or harmed Asia.27 This issue is important, but only so for

present purposes insofar as structural reforms increased or diminished the likelihood of future

crises. The evidence to date on balance, despite strong claims to the contrary, favors the regional

decision to follow the IMF's tough love advice. Asia accepted fiscal austerity and monetary

restraint. It liberalized, amassed large foreign currency reserves, maintained floating exchange

rates and prospered. After enduring a protracted and perhaps excessively painful period of

adjustment, Asia not only resumed rapid growth within the IMF's framework, but when push

came to shove in 2008, weathered the global financial shock wave better than most. It appears

that although global financial liberalization does pose clear and present speculative dangers as

IMF critics contend, the risks can be managed with prudence and discipline.28


27
   The term Washington Consensus was coined by John Williamson in 1989 to describe ten standard reforms
advocated in Washington DC for ameliorating crises and promoting sustainable growth in developing countries.
These reforms include fiscal discipline, structural investments (in education, etc.), tax rationalization, market
determined interest rates, competitive exchange rates, trade liberalization, privatization, deregulation and rule of
law. See John Williamson, "What Washington Means by Policy Reform," in Williamson, ed., Latin American
Adjustment: How Much Has Happened?, Washington DC: Institute of International Economics, 2002. Cf. Paul

         Some have suggested that Russia provides a cogent counter Washington Consensus

example because having liberalized after its own financial crisis in 1997, and recovered, its

economy was crushed by the 2008 financial crisis. The claim however is misleading on a variety

of grounds. There simply are too many dissimilarities for the Russian case to be persuasive.

Unlike Asia, Russia was mired in hyper depression when it defaulted on its sovereign Euro

denominated debt in 1997. It never received significant sums of direct and/or hot money inflows

into the private sector during the Yeltsin years, had a floating peg exchange rate, and received no

IMF support after the ruble collapsed. Consequently, it is fatuous to lump Russia into the same

basket with Asia.29 Asia's and Russia's systems and contexts are too disparate for them to be

pooled. The same argument for different reasons applies to Argentina 1999-2001. Russia's and

Argentina's crises were both linked to sovereign debt issues, but their problematic, and roles

within the global economic and financial system place them in separate categories.

         Clarity in this regard is essential for gauging the Asian financial crisis's historical

significance. Some like Niall Ferguson contend that Asia's financial crisis was the first tremor of

the second globalization age that emerged after the Bretton Woods international monetary and

that really links Russia's 1998 financial crisis to Asia's is the demonstration effect. When the Asian bubble burst July
1997, Europeans started to reassess Russia's creditworthiness, after being assured by Anders Aslund, the IMF,
World Bank and the G-7 that Russia had become a "capitalist market economy" on the road to recovery. The real
story is that Yeltsin officials after scamming their own people innumerable times including the infamous 1996
"Loan for Shares" swindle of the millennium, began a massive issue of GKO (Gosudarstvennoye Kratsrochoye
Obyazatel'stvo; government short term obligations) designed to entice foreign hot money by paying 150 percent
interest, at a time when it could not cover its budgetary expenses with tax revenues hopelessly in arrears. Yeltsin
insiders knew that the obligations couldn't be met, but also saw opportunities for self-enrichment and played the
situation that way. They secured a 22.6 billion IMF rescue package on July 13, swapping GKOs for long-term
Eurobonds to string the process out, before finally repudiating their GKO and Euro-denominated obligations, and
abruptly devaluing on August 17, 1998. In the Asian case, foreign capital fled because private sector risks had
increased. By contrast, in the Russian case it fled because carry traders realized that the Russian government was
intent on ripping them off. The only question was when, not if, the Kremlin would strike. See Marshall Goldman,

financial order collapsed in the late 1970s, early 1980s; weakly implying that future crises will

mimic Asia's experience.30 This is implausible. Asia's crisis provides an object lesson on the

broad danger posed to a wide variety of economies in various stages of economic development

by overly exuberant international financial liberalization, but doesn't offer a blueprint about how

things must unfold.31

The 2008 Financial Crisis and Subsequent Great Recession

         The origins of the 2008 financial crisis can be traced to various milestones in the

construction of the post World War American economy. During the 1950s, Keynesianism

became orthodox at the same time momentum built to rescind sundry New Deal and wartime

restrictions on free enterprise including wage-price controls, and fair trade retail pricing (Miller-

Tydings Act 1937; McGuire Act 1952, both rescinded in 1975 by the Consumer Goods Price

Act). Deregulation in rail, truck and air transportation during the 1970s, ocean transport in the

1980s, natural gas and petroleum sectors 1970-2000, and telecommunications in the 1990s

created opportunities for asset value speculation, soon facilitated by complementary deregulation

initiatives in the financial sector. The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control

Act of 1980 (DIDMCA), and Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act(1982) both increased

the scope of permissible bank services, fostered mergers, facilitated collusive pricing, and

relaxed accounting rules(Moody's for example is permitted to accept fees from insurers it rates).

Beginning in the early nineties banks shifted from the direct loan business to packaging and

marketing novel debt instruments like mortgage-backed securities(ultimately including subprime

loans) to other financial institutions, and shortly thereafter President William Jefferson Clinton

   The rebirth of financial globalization and the possibility of serial crises of increasing intensity evokes memories of
Rudolf Hilferding's Marxist classic Das Finanzkapital, 1910, but the fit is inexact because Hilferding stressed the
international capitalist concentration of financial power, rather than the competitive variety evident today.

approved the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act(1999) enhancing business flexibility. Glass Steagall had

compartmentalized banks, prohibiting those engaged in stable businesses like mortgages and

consumer loans from participating in riskier stock brokerage, insurance, commercial and

industrial activities with the intention of building a firewall against speculative contagion. Its

repeal ushered in an era of financial merger mania across old divisional lines, allowing

companies like Citicorp and Travelers Group to unite.

           These developments, replicated across much of the globe, were all positive from the

standpoint of neoclassical microeconomic theory because they enhanced competitive efficiency,

with the proviso that moral hazards and speculative abuses were optimally contained by residual

regulations ("liberalization"). However, if residual "laissez-faire"(do whatever you want)

regulations were inadequate, then ensuing financial crisis costs could easily outweigh

deregulatory efficiency gains.

           Clearly, there are legitimate grounds for suspecting deregulatory involvement in the 2008

global financial crisis, but it isn't the only suspect. The financial environment also was placed in

jeopardy by revisionist Keynesianism. John Maynard Keynes was an apostate monetarist who

devised and spread the counter-depressionary gospel of deficit fiscal spending in his General

Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.32

           He contended that the Great Depression had been caused by deficient aggregate effective

demand brought about by negative income effects, prolonged by a liquidity trap and claimed that

full employment could be easily restored by offsetting private hoarding (speculative idle cash

balances) with government expenditure programs(deficit financed state procurements and

programs). Other things equal, Keynes insisted competitive markets could and would achieve

perpetual full employment, if it weren't for income (multiplier) effects, and this destabilizing

force could be overcome without inflation through countercyclical government deficit spending

and countervailing surpluses. There was no place in Keynes's universe for continuously

mounting "structural deficits," sovereign debt and/or "managed" inflation that could feed

speculation and cause financial crises.

        Nonetheless, immediately after World War II, the U.S. government passed the

Employment Act of 1946 prioritizing the attainment and maintenance of full employment

(further codified and expanded in the Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, 1978). The law

didn't fix quantitative targets, but marked the Truman administration's expansion of federal

powers to include macroeconomic administration, management and regulation, without explicit

constitutional sanction, and established the Council of Economic Advisors to aid presidential

policymaking, as well as the Joint Economic Committee of Congressmen and Senators to review

executive policies.

        These actions enabled Washington to go beyond the perimeters of Keynesian orthodoxy,

whenever full employment could not be sustained with trans-cyclically balanced federal budgets.

The exclusion remained moot throughout much of the 1950s until William Phillips discovered,33

and Paul Samuelson popularized the notion that full employment could only be maintained with

"excess" monetary and/or fiscal stimulation accompanied by inflationary side-effects (Phillip's

Curve). Keynes, many concluded was almost right. Deficit spending was essential, but it also

should be applied no matter how much inflation it generates to secure the higher goal of full

employment. Full employment zealots insist that governments are "morally" obliged to deficit

spend forever, a position still widely maintained despite Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps

United Kingdom 1861-1957," Economica, 25(100), pp.283-299.

20
demonstrations that Phillips was wrong in the medium and long runs by omitting inflationary

expectations. .

       The orthodox Keynesian straitjacket was loosened further by Walter Heller, Chairman of

President John Kennedy's Council of Economic Advisors, 1961-64, who introduced across the

board tax cuts as a counter-recessionary stimulus, even though this meant creating credit not just

for investment, but for consumption as well. Keynes's employment and income multiplier theory

required stimulating investment as the only legitimate method for combating deficient aggregate

effective demand [Works Projects Administration 1932(WPA) providing 8 million jobs, and later

investment tax credits]. He argued that new investment creates new jobs, wages, and derivatively

increases consumption, whereas deficit consumption spending via diminished marginal

propensities to consume merely transfers purchasing power from one recipient to another,

without increasing employment. Heller's revisionism brushed Keynes's concerns aside, making it

possible for politicians to claim that any deficit spending which benefited them and their

constituents would stimulate aggregate economic activity and employment, including

intertemporal income transfers from one consumer's pocket tomorrow to the next today.

       This logic was extended by falsely contending that deficit spending and expansionary

monetary policy accelerate long term economic growth. Although, there are no grounds for

claiming that structural deficits and lax monetary policy accelerate scientific and technological

progress (the ultimate source of sustainable economic growth), policymakers couldn't resist the

temptation to assert that deficit spending and inflation are indispensible for maximizing current

and future prosperity. The ploy has been successful as a political tactic, making deficits and

inflation seem more palatable, but also has widened the door to compounding past abuses by




21
upping the ante whenever the economy sours. Policymakers’ reflex isn't to retrench, but to do

more of what caused problems in the first place.

        Academic macroeconomists likewise succumbed to wishful thinking, brushing aside the

speculative momentum embedded in postwar institutional liberalization and fiscal indiscipline.

Influenced by Robert Lucas, and Phil Kidland and Edward Prescott34, the conventional wisdom

2000-2008 came to hold that business cycle oscillations were primarily caused by productivity

shocks that lasted until price- and wage-setters disentangled real from nominal effects. These

shocks sometimes generated inflation which it was believed was best addressed with monetary

policy. Accordingly, central bankers were tasked with the mission of maintaining slow and

stable, Phillips Curve compatible inflation. Although, central bankers were supposed to be less

concerned with real economic activity, many came to believe that full employment and two

percent inflation could be sustained indefinitely by "divine coincidence."35 This miracle was said

to be made all the better by the discovery that real economic performance could be regulated

with a single monetary instrument, the short term interest rate. Happily, arbitrage across time

meant that central bankers could control all temporal interest rates, and arbitrage across asset

classes implied that the U.S. Federal Reserve could similarly influence risk adjusted rates for

diverse securities. Fiscal policy, which had ruled the roost under the influence of orthodox

Keynesianism from 1950-80 in this way, was relegated to a subsidiary role aided by theorists'

beliefs in the empirical validity of Ricardian equivalence arguments, and skepticism about lags

and political priorities. The financial sector likewise was given short shift, but this still left room

   The term refers to situations where stabilizing inflation is the same as stabilizing output.

22
for other kinds of non-monetary intervention. The consensus view held that automatic stabilizers

like unemployment insurance should be retained to share risks; that are to assist in case there

were any unpredictable shocks. Commercial bank credit similarly continued to be regulated, and

federal deposit insurance preserved to deter bank runs, but otherwise finance was lightly

supervised; especially "shadow banks", hedge funds and derivatives.

       A similar myopia blinded many to the destabilizing potential of Chinese state controlled

foreign trading. As postwar free trade gained momentum, liberalizers not only grew increasingly

confident that competitive commerce was globally beneficial, but that trade expansion of any

kind increased planetary welfare. Consequently, few were perturbed after China's admission to

the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 either by the conspicuous undervaluation of the

renminbi (RMB) fixed to support export-led development, or by Beijing's ever mounting dollar

reserves. It was assumed that even if China overexported (at the expense of foreign importables

jobs), this would be offset by employment gains in the exportables sector as China increased its

import purchases. "Overtrading" as theory teaches is suboptimal, but not seriously harmful to

aggregate employment and has the compensatory virtue of expanding international commerce.

       However, a fly spoiled the ointment. The Chinese (and some others like Brazil) chose to

hold idle dollar reserve balances (hoard), instead of importing as much as they exported.

Beijing's dollar reserves grew from 250 billion in 2001 to 2.6 trillion in 2010. In a perfectly

competitive universe this wouldn't matter because others would borrow these unused funds, but

not so in a Keynesian world were rigidities of diverse sorts transform idle cash balances into

deficient aggregate effective demand, and simultaneously serve as a vehicle for financial hard

asset speculation. For reasons that probably involve the Chinese Communist Party's desire to

protect privileged producers in both its domestic importables and exportables sectors (implicit,



23
stealth "beggar-thy-neighbor" tactics), Beijing became an immense source of global real and

financial sector disequilibrium, contributing both to the 2008 financial crisis and its aftermath.

Chinese leaders in its state controlled foreign trade system had, and have the power to reset the

renminbi exchange rate, and increase import purchases, but they chose, and are still choosing to

do neither.36

         The cornerstones of 2008 financial crisis in summary are: 1) an evolving deregulatory

consensus, 2) a mounting predilection for excess deficit spending, 3) a penchant for imposing

political mandates on the private sector like subprime mortgage, student loan lending, and excess

automobile industry health benefits which drove GM and Chrysler into bankruptcy in 2009, 4)

waning concern for labor protection manifest in stagnant real wages and therefore flagging mass

consumption demand,[shift towards promoting the security of other social elements] 5) a

proclivity to prioritize full employment over inflation, 6) the erroneous belief that structural

deficits promote accelerated economic growth, 7) the notion that government insurance

guarantees, off budget unfunded obligations like social security, and mandated preferences to

savings and loans banks were innocuous, despite the 160 billion dollar savings and loans debacle

of the late 1980-1990s, 8) deregulatory myopia, and activists social policy, including the

encouragement of subprime loans, adjustable rate mortgages(ARM), and tolerance of finance

based credit expansion which flooded the globe with credit,37 9) lax regulation of post-Bretton

   Subprime mortgages involved loans to people likely to encounter difficulty maintaining their repayment
schedules. ARMS allowed homeowners to borrow inexpensively, but obligated them to pay more if interest rates
rose. Additionally, during the new millennium it was common for banks to waive down payments, enabling
"owners" to walk away from their properties when housing prices (and values) fell, leaving banks with an huge
inventory of bankruptcy repossessions and distressed sales. The Clinton Administration pushed subprime lending.
The value of U.S. subprime mortgages in 2007 was 1.3 trillion dollars. In an inflationary environment, driven in part
by people borrowing from their home's inflationary premium, home buying was transformed into a speculative
game. The ratio of global liquidity to global GDP quadrupled 1980-2007; doubling 2000-2007. Cross border capital
flows decupled 1990-2007 from 1.1 to 11.2 trillion dollars. Derivatives rose from virtually zero in 1990 to 684

   Debt obligations issued by nation states are called sovereign debt. Superficially, it might be supposed that
sovereign bonds are more secure than their corporate equivalents, but the reverse often is the case because under the
doctrine of sovereign immunity, countries cannot be forced to honor their obligations. Creditors only recourse is to
passively accept rescheduling, interest reductions or even repudiation. See Jonathan Eaton and Raquel Fernandez,
"Sovereign Debt," in G. Grossman and K. Rogoff, eds., Handbook of International Economics, Vol. III, Amsterdam:
Elsevier Science B.V., 1995, chapter 39. Sovereign debt initially played a subsidiary role in the 2008 financial crisis.
The collapse of Iceland's main banks, and 77 percent stock plunge in September 2008, prompted rating agencies to
drastically cut Iceland's sovereign debt rating from A+ to BBB-. The IMF arranged a rescue package November 19,
2008, but the cat was out of the bag. Suddenly, investors became aware that the global financial crisis's scope might
be much wider than earlier supposed, raising the specter of a worldwide financial collapse that wasn't reversed until
March 2009. Nonetheless, sovereign debt fears reemerged in 2010 due to credit rating reductions for Greek, Irish,
Portuguese, and Spanish sovereign debt that forced an EU to intervene in defense of these members. The rescue
involved loans for conditionality, where credit impaired sovereigns were compelled to pledge the adoption of
austerity measures reducing their "structural deficits." The problem which could easily expand to include Italy, and
others, doesn't appear to jeopardize the international financial system immediately, but is a bad omen for the future.
Additionally, many worry that if rating cuts contingent on budgetary debt reductions don't cease, it could force the
European Union to abandon the Euro as a common currency, and even result in the EU's dissolution. The root cause
of the EU's problem isn't excessive debt per se, but the ability of less productive members to run EU threatening
deficits in a common currency regime, without the option of individual country currency devaluation. See Bruno
Dallago and Chiara Guglielmetti, "The EZ in the Prospects of Global Imbalances: Two Europes?" in Steven

ownership from corporate control enabling top executives to excessively compensate themselves,

including golden parachute perks. CEOs were institutionally encouraged to gamble with

a garden variety White Swan business cyclical event. It was a long time coming, and prospects

for a repetition depend on whether underlying structural disequilibria, including political

indiscipline are redressed.45

The Shock Wave

         The defining event of the 2008 global financial crisis was a "hemorrhagic stroke;" a

paralytic implosion of the loanable funds market that seemingly brought the global monetary and

credit system to the brink of Armageddon. The September 2008 emergency was caused by the

terrifying realization that major financial institutions, especially those connected with hedge

funds couldn't cover their current obligations either with asset sales or short term bank credit

because confidence had been lost in the value of their assets, and short term lending suddenly

ceased. People everywhere were panicked at the prospect of cascading financial bankruptcies,



to large increases in trade. This is not what happened in the Euro-zone after the monetary union was established. The
key problem is building a consensus on how best to restore price equilibrium after asymmetric shocks, booms and
slumps that disparately affect individual member states. Labor mobility (Robert Mundell), fiscal integration (Peter
Kenen), a strong central bank serving as lender of last recourse, and a fiscal unit to bail out sovereign debts lubricate
equilibration, but don't automatically resolve conflicting member interests. The EU sovereign debt issue is tutoring
members about the trade-offs that must be made, if the monetary union is to survive.

   FDIC chairman William Issac places much of the blame for the subprime mortgage crisis on the SEC for its fair-
value accounting rules, misapplied in times of crisis. The Emergency Stabilization Act of 2008, signed October 7,
suspended mark to market asset pricing during crises. The new regulation is FAS 157-d.

   "Morici: Down Grade US Treasury’s to Junk" Yahoo! Finance, December 20, 2010. Peter Morici contends that
Congress and the White House made no comprise whatsoever in extending and expanding the Bush tax cuts,
including a temporary 33 percent cut in poor and middle class social security taxes, ballooning the federal deficit to
1.5 trillion dollars in 2011; to say nothing of off budget deficits ten times as large.

where the securities of failed companies contaminated the value of other assets, triggering

margin calls, shuttered credit access, lost savings, bank runs, stock market crashes, liquidity

crises, universal insolvency, economic collapse and global ruination. All crises are ominous, but

this one seemed as if it just might degenerate into a Black Swan debacle, equal to or greater than

the Great Depression of 1929. After all, the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Bank had

reassured the public that the forced sale of the "risk management" investment banking firm Bear

Stearns to JPMorgan Chase on March 24, 2008 for 5.8 percent of its prior high value had fully

solved the subprime loan, mortgage and derivative securitization threat, but subsequent events

revealed that Bear Stearn was just the tip of a potentially Titanic sinking iceberg, with American

and European banking losses 2007-2010 forecast by the International Monetary Fund to reach 1

trillion, and 1.6 trillion dollars respectively.46 An additional 4 to 5 trillion dollars are expected to

be lost through 2011, and although the Dow Jones Industrial Average fully recovered from the

September 2008 highs by December 2010, 42 percent of its value was wiped out at the stock

market crash's trough.47

        The other shoe began dropping on September 7, 2008 when the Federal National

Mortgage Association(Fannie Mae), and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation(Freddie

Mac)[specializing in creating a secondary mortgage market] were placed into conservatorship by

46
   Bear Stearns, founded in 1923 had survived the 1929 Wall Street crash, and achieved celebrity status in the new
millennium because of Lewis Ranieri's pioneering innovation of the mortgage backed securitization business. Its
problems became public in June 2007 when the company pledged a 3.2 billion dollar collateralized loan
(collateralized debt obligation: CDO) to rescue one of its hedge funds. The CDOs were thinly trade, and when Bear
Stern encountered liquidity problems, Merrill Lynch seized 850 million dollars worth, but only realized 100 million
in forced liquidation. During the week of July 16, 2007 Bear Stearns acknowledged that its two CDO supported
hedge funds had lost nearly all their value amid a rapid decline in the subprime mortgages market. On March 14,
2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York agreed to grant Bear Stearns a 25 billion dollar loan collateralized by
free and clear assets from Bear Stearn in order to provide liquidity for 28 days. The deal however was changed two
days later into a forced bailout when the Federal Reserve decided that the loan would be given to Bear Stearn's
shotgun bride, JP Morgan, enticed into the marriage by a 35 billion non-recourse Federal Reserve loan. The action
approved by Ben Bernanke, putting public money at risk, was justified by the necessity of preventing systemic
failure, and forestalling the need for further intervention.
47
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average peaked October 9, 2007 at 14,164, and bottomed March 9 at 6,470. In early
September 2008, it traded around 11,500, just where it stood at the end of 2010.

28
the Federal Housing Financing Agency after new mark to market accounting regulations(FAS

157) created havoc in the mortgage industry.48 At the time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac held 12

trillion dollars worth of mortgages.49 Three days later on September 10, 2008, the "risk

management" investment bank Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy after having failed to find

a buyer, or acquire a Federal bailout to cover a 4 billion dollar loss. Merrill Lynch finding itself

in similar dire straits was sold to the Bank of America on the same day. Six days later, the

Federal Reserve announced an 85 billion dollar rescue loan to the insurance giant American

International Group (AIG), also heavily involved in "risk management" securitization activities.

The news ignited a wave of Wall Street short selling, prompting the SEC to suspend short selling

immediately thereafter. Then on September 20 and 21, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson

and Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke appealed directly to Congress for an endorsement of

their 700 billion dollar emergency loan package designed to purchase massive amounts of sour

mortgages from distressed institutions. Forty eight hours later, Warren Buffett bought 9 percent

of Goldman Sachs, another "risk management" investment bank for 5 billion dollars to prop the

company up. On September 24 Washington Mutual became America's largest bank failure ever,

and was acquired by JPMorgan Chase for 1.9 billion.

         These cumulating disasters, exacerbated by parallel developments in Europe and many

other parts of the globe addicted to structural deficits, Phillips Curve justified inflation, financial

deregulation, asset backed mortgages, derivatives, electronic trading, and hard asset speculation

sent shock waves through the global financial system, including the withdrawal of hundreds of

billions of dollars from money market mutual funds(an aspect of the shadow banking system),


48
   Lending institutions were abruptly required to write their illiquid mortgage assets down to rapidly falling current
values, forcing them to sell securities to raise capital, and generating a vicious downward credit spiral.

   Both firms were subsequently delisted from the New York stock exchange, June 2010 because their share prices

depriving corporations of an important source of short term borrowing. The London Interbank

Offered Rate(LIBOR), the reference interest rate at which banks borrow unsecured funds from

other banks in the London wholesale money market soared, as did TED spreads[T Bills versus

Eurodollar future contracts], spiking to 4.65 percent on October 10, 2008, both indicating that

liquidity was being rapidly withdrawn from the world financial system. In what seemed like the

blink of an eye, the global financial crisis not only triggered a wave of worldwide bankruptcies,

plunging production, curtailed international trade, and mass unemployment, but morphed into a

sovereign debt crisis. Countries like Iceland, Ireland, Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain found

themselves mired in domestic and foreign debt that dampened aggregate effective demand,

spawned double digit unemployment and even raised the specter of European Union

dissolution.50

        These awesome events, together with collapsing global equity, bond and commodity

markets unleashed a frenzy of advice and emergency policy intervention aimed at stemming the

hemorrhaging, bolstering aggregate effective demand, and repairing regulatory lapses to restore

business confidence. FAS 157-d (suspension of mark to mark financial asset pricing) broke the

free fall of illiquid, mortgage backed assets valuations, offering some eventual support in resale

markets. The Emergency Stabilization Relief Act bailed out system threatening bankruptcy

candidates through emergency loans, and toxic asset purchases. FDIC savings deposits insurance

was increased from 100,000 to 250,000 dollars per account to forestall bank runs. The SEC

temporarily suspended short selling on Wall Street. The government pressured banks to postpone

foreclosures invoking a voluntary foreclosure moratorium enacted in July 2008. The Federal

Reserve and Treasury resorted to quantitative easing(essentially printing money) to bolster

liquidity and drive short term government interest rates toward zero, effectively subsidizing

financial institutions at depositors' expense. The federal government quadrupled its budgetary

deficit in accordance with Heller's neo-Keynesian aggregate demand management tactic,

concentrating on unemployment and other social transfers, instead of the direct investment

stimulation advocated by Keynes.51 Committees were formed to devise bank capital "stress

tests," coordinate global banking reform,52 improve auditing and oversight, prosecute criminal

wrong doing including Ponzi schemes (Bernard Madoff),53 and investigate regulatory reform of

derivatives and electronic trading(Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection

Act, July 2010).54 In Europe many imperiled banks were temporarily nationalized, and a series of

intra-EU austerity and rescue programs launched. In the larger global arena, the International

Monetary Fund, World Bank and others provided emergency assistance, and the deep problem of

Chinese state controlled trading was peckishly broached.

   Alan Blinder and Mark Zandi, How the Great Recession Was Brought to an End, www.economy.com/mark-
zandi/documents/End-of-Great-Recession.pdf the breakdown of the American 1 trillion dollar counter crisis fiscal
stimulus package is divisible into two baskets: spending increases ($682 billion) and tax cuts ($383 billion). The
Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 spent $170 billion. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009
disbursed another $582 billion dollars on infrastructure($147 billion; including $109 billion dollars of
"nontraditional" infrastructure); transfers to state and local governments($174 billion dollars: Medicaid $87 billion
dollars, education $87 billion dollars), transfers to persons($271 billion dollars: social security $13 billion dollars,
unemployment assistance $224 billion dollars, food stamps $10 billion dollars and Cobra payments $24 billion
dollars). Tax cuts under the 2009 act totaled $190 billion dollars, allocated to businesses ($40 billion dollars),
making work pay ($64 billion dollars), first time homebuyer tax credit ($14 billion dollars) and individuals ($72
billion dollars). Subsequently, the government also provided $55 billion dollars of extended unemployment
insurance benefits. See Table 10, p.15. More than 90 percent of the stimulus was targeted at bolstering aggregate
effective demand through transfers and tax rebates in the post 1960s Heller fashion, rather than in direct investment
assistance(traditional infrastructure, business tax credits and first time home buyer credits) as Keynes himself
recommended.

   The Dobb-Frank Act contains 16 titles, strewn with prohibitions, rules and rate fixing. It is difficult to render a
summary judgment, but has been criticized for not addressing the too big to fail issue, and indulging political at the
expense of regulatory goals.

31
           With the advantage of hindsight, it is evident the American government's Troubled Asset

Relief Program(TARP), including the "cash for clunkers" program, other deficit spending and

quantitative easing, passive acceptance of Chinese under-importing(dollar reserve hoarding),

continued indulgence of destructive speculative practices(program trading, hedge funds, and

derivatives), together with regulatory reforms and confidence building initiatives didn't cause a

Black Swan meltdown and the subsequent hyper-depression many justifiably feared. Some of

these same policies may deserve credit for fostering a recovery, tepid as it is, but also can be

blamed for persistent, near double digit unemployment, a resurgence of commodity, stock and

foreign currency speculation, and the creation of conditions for a sovereign debt crisis of biblical

proportions in the years ahead when the globe is eventually confronted with tens of trillions of

dollars of unfunded, and un-repayable obligations.55

           At the end of the day, it shouldn't be surprising that the institutionalized excess demand

disequilibrium of the American and European macroeconomic management systems would

produce some relief, even though their policies were inefficient and unjust. Financial stability is

being gradually restored, and output is increasing, but the adjustment burden has been borne

disproportionately by the unemployed, would be job entrants, small businesses, savers,

pensioners and a myriad of random victims, while malefactors including politicians and

policymakers were bailed out. Moreover, the mentality and institutions which created the crisis

in the first place remain firmly in command. Incredibly, the Obama administration under cover

of the Frank-Dobb Act already has begun mandating a massive expansion of the very same

subprime loans largely responsible for the 2006 housing crisis and the 2008 financial debacle

that swiftly ensued.56 This action and others like it will continue putting the global economy

squarely at Black Swan risk until academics and policymakers prioritize financial stability over

parochial, partisan, ideological and venal advantage.57

        The 2008 financial crisis also has placed macroeconomic theory in a quandary. The

"divine coincidence" is now seen for the pipedream that it was, but there is no new consensus to

replace it other than the pious hope that structural deficits, loose monetary policy and better

financial regulation (aggregate demand management) will foster prosperity no matter how

irresponsibly politicians, policymakers, businessmen, financial institutions, special interests and

speculators behave.58 Worse still, there seems to be little prospect that a constructive consensus

soon will emerge capable of disciplining contemporary societies for the greater good by

promoting optimal efficiency, growth and economic stability. The global economy is flying

blind, propelled by a disequilibrium mentality (some say herd mentality) that spells trouble ahead

with scant hope for learning by doing. Most players seem to believe that contemporary monetary

and fiscal management, combined with better financial regulation will work well enough, but

they appear to be conflating wishful thinking with economic science.

   Peter Wallison and Edward Pinto, "How the Government is Creating Another Bubble," AEI Articles and
Commentary, December 27, 2010. Wallison and Pinto contend that the Dobb-Frank Act allows the administration to
substitute the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as the principal and
essentially unlimited provider of subprime mortgage, at taxpayers’ expense. Since the 2008 government takeover of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises' regulator has restricted them to purchasing
high quality mortgages, with affordable housing requirements mandated in 1992 relaxed. This reduces the future
risk, but the good is entirely negated by shunting the old destructive practices to the FHA on the pretext of
supporting the soundness of the entire mortgage industry. The gambit in the usual way, allows the administration to
present a prudent face with regard to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, while diverting attention from the 400 billion
dollar loss previously racked up by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and recklessly reprising the Housing and Urban
Development Administration’s (HUD) prior destructive policies. Peter J. Wallison, Alex Pollock and Edward Pinto,
"Taking the Government Out of Housing Finance: Principles for Reforming the Housing Finance Market, AEI
Online, January 20, 2011. Wallison, Pollock and Pinto report that the US government sponsored 27 million
subprime and Alt-policies. To correct the situation they recommend that the government get out of the housing
finance business. Government regulation should be restricted to ensuring mortgage credit quality. Assistance to low-
income families should be on-budget. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be privatized.

Prospects

        A great deal of water has flowed under the bridge in the past two decades. There were

three distinct types of financial crisis: 1) a domestic money and credit implosion, where foreign

direct investment and hot money played no significant role (Japan); 2) an insolvency and foreign

reserves meltdown triggered by foreign hot money flight from frothy economies with fixed

exchange rate regimes (developing Asian), where domestic speculative excesses were partly

linked with foreign direct investment, and 3) a worldwide debacle rooted in reckless aggregate

demand management and financial deregulation by a "partnership" of politicians, administrators,

businesspersons and activists in significant part for personal gain that started in America, but

spread almost instantaneously across the globe, mostly through international financial networks

(except Asia where export shocks were primary). The last is the most dangerous, and most likely

soon to recur because high rolling losers were compensated out of public funds,59 self-interested

aggregate demand managers are unrepentant, and publics are dazed by fast talk. The least likely

near term recidivists are developing nations like those in Asia which through bitter experience

adopted flexible foreign exchange regimes and now maintain adequate foreign currency reserves,

but over the longer term remain vulnerable to invasive moral hazard and social turmoil.

Countries like China fall in the middle. On one hand, they are insulated against capital flight by

stringent state controls, but on the other they are at high risk for destructive rent-seeking and

turbulent domestic asset speculation. International financial laissez-faire which accompanied the

second wave of globalization after the fall of the Bretton Woods system obviously has played an

important part in two of the three financial crises surveyed, but is neither the only, nor the

elsewhere with various "public-private partnerships" using all means fair and mostly foul to

create favorable speculative financial conditions for their personal enrichment, which when

combined with under regulated white hot money flows, Chinese dollar reserve hoarding and

stealth protectionism in the best scenario will seriously degrade global economic performance,

and in the worst culminate a Black Swan catastrophe.
