                                            ABSTRACT


       We examine whether the aggregate U.S. business cycle is driven mainly by geographical

shocks (affecting all sectors within a state), or by sectoral shocks (affecting the same sector in all

states). We find that, at the level of an individual sector in an individual state, shocks to output

growth are driven by the sector, not by the state: textiles in Texas move more with textiles elsewhere

in the U.S. than with other sectors in Texas. But shocks to sector growth rates exhibit a lower

correlation across sectors compared to the correlation of shocks to state growth rates across states.

As a result, geographical shocks gain greater importance at higher levels of aggregation. Finally,

we find that changes in the volatility of the aggregate U.S. business cycle reflect, to a roughly

comparable degree, both changes in the volatility of state and sector business cycles, and changes

in their correlation across sectors and states.

     1 Introduction

    News stories about the “California Depression” or the “Rust Belt Revival” suggest that,
    at a disaggregated level, geographical location is of prime importance in explaining output
    movements. E-et reports of the “resurgence of the electronics industry” or of the “housing
r   industry collapse” suggest that it is the sector, rather than location, which matters.’ -4t a
    more aggregate level, the U.S. business cycle might reflect the changing fortunes of regions,
    or of sectors. Jvfuch of the business cycle literature to date has focused on the sectoral
    dimension: whiie a small literature examines comovements between sectorally disaggregated
    activity and national output2, the geographical dimension of business cycles has attracted
    relatively little attention.3
        This emphasis on sectoral explanations might reflect an implicit assumption that differ-
    ences across states arise mainly from “exogenous” differences in their sectoral composition.4
    Put differently. were all states to adopt the same “portfolio” of industries, little if any geo-
    graphical differences might remain: Michigan differs from Kentucky only because Michigan
    has a higher esposure to the automobile sector - and is thus subject to the “automobile
    shock” - while Kentucky has a higher exposure to the tobacco industry - and is thus
    subject to the 9obacco shock.” By symmetry, of course, the case can equally be made
    in reverse: heterogeneity across sectors might reflect nothing more than their geographical
    location and v;ould disappear were sectors equally dispersed across states. Thus the auto-
    mobile sector differs from the tobacco sector only because it is located in Michigan, and
    is subject to the “Michigan shock,” while tobacco is located in Kentucky, and is therefore
    subject to the “Kentucky shock.”
        Both views have merit.         Fiscal policy changes at the state level [Gramlich (1987)],
    shifts in the allocation of military installations across states, local weather conditions, im-
    provements in local infrastructure, local inter-dependencies of the banking system [Samolyk
       ‘Inasmuch as particular sectors are concentrated in particular states, the stories become more difficult

    to distinguish, an important issue taken up below.

       ‘Over the longer term, location choice, and hence sectoral composition, is of course itself endogeneous.

 (1994)] and a host of other state level factors will tend to creat,e geographically correlated
supply and demand movements, particularly for non-traded goods. On the other hand,
technological advances and shifts in sector-specific tastes will affect production for the
same sectors across the United States.’
     We use a disaggregated dataset on state-sector output for the Gnited States to examine
the relative importance of sectoral versus geographical factors at various levels: shocks to
the growth rate of an individual sector in an individual state, shocks to entire states and
sectors, and, ultimately, shocks to aggregate output.
    The distinction between geographical and sectoral shocks is of some importance for
stabilization policy. If aggregate business cycles primarily reflect large output movements
in some states - affecting most sectors within those states - then the efficacy of geo-
graphically undifferentiated counter-cyclical policies at the federal level will be limited and
stabilization policy should be targeted at specific states [Gramlich (1987)].6 On the labor
market side, geographical shocks place a premium on spatial mobility, most likely within
the same sector. If: instead, the aggregate cycle largely reflects the booms and busts of
individual sectors. then broadly based fiscal policies - be they state or federal - would
not be fully efficient: and cross-sectoral labor mobility - quite likely within the same state
- would provide an alternative adjustment mechanism.7

    We proceed in three steps. We begin at the most disaggregated level with the shock to
the growth rate of an individual sector in an individual state - say chemicals in California
- which we term the individual-micro shock. We then define the sector-micro shock as a

weighted average (across all states) of the absolute value of the individual-micro shocks in
that sector. The sector-micro shock thus aims to capture the size of the “typical” (absolute)
shock affecting that sector, regardless of its geographical location. Analogously, we define
a state-mien, shock as the weighted average (across all sectors) of the absolute value of the
individual-micro shocks in that state. The state-micro shock aims to capture the size of
   5Some authors equate geographical shocks with “demand” movements and sectoral shocks with “supply”

movements. While of some intuitive appeal, the correspondence is not exact: a product specific taste shock is

an example of a demand movement showing up as a sectoral shock; a change in the quality of transportation

infrastructure is an example of a supply shock with a geographical component. For our purposes, there is

no need to identify geographical (sectoral) shocks with demand and supply movements.

   6The fiscal transfer system to states partially fulfills this role [Sala-i-Martin and Sachs (1992))

   ‘See Blanchard and Katz (1992) on labor market adjustment patterns.



                                                       4
     the “typical” (absolute) shock affecting that state, regardless of the particular sector.
        We examine two issues at this level. First, are there marked differences of these micro
    shocks across states and across sectors ? Second, are individual micro shocks more corre-
    lated along the geographical dimension - the textile sector in California moving with the
    chemicals sector in California - or more correlated along the sectoral dimension - the
r
    textile sector in California moving with the textile sector in Texas?
        Moving up one level of aggregation, we consider the properties of state shoc& - defined
    as the (output weighted) sum of the actual (rather than absolute) micro shocks to sectors
    in that state.   The state shock is thus the average shock to the state, taking account
    of “diversification” across sectors.   Likewise, the sector shock is defined as the (output
    weighted) sum of the actual micro shocks to that sector across all states - that is, taking
    account of “diversification” of the sector across various states. Again, two issues are of
    interest. First, does the size of state and sector shocks vary across states and sectors?
    Second, are there differences between the correlation of state shocks across states and the
    correlation of sector shocks across sectors? Finally, we turn to the aggregate 5.S. business
    cycle and relate its volatility to the properties of the underlying state and sectoral shocks.
       We find that, d,t the micro level of an individual sector in a particular state, it is
    the sector which matters. Output of chemicals in California is driven more by the US
    chemicals business cycle than by the California business cycle. -4s the focus moves up to
    higher levels of aggregation, however, the geographical dimension gains greater importance.
    While shocks to sectors are larger than the corresponding shocks to states (because the
    underlying micro shocks are more correlated within a sector than within a state, thus
    aggregation across sectors within a state provides more “diversification” than aggregation
    across states within the same sector), the correlation of sector shocks across sectors is lower
    than the correlation of state shocks across states. At the national level, therefore, shocks
    to states have considerable explanatory power for the aggregate business cycle.
     2 Micro Shocks

     Our results are based on the BEA sectoral-state database containing state output series
    from 1963 to 1991 for thirty-four sectors, deflated by the US sectoral output deflators.8
    The basic unit is the individual-micro shock to the growth rate of sector i in state s at time
r   t, denoted Afls. The appropriate way of modeling the time series behavior of sectoral and

    aggregate output continues to be the subject of a lively debate. For robustness, we select
    two alternative measures of the shock. The first measure is the residual of an autoregression
    (AR) of the current output growth rate, A log yis, on a constant, and it’s own lag: Ai” -
    A log @-(,uiS+$“Alog ytS_,). The second, less restrictive measure is the cyclical component
    of a Hodrick-Prescott (HP) decomposition of output growth. In practice, the low persistence
    of growth rates means that the two series are very similar, and are indeed very similar to
    the growth rate itself.
        We begin by examining the magnitude of these shocks along the sectoral and geograph-
    ical dimensions. Kext we consider how jndividual micro shocks are related to micro shocks
    in the same sector versus micro shocks in the same state.

    The first two columns of Table 1 report the sector micro shocks, {l?}~&, for the AR and
    for the HP measures. Each represents the “typical” absolute growth shock to that sector
    averaged across states and, for any period, is calculated as a weighted average over all
    states, s = 1, . ..( 50 of the absolute value of the shock Ai,” . The weight attached to the
    growth shock to sector i in state s is the ratio of output in the sector in the state, yis : to

where the notation Y: indicates aggregate U.S. output of sector i in period t, and I” is the
average over the entire sample, 1965-91.
    Correspondingly, columns 5-6 report the state micro shocks, {P}~!?i. In state s and
time t, the state micro shock is simply the “typical” growth shock to sectors in that state,
averaged across sectors. For any period, it is calculated as a weighted average over all
sectors, i = l,..., 34 of the absolute value of the shock A:‘. The weight attached to the
growth shock to sector i in state s is the ratio of output in the sector in the state, yi” , to
state output.

It bears emphasizing that these “micro shocks” are quite different from the average shock
to the entire sector or state - which we calculate below, and term the sector and state
shocks respectively. By taking the absolute value of the shock before averaging in (1)
and (2), no allowance is made for negatively correlated shocks within a sector (or state)
off-setting each other, thus permitting a look at the typical size of shocks, independent
of their sign. It should also be noted that the state and sector micro shocks contain a
common component and are thus not uncorrelated. The common component arises from
two sources. First, every individual-micro shock comprises the “national” shock common
to all micro-shock observations. As we will see below, the national shock is, however, not
quantitatively important.
    The second source of co-movement derives from the fact that every observation has both
a state and a sector dimension. To take an extreme case, suppose that a particular sector in
a particular state accounts both for the entire state output and the entire (national) sector
output. In that case, the state and the sector shocks would be perfectly correlated. In
practice, the overlap is much smaller but is nevertheless present, inducing some correlation.g
   ‘Conceptually, the individual-micro shock can be written as A;” = nl + uf + uf -+- c:*’ where U: and V:

are uncorrelated. However, as every observation belongs to both a sector and a state, these uncorrelated



                                                         7
         Three sectors are subject to particularly large micro-shocks: agriculture, petroleum
    and durables (notably motor-vehicles) - presumably reflecting the importance of weather
    disturbances, oil price movements, and swings in consumer sentiment and credit conditions.
    At the opposite end of the spectrum, services and the public sector exhibit significantly
    below-average micro-shocks. Overall, the typical micro-shock is larger for sectors producing
r
    durables, than for sectors producing non-durables, and for sectors producing traded, as
    opposed to non-traded, goods. Turning to states: sectors in Alaska - clearly an outlier
    - are subject to the largest micro-shocks. At the other end of the distribution no outliers

    are found, though the largest states, New York and California, exhibit the smallest micro-
    shocks - a finding to which we return below. A comparison shows that the distribution
    of state-micro shocks is significantly tighter than the distribution of sector-micro shocks.
    Since the results are quite similar for the AR and the HP measures of the micro-shock
    (reflecting the low persistence of shocks), below we report results only for the AR measure:
    except in the summary tables.
        Since the state shocks are based on the state-output weighted shocks to the individual
    sectors in the state, differences across states can reflect one of two factors. First, it might be
    that the same sector receives different shocks in different states. For instance, Californian
    agricultural output may, perhaps because of greater weather-sensitivity of local crops; on
    average be more volatile than output of Kansas agriculture. Second, it might be that
    the output in the same sector is subject to similar shocks regardless of location, but that
    output volatility differs across sectors. In the latter case there would be differences in state
    aggregates purely as a result of differences in sectoral composition (and hence weighting of
    the micro-shocks). For instance, if Kansas produces mainly agriculture, and the agricultural
    sector exhibits high volatility, then a large Kansas micro shock (relative to California)
    might simply reflect the large weight of agriculture in state output, (yaglh’an/YKan) used
    to calculate the state micro shock, rather than an autonomous “Kansas shock.”
    shocks cannot be identified without imposing some additional restriction (in the extreme case mentioned

    above, the shock can, with equal justification, be attributed to the sector or to the state). Our preference

    is to avoid imposing such additional restrictions. As a result, our measures do not refer to ‘Lpure” sector

    or state effects (conditional on identifying restrictions) but rather to weighted averages of sector, state and

    national factors. As our main interest lies in exploring the systematic differences between the set of sector

    and the set of state shocks, and as the “leakage” factors are roughly constant across the relative dimensions,

    rankings are unlikely to be affected. We return to these issues in the ANOVA subsection below.



                                                           8
        A priori, an analogous argument can of course be made about differences between the
    sector-micro shocks. Just as a large shock to Kansas might reflect the combination of a
    large (US-wide) shock to agriculture and a large weight of agriculture in Kansas output, the
    shock to agriculture in the U.S. may reflect the combination of a large shock to California
    (say an early frost) and the large weight of the Californian agricultural sector in national
r
    agricultural output.
        In the former case, part of the variation across states would merely be a reflection of
    differences in the sectoral composition of state output - rather than autonomous geo-
    graphical shocks; in the latter case: part of the variation across sectors would merely be
    a reflection of differences in the spatial composition of sectors - instead of autonomous
    sectoral shocks.
        Weighting-induced differences certainly appear to be a possibility as both the geographi-
    cal dispersion of sectors, and the sectoral diversification of states vary significantly. Herfind-
    ah1 indices of concentration reveal tobacco, motor vehicles, and mining to be the most
    geographically concentrated sectors; while Alaska, Louisiana, and Sevada are the most
    sectorally concentrated states.
        To examine whether weighting matters, we recompute the state-micro using the share
    of the sector in &‘.S. output rather than the share of the sector in state output. Likewise, we
    recompute the sector-micro shocks using the share of the state in U.S. output rather than
    the share of the state in sector output. Columns 3-4 and 7-8 of Table 1 report the results for
    the US weighted micro-state and micro-sector shocks. For one sector - agriculture - the
    U.S.-weighted micro-shock is more than 0.1 below the sector-weighted micro-shock, in seven
    sectors, the U.S.-weighted shock is actually larger than the state-weighted shock by more
    than 0.1 (with the mining and instruments sector showing the largest increases). On the
    state side, the micro-shock for seven states - Alaska, Indiana, Michigan, Montana, North
    Dakota, Ohio and Wyoming - is lower by more than 0.1 for the US -weighted shocks,
    while for sixteen states the state micro shock would actually be more than 0.1 points larger
    using US-weights.
        Overall, the results reveal that while weighting affects results, controlling for differences
    in the sectoral composition of state output and the spatial composition of sectoral output
    does not eliminate either the intra-state, or the intra-sector differences, nor does .it affect the
    overall comparison between sector and state shocks. The finding that differences in sectoral

                                                    9
    composition cannot fully account for geographical heterogeneity matches conclusions by
    Jimeno [1992] and Clark [1995] for more aggregated datasets.
        This conclusion of course depends on the assumption that the individual micro shocks,
    Ai”, are themselves independent of the size of the sector, and thus of the weighting scheme
    used. This may not be the case. For instance, to the extent that individual firms suf-
r
    fer idiosyncratic shocks, aggregation generates diversification effects, in consequence, the
    volatility of a given sector across states might be expected to decrease in the absolute size
    of the sector. To control for this possibility, we regress the absolute size of the micro shock
    Ai” on the size of the sector. The regression results indeed suggest a slight negative corre-
    lation. To examine whether this correlation is sufficiently large to affect the interpretation
    of results, we recompute the statistics based on “size-adjusted” shocks (computed by re-
    moving the size-effect predicted by the regression) but find only minor differences to the
    original series. The assumption that the volatility of a given sector in a given state can, to
    a first approximation, be taken as independent of the absolute size of the sector in the state
    thus seems acceptable. Summing up these results, the evidence quite strongly suggests that
    neither differences across sectors, nor differences across states, can be fully explained by
    composition effects. Put differently, the results suggest the presence of both autonomous
    geographical and sectoral shocks.
       Table 2 examines the stability of the size of the micro shocks over time. The table
    reports, for both shock measures, the median shock (across the states and across the sectors)
    for five year subsamples. The size of the typical micro-shock has varied within a fairly
    narrow range - increasing gradually until the early 198Os, then declining again - while
    the relative ranking of state and sector micro shocks has remained the same across the
    subsamples.


    2.2 Comovements

    Is the shock to a particular sector in a particular state determined by what happens to
    the sector elsewhere in the United States, or by what happens to other sectors in the same
    state? We begin examining the relative importance of state - versus sector - effects by
    comparing the average k-ha-sector correlations between the (actual, not absolute) micro-
    shocks to a particular sector in all states - each computed as the average of the 1‘225

    below-diagonal elements of the 50*50 correlation matrix of shocks to the given sector in all
    fifty states - with the intro-state correlations (each computed as the average of the 561
    below-diagonal elements of the 34*34 correlation matrix of shocks to all thirty-four sectors
    within a given state). As a robustness check, we compute both the simple average of the
    1225 (561) bilateral correlations for each sector (state), and an output weighted measure.r’
r
        Table 3 reports the average correlations. The results are quite similar across the various
    measures, so we focus on the (equally-weighted) AR measure: depicted in the two panels
    of Figure 1. The correlation of the shocks to the same sector across different states is
    strikingly larger and more dispersed, compared to the correlation of shocks to different
    sectors within the same state: California textiles tend to move with Texas textiles, rather
    than with California chemicals. Indeed, more than one-third of the intra-sector correlations
    are statistically significant (at the 10 percent level or higher) whereas none of the intra-state
    correlations are statistically significant.
        The distribution of the average intra-state correlation is fairly bunched. Micro shocks
    to different sectors within North Dakota are almost uncorrelated, at 0.06, while shocks to
    sectors within Michigan, at 0.32, exhibit the highest correlations; most intra-state corre-
    lations fall in a narrow range of 0.10 to 0.25. In contrast, intra-sector correlations span a
    considerably wider range. At one end of the scale: shocks to tobacco and agriculture -
    subject to local weather shocks - exhibit almost no correlation across states. At the other
    end, shocks to transport and retail trade - both highly dependent on other sectors -
    exhibit correlations above 0.7 across states.
        To examine these co-movements more formally, we regress the shock to sector i in state
    j on the output-weighted average shock to sector i in all states ezcept state j and on the
    output-weighted average of the shock to state j in all sectors ezcept sector i to explore which
    piece of information is more useful in explaining the growth shock to an particular sector
    in a particular state: knowing what happened to the sector elsewhere or what happens to
    other sectors in the same state? The results are reported in table 4, listing the orthogonal
    contribution of the state and the sector variable to the R2 of this regression - averaged
      “‘The weight attached to the correlation between sector i and sector j in state s is equal to the sum of

    the output in those two sectors in the state, resealed so that weights add up to unity. Likewise, the weight

    attached to the correlation of the shock to a particular sector in state r and state s is equal to the sum of

    the output of the sector in the two states, again resealed so that weights add up to one.

         Controlling for the shock to the same sector in other states, including the shock to other
     sectors in the same state raises the explained variance by less than 5 percentage points. In
     contrast, controlling for the shock to other sectors in the same state: including the shock to
     the same sector in other states raises the explained variance by almost 25 percentage points.
     The contribution of the shock to other sectors in the same state (column 2) is broadly similar
     across the different states (ranging between 0.04 to 0.10) while the contribution of the shock
     to the same sector in other states differs widely across the various sectors (column 4). For
     retail trade, almost one-half of the variance is explained by movements of retail trade in
     other states, while less than 8 percent of the variance in finance, insurance and real-estate
     can be explained by movements in other states.
       “The orthogonal component contribution       of the state variable is calculated as the increase in the   R2
     obtained by adding the state variable to a regression already containing the sector variable; the orthogonal

     contribution of the sector variable is computed analogously as the increase in the     R2 obtained by adding
     the sector variable to a regression already containing the state variable.

     Columns 3 and 6 report the overall R2 of the individual regressions, again averaged
across states or sectors. These R2s measure the extent to which output movements at the
state-sector level can be explained jointly by shocks to the same sector in other states and
by shocks to other sectors in the same state. As such, they provide a joint measure of
geographical and sectoral linkages. Sectors in Alaska are seen to be the most independent,
while almost 60 percent of shocks to sectors in Ohio are explained by shocks to the same
sector in other states and to other sectors in Ohio. Across sectors, tobacco is the least
linked, while more than 77 percent of retail trade shocks can be explained by state and
sector linkages.
    At the individual micro level, the answer to the question posed in the introduction is
thus unambiguous: What matters for an individual sector in an individual state is what
happens to the same sector in other states, not what happens to other sectors in the same
state. The findings are consistent with two explanations. First, they might reflect a greater
incidence of shocks which similarly affect the same sector in all states, compared to shocks
which similarly affect all sectors within a state. Second, they might reflect the presence of
leading firms/states in a given sector passing an idiosyncratic shock on to other firms in
that sector through vertical linkages. By construction; our data do not permit a distinction
between cross-sectionally correlated “exogenous” shocks and propagated shocks within the
year.
    Granger causality tests, however, provide some insight about temporal linkages. We
estimate two sets of Granger-tests, each using one lag. The first asks whether the output
shock in a given sector in a given state Granger-causes the output shock in the same sector
in other states. Transport, electrical equipment and communication are the three sectors
with the greatest number of significant Granger-causal links between the same sector in
different statesI The second set of tests examines whether the output shock in a given
sector in a given state Granger-causes the output. shock in other sectors in the same state.
The evidence here is even weaker. Maine, Florida and Arizona top the list, with around
three percent of all causality tests significant. l3 Overall, the evidence for important linkages
  “For the transport sector, Massachusetts is the leading state, Granger-causing almost a third of the

transport shocks in other states. For Electrical equipment and communication, Idaho and Indiana are the

leading states, again Granger-causing shocks in the same sector in about a third of the other states.
  r3The leading sectors in these three states are state/local government in Maine, construction in Florida

over time, wither within sectors across states, or within states across sectors is thus rather
limited.
     Figure 2 provides the answer to a slightly different question, which has been examined by
a number of previous authors for more aggregated datasets: what fraction of the individual-
micro shock to a specific sector in a specific state can be attributed to a sector-independent
state effect (common to all sectors in the state), to a state-independent sector-effect (com-
mon to the same sector in all states) and to a residual idiosyncratic effect? As discussed
above, the question cannot be answered without imposing additional restrictions, since ev-
ery observation belongs both to a state and to a sector. We follow the previous literature in
achieving identification through the choice of an (arbitrary) reference point, agriculture in
Alabama. Given the reference point, the orthogonal sector contribution can be estimated
as the increase in the R2 obtained by including sector dummies (except for agriculture) to
a panel regression already including state dummies (except for -4labama). The orthogonal
state contribution is analogously computed as the increase in the R2 obtained by adding
state dummies t.o a panel regression already including sector dummies. The figure plots
these orthogonal contributions. In all but a few years, sector shocks have greater explana-
tory power than state shocks. Over the entire period, the average orthogonal explanatory
power of sector dummies amounts to 0.119, exceeding the explanatory power of the state
dummies at 0.080 by almost fifty percent.
    These results for the United States differ markedly from earlier findings for cross country
studies. Thus Stockman (1988) finds sector and geographical shocks to be of roughly equal
importance for a sample of OECD economies; Helg et al. (1995) conclude that “more
variance of output innovations is explained at the country, rather than the industry level”;
Costello (1993), examining productivity growth, finds a higher correlation across industries
within one country than across countries within one industry; and Borensztein and Ostry
(1994) looking at the output decline in eastern Europe, find a predominance of geographic
over industry shocks. Our finding of more prominent sectoral shocks in the U.S., however,
are matched by other studies of subnational sectoral and geographic activity [Norrbin and
Schlagenhauf (1988), Prasad and Thomas (1994), Kollmann (1995)]. The available evidence
thus suggests an interesting reversal of the relative importance of geographic and sectoral

and primary metals in Arizona, each Granger-causing about 15% of the other sectors in the respective state.

shocks between the sub-national and the national level.
    It bears emphasizing that this reversal cannot be simply explained by the absence of a
formal role for national policy shocks in the evidence presented above. -4s the shocks are
calculated separately for each state-sector pair (no control for an overall annual average is
included), any national shock would be part of every single state-sector shock series. If such
national shocks were indeed the dominant driving force, we would not observe differences
between the sect,or and the state decompositions, nor would we observe sizable differences
between individual states and sectors - in stark contrast to our results.
    To some degree, the greater importance of common sectoral shocks for the intra-national
compared to inter-national data may reflect structural factors, in particular lower artificial
and natural trade barriers within the United States, easing the geographic transmission
of sectoral shocks. -4 second possibility is that the reversal reflects the different levels of
aggregation. The possibility is of interest since: due to more restricted data availability,
the national studies referred to above employ rather more aggregated data than used here.
Costello (1993). for example, examines shocks to five major industries, while Stockman
(1988) and Borensztein and Ostry (1994) study shocks to ten sectors: compared to the
thirty-four sectors examined here. To the extent that the correlation of geographic shocks
UCYDSS space differs from the correlation of sector shocks across sectors. a move from shocks
to disaggregated sectors in disaggregated spatial units to shocks to more aggregated sectors
in more encompassing spatial units will by itself affect the relative volatility of geographic
versus sectoral shocks. To examine this issue in more detail, we now t.urn from the micro-
shocks to state and sector level shocks.


3 State and Sector Shocks

The evidence presented thus far can be usefully summarized by aggregating micro shocks
along the state or sectoral dimensions. The average state shock is simply the absolute value
of the (weighted) average of (actual, not absolute) shocks to sectors in that state. Thus, in
contrast to the previous section, we now allow for positive and negative shocks within the
state to cancel each other.




                                              16

                                                                                            (3)

      The average sector-level shock is defined analogously:


                                                                                            (4)
                                        k1965 s=l

      We begin by examining the magnitude of these shocks - relating them to the resuIts
above on the sectoral and geographical dimension of the micro shocks - and then turn to
the correlations between state shocks and between sector shocks.


3.1     Magnitude and Relation to Micro Shocks

These average shocks (for the AR measure) are plotted, sorted by size and on identical
scales, in Figure 3. State shocks fall within a quite narrow range - from 0.017 for California
to 0.048 for Korth Dakota - with Alaska an outlier at 0.080. In contrast, the sector shocks
are considerably larger and much more dispersed: ranging from a shock of 0.008 for state
and local government to 0.133 for motor vehicles. Overall, the average sector-level shock
(0.047) is almost twice as large as the average state-level shock (0.026) with the difference
significant at the one percent level.
      The figure of course only provides a different view of the results presented above: the
low intra-state correlation of shocks to different sectors implies a high incidence of off-
setting shocks, hence the absolute value of the state shock based on actual micro-shocks
is substantially lower than the value of the state-micro shock based on the absolute values
of the micro-shocks. In contrast, the substantial correlation of shocks to the same sector
across states implies limited offsetting, hence the micro-sector shock and the absolute value
of the sector-shock are comparable. Put differently, the aggregate state shock is reduced by
“diversification” across sectors to a greater extent than the aggregate sector shock is reduced
by diversification across states. Turning to individual states and sectors, the magnitude
of the state and sector shocks reflects both the size of the micro shocks (table 1) and the
intra-state and intra-sector correlations (Figure 1).

3.2       Comovement of State and Sector Shocks

Next we consider the inter-state and inter-sector correlation of the average sector and
state shocks with a view to determining their importance in explaining aggregate output
movements.14 For each sector, i, we calculate the (weighted) average of the correlations
between the output-weighted actual shock to sector i with each of the thirty-three other
sectors. Similarly, for each state, s, we calculate the output-weighted average of the cor-
relations between the output weighted actual shock to state s with each of the forty-nine
other states.15
      Analogously to the computation of the i&m-state and i&m-sector correlations, we weigh
observations by the sum of the outputs of the two states (sectors) resealed to ensure that
weights add up to unity. Table 5 (analogous to table 3) reports the aggregate statistics for
the various measures. Again, as there are no substantial differences, we focus on Figure 4
which shows the correlations based on state- and sector-weighted AR shocks.
      Across the entire sample, state shocks display an average correlation of around 0.50
with other state shocks, close to seventy percent of these correlations are significantly
different from zero at the five percent level. Sector shocks, in contrast, have a much lower
average correlation of around 0.30 with close to forty percent of the correlations significantly
different from zero at the five percent level. l6 As a result, sectoral aggregation diversifies
away sector shocks to a greater extent than geographical aggregation diversifies away state
shocks. The higher the level of aggregation, therefore, the greater the role of geographical
sh0cks.r’
      Most of the correlations of states with other states lies within the range of 0.3 to
  “The independent interest of the results rests on the definition of the average state-level and sector-level

shock as the sum of state-sector shocks weighted, respectively, by output weights in total state and total

sector output. If state-sector shocks are instead weighted relative to US output, the sum of all state shocks

would, by definition, be equal to the sum of all sector shocks.    Thus, a lower average state shock would

automatically imply a higher average correlation.

  “The fairly low correlation across sectors provides an explanation for our earlier finding that states with

small aggregate shocks tend to be fairly large and diversified across sectors.
  “The low correlation of sectoral shocks on the national level is well documented, see for example Lebow

(1993).

0.6, only Alaska is negatively correlated with other states. Across sectors, the average
correlation with other sectors ranges from a negative correlation for agriculture and near
zero correlations of the Federal Military and Civilian Government to significant positive
correlations for Furniture, Rubber and Metals. The wide variation of inter-state correlations
is of some interest, going back to our earlier discussion of propagation channels. While a
complete exploration of the cross-sectional differences in correlations is beyond the scope
of this paper! we briefly explore two potential determinants of above average correlations:
proximity and similarity.
    Bilateral correlations might be expected to depend upon the distance between states for
at least two reasons. First, a substantial literature has established a sturdy negative link
between bilateral distance and trade. To the extent that propagation partly takes place via
trade linkages: more distant states-should exhibit lower correlations. Second, to the extent
that some geographical shocks (such as the weather) can affect several states in a region:
we would again expect a negative link between distance and correlation. In addition to
distance, one might expect more similar states to exhibit higher bilateral correlations.
   Table 6 examines whether distance (measured as the log of the distance, in miles,
between state capitals) and measures of similarity indeed have explanatory power for the
cross-sectional dispersion of correlations. We include four measures of similarity. The first
and second proxy for the similarity of the sectoral composition of output and exports,
computed as the sum of the absolute differences of the output (export) shares across all
sectors. The output data are the same as those underlying the shocks. The export data
were taken from the 1993 commodity flow survey issued by the Bureau of Transportation,
and exclude services. For both measures, a larger value implies greater dissimilarity. As
additional controls for size and performance, we include the logs of the sum of value added
per worker in manufacturing, the log of the product of growth rates of the two states and
the log of the state output levels. The results, reported on the left side of table 6, indicate
that the correlation increases in proximity as well as in the similarity of output and trade.r’
   The right hand side of table 6 reports the results of a similar exercise for the bilateral
correlations of sector shocks. We include three explanatory variables as well as dummies
for capital goods and for non-capital intermediate inputs. First, the sum of the bilateral

Second, the product of the sector Herfindahl indices, to examine whether sectors that are
geographically very dispersed, and hence less likely to be subject to idiosyncratic geographic
shocks, exhibit a higher correlation. Third, the product of the shares in U.S. output of the
two sectors, measuring whether large sectors exhibit higher comovements. The results
suggest that input-output linkages between two sectors raise the correlation between the
sector shocks. and hence that shocks are partly transmitted via vertical production chain
linkages. A second effect is the geographic dispersion: the correlation between shocks to
sectors declines in the degree of geographic concentration, reflecting the importance of share
geographic shocks. Finally, the size of sectors does not appear to affect the correlation.
Ceteris paribus. sectors producing intermediate inputs exhibit higher correlations, though
the effect is not significant.


3.3 The Aggregate Business Cycle

By definition. changes in the volatility of the aggregate business cycle may reflect either
changes in the typical size of shocks affecting states and sectors, or changes in the correlation
of these shocks across sectors and states. Table 7 throws some light on the importance of
these two factors. The table reports, for the AR measure of the U.S.-weighted state shock
and the sector-weighted sector shock, both the typical size and the correlation across sectors
and states for five-year sub-periods.
    The table suggests that the post-1970 increase and the post 1985 decrease in the volatil-
ity of the aggregate business cycle reflect both an increase in the volatility of the business
cycle on the state and sector level - captured by the average size statistic - and a greater
synchronicity of these cycles - captured in the correlation statistic.
   Our results can best be summarized by computing four measures of the shock to the
growth rate of U.S. output, graphed in Figure 5. The first measure is the absolute output-
weighted shock to U.S. output - the focus of traditional aggregate business cycle analysis.
The second and third measures are the sums of the output-weighted (absolute) average
state and sector shocks. The fourth measure is the sum of the output-weighted micro
shocks to individual state-sector pairs. Each of these measures weight each individual shock
identically - they differ solely in the stage at which the aggregation is done (the absolute

value is taken), and thus on the extent of “diversification” permitted. The first measure
allows diversification both within and across states and sectors. The second and third
measure permit diversification within, but not across, sectors and states (and corresponds
to the “state” and “sector” shocks). The fourth measure allows for no canceling of shocks: it
measures the impact of all individual shocks and corresponds to the “micro” shocks above.
    By virtue of the less than perfect correlation - within and across states and sectors -
the size of the shock decreases as we move from the micro to the aggregate level. Moreover,
as shown above, the sector shock is larger than the state shock because micro shocks are
more correlated within a sector than within a state.
                                                                                                       .
   The differences across these alternative shock measures have a direct bearing on stabi-
lization policies aimed at containing the employment consequences of shocks. If labor is
completely mobile across sectors and states, the shock to U.S. output is the appropriate
focus of stabilization policy. If labor mobility is restricted, however, stabilization of aggre-
gate output goes only a small way towards reducing employment swings. To the extent
that labor cannot move across sectors - perhaps because of sector-specific human capital


                                              23
- sectoral stabilization pohcy is more effective; to the extent that labor is restricted to a

particular state, geographical stabilization is required. If there are costs to mobility along
both dimensions, then stabilization policy might be most effective on the micro level of
individual sectors in individual states - textiles in Texas, rather than textiles or Texas.



4 Conclusion

This paper asks a simple question: What drives the business cycle, geographical or sectoral
shocks? It turns out that the answer depends very much on the level of aggregation.
   At the level of an individual sector in a particular state, it is the sectoral dimension which
dominates. The fate of the textile sector in Texas is determined by the fate of textiles in
the U.S., not by the business cycle of Texas. In consequence of the greater correlation along
the sector than along the state dimension, the average absolute shock to sectors exceeds the
average absolute shock to states. Put differently: there is more diversification across sectors
within a state than across states within a sector. To a reasonable approximation, therefore,
most shocks at a disaggregated level can be attributed to sector-specific disturbances such
as technology or sector-specific taste shocks.
   At the level of the aggregate U.S. business cycle, the relative importance of sector and
state shocks depends upon both their average size and on their correlation acruss sectors
and states. While sector shocks are larger, they are less correlated across sectors: California
tends to move with Oregon more than chemicals move with textiles. As a result, sectoral
aggregation “diversifies away” shocks to sectors to a greater extent than geographical ag-
gregation diversifies away shocks to states. Therefore, shocks to states have considerable
explanatory power for movements of aggregate output.
   By extension, changes in aggregate business cycle volatility can also be attributed to
one of two causes: changes in the average size of shocks hitting the components of aggregate
                                                                                                    .
output, and changes in the bunching of these shocks. A priori, it is perfectly possible for
the volatility of aggregate output to change while the volatility of state and sector output
remains constant. In the data, we find that the two elements have moved together over
the last thirty years: the early 1970s saw a sizable increase in both the average size of
shocks to sectors and states, and their correlation across states and sectors; the late 1980s
saw a decline in both. Looking forward, the explanation of these changes in the average


                                                 24
size of shocks and their geographical and sectoral correlation poses an interesting research
challenge.
