In this paper we evaluate the success of policies that were implemented in the 1980s that were

designed to improve the workings of the UK labour market. Our primary conclusion is that the

Thatcherite reforms succeeded in their goals of weakening union power; may have marginally

increased employment and wage responsiveness to market conditions and may have increased

self-employment. They were accompanied by a substantial improvement in the labour market

position of women. But the reforms failed to improve the responsiveness of real wages to

unemployment; they were associated with a slower transition from nonemployment to

employment for men; a devastating loss in full-time jobs for male workers and produced

substantial seemingly noncompetitive increases in earnings inequality.
