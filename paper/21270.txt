                                            ABSTRACT

We use data from the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS) to document the medical spending
of Americans aged 65 and older. We find that medical expenses more than double between ages 70
and 90 and that they are very concentrated: the top 10% of all spenders are responsible for 52% of
medical spending in a given year. In addition, those currently experiencing either very low or very
high medical expenses are likely to find themselves in the same position in the future. We also find
that the poor consume more medical goods and services than the rich and have a much larger share
of their expenses covered by the government. Overall, the government pays for 65% of the elderly's
medical expenses. Despite this, the expenses that remain after government transfers are even more
concentrated among a small group of people. Thus, government health insurance, while potentially
very valuable, is far from complete. Finally, while medical expenses before death can be large, on
average they constitute only a small fraction of total spending, both in the aggregate and over the life
cycle. Hence, medical expenses before death do not appear to be an important driver of the high and
increasing medical spending found in the U.S.

1       Introduction
    We use data from the Medicare Current Beneﬁciary Survey (MCBS) to document
the medical spending of people aged 65 and over in the United States. The medical
spending of this population is notable for a number of reasons.
    First, the typical elderly American receives far more medical services than those
of younger ages. In 2010, average medical expenditures for an American aged 65
or older were 2.6 times the national average (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid
Services, 2015). In the same year people 65 and older accounted for over one third
of U.S. medical spending. As the population continues to age, this fraction will
likely grow. Given that much of the elderly’s medical expenditures are ﬁnanced by
the government, their spending is of increasing ﬁscal importance. A particularly
contentious issue is spending at the end of life (Scitovsky, 1994; Scitovsky, 2005).
Even though studies have found that over a quarter of Medicare spending on the
elderly is for end-of-life care (Hoover et al., 2002), proposals to reform this spending
have generated skepticism (Emanuel and Emanuel, 1994) and sometimes strident
resistance (Daly, 2009).
    A second notable feature of this population is that virtually every American aged
65 or older is eligible for Medicare, a government-provided health insurance program.
Medicare pays much of the cost of short hospital stays, doctor visits, and, since 2006,
pharmaceutical. This is in sharp contrast to the younger population. The majority of
Americans younger than 65 are covered through employer-provided health insurance,
but many others are covered by privately-purchased health insurance or government-
provided insurance. Moreover, because privately-purchased insurance can be expen-
sive, and because the eligibility criteria for government insurance are strict for the
non-elderly, many people younger than 65 are uninsured. A number of studies sug-
gest that access to health care in the U.S. is unequal across the income distribution
(Wagstaﬀ and van Doorslaer, 2000).1 This inequality is likely more pronounced among
the younger population than among the elderly, where Medicare mitigates disparities
in health care access.
    A third reason why the medical spending of the age 65 and older population is of
particular interest is that the spending data for this group are of high quality. Since
Medicare is provided by the government, researchers have access to administrative
Medicare records. Our principal data source for this paper, the MCBS, links the
administrative Medicare records to survey information from households. In addition
    1
     More precisely, Wagstaﬀ and van Doorslaer (2000) review the literature on inequalities in the
delivery of health care.


                                                2
to high quality data on Medicare payments, the MCBS contains spending data for
other payors from its survey component.
    A fourth reason to study medical spending among retirees is that medical expenses
provide an important motive for retirement savings (De Nardi, French, and Jones,
2010). These savings not only aﬀect wages and economic growth, but are an important
policy concern in their own right.
    We ﬁnd that medical expenses more than double between ages 70 and 90, with
most of the increase coming from nursing home spending. Medical expenses are very
concentrated: the top 10% of all spenders are responsible for 52% of medical spending
in a given year. We also ﬁnd that those currently experiencing either very low or very
high medical expenses are likely to ﬁnd themselves in the same position in the future.
These features of the data are consistent with individuals or households facing a small
risk of large medical expenses, which, once incurred, tend to be persistent over time.
Because it is hard to self-insure against such risks by saving, they may be quite costly
for consumers, especially if there are frictions in private health insurance markets.
Government insurance mitigating these risks may thus be very valuable to consumers.
This notwithstanding, and despite the fact the the government pays for 65% of the
elderly’s medical expenses, the expenses that remain after government transfers are
even more concentrated among a small group of people. Hence, government health
insurance, while potentially very valuable, is far from complete. This is in part
because the government’s Medicaid program is the payer of last resort, contributing
only after private funding has been exhausted. As a result, even though the poor on
average consume more medical goods and services than the rich, they are responsible
for a much smaller share of their costs. Finally, while medical expenses before death
can be large, on average they constitute only a small fraction of total spending, both
in the aggregate and over the life cycle. Therefore, medical expenses before death do
not appear to be an important driver of the high and increasing medical spending
found in the U.S.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the related liter-
ature. Section 3 brieﬂy describes the health care system for older Americans. Section
4 describes the MCBS data and compares them to administrative data. Section 5
documents the concentration of medical expenditures, both within a single year and
across multiple years, and the concentration of medical spending across the income
distribution. Section 6 shows the evolution of medical expenses and its payors during
the retirement period. Section 7 presents new estimates of medical spending in the
last three years of life. Section 8 concludes.

2     Related Literature and Contribution
    In this paper, we combine the 1996 to 2010 waves of the MCBS with secondary
data sources in a general review of medical spending among the U.S. age-65+ popu-
lation. While Medicare expenditures have been studied extensively, to our knowledge
the format of our study is novel. Related studies include Crystal et al. (2000),
Goldman and Zissimopoulos (2003) and Hurd and Rohwedder (2009), who document
out-of-pocket medical spending. Spillman and Lubitz (2000), Lubitz et al. (2003) and
Joyce et al. (2005) use the MCBS to project total expenditures by the elderly over
their remaining lives. The MCBS sourcebook series (CMS, multiple years) provides
annual data summaries.
    This paper is part of a series of studies examining the properties of individual-level
medical spending both across several data sets for a given country and across coun-
tries. More speciﬁcally, Fahle, McGarry and Skinner (2015), Calonico, et al. (2015),
Pashchenko and Porapakkarm (2015), and Evans and Humpherys (2015) focus on
U.S. data sets, while Christensen et al. (2015) study Denmark, Geoﬀard et al. (2015)
study France, Karlsson et al. (2015) study Germany, Ibuka and Chen (2015) study
Japan, Bakx et al. (2015) study the Netherlands, Aragón et al. (2015), Cookkson and
Propper (2015), and Kelley, Stoye and Vera-Hernandez (2015) study England, Côté-
Sergent et al. (2015), study the province of Quebec in Canada, and Chen and Chen
(2015) study Taiwan. Finally, Banks, Keynes, and Smith (2015) analyze diﬀerences
in health between the U.S. and the U.K.
    Earlier international summaries of medical spending for the elderly are limited.
Brockmann (2002) and Polder et al. (2006) document end-of-life care in Germany and
the Netherlands, respectively. Campbell et al. (2010) discuss how introducing public
long-term care insurance aﬀected expenditures in Germany and Japan and contrast
long-term care expenditures in these countries with those in the U.S. Comparative
analyses have more focused on how expenditures are ﬁnanced (Stabile and Thomson,
2014; Wagstaﬀ et al., 1999) or on access to care (van Doorslaer et al. 1997). There
is also a large literature examining international diﬀerences in aggregate medical
expenditures: Gerdtham and Jönsson (2000) provide a review. Of note is Seshamani
and Gray (2002), who ﬁnd signiﬁcant cross-country diﬀerences in the growth rates of
per capita medical expenditures on the elderly.

3       Health Care for the Age-65+ Population in the
        United States
3.1     Institutional Background
    With some exceptions, U.S. health care is privately provided. Most U.S. hospitals
are run either by non-proﬁt institutions such as universities or religious organizations,
or by private for-proﬁt companies. The employees of those hospitals, including doctors
and nurses, are then paid by the hospitals. Hospitals, doctors and other health care
providers are largely free to charge what they wish for their services. However, health
care insurers (public and private) usually negotiate prices for their insurees.
    The main payor of health care amongst the elderly is Medicare, a federal program
that provides health insurance to almost every person over the age of 65. Individuals
covered by Medicare have the option of traditional Medicare, where Medicare pays
the providers, or Medicare Advantage, where Medicare provides payments to Health
Maintenance Organizations, who then provide care. Under traditional Medicare, the
government sets a schedule of payments for most services. In order to discourage
the over-provision of health care services, many health care treatments performed by
hospitals are paid on the basis of the diagnosis rather than the treatment. Tradi-
tional Medicare pays for the great majority of the cost of short term hospital stays,
80% of the cost of doctor visits, and since 2006, most of the costs associated with
pharmaceuticals. Medicare Advantage pays for close to 100% of the cost of hospital
stays, doctor visits, and pharmaceuticals.
    Many older individuals have private insurance plans that cover medical expenses
not covered by Medicare, such as the residual share of the costs of doctor visits.
However, some forms of care are largely uninsured by either Medicare or private
health insurance, with the most important category being nursing home spending. A
large share of nursing home costs are paid out of pocket. Because nursing home stays
are expensive, on the order of $77,000 to $88,000 a year in 2014, most individuals will
be impoverished by a long nursing home stay. Those made ﬁnancially destitute will
be covered by Medicaid, a means-tested program that is run jointly by the federal
and state governments.2 In 2013, around 29% of nursing home costs were paid out of
pocket, while around 30% were covered by Medicaid. Medicaid covers almost all the
nursing home costs of poor old recipients. More generally, Medicaid ends up ﬁnancing
63% of nursing home residents (Kaiser Foundation, 2013, Figure 4). In 2009, 62% of
    2
   De Nardi et al. (2015) and Gardner and Gilleskie (2006) document many important aspects of
Medicaid insurance in old age.

Medicaid’s transfers to the elderly were for long-term care (Kaiser Foundation, 2013,
Figure 12). In large part because of its role in funding nursing home care, Medicaid
is the second most important public health insurance program for the elderly in the
U.S. Nonetheless, Medicaid is the payer of last resort, contributing only after private
funding and Medicare support have been (nearly) exhausted.

  Table 1: Funding Sources of the Elderly’s Personal Health Care Expenditures, 2010


    The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA), maintained by the Centers
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS, 2015) document how much is being spent
on each type of health care service, as well as the payors of those services.3 Tables 1
and 2 use these data to summarize the sources and uses of personal health care
spending. Personal health care measures the total amount spent on all treatments
for all individuals. It excludes government administration, government public health
activities, and investment. We focus on personal health care expenditures since it is
the concept that the MCBS data are designed to measure. Moreover, the bulk – in
2013, 85% – of total national health care expenditures go to personal health care.
    Table 1 shows how the personal health care expenditures of the elderly were funded
in 2010, the most recent year the age-speciﬁc data are available in the CMS data
set. Each column of the table corresponds to a particular type of service: hospital
care; professional services such as doctor and dental visits; nursing home care; drugs;
and other. Each row corresponds to a payor: out-of-pocket; private health insurance;
Medicare; Medicaid; and other. Table 1 shows the fraction of each expenditure subto-
tal paid by each payor. For example, the ﬁrst column shows that only 1% of the costs
of hospital care are paid out of pocket, while almost 70% of the costs are covered

by Medicare. In fact, Medicare is the largest payor for every type of expenditure,
with the exception of nursing home care. The ﬁnal column of Table 1 shows that
Medicare covers well over half of the elderly’s medical expenditures. Private health
insurance, Medicaid, and out-of-pocket expenditures each cover between 11 and 13%
of the total.

Table 2: Personal Heath Care Expenditures, by Payors and Expenditures, National Data

    Table 2 compares the spending of the elderly to that of the general population.
The top panel of Table 2 shows the shares of medical spending covered by diﬀerent
payors. The ﬁrst column in this panel repeats the ﬁnal column of Table 1. The next
four columns of Table 2 show results for the entire U.S. population, for 1970, 1990,
2010 and 2013. While Medicare pays a much bigger share of health care expenditures
for the age 65+ population than for the population as a whole, in 2010 the share spent
out of pocket barely falls after age 64. Instead, the rise in Medicare expenditures after
age 64 mostly displaces private insurance expenditures.

                                             7
    The second panel of Table 2 shows the shares of total medical spending across
service categories. The biggest changes in expenditure shares for those aged 65+ are
a rise in nursing home care and a fall in professional services such as doctor visits.
    As is well known, the United States spends large and increasing amounts on
medical care. The bottom panel of Table 2 shows that in 2013 personal health care
expenditures amounted to $2.5 trillion in 2014 dollars, representing 14.7% of GDP.
This translates to $7,930 per person. Figure 1 shows personal health care spending
in the U.S., both per person and as a percentage of GDP, from 1960 to present. By
either measure, health care spending has risen dramatically. Table 2 reveals that
while the shares of spending going to each category have been fairly stable over time,
the share of spending covered out of pocket has fallen by nearly two-thirds. For most
of this period, per capita expenditures on the elderly have grown more rapidly than
expenditures on the young. Meara et al. (2004, Exhibit 4) calculate that in 1963,
average expenditures in the age-65+ population were 2.4 times the expenditures of
those under 65. In 2000, the ratio had risen to 4.4. Meara et al. (2004) also ﬁnd,
however, that this trend has reversed in recent decades, and per capita expenditures
on the elderly are now growing more slowly than those on the young. The spending
ratio calculated with the National Health Expenditure Accounts has fallen from 3.7
in 2002 to 3.4 in 2010.

4         The MCBS Dataset
4.1         Description
    Our principal data source is the 1996 to 2010 waves of the Medicare Current Ben-
eﬁciary Survey (MCBS). The MCBS is a nationally representative survey of disabled
and elderly (age-65+) Medicare beneﬁciaries.4 Although the sample misses elderly
individuals who are not Medicare beneﬁciaries, virtually everyone aged 65+ is a bene-
ﬁciary. The survey contains an over-sample of beneﬁciaries older than 80 and disabled
individuals younger than 65. We exclude disabled individuals younger than 65, and
use population weights throughout.
    MCBS respondents are interviewed up to 12 times over a 4-year period, and are
asked about (and matched to administrative data on) health care utilization over 3 of
the 4 years, forming panels on medical spending for up to 3 years. We aggregate the
data to an annual level. These sample selection procedures leave us 66,790 diﬀerent
individuals who contribute 152,193 person-year observations.
    The MCBS’s unit of analysis is an individual. Respondents are asked about health
status, income, health insurance, and health care expenditures paid out of pocket,
by Medicaid, by Medicare, by private insurance, and by other sources. The MCBS
survey data are then matched to Medicare records.
    The key variable of interest is medical spending. This includes the cost of hospital
stays, doctor visits, pharmaceutical, nursing home care, and other long term care. The
MCBS’s medical expenditure measures are created through a reconciliation process
that combines survey information with Medicare administrative ﬁles. As a result, the
MCBS contains accurate data on Medicare payments and fairly accurate data on out-
of-pocket, Medicaid, and other insurance payments. Out-of-pocket expenses include
hospital, doctor and other bills paid out of pocket, but does not include insurance
premia paid out of pocket. Because the MCBS includes information on people who
enter a nursing home or die, its medical spending data are very comprehensive.
    We adjust all dollar amounts to 2014 dollars using the personal consumption
expenditure index. Some people have zero medical spending, and so the log of their
medical spending is undeﬁned. To address this problem, we bottom code the medical
spending data anytime we take logs. We treat all values of medical spending less than
10% of the mean of medical spending as equal to 10% of the mean. So, if someone
has medical spending equal to 5% of the mean, we recode their medical spending as
10% of the mean.
    4
        Adler (1998) describes the MCBS in some detail.


                                                  9
    In the MCBS, individuals are asked to report “...your and your spouse’s total
income before taxes during the past 12 months”. Respondents are asked to provide
an income interval, rather than an exact dollar amount. The MCBS income measure
appears to include household income, including transfer and asset income. In con-
trast, medical spending and most other variables in the MCBS are measured at the
individual level. To make the income data compatible with the other variables, we
rescale household income by standardized household size (Citro and Michael, 1995):
standardized household income = total household income/(# of adults)0.7 . When
taking logs, we bottom code income in the same way as medical spending.


4.2    Comparisons to Administrative Data
    Although there is no high quality administrative information for out-of-pocket and
private insurance payments for the age-65+ population, we can compare the MCBS
data to administrative data from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
    The ﬁrst set of columns in Table 3 compares Medicare enrollment and average
Medicare expenditures in the MCBS to the corresponding values in the aggregate data
from the Census Bureau. Table 3 shows that, when using population weights, the
number of Medicare beneﬁciaries and expenditures per beneﬁciary line up closely with
the aggregate statistics. Over the 1996 to 2010 period, MCBS Medicare enrollment for
the age-65+ population averages 36.7 million, only 3% more than the average of 35.8
million. Over the same period, expenditures per beneﬁciary in the MCBS are $7,670,
15% smaller than the value of $9,060 in the oﬃcial statistics.5 The expenditure match
weakens over time, as mean expenditures in the MCBS go from 92% of the data in
1996 to 79% of the data in 2010.
    The MCBS uses administrative data to determine whether an individual is re-
ceiving Medicaid beneﬁts, but it does not have administrative data on the value of
those payments. In order to assess the quality of the Medicaid expenditure data
in the MCBS, we benchmark it against administrative data from the Medicaid Sta-
tistical Information System (MSIS). Table 3 shows that the MCBS also accurately
measures the share of the population receiving Medicaid payments. According to
MCBS data, there were on average 5.2 million aged Medicaid beneﬁciaries over the
1999-2009 period, versus 4.7 million aged Medicaid beneﬁciaries in the MSIS data, an
overstatement of 10 percent. This diﬀerence may reﬂect a small number of Medicaid
age-65+ individuals who are classiﬁed as “disabled” instead of “aged” in the MSIS

data.6 However, for the period 1999 to 2009, MCBS Medicaid payments for the age-
65+ population are on average 40% smaller than what the MSIS data suggest. As
with the Medicare data, the discrepancy between the MCBS data and the adminis-
trative data is growing overtime. By 2009, Medicaid payments in the MCBS are less
than half of the MSIS estimates.7
    De Nardi et al. (2015) benchmark the MCBS data to survey data from the As-
sets and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old (AHEAD) dataset. They show that,
conditional on income quintile, average total income (including asset and other non-
annuitized income), out-of-pocket medical spending, and Medicaid recipiency rates in
the AHEAD data are slightly lower than their counterparts in the MCBS data. The
MCBS uses administrative data to identify Medicaid recipiency, which greatly reduces
underreporting problems. In addition, the MCBS imputes forgotten out-of-pocket ex-
penses if Medicare had to pay a share of the total cost. In contrast, the AHEAD uses
a more detailed set of questions to measure out-of-pocket medical spending, including
“unfolding brackets”, where respondents can give ranges for their spending, instead
of a point estimate or “don’t know” as in the MCBS.

        Over Time
5.1     The Cross-Sectional Distribution
    The top panel of Table 4 shows a breakdown of medical spending in the MCBS
among payors: out-of-pocket; private insurance; uncollected liabilities for treatments
that have not been paid for; and government. The bottom panel shows a breakdown
of spending among expenditure categories: hospital spending, by inpatients and out-
patients; professional services; nursing home care; pharmaceutical costs; and home
help and hospice care. Both panels use data from all waves.
    The ratios shown in Table 4 are constructed in the same way as the ratios in
Table 2. Mean spending in each category is divided by the mean of total medical

spending, so that the ratios equal the distribution of aggregate medical spending.8
The percentages calculated for the MCBS are fairly similar to those for the aggregate
data for the elderly in 2010 shown in Table 2. In both tables, the government covers
over 65% of the elderly’s medical expenditures. The fraction of costs paid out of
pocket is higher in the MCBS (19.4%) than in the aggregate statistics (13.2%), while
the fraction covered by Medicaid is lower. Drug expenditures are relatively higher in
the MCBS. These diﬀerences may in part reﬂect the lack of Medicare drug coverage
in the years preceding 2006.
  8
   An alternative approach is to construct spending ratios for each individual and calculate the
means of these ratios. Appendix Table A2 displays these ratios.



                                              13
    The two most notable diﬀerences between men and women in Table 4 involve
Medicaid and nursing home care. The fraction of medical expenditures covered by
Medicaid is nearly twice as large for women as it is for men. Similarly, women spend
twice as much on nursing care as men. This is consistent with Table 1, which shows
that Medicaid plays a particularly large role in funding nursing home care. Table 4
also shows that in the aggregate men rely more on Medicare (57.5%) and spend
relatively more on hospital care (40.0%) than women (52.8% and 31.1%, respectively).
This too is consistent with Table 1, which shows that Medicare reimburses nearly 70%
of hospital costs.

                                          14
    is calculated by dividing the average private insurance premium by average total
    medical spending. Many elderly individuals have “Medigap” health insurance plans
    that pay for items such as Medicare co-pays for doctor visits. As it turns out, this
    ratio is 13% (for all), which is very close to the 12.5% share of aggregate costs paid
    for by private insurers.
        Table 5 shows the cross-sectional distribution of medical spending by expenditure
    type and for the most important payor types, with the results for each spending type
    sorted by that type’s spending. The ﬁrst panel shows the distributions of total medical
    spending, total spending excluding nursing home care, and spending on hospitals.
    Individuals in the top 5% of the total expenditure distribution spend $97,880 apiece,
    nearly 7 times the overall average of $14,120, and constitute nearly 35% of all medical
    spending. For hospitals, 50% of individuals have almost zero spending and those in the
    top 5% of the distribution account for over 52% of the the spending. The bottom panel
    shows results for out-of-pocket expenditures, Medicare, and Medicaid. Although
    out-of-pocket expenditures are on average much lower than total expenditures, the
    distribution of out-of-pocket expenditures is more concentrated. Almost half of the
    out-of-pocket expenditures are made by the top 5%. Even with public and private
    insurance, out-of-pocket medical expenditure risk is signiﬁcant.

       Table 6: Mean Medical Expenditures sorted by Expenditure Quintile and Gender.

        To examine how the cross-sectional distribution of medical spending diﬀers by
    gender, we sort medical spending for men and women into quintiles. Table 6 shows
    mean medical spending within each spending quintile. Total expenditures are higher
    for women than men at every spending quintile. This diﬀerence is largely due to
    expenditures on nursing home care. Once we exclude nursing home care, men have
    higher expenditures on average ($11,540 vs. $10,970) and at the top two spending

                                              15
quintiles. Men in particular incur higher hospital costs ($5,390 vs. $4,530), consistent
with Table 4. However, the overall shapes of the medical spending distributions are
similar across genders.


5.2    The Distribution by Income
   To document how medical spending is distributed by income, Table 7 displays
mean income and medical expenditures by gender in the MCBS, broken down by
income quintile. Low-income people consume more medical resources per year. The
higher spending on the poor consists mostly of greater expenditure on nursing homes.
When nursing home care is excluded, the income gradient is much less pronounced.
Excluding nursing home expenditures, men consume more medical resources at each
income quintile. But because women use more nursing home care than men, they
have higher total medical spending at every income quintile.

in the lowest income quintile and $6,270 on those at the top. Out-of-pocket spending
is almost constant across the income distribution. In contrast, Medicaid pays an
average of $3,900 to those in the bottom quintile and only $270 to those at the top,
while private insurance pays an average of $2,420 a year to those in the top quintile
and only $860 to those at the bottom.
    The bottom panel of Table 8 shows a breakdown of expenditures by service item
for each income quintile. Those at the bottom of the income distribution receive
more medical services ($17,410) than those at the top ($12,430). Interestingly, this
diﬀerence seems to be mainly driven by nursing home care expenditures. Once nurs-
ing home care is excluded the diﬀerence in spending between those at the bottom
($11,890) and those at the top ($10,800) almost disappears.



                                           17
5.3    The Correlation Over Time
    The distribution of cumulative medical spending depends not only on the distri-
bution of spending at each age, but also on its persistence: if an individual has high
medical spending this year, how likely is she to have high medical spending next year
as well? Relative to the concentration of medical spending over a single year, there
has been much less work on the concentration of medical spending over multiple years.
Spillman and Lubitz (2000), Lubitz et al. (2003) and Alemayehu and Warner (2004)
describe how lifetime expenditures vary by health and time of death, but they do
not describe the expenditures’ concentration. For the U.S., most of the research has
focussed on the persistence of medical spending across multiple years (e.g., French
and Jones, 2004; Feenberg and Skinner, 1994).
    Feenberg and Skinner (1994) and French and Jones (2004) analyzed the persistence
of out-of-pocket medical spending. Table 9 shows correlations, both in levels and
logs, of all medical spending, all spending excluding nursing home care, and hospital
spending, 1 and 2 years apart: i.e., it shows the correlation of medical spending in
year t with medical spending in years t + 1 and t + 2. The correlation of total medical
spending between adjacent years is 0.57 in levels and 0.61 in logs. The correlation of
total medical spending between years two years apart is 0.40 in levels and 0.53 in logs.
Although medical spending is not perfectly correlated over time, its serial correlation
is still relatively high two years later. Thus, even on a lifetime basis, there is likely
to be a large amount of concentration of medical spending. The correlation drops
slightly when nursing home care is excluded, and it drops considerably when we only
consider hospital spending. Table A3 in the appendix shows the results disaggregated
by gender.

periods and spending bins. Panel A displays one-year transition probabilities and
Panel B displays two-year probabilities for movements between the total medical
spending quintiles shown in Table 6. The row j, column k element of a transition
matrix gives the probability that an individual is in spending quintile k in year t+1
or t+2, given that the individual was in spending quintile j at year t. The tables
show that the correlation of medical spending is concentrated in the top and bottom
tails of the medical spending distribution. Conditional on being in the top quintile
of the spending distribution in a given year, there is a 53.8% chance of being in the
top quintile in the following year, and a 48.2% chance of being in the top of the
spending distribution in two years. Tables A4 and A5 in the appendix report the
transition matrices for total expenditures net of nursing home costs and for hospital
costs, respectively.
    Figure 2 displays a more direct measure of how accumulated medical spending is
concentrated, by displaying the cumulative distribution function for medical spending
averaged over 1-, 2- and 3-year periods. Medical spending is highly concentrated even
when the data are averaged across 3 years. For this to be the case, medical spending

    Table 11 displays more measures of the concentration of medical spending over
diﬀerent durations, namely the Gini coeﬃcient and the shares of total medical spend-
ing, total spending excluding nursing home costs, and hospital spending, for the top
1% and top 10% of spenders. Again, results are shown for 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year
periods. Although medical spending becomes less concentrated as the averages cover
more years, even at 3 years medical spending remains very concentrated.

6       Average Medical Spending Over the Life Cycle
    Figure 3 shows life cycle proﬁles of mean total medical spending. The two graphs
in this ﬁgure plot spending proﬁles, ﬁrst by expenditure type, then by payor type.9
The estimates show that average medical spending exceeds $25,000 per year for those
in their 90s. The top panel shows this is almost entirely due to nursing home expen-
diture. In fact, other forms of expenditure fall with age after age 90. The bottom
panel shows medical spending by payor. Given that nursing home care is mostly paid
either out of pocket or by Medicaid, and that nursing home spending rises quickly
with age, it should come as no surprise that most of the increase in spending with
age is paid either out of pocket or by Medicaid.
    An interesting question is to what extent the way in which medical expenses rise
with age is due to the fact that people require more expensive medical services at
older ages and to what extent is is due to large medical expenditures right before
death. Yang et al. (2003) argue that medical spending increases with age primarily
because of end-of-life expenditures – mortality rates increase with age. Other papers

    We estimate total medical spending on a full set of age dummies, with age topcoded at 100,
without adjusting for cohort eﬀects.

reach similar conclusions using data from diﬀerent countries. For instance, Zweifel
et al. (1999) use Swiss data, Seshamani and Gray (2004) use data from England,
and Polder et al. (2006) use data from the Netherlands. Interestingly, de Meijer
(2011) use Dutch data to ﬁnd that time-to-death predicts long-term care expenditures
primarily by capturing the eﬀects of disability. Yang et al. (2003) ﬁnd that inpatient
expenditures incurred near the end of life are higher at younger ages, while long-term
care expenditures rise with age. Braun et al. (2015) ﬁnd that total end-of-life costs
rise with age. Scitovsky (1994), Spillman and Lubitz (2000), and Levinsky et al.
(2001) have also studied this question.

7      Medical Spending before Death
     It is often argued that people in the U.S. spend too much on health care at the end
of their lives. A number of studies have shown that end-of-life spending is signiﬁcant.
For example, Hoover et al. (2002) ﬁnd that 22% of all medical spending in the MCBS
comes from those in the last 12 months of life.10 Here we revisit and update their
estimates. We estimate medical spending in the calendar year of death, and in the
two years before death. We also compare medical spending before death to total
aggregate medical spending.
     Table 12 presents key facts on medical spending in the ﬁnal three years of life,
relative to medical spending of the whole population. Panel A displays aggregate
statistics on medical spending and mortality for the U.S. in 2008 that are useful
for making these calculations. National statistics for spending come from the aggre-
gate NHEA data. The rightmost column displays corresponding statistics from the
MCBS. Data on mortality comes from the National Vital Statistics Reports (Miniño
et al., 2011). Panel A shows that the MCBS matches the aggregate spending statis-
tics reasonably well, and matches mortality statistics very well, giving us additional
conﬁdence in the data.
     Panel B in Table 12 displays medical spending in the last years of life. The
leftmost “mean spending” column refers to mean spending in the last 1, 2 and 3
calendar years before death. If an individual dies in March, medical spending in the
year of death will refer only to medical spending between January and March. All the
data in Table 12 is for 2008, so spending in the “Next to last” and “Second to last”
years is by people who go on to die in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Spending in the
last calendar year of life is $43,030, or about 6 times average spending for the entire
population and over double the average medical spending of the age-65+ population.
Medical spending in the previous year is $42,810, again about 6 times average medical
spending per person, and spending in the second to last year is $32,860.
     The right-hand columns of Panel B present medical spending in the last years of
life as a percentage of medical spending at all ages, as well as a percentage of medical
spending for the over-65 population. We calculate these percentages by multiplying
the mean spending values in Panel B by the number of deaths in Panel A, and dividing
the resulting product by the aggregate spending values reported in Panel A. By way of
example, data from the Vital Statistics Reports indicate that 2.47 million individuals
died in 2008, of whom 73% were aged 65 or older. Assuming that medical spending

on the dead over age 65 is the same as medical spending for the younger-than-65
population, we can infer that aggregate medical spending on all those who died in
2008 was $43,030 × 2.4720 = $106.4 billion, which constitutes 4.9% of aggregate
medical spending.
    Medical spending for the “year of death” mixes together those who died in January
(and so had only one month of spending in the “year of death”) with those who died
in December (and so had 12 months of spending). To estimate total medical spending
in the last 12 months of life, we apply the approach taken in Hoover et al. (2002).
We estimate the following regression:
                                     √
                       Ei = β0 + β1 mi + β2 mi + β3 m2i + ϵi ,                    (1)

where Ei is total medical spending in the calender year for individual i, and mi is
individual i’s exact month of death, where mi = 1 if the month of death is January
and mi = 12 if the month of death is December. The bottom row of Panel B presents
our results. Using data from 2008, we ﬁnd that 16.8% of all medical spending for
the 65+ population occurs in the last 12 months of life. Using MCBS data for 1992
to 1996, Hoover et al. (2002) ﬁnd that 22% of all medical spending for the 65+
population occurs in the last 12 months of life. Our lower estimate appears to be
the result of using more recent data. For example, if we use data from just 1996, the
estimate becomes 20.9%, much closer to Hoover et al’s. (2002) estimate.
    Because those aged 65 and older are more likely to die, end-of-life spending is
far more important for those over 65 than for the population as a whole. The 65+
population accounts for only 34% of all medical spending, but 73% of all deaths. The
percentage of medical spending at all ages going towards individuals in the last 12
months of life is only 6.7%. Medical spending in the last 3 years of life represents
13.4% of aggregate medical spending. Thus, while end-of-life spending is high in the
United States, it hardly explains all of why medical spending in the U.S. is so much
higher than in other countries. For example, Polder et al. (2006) ﬁnd that 10% of
all medical expenditures in the Netherlands are made in the last year of life, a higher
percentage than (our estimates) for the U.S.
    Figure 4 shows mean cumulative medical spending over the last 12 months of life
as a function of the number of months from death. It decomposes medical spending
into spending by expenditure and payor types. Total medical spending in the last
month of life averages $12,400, the great majority of which is paid by the govern-
ment, through Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans programs. Over the ﬁnal year, total
medical spending is $59,100. Of this total, $42,100, or 71%, is covered by Medicare,

ernment programs. Relative to medical spending for all the elderly (Table 4), the
government picks up a larger share of medical spending amongst those near death,
most notably through Medicare. Out-of-pocket expenses in the last year of life are
$6,500, somewhat lower than in French et al. (2006) or Marshall et al. (2011). Uncol-
lected liabilities are $380, while $3,180 is covered by private insurance. The greatest
expenditure type is hospital inpatients at $24,000, or 41%, followed by nursing home
at $14,990, or 25%. Professional services are $8,500, home health and hospice are
$6,170, hospital outpatients are $2,870, and drugs are $2,560.


8    Conclusion
    We ﬁnd that medical expenses more than double between ages 70 and 90 and that
medical expenses are very concentrated: the top 10% of all spenders are responsible
for 52% of medical spending in a given year. In addition, those currently experiencing
either very low or very high medical expenses are likely to ﬁnd themselves in the same
position in the future. We also ﬁnd that the poor consume more medical goods and
services than the rich, and have a much larger share of their expenses covered by
the government. Overall, the government covers 65% of the elderly’s total medical
expenses. Despite this, the expenses that remain after government transfers are
even more concentrated among a small group of people. Thus, government health
insurance, while potentially very valuable, is far from being complete. Finally, while
medical expenses before death can be large, on average they constitute only a small
fraction of total spending, both in the aggregate and over the life cycle. Hence,
medical expenses before death do not appear to be an important driver of the high
and increasing medical spending found in the U.S.

Appendix A: Supplementary Tables
    Table A1 shows mean Medicaid payments conditional on payment percentile for
both the MCBS and the MSIS (from Young et al., 2012). Our calculations for this
table use the subset of the MCBS that receives both Medicare and Medicaid, the
subset most similar to the subset of the MSIS data used by Young et al. Table A1
shows that in both datasets the least costly 50% of total Medicaid enrollees account for
less than 1% of total Medicaid payments, whereas the most costly 5% are responsible
for over 40% of the total. But even though the MCBS Medicaid data match the
MSIS expenditure shares, they understate the level of spending at all parts of the
distribution.

Table A1: Medicaid Enrollment and Expenditures by Enrollee Spending Percentile, MSIS
          versus MCBS.



    Table A2 presents a diﬀerent measure of expenditure ratios: construct the ratios
for each individual, then average over all individuals. This diﬀers from Table 4 and
Table 2, where expenditures are averaged across all individuals and then used to
calculate ratios. As it turns out, changing the method of calculating ratios has sig-
niﬁcant eﬀects. For example, the share of aggregate medical expenditures covered by
Medicaid is 9.4%, but the average individual Medicaid share is 4.1%. The diﬀerence
arises because taking the ratio of the means weights more heavily those with high
medical spending. Medicaid spending is concentrated amongst a small number of
individuals who consume a very large amount of medical resources. Most individuals
receive no Medicaid assistance at all. Among expenditure types, nursing home care

                                          32
represents 15.9% of medical spending in the aggregate, versus 4.1% when averaged
across individuals. Again, the key diﬀerence is the weighting: the small share of peo-
ple in nursing homes consume a great deal of medical resources, meaning that nursing
home expenditures are responsible for a large share of total resources.
