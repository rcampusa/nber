  COMPARISONS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE
                  DOES THE LEGAL ENVIRONMENT MATTER?


                                    ABSTRACT




       A stylized fact in the growing literature on public sector labor mar-

kets   is that estimates   of public sector union wage premia are significantly

lower than estimates of private sector union wage premia.         In this paper   I



investigate the hypothesis that this difference       may in part be due to the

differing     legal environments in which public and private sector unions oper-

ate.    Using data from the Current Population     Survey and the Census of Popu-

lation,   I   find that public sector union wage differentials    increase signifi-


cantly with the degree of legal protection afforded to the union in bargain-

ing.    However,   the estimated public sector union wage premia when no legal

controls are included in the specification       are close to the estimated premia

under the strongest     legal environment.    Consequently,   while controlling for

the legal environment      in the public Sector is important,    it may not recon—


cUe    the differences between estimated public and private sector union wage

premia.

    One of the "stylized facts" which has emerged from the growing

literature on public sector labor markets is that estimates      of public sector

union wage differentials    are significantly   lower than estimates of private

sector union wage differentials.     In a recent survey, Ehrenberg and Schwarz

(1986) comment on this comparison.

          What is most striking is how small these numbers typically are!
     The estimated relative wage differentials associated with union
     membership or collective bargaining coverage are typically smaller
     than 10 percent and rarely exceed 20 percent. These estimates are
                                                     from private sector
     considerably lower than the estimates obtained
                                                                         have
     studies and they suggest that the relative wage effects of unions
     been less in the public—sector than the private—sector. (p. 1228)

A key Issue Is whether the differences in the magnitudes of union wage

premium across sectors are real or illusory.

     Several arguments     exist as to why at least part of this observed

difference may be illusory.      Public and private sector union wage differen-

tials are typically derived from different wage equation specifications

estimated on different types of data.       The basic difference In the level of


aggregation   of the data used in public and private sector studies has

                                                                           included
resulted in important differences in the types of control variables

in these studies.    Public sector wage equations have focused on economic,

                                           relating to the geographic   area
demographic, and political     variables

containing the bargaining unit.      rn contrast, private sector wage equations

have focused on individual worker characteristics.        Several other specifica-


tion differences    include the treatment of the endogeneity of the union

status of workers,   the treatment   of "threat" or "spillover" effects, and the

treatment of the occupational structure of the work force.1




1Details of these arguments as well as specific references to the empirical
 literature can be found in Ehrenberg & Schwarz (1986) and Freeman (1986).

        Assuming that all of the gap between private and public sector union

wage differentials can not be explained by data or specification

differences,      a second issue is what factors explain the inability of public

sector unions to generate comparable           premiums for their workers.      A natural

starting point is to examine the relative bargaining power between public

and private sector unions.          Previous studies have emphasized     the nonprofit

nature of government employers           and the likely effects this aay have on the

bargaining      procesa.     A second distinction between public and private sector

bargaining      is the legal environment which governs the bargaining process.

Private sector bargaining is governed by a largely uniform set of laws and

court decisions.        The only source of variation       is the ability of a state to

pass a Right-to-Work law.          In contrast,      public sector bargaining is governed

by a set of laws which can vary both between states for a particular group

of workers and between groups of workers within a particular state.                Pubiic

sector bargaining laws range from one extreme of outright prohibitions

against bargaining to the other extreme of a duty of public employers                to

bargain which is backed up with the right to strike or access to arbitra-

tion.     In the best situation,        public sector unions can negotiate contracts

in a legal environment comparable to the private sector.              In the worst

situation,      public sector unions can not negotiate a contract at all.

        The potential      importance   of investigating the role of variations      in

public sector bargaining laws in explaining variations in public sector

union wage premiums was emphasized by Ehrenberg & Schwarz             (1986).

             Somewhat surprisingly, however, there are no studies that have
        empirically  looked at how the nature of impasse procedures affects the
        union/nonuniondifferential    . , the smaller estimated differentials in
                                           .



        the public sector @i reflect smaller actual differentials caused by
        the different nature of laws governing bargaining in that sector.

     In this paper I examine the influence of the legal environment on the

union differentials which are negotiated           In the public sector.     I   compare


union wage differentials   for teachers and po1ice under a variety of

different   bargaining law configurations.         Particular   attention   Is   paid to

the issue of the potential       endogeneity of the bargaining law variables.              The


basic findings are that public sector union wage premiums Increase signifi-

cantly with the degree of legal protection           afforded to the union in


bargaining.     However, the estimated       union wage premia when no legal controls

are inc1uded in the specification          are close to the estimated   union wage


premia under Duty—to-Bargain       laws.     Consequently,   while controlling for the


legal environment    in the public sector is important,         it may not reconcile

differences   between estimated     public and private union wage differentials.



                  SUMMARY OF PREVIOUS STUDIES OF BARGAINING LAWS

     Considerable    attention    has been focused on assessing the impact          of

Right-to-work    laws on unionization rates in the private sector.               Far less


effort has been directed toward measuring the impact of Right-to—work                 laws


on the union wage differential in the private sector.             Two econometric


concerns show up in each of these lines of research.             The first concern is

that there exists unobserved heterogeneity In states which is correlated

both with the presence of a Right-to—Work law and with the level of unioni—

zation.     For example, states with strong anti union          "sentiments' may be


likely to have both a Right—to—Work law as well as lower unionization rates.

This creates a left-out—variables          bias in the coefficient estimate of the

Right-to--Work law.    The second concern is that a simultaneity bias exists.

That is, the level of unionization in a state may affect the probability

that a Right—to—Work law is passed.           States with high levels of unionization
                                        —4—

may be less likely to pass such a law due to lobbying efforts by the unions.

        A variety of methods have been used in previous studies to address one

or both of these concerns.     Luasden & Petersen (1975) anelyze state aggre-

gate unionizatinn rates for the years 1939, 1953, and 1968.          The coefficient

on the Right—to-Work    indicator in the regression using the 1968 data was

negative and significant.     Lumsden & Petersen test for left—out--variable

bias by including the same Right—to—Work      indicator variable in a regression

using the 1939 data.     At this point in time no states had Right—to—Work

laws.     The coefficient estimate was negative,   significant, and of roughly

the same order of magnitude    as the coefficient estimate from the 1968

regression.     They conclude that there is no significant effect of the law

per se on the level of unionization.      The negative effect measured using

the 1968 data simply reflected    lower prelaw levels of unionization due to

other unobserved factors prevailing    in those states.

        Moore & Newman (1975) analyze state aggregate   unionization    rates for

the years 1950. 1960, and 1970.     They address the issue of simultaneity by

estimating the unionization equation using Two Stage Least Squares.          They

fit a model for the process governing the probability         that a Right-to-Work

law is passed in a state.     This model is used to generate predicted proba-

bilities which are used in place of the Right—to—Work         Indicator variable.

They find a negative and significant coefficient for the Right—to-Work

indicator    but a negative and insignificant   coefficient   for the predicted

value of the indicator.     They conclude like Lumsden & Petersen that there is

no effect of the law per se on unionization rates.

        Finally, Ellwood & Fine (1983) address the problem by examining      flows

of unionization generated by NLRB elections.       They argue that flows will be

more sensitive than stocks to changes in the legal environment making it
                                             —5-

easier to measure the effect of the law using flow data.           The data indicate

                                                                        of a
that the flows into unionization drop immediately following the passage

Right—to—work    law and continue to be below the prelaw levels for up to ten

years.   Their estimates imply a long run reduction of 5-10% in the stock of

union members or equivalently a drop of 1-3% in the unionization rate.              For

a sample of seven states they have flow data both prior to and following

adoption of a Right—to—work       law.     They estimate a fixed effect model on data

from these states to test for left—out—variable          bias. Their fixed effect

estimates were virtually       identical    to their earlier results.    Finally,   they

test for simultaneity        by including in the specification an indicator that

takes a value of one for the five years prior to the year the state passed

its Right-to-Work     law.     The simultaneity    argument would predict a negative

coefficient     on this variable.        They find a positive and insignificant

coefficient.       They conclude that the legal environment does have an

                effect on the level of private sector unionization        in a state.
independent

     The effect of Right-to—Work          laws on private sector union wage

differentials     has received less attention       in the literature.   Moore (1980)

examines a single cross section of workers in 1970 drawn from the Income

Dynamics Panel data.         He finds negative and insignificant point estimates on

the Right-to-Work     variable in both the nonunion and union wage equations.

The implied effect of the law on the union wage differential is positive but

insignificant.      Farber (1984) reexamines this issue using data drawn from

the May 1977 Current Population          Survey (CPS).   He finds negative and signi-

ficant point estimates on the Right—to—Work           variable in both the nonunion

and union wage equations.         The implied effect of the law on the union wage

differential     Is positive and significant.        Mo clear picture emerges as to

the magnitude of the effect of the legal environment on private sector union
                                           -6—

wage differentials.     In addition, neither study explicitly tests for the

omitted variable bias or simultaneity bias.

        Studies of the effects of the legal environment on unionization         rates

and wages in the public sector are of more recent vintage.            This reflects

the fact that until recently no comprehensive         data set en public sector

bargaining laws existed.     lchniowski    (1986) examines the effect of

bargaining laws on municipal police unionization.             Hazard models are esti-

mated for the duration until formation of a police bargaining unit in a

city.     He finds that unionization rarely proceeds passage of a favorable

bargaining law.     In addition,    the bargaining laws are the most important

determinants    of the conditional probability of unionization.         Passage of a

Duty—to—Bargain    law significantly    increases   the likelihood of the formation

of a bargaining unit.     Access to arbitration, though, does not significantly

affect unionization.

        Freeman & Valletta (1987) investigate the effect of the legal

environment    on unionization,    employment,   and wages.    Union coverage and

employment    data are obtained from the Annual Survey of Government.          Wage

data are obtained from the 1984 May CPS.         The legal environment     is proxied

by a single index summarizing the bargaining laws in effect.            This is in

contrast to other studies which have tried to estimate separate effects for

different    types of bargaining laws.     They find that more "prounion" legal

environments mre associated with significantly higher union coverage rates,

with significmntly higher employment levels for covered groups of workers,

and with significantly higher union wages.          They do not test to see if the

legal environment    significantly    affects union wage premiums.      No specifica-

tion tests are carried out to check for possible endogeneity of their legal

index.

     Indirect evidence on the effect of bargaining laws on public sector

union wage premiums    Is given In Zax (1985),    In this study, Zax examines the

effect of different    "modes" of unionization on the resulting union wage

premium.    The modes vary from one extreme of an unrecognized union in a city

with no recognized bargaining Units to the other extreme of a recognized

bargaining unit.     He finds that going from the weakest to the strongest        mode

of unionization,    the measured union wage premiums increase from 3.8% to

11.8%.     While controlling   for the mode of unionization   is not equivalent    to


controlling for the prevailing bargaining laws, the findings by Ichniowski

(1986) would suggest that they are strongly correlated.




                         ECONOMETRIC SPECIFICATION ISSUES

     The impression one is left with after reviewing the literature on

bargaining laws is that no consistent set of results exists.         Results vary

with the type of data used and the type of specification estimated.         No

evidence has been found in support of the simultaneity hypothesis while

mixed evidence has been found in support of the omitted variable hypothesis.

In light    of these studies, it remains plausible that the legal environment

is an important    factor in explaining the differences   in union wage differen-

tials between the public and private sector.       While an explicit treatment of

omitted variable bias is warranted,      there is less justification   for concern

about simultaneity.2




      follows for two reasons. First, the connection between unionization
 rates and passage of bargaining laws seems more plausible than a similar
 connection for union wage differentials.   Unionization rates directly
 translate into electoral pressure.   Second, as already pointed out, there
 is no strong evidence to date supporting the direction of causality from
 unionization rates to bargaining laws.

       Each 0f the techniques used in previnus studies to correct for omitted

variable bias has been criticized.                             The first method is to estimate a fixed

effect model using panel data.                            Two problems arise here.       This method can

not be used on a single cross section of data, and the method assumes that

the omitted variables are constant through tiae.                                 The second method is to

explicitly           model the legislative process which determines                      the legal environ-

ment and then to estimate the outcome (i.e. unionization or wage) equation

using Two Stage Least Squares.                            The fundamental problem with this method is

the lack of a convincing model of the legislative process.3                                 This leads to

questionable           identification          of the model through functional fora or

arbitrary       exclusion restrictions.

       Most estimates of private sector union wage differentials have been

based on cross section data such as the CPS.                             Comparisons     with these

previous private sector estimates would be facilitated by using similar data

sources.       This raises the problem of how to deal with omitted variable bias

issues using cross section data.                             In this paper   I   examine three approaches

to this problem. The first approach is to use the group structura                                (ie by

city) which exists in the data.                             I assume that the wage for individual     i    in


city j    is    determined by the following stochastic model.

The composite error term for an individual             consists of a city specific and

an individual specific error component.            I   assume that the a's and        's    are


uncorrelated with each other and that the              's   are uncorrelated with the

included variables.

    The city specific error component captures the combined effect of the

unobserved state and city heterogeneity            (le omitted variables         in Z) on


wages.   If      > 0 and the a's are uncorrelated with X and Z, then OLS will

produce consistent coefficient estimates           but biased standard error

estimates.     Moulton   (1986) demonstrates       that the magnitude of this standard

error bias is likely to be largest for the Z variables                  since they have no

within group variance.           Since the vector Z includes the bargaining law

variables, this can lead to incorrect inferences               as to the significance of

the legal environment.           This problem can be corrected either by recalculat-

ing the OLS standard errors using estimates of                  and          or by estimating a

random effects model.

     A more important problem exists If the a's are correlatedwith

variables     in X and/or   Z.     Previous studies of bargaining laws have argued

that factors such as public sentiment toward unions will affect both the

type of bargaining laws in the state as well as union and/or nonunion wages.

If this sentiment     is picked up In the a's, then both              IlLS   and random effects

will be produce biased estimates of the bargaining law coefficients.

     The advantage       of the wage specification          given In (1) is that the

                                                                                       can be
hypothesis that the a's are correlated with the included variables

investigated     using a Rausman test.       The basic idea behind the test is that

the "within      or "fixed effect" estimates of $ are consistent regardless of

the correlation between the a's and the included variables,                     while the GLS

are consistent only under the null that no correlation exists.                      The test
                                           —10—

consists of -determining if there is a statistically significant                difference

between the Within and the      IlLS   estimates of   fi.



     If   the specification    test indicates that the a's are correlated with

the included variables,     then it may still be possible to obtain consistent

coefficient estimates   by following the Instrumental Variable Random Effects

procedure   (IVOLS) outlined    in Hausman & Taylor (1981).          Assume that the X's

are exogenous and that the source of the correlation with the a's is the set

of bargaining law variables      contained in Z.       In this case, $ can be estima-

ted using the within variation in the X's while the between variation in the

X's can serve as instruments for the Z's.          A second Hausman test can be

carried out to check the validity of this assumption.4

     The second approach to the left—out-variable           problem is to augment

specification   (1) with proxies for the likely omitted variables.              As

mentioned   earlier, states with greater tastes for unionism may be more

likely to pass permissive public sector bargaining           laws.     In this case, the

coefficient on the bargaining laws measures both the direct effect of the

legal environment   as well as the indirect effect of the prevailing union

sentiment   in the state.     The second test of this hypothesis         is   to add the

level of private sector unionism to the public sector wage equations.                 If

private sector union coverage in the state is a good proxy for the prevail-

ing union sentiment,    then controlling for private union coverage should

reduce the degree of bias in the bargaining law coefficients.                 If there is

little change In these coefficients,         then this is further evidence against

the left-out—variable   hypothesis.




4Other Instrumental Variable procedures have recently been discussed in the
 literature.  See Amemiya & MaCurdy (1986); and Breusch, Mizon and Schmidt
 (1987).

     The third approach to the problem is to include the public sector

                                                                 Since public
bargaining laws in a private sector wage specification.°

sector laws are not germane to private sector bargaining,        they should not

have any direct effect on the estimated union wage differentials.         Any

effect of the public sector law variables should be attributed        to the

indirect effect of the prevailing sentiment       toward unionism.   If these vari-


ables have the same qualitative      effect on private union wage differentials

as they do on public union wage differentials,        then this is evidence

supportive of the left—out—variable      hypothesis.6




                                   DATA DESCRIPTION

        1   necessary ingredient for this type of study is a comprehensive      data

set of public sector bargaining      laws.   The compilation of this data was

undertaken by the National Bureau of Economic Research and is discussed           in

detail in Valletta & Freeman      (1985).    For this study, the wealth of legal

information provided in the data have been collapsed        into a few key varia-

bles.       The collective bargaining rights of the union have been summarized         in


three basic categories.       The left—out category consists of states that

either have no laws dealing explicitlywith bargaining rights or that have

laws which provide only 'weak       bargaining rights.7    The second category


°I would like to thank Henry Farber for this suggestion.
61n an earlier paper I focused on the issue of selection bias instead of
 omitted variable bias.   I estimated a multinomial  logit selection model
 where workers selected into one of four labor markets:    private/nonunion,
                                                      I assumed that all
 private/union, public/nonunion. and public/union.
 bargaining laws, public and private, affected a worker's choice of sector
 but that wages were affected only by the bargaining laws applicable to that
 sector.   This led to exclusion restrictions between the choice and the
 outcome equations.   None of the selection effects were significantly diffe-
 rent from zero. The public/union selection effect was large in magnitude
 but imprecisely measured.    In Light of these findings, it seems more fruit—
 ful to investigate sources of biases other than selection effects.
'Weak bargaining rights include situations where the public employer is

 consists of states which have taken strong positions               against public sector

 unions by prohibiting     collective     bargaining.        At the other extreme, the

third category consists of states which have imposed a                                       on
                                                       "Duty-to—Bargain"

their public employers.        In addition to the bargaining rights variables,               two

variables have been constructed which indicate if the union has the right to

strike or access to arbitration          if bargaining results       in an impasse.

Finally, similar to the private sector, public sector union security is

summarized by a Right-to-work          indicator variable.

     The bargaining data is coded separately                for state, police, fire,

teachers,    and other local employees.         Table   1   givea the overall distribution

of the bargaining rights variables            ss well as the distribution       by region.
The unit of observation      in Tables    1   through 3 is a function unit in a

particular     state, ie police in Illinois, teachers is New Jersey, etc.8               As
of 1976 only around 7% of the function units were prohibited from collective

bargaining.     Distinct regional patterns to the bargaining rights exist,                   All
function units in the Northeast         have Duty—to—Bargain       rights.    In contrast,

only 19% of function units in the South had Duty—to-Bargain                  rights, and none

had the additional right to strike or arbitration,                In addition nearly all

prohibitions    against   collective    bargaining were found in the sooth.

     The distribution of public sector Right—to—Work               laws in aggregate and

by region is given in Table      2.     Slightly over 31% of the function units were
covered by these laws.      A similar regional pattern exits for Right—to-Work

laws as for bargaining rights laws.            No function units in the Northeast are

covered by Right-to-Work laws while over 43% of the function units in the



 authorized but not obligated to negotiate with the onion, situations where
 the onion has the right to present proposals, and situations where the
 union has the right to "meet and confer" with the employer.

 arbitration rights are also provided and "weak" if they are not
                                                                 provided.

South are covered.     However,    despite this similarity,      it is not the case

that Right—to-Work    laws are necessarily    synonymous with anti—public         sector

unionism.     To see this, the distribution of public sector Right—to—Work               laws

by type of bargaining rights       is presented    in Table 3.       The same percentage

of function units covered by Right—to-Work         laws have strong Duty—to—Bargain

rights as prohibitions     against collective      bargaining.

     Unfortunately,    there are serious limitations associated with the major

sources of cross section data on public sector workers which can be matched

with the bargaining law data.       The two sources used in this analysis are the

May CPS data and the 1980 Census of Population          (CoP) data.       Data on onion

and nonunion workers is available       each year from the May CPS;          however,

several restrictions    must be met before this data can be analyzed for any

given year.     Since the bargaining    law data is gathered at the state level,

we must be able to identify the state associated with a public employee's

place of work in order to merge       in the appropriate      set of laws.9     For

reasons of confidentiality,       the CPS grouped some states together up until

the 1977 survey;      a worker's    specific state within the group can only be

identified if the worker resides in an identified            SMSA.    To utilize the full

range of variation    in public sector bargaining       laws, we must restrict

ourselves   to analyzing   data from 1977 onwards.         The second restriction       is

that we must have wage data for the worker.           Starting in 1979 the CPS asked

wage questioos only for the two outgoing rotation groups.               As a result the

effective   sample size drops drastically,        making   it impossible    to estimate

separate wage equations    for union and nonunion samples of public employees.




9The appropriate bargaining laws is a function of a worker's place of work
 and not necessarily his/her place of residence. Unfortunately the CPS only
 asks a place of residence question. This will result in some mismatching
 of bargaining laws with workers.
                                            -14-


Consequently,    only the 1977 snd 1978 data can he analyzed as separate cross

sections without resorting       to pooling across years.         This study will analyze

the 1977 CPS data.

        The advantage     of the CPS data   Is that it identifies       the union status of

each public sector worker.        The disadvantage      of the CPS is that it contains

small samples of workers from each type of local function unit.                The problem

of small sample sizes can be overcome by using the 1980 CoP data.                 Combining

the A and 8 samples gives a combined 6% random sample of the population.

Each local public sector employee was selected             from the 1980 CoP as well as

a   1   in 100 subsample of private sector workers.          The principal disadvantage

of the CoP data is that no union question             is asked.   This problem can be

addressed hy restricting the sample to public employees working in central

cilies.      information on unionization      rates for central city public employees

is available     in the 1979 Census of Government         (CoG) data.     For each city,

the CoG data gives both the total number of employees               and the number of

organized     employees    in each function unit.      This data was used to construct

a city/function     unit specific union coverage rate.            As will he discussed in

the next section, separate union and nonunion wage equations                can not be

estimated using the CoP data.         instead, a single wage equation with the

union coverage rate as well as the coverage rate interacted with the

bargaining law variables will be estimated.

         The following selection criteria will be used in creating each sample

used in the estimation.         Workers must be employed full time or part time for

economic reasons in a nonagricultural          job.     All observations with

"allocated" or missing responses        for variables      used in the analysis are

deleted.      For the CPS data, the definition         of labor union used is membership

 in a union or employee association.          For reasons to be discussed below, the
                                         —15-


analysis will be limited to teachers and police.         Summary statistics are

given In Table 4.



                                  EMPIRICAL RESULTS

     Three    groups   of local public workers were selected for potential use in

this study:      teachers, police, and fire fighters.     These three groups were

focused on for two reasons-       First, each group can be identified in both the

OPS and the CoP data.       Second, a close link exists for these groups between

the collective bargaining and the employment files of the SoG data. This

improves     the reliability of the unionization   imputations to be used with the

CoP data.10      Tests were carried out to see if it would be permissible       to

aggregate    some or all of these three groups.       In no case did the data

indicate     that aggregation was justified.    The sample of fire fighters     from

the CPS data was too small to warrant an independent investigation.           As a

consequence,     further analysis was restricted   to the samples of teachers and

police.      In addition,   the CPS sample sizes for the teachers and police were

too small to estimate a random effects model.         Specification   tests for group

error structures were carried out only for the CoP samples.




10The employment file of the SoG data gives both the total number of full--
  time workers as well as the number of organized workers in the function
  unit. The collective bargaining file gives the number of workers in the
  bargaining unit. Both the percent organized as well as the percent in the
  bargaining unit were calculated.  If the percent organized was positive,
  then the unionization rate was set equal to the percent organized. If the
                                                                unit was
  percent organized was zero and the percent in the bargaining
                                                      to the percent in the
  positive, then the unionization rate was set equal
  bargaining unit. For some groups of workers such as clerical workers, the
                                                    function units In the
  bargaining unit can contain workers from several
  employment  file. In these cases, the percent io the bargaining unit can
  not be accurately calculated.

The CM statistic is distributed as a standard normal variate.                                     The values of

the CM statistic             for the teacher and police CoP samples were 9.61 and 9.50

respectively.            Clear evidence of a group error structure                          is indicated.    Both

OLS and CLS estimates                    are reported in Tables 5 and 6 for the Cop samples.

The variance of the city—specific                                 error component   is saall relative to the

variance of the individual specific error component.                                    Similar to the find-

ings in Moulton (1986), the most significant difference                                   between OLS and CLS

is the precision of the coefficient estimates                                 for the variables    with no

within group variance.                    Allowing for omitted state and/or city variables

through inclusion              of a city specific error component can make an important

difference in the inferences drawn from the data.

     The last specification                             issue to investigate        is the possible correlation

between the city error component and the independent variables.                                     The test of

environment on public sector union wage differentials               is presented in

Table     7.    Examination    of the coefficients      for the ooolegal variables   will he

left to the reader.           When no bargaining law variables are included in the

specifications,       the estimated    union wage differentials      range from 7-11% for

teachers and 9-20% for police.           With the exception of the CPS teacher

sample, these estimates are close to the estimates which assume that a Duty—

to—Bargain       law (with no access to strikes or arbitration)         is in effect.

This soggests that the failure to control for the legal environment                  is not

the principal       explanation of why public onion wage differentials         are below

private sector estimates.

        The similarity between these two sets of onion wage differential

estimates,       however, masks    the important role that the legal environment

plays    in determining wage outcomes.          Prohibitions   against collective

bargaining generally result in union wage premiums which are insignificantly

different from zero.           The exceptions   to this result are the sizeable

positive differentials produced by the separate onion and nonunion wage

equations.        Public sector onion wage differentials        are positive in states

with Meet—and—Confer          laws (or no specific laws) and statistically      signifi-

cant for the CPS teacher sample and the CoP police sample.                In almost every

case,    the union wage differential       increases when Meet—and—Confer      laws are

strengthened to Duty—to—Bargain laws.              The one exception is the police

differential       calculated using the separate onion and nonunion wage coeffi-

cients.        The magnitude   of the increase in the onion premium varies both hy

type of worker and sample.           For teachers, the union premiom increases from
                                          -19—

13.9% to 20.3% in the CPS sample and from 2.5% to 9.6% in the CoP sample.

For police, the union premium increases          from 11.8% to 12.4% in the CPS

sample and from 12.8% to     217%   in the CoP sample.     Expanding    the legal

rights of pubiic sector unions from simple Meet-and--Confer laws to Duty-to--

Bargain laws is associated with a 6-8% higher union wage differential.                The

one exception    is the modest 0.4% increase in the premium for the CPS sample

of police.

     While the separate nonunion and union samples from the CPS are small

and may produce unreliable     estimates,   it is still    interesting to look at the

differential    effects of the legal variables by union status of workers.

Results differ by type of worker.         For teachers, there does not appear to

be any evidence that bargaining laws add or detract from union threat

effects.     For nonunion teachers,    prohibitions against collective       bargaining

do not significantly     lower wages   (by eliminating the threat effect( and

Duty-to—Bargain    obligations do not significantly       raise wages    (by strength-

ening the threat effect(.      Instead, the bargaining      laws affect union wsge

differentiais     through their influence on union wages.        In contrast,    for


police there is more evidence of a threat effect.           Since no police

hargaining units existed in states which prohibited collective bargaining,

no union coefficient could be estimated for this variable.              There is no

evidence that prohibiting collective        bargaining significantly reduces non-

union police wmges.     However, nonunion police in states with Duty—to—Bargain

laws receive significantly     higher wages than other nonunion police.          This

later finding is consistent     with a union threat effect.

     The final aspects of the legal environment to examine are the access by

the union to strikes or arbitration       and limitations placed on union security

clauses    in states with right-to-work     laws.    The evidence on the effect of a
                                         -20—

strike threat on wage outcomes is liaited to the CPS sample of teachers.

Although the CoP sample of teachers is considerable larger, no teachers from

this saaple worked in states with right—to--strike provisions.              The evidence

indicates that teacher onion premia are significantly            lower in states which

allow teachers to strike.     Disaggregatingby nonunion and onion indicstes

that the strongest effect is wages of unionized teachers.             Similarly,    the

data indicate that union wage presia in general are lower in states which

allow access to arbitration.       This effect is significant,       though, only for

the CPS sample of teachers.       Finally,   in contrast to Farber's        (1984) finding

that private sector union wage differentials         are higher in states with

Right-to—Work   laws, the data indicate that public sector union wage differ-

entials are generally   lower in states with Right—to—Work          laws.    This effect

is significant only for the CPS saaple of teachers.

     Recall that the Hausman specification         test for correlation between the

city—specific   error component    and the included variables was the first of

three types of tests for left—out-variable         bias.     No strong evidence of

correlation was indicated by the data.          The second test is to include the

level of private sector unionization in the state as a proxy for the

prevailing attitude in the state toward unionism.             If the bargaining laws

are primarily   proxies for these underlying       attitudes and if private sector

union coverage is strongly correlated with these attitudes,            then controlling

for private union coverage should significantly            diminish the explanatory

power of the bargaining   law variables.        Examining    columns (6) of Tables 6

and 7 indicate that including private sector coverage in the specification

primarily   affects the coefficient on public sector coverage and does not in

general diminish the importance of the legal variables.             In most cases, in

fact, the coefficients on the legal variables         increase in absolute value.
                                               —21—

The results of the second test do not reject the null hypothesis of no

significant left—out-variables         bias.          The third test is to include the

public sector bargaining law variables in a privste sector woge regression.

The null hypothesis would suggest thst public sector bargaining laws should

have no effect on private sector union wage differentials.                The alternative

hypothesis would suggest    that they would affect these differentials               in the

same way as they do in the public sector.               The data indicate that public

sector bargaining laws do significantly               affect private sector wages, but do

not significantly   affect private sector union wage differentials.                Specifi-

cally, private sector wages    (private sector union wage differentials)                 are

insignificantly    lower (insignificantly        higher( in states which prohibit

collective bargaining, significantly           higher (insignificantly     lower) in

states which impose a Duty—to—Bargain,           and significantly     lower   (insignifi-

cantly lower) in states which provide access to arbitration.12                 Again, no

evidence supporting the left—out—variable hypothesis               is indicated    in the

data.




                                         CONCLUS ION

        The aim of this paper has been to examine the role of the legal

environment    in determining the magnitude of public sector union wage

differentials.     Specifically,   I    investigated the hypothesis       that estimates

of public sector union wage differentials               are lower than estimates    of

private sector union wage differentials due to the weaker legal rights

afforded to moat public sector unions at the bargaining table.                 Empirical

estimates    of the effects of the legal environment were obtained by taking

advantage    of the wide variation      in public sector bargaining laws across


    full set of private sector regression results is available                 upon request.

states.     The possibility that these bargaining laws are correlated with city

or state—specific    left—out—variables    such as sentiment   toward unions was

addressed    in three separate fashions.

     The results indicatcd that there was little difference in public sector

union wage differentials    when no bargaining laws were controlled for and

when a Duty-to—Bargain     law was assumed.      This indicates that the legal

envircnment    is not the likely explanation      for the observed disparity   in

union wage differential    estimates across sectors.       However, the data did

indicate that the legal environment was an important determinant uf public

sector union wage differentials.      Generally,     the measured differential

increased as the bargaining rights of the union were strengthened.             Finally,

no significant evidence of left—out—variable bias         in the bargaining    law

coefficients    was indicated by the three tests which were carried out.
