This study uses micro data and an overlapping generations (OLG) model to show that general equilibrium
(GE) forces are critical for understanding the relationship between aggregate fertility and household
savings. First, we document that parents perceive children as an important source of old-age support
and that, in partial equilibrium (PE), increased fertility lowers household savings. Then, we construct
an OLG model that parametrically matches the PE empirical evidence. Finally, we extend the model
to conduct a GE analysis and show that under standard assumptions and with the parameters implied
by the data, GE forces can substantially offset the PE effects. Thus, focusing only on the PE can substantially
overstate the effect of aggregate fertility on household savings.

1        Introduction

The linkage between aggregate fertility change and economic performance is central to models


of economic growth. A large literature has provided important evidence relating aggregate


fertility change to growth (e.g., Romer, 1986; Kremer, 1993; Jones, 1999; Galor and Weil,


2000), growth and inequality (e.g., De La Croix and Doepke, 2003), culture (e.g., Fernandez


and Fogli, 2006; Fernandez and Fogli, 2009), social security (e.g., Boldrin and Jones, 2002;


Boldrin, De Nardi, and Jones, 2005; Song, Storesletten, Wang, and Zilibotti, 2012) and


savings (e.g., Becker and Barro, 1988; Barro and Becker, 1989; Manuelli and Seshadri, 2009).


In particular, Modigliani and Cao (2004) argue that changes in aggregate fertility can also


lead to signicant changes in household savings through their eect on the dependency ratio


and wage growth.          The authors support their claim with descriptive time series data from


China, where a substantial reduction in fertility during the 1970s and 1980s resulting from


family planning policies was accompanied by a rapid rise in the savings rate.


        Such time series correlations are dicult to interpret since aggregate fertility change is


likely to coincide with other macroeconomic changes, such as changes in the returns to human


capital or in the relative female wage.          In the case of China, an additional concern is the


possibility that the increase in savings and the reduction in fertility are both consequences of


the massive economic reforms that took place. Moreover, fertility is likely to aect savings


through mechanisms other than the pure aggregation channel proposed by Modigliani and


Cao (2004). The recent literature has therefore taken advantage of more specic demographic


shocks (e.g., the introduction of China's family planning policies, the implementation of family


policies in Bangladesh under the leadership of the International Centre for Diarrhea Disease


Research, or the birth of twins) to empirically estimate the causal eect of fertility on savings.


These studies nd a large negative eect of fertility on savings (e.g., Ruthbah, 2007; Banerjee,


Meng, and Qian, 2011; Ge, Yang, and Zhang, 2012; Choukhmane, Coeurdacier, and Jin,


2013).
          1 Studies such as Curtis, Lugauer, and Mark (2011) and Choukhmane, Coeurdacier,


and Jin (2013) then use the evidence from micro data to calibrate partial equilibrium (PE)

    1
        This paper supersedes Banerjee, Meng, and Qian (2011).




                                                       1
overlapping generations (OLG) models to understand the quantitative eect of an aggregate


fertility change on savings.


       While these studies provide compelling evidence that fertility aects savings decisions,


they are unlikely to identify the correct quantitative eect of a change in aggregate fertility


on savings. This is because an aggregate change in fertility may alter other economic factors


that aect savings, such as the interest rate and the rate of wage growth, through their eect


on the capital-labor ratio (e.g., Barro and Becker, 1989; Galor and Weil, 1996).
                                                                                             2 The quasi-


experimental micro evidence, which relies on comparisons of households with dierent levels


of fertility within the same economy, nets out such general equilibrium (GE) eects, without


which we cannot obtain the correct full equilibrium eect of a change in fertility. In particular,


the fact that higher fertility leads to higher future interest rates and to slower wage growth,


both of which may lead to higher savings, has the potential to partly undo the negative PE


eect of fertility on savings that is estimated in the micro empirical analyses.


       The goal of this paper is to use a combination of parameter estimates from a natural


experiment and other micro data and careful modeling to understand whether studies of


the relationship between aggregate fertility and savings need to take GE eects seriously in


drawing macro policy conclusions from micro empirical estimates. While the principle that


GE eects matter is widely accepted (e.g., Heckman, Lochner, and Taber, 1998 and Acemoglu,


2010), concrete examples of their potential quantitative importance are scarce. To the best


of our knowledge, we are the rst study of the relationship between aggregate fertility and


savings to provide such an example.


       Our study proceeds in several steps. First, to motivate the study and obtain parameter


values for calibrating the model later in the paper, we use nationally representative survey


data to document that contemporary Chinese parents perceive children and especially sons


as an important source of old-age support.           At the time of this study, there were no data

   2
       The seminal study of Barro and Becker (1988, 1989) models children as consumption and introduces
endogenous fertility and intergenerational transfers to optimal growth models. Becker and Barro (1988) uses
an open economy framework, where interest rates are exogenous.      Barro and Becker (1989) uses a closed
economy framework where fertility increases the capital-labor ratio and interest rates. Note that the main
dierence between our framework and theirs is that we view children as an investment good. This is discussed
in detail later in the introduction.




                                                     2
that contained both total fertility history and data on income and expenditures. Thus, we


conducted a survey that provides this data and use it to establish that for individuals age 50


65, the shift in Chinese family planning policies from pro-natal to anti-natal reduced fertility


and increased household savings, particularly for those who had only one daughter. Because


in these cohorts there was no sex-selection we argue that this can be interpreted as the


causal eect of the family being restricted to one daughter. Moreover both the data and our


estimated parameter values suggest that child-related expenditures are similar for daughters


and sons. Therefore the nding that a reduction in fertility increases savings more for those


with only-child-daughters is evidence for models where parents take savings decisions based


on how much nancial or psychological old-age support they can expect to get from their


children (e.g., Caldwell, 1978; Weil, 1997; Boldrin and Jones, 2002; Tertilt, 2005).
                                                                                                   3


       Next, we characterize the savings decision in a parsimonious Diamond-style OLG model


with the additional feature that parents anticipate have to spend resources on bringing up


children but the expect transfers from children in old age and both of these inuence their


savings decisions. We calibrate the PE version of this model to match the empirical ndings.


Then, we introduce GE eects to our model by endogenizing wages and interest rates (e.g.,


Barro and Becker, 1989; Galor and Weil, 1996).
                                                            4


       We nd that depending on parameter values, GE eects can either dampen or exacerbate


the PE eects of an increase in fertility (or leave them unchanged). On the one hand, GE


eects may be more muted because the rise in the interest rate and the fall in wage growth


generated by an increase in fertility reduce the present value of future transfers from children


and thus induces parents to save more.               On the other hand, GE eects may be stronger


because of the income eect from the rise in the interest rate. Using the parameter estimates

   3
       Caldwell (1978) argues that children provide old-age security.   Weil (1997) nds that intergenerational
transfers occur in both directions  from parents to children and from children to parents. Boldrin and Jones
(2002) uses a growth model to formalize the ideas of Caldwell (1978) and shows that it can account for
demographic patterns in the data. Boldrin, De Nardi, and Jones (2005) goes further to argue that if children
provide old-age security, then the observed cross-country dierences in fertility rates can be explained by
cross-countries dierences in social security.   Tertilt (2005) also considers children as a form of savings for
parents and nds that banning polygyny is likely to decrease fertility and increase savings.
   4
       That savings rates are associated with interest rates in practice is consistent with Horioka and Wan's
(2007) nding that, in China, average household savings rates at the province level is positively associated
with real interest rates.




                                                        3
we obtain from the micro-empirical analysis, we nd that the GE eect of increased fertility is


only 30% of the PE eect estimated from micro data. This is true as long as the intertemporal


elasticity of substitution is not too far below one, which is consistent with the data.


   Since our estimates of the parameters are not always very precise and the match between


our model and reality is, as always, inexact, we check the robustness of our GE estimates by


varying the parameters over a wide range, and for the most part the results remain the same.


We then consider a number of extensions of our model that bring in endogenous fertility,


endogenous transfer rate and endogenous human capital investment. Our results are robust


to these extensions as well.


   The key contribution of our paper is to provide a concrete example of the importance of


GE eects for understanding how a shift in aggregate fertility aects savings. Applying PE


estimates to macro policy without interpreting the results with the appropriate model can


therefore be very misleading.   In a methodological sense this is similar to Weil (1994) who


notes that aggregate savings is negatively associated with the size of the elderly population


despite the lack of micro evidence that the elderly dis-save. To reconcile these patterns, he


develops a model to demonstrate that in the absence of full annuitization, if the elderly saves


for bequests, then the anticipation of income from bequests will cause children to save less.


At the same time, our study illustrates the importance of obtaining reliable micro evidence


since the quantitative eects are sensitive to parameter values.     In this sense we address


the general methodological concern that there is often a discordance between the macro


models used in policy evaluation and the microeconomic models used to generate the empirical


evidence (Browning, Hansen, and Heckman, 1999) and provide an example of a growth


models that are built up from well-identied parameters estimated using experimental and


quasi-experimental data as proposed by Banerjee and Duo (2005)(for parallel exercise on the


macro impact of microcredit see Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2012)).


   More generally this work is related to studies that explore the eects of aggregate fer-


tility change going back to the classic work of Becker, Murphy, and Tamura (1994) and the


important subsequent work by De La Croix and Doepke (2003), Galor and Weil (2000) and




                                               4
Manuelli and Seshadri (2014). In emphasizing the macro eects of demographic changes in


the contemporary Chinese context, our study is closely related to Song, Storesletten, Wang,


and Zilibotti (2013), which shows that the demographic transition in China implies that


pay-as-you-go pension systems have redistributive eects across generations.


       Finally, our study adds to the previously discussed studies that explain Chinese savings


rates with demographic factors. For example, Song and Yang (2010) elaborates the argument


originally made by Modigliani and Cao's (2004) and provides evidence that links the spike


in aggregate savings, the growth rate and the attening of experience proles over time.


Rosenzweig and Zhang (2014) explains the savings of the young with family size and transfers


of housing from parents to children       .   Finally, in their innovative work, Wei and Zhang (2011)


shows that savings rates for middle-aged parents today are partly driven by the anticipation


of paying bride prices for sons in a future where there will be many more men than women


in the marriage market.
                             5


       For policy makers in China, our results suggest that abandoning family planning policies


and allowing fertility to rise, if our model is to be believed, will have little eect on household


savings.


       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 documents parents' beliefs of the importance


of children as a source of old-age support.           Section 3 documents the relationship between


fertility change and savings.        Section 4 presents the results from the model, including the


calibration of the parameters and the quantitative estimates.                 Section 5 oers concluding


remarks.
   5
       There also a number of studies of Chinese savings that emphasize factors other than demography: Cha-
mon and Prasad (2010) provides evidence that nancial underdevelopment and the precautionary motive are
important contributors to savings; similarly, a recent study by He, Huang, Liu, and Zhu (2014) nds pre-
cautionary saving and increased employment risk due to the downsizing of the state sector to be important
determinants of household savings; and Horioka and Wan (2007) nds that savings are associated with lagged
savings rate, the income growth rate, the real interest rate and the ination rate.

2    Children as Old-Age Security

In this section, we briey summarize we believe that the parents we study, who are 50 to 65


years old urban workers in 2008, anticipate that their children will be an important potential


source of support in old age; and that typically, sons are likely to provide more support than


daughters. This is certainly what one would have expected based on Confucian traditions, but


in contemporary urban China, state-provided pensions are a very important source of old-age


support (Song, Storesletten, Wang, and Zilibotti, 2012). However, since pensions have not


been indexed to the high income growth rates of urban areas, the real value of pensions have


tended to decline rapidly over time. In contrast, children's earnings will (on average) increase


with prices and thus remain a stable source of support for parents for long haul.       Also, it


is important to note that the elderly almost always live with their children (or other family


members) when they are very old.      There is very little old-age care in the form of nursing


homes, etc., that we see in more developed economies.


    Outside of pensions and children, urban households have access to few savings instruments.


Bank interest rates are very low and though more recently access to nancial markets has


expanded, in 2007, almost all household savings (other than housing) in urban areas were in


bank deposits (He and Cao, 2007).


    Existing descriptive evidence support the conventional wisdom that elderly parents in


urban China receive substantial old-age support from children, which is increasing in the


number of children, whether a parent has a son and the age of the parent. Using data from


the 2011 CHARLS survey, which samples a nationally representative set of households (see


the Data Appendix for a discussion of all of the surveys used in this section), Figure 1 plots


urban net household transfer income from children as a fraction of total household income


against the age of the main respondent.      The main respondent in the survey is typically


the oldest male household member.      The gure shows that total transfer income increases


with age and the number of children (total fertility). For example, for those with one child,


net transfer income increases to approximately 20% of total income by age 90.         For those


with two children, transfer income increase to almost 80% of total income by age 90. Since



                                               6
the CHARLS only reports transfers for parents who do not live with their children, we also


examine co-habitation patterns. For this, we can use the UHIES, which is a representative


sample of urban households, of which we have data from nineteen cities in nine provinces.


Using the information on cohabitation and the relationship to the household head, we are


able to calculate the fraction of parents living with a child for the entire urban population.


Figure 2 shows an inverse U-shape.           The fraction of parents living with children decreases


from almost 100% at age 40 to around 50% by age 65 and returns to 100% by age 90.


Unfortunately, the UHIES does not allow us to distinguish whether parents live with their


daughter or son. However, the CHARLS (2011) data on cohabitation reports that for urban


households, approximately 20% of adult sons (age 4564) and only 10% of adult daughters


live with elderly parents (age 65 or older).


        Finally, we examine the survey evidence on parents' perceptions of old-age support. In


the CHARLS (2011), respondents were asked Whom do you think you can (most) rely on


for old-age support?.        Figure 3 plots the answers given by urban households according to


the age of the household head.           It shows that, on average, less than 10% of respondents


rely on savings, approximately 60% choose pension or retirement salary and slightly less


than 30% choose children (the other possible responses to this question were commercial


pension insurance and other). As parents age from 65, when most workers retire to 90, the


percentage reporting pensions as the most important source of support declines from 65% to


40%, whereas those reporting children as the most important increases from 20% to 60%.




3        The PE Eects of Fertility on Savings

3.1 Family Planning Policies
In its early years, the communist government (1949 ) had a pro-natal stance on fertility


(Chang, Lee, McKibben, Poston, and Walther, 2005; Scharping, 2013).
                                                                                    6   The government


pursued policies that encouraged fertility such as conditioning food rations on the number

    6
        Most famously, Ma Yinchu's New Population Theory, which argued that a rapidly growing population
would hinder economic development and that the government should implement population control policies,
was ocially discredited as being pro-Malthusian and anti-Socialist (Yang, 1986).



                                                      7
of family members and making access to contraceptives dicult until a certain number of


children had already been born. Discussions about curbing population growth were conned


to the top policy makers until the early 1970s.             However in 1971, Mao Zedong and Zhou


Enlai made a sudden public policy shift and announced that population must be controlled ,


which signaled a turning point in family planning policy practice in China.
                                                                                            7 Eorts began


in earnest in 1972 with measures to clarify the shift in family planning policy and energize


the bureaucracy.
                      8   By 1973, 23 provinces had established the necessary bureaucracies for


implementing family planning related policies.


       Our study focuses on the unanticipated and unprecedented initial shift in family planning


policy from anti-natal to pro-natal that occurred in 1972, which encouraged birth spacing


of three to four years.       An unanticipated increase in birth spacing is likely to reduce total


fertility since, for example, some mothers will become too old to have a second child after the


required waiting period. In urban China, the reduction due to birth spacing was magnied


by the subsequent introduction of the One Child Policy in 1980 (1979 in Shanghai), when


the government took another unanticipated move of restricting fertility to only one child.
                                                                                                              9


When this occurred, parents who had their rst child after 1976 (1975 in Shanghai) and were


waiting to pass the required birth spacing to have their second child found that they would


remain one-child families.
   7
       On Feb. 15th, 1971, Zhou Enlai re-emphasized the importance of family planning when meeting with the
provincial representatives at the National Planning Conference in Beijing: It's important to control population
growth. Government should advocate late marriages and birth control, and vigorously publicize these policies
from now on. On July 8th, the State Council published the Report on Doing Well in Family Planning. The
written instruction by the State Council on the document pointed out that Family planning is an important
issue that Chairman Mao has advocated for years. All levels of ocials must treat the issue seriously.
   8
       On January 17, 1972, provincial leaders attended a meeting organized by the Ministry of Public Health
where the central government demanded that local governments publicize and enforce Mao's instructions
on family planning, and instructed all levels of government to establish or reinforce their bureaucracies for
organizing or implementing family planning related tasks. In May of that year, the Ministry of Public Health
organized a national workshop on family planning measures where all provinces had to participate. The details
of family planning policy history is documented (in Chinese) by the China Population Information Network
(POPIN), a branch of the China Population Development and Research Center (CPDRC or CPIRC) on their
website.

       The One Child Policy (OCP) punished households that had more than one child with nes, job loss, and
the loss of access to public goods, and rewarded those with only one child with bonuses.       Family planning
polices also became better dened over time. For example, in 1978, the state dened details on things such
as what counted as late marriages and the bonuses and subsidies for workers and farmers if they go through
sterilizing operations, etc. See The Report on the State Councils Family Planning Groups First Meeting
(1978).

3.2 Estimating the Eect of Fertility on Savings
We will use household-level data to rst demonstrate two reduced form relationships:                               (i)


family planning reduced fertility; (ii) family planning increased savings.                      These estimates,


together, imply that reduced fertility increased savings. Since parents traditionally rely on


sons more than daughters, fertility from the perspective of parents thinking about future


transfers is a weighted sum of children, where daughters receive less weight than sons. Since


we do not know the weights, we simply treat daughters and sons separately and estimate the


following reduced-form equation




                               y ij = Œ¥pij + Œ±mij + Œ∂(pij √ó mij ) + ‚àÜXij + Œ∏j + Œµij .                             (1)



yij ,   for household      i   living in region   j,   represents outcomes like the total number of children,


savings, etc. We specify that it is a function of: a dummy variable for whether the rst child


was born in or after 1972,           pij ; a dummy for whether the rst child is male, mij ; the interaction

term between         pij   and   mij ;   a vector of household-level controls,    X ij ;   region xed eects,     Œ∏i ;

and a household-specic error term,               Œµij .   The standard errors are clustered at the sex (of the


rst child), year of birth (of the rst child) and city level for all of our results.
                                                                                                 11   Œ¥   is the eect


of having a rst child in 1972 or afterwards for households that have a daughter for the rst


child.     Œ¥+Œ∂    is the eect of having a rst child in 1972 or afterwards for households that have


a son for the rst child.


        These estimates test the hypothesis that parents perceive children, especially the male rst

    The variation in the implementation of the One Child Policy in rural China can be seen in the China
  10

Health and Nutritional Survey, which reports the relaxations of the policy that are allowed at the community
and year level. In contrast, the data show very little variation in these variables across communities or over
time for urban areas. These descriptive statistics are available upon request.
  11
        There are 131 clusters. We can alternatively cluster the standard errors at the sex and year of birth (of the
rst child) level and then correct for the small number of clusters by estimating wild bootstrapped standard
errors.     The rst stage and reduced form estimates are very similar between these two levels of clustering.
These estimates are available upon request. There is no correction for the small number of clusters for the
2SLS estimates.

child, as an important provider of old-age support. The claim that having one's rst child


during or after 1972 decreased total fertility both when the rst child is female and when he


is male, translates into a test for whether both              Œ¥ÃÇ < 0   and   Œ¥[
                                                                              + Œ∂ < 0.    Similarly, the claim


that parents rely more on sons than daughters for old-age support, and therefore parents who


gave birth in or after 1972 and had a rst male child need to save less and can retire earlier


compared to parents who gave birth in or after 1972 and have a rst female child would imply,


Œ∂ÃÇ < 0    in the savings equations. The vector          Xij   includes household-specic controls that we


will discuss and motivate later as they become relevant.


       For a sense of the implied magnitudes, we also estimate an instrumental variables speci-


cation, which assumes that the only thing that changed in 1972 for this population was the


number of children they could have




                            y ij = Œ¥nij + Œ±mij + Œ∂(nij √ó mij ) + ‚àÜXij + Œ∏j + Œµij .                            (2)




Here,     nij   is the number of children the family eventually had and is instrumented by                    pij .

Similarly,      nij √ó mij   is instrumented by    pij √ó mij .

       The aim of our study is to assess whether GE eects should be taken seriously for un-


derstanding the relationship between aggregate fertility and savings. Thus, the instrumental


variables estimates are used to illustrate the approximate magnitude of the relationship be-


tween fertility and savings and to provide parameter values that are useful for the calibration


of our model in Section 4. We do not interpret the 2SLS literally as the causal eect of fertility


on savings since there are potential violations of the exclusion restriction.
                                                                                           12


       Note that there is little sex selection in our sample.            Female infanticide rates in urban


China are very low and we restrict our sample to households that bore children before sex-


selective abortion became available in the 1980s. Consistent with no sex-selection, 50.3% of


all children in our sample are male. Thus, we interpret the coecient for the sex of the rst


child,    mijt ,   as exogenous. Also, note that given the introduction of family planning policies,

  12
       It is possible, for example, that even if the actual number of children was unaected, the option of having
another child later in life might have independent eects.




                                                         10
we have many fewer observations for second or higher parity children than for rst parity


children.     For this reason, our sample size is not large enough to examine the dierential


eects of male and female higher parity children.


       There are two important caveats to our strategy. First, households in the control group


will be older on average than those in the treatment group, which can aect savings patterns


if parents of the two groups are at dierent parts in their life cycle (even within the narrow


age band that we examine). One way to address this is to control for the age of the household


head. However, while this controls for age, it can introduce selection bias if parents choose


fertility timing based on factors that are correlated with savings later in life. We will discuss


this in further detail when we interpret the results.


       This raises a second diculty. For example, parents that have children later in life may be


more risk averse, which will, in turn, cause them to save more. To investigate this possibility,


we directly examine the correlation between age at rst birth and savings, controlling for the


same baseline controls. We nd no correlation.

3.3 Data
To document the relationship between fertility and household savings, we use the urban


household portion of the larger survey that we collected in 2008, called the 2008                Rural-Urban
Migration in China (RUMiC). At the time of our study, these were the only data that allowed
us to measure both the total number of children ever born and savings rate for a sucient

  13
       There are several additional facts to keep in mind for interpreting the coecients.   First, the policies
for population control gradually tightened over time. This means that the eect of family planning policies
on total fertility is not uniform across households that have their rst child in or after 1972; the later they
have their rst child, the fewer children they will have. This is important to keep in mind when interpreting
the magnitude of the estimates, which give the average post-reform eect. Second, family planning policy is
relatively uniform across urban areas (e.g., Ebenstein, 2010; Qian, 2009) and there are relatively few ethnic
minority households (who get some exemption from the policy in most Chinese cities). Our empirical strategy
estimates the average change after 1972.
  Note that our identication strategy assumes that the shift to fertility control in the early 1970s was
unanticipated. For example, if parents anticipated fertility control policies, those who desired more children
may have had more children than otherwise in the years leading up the policy. This would cause an Ashenfelter
dip and our strategy will overestimate the eect of the policy on reducing the number of children. If parents
who intentionally had more children also had a lower propensity to save for reasons unrelated to fertility,
this will also cause our strategy to overestimate the eect of the policy on increasing savings. The historical
evidence discussed earlier suggests that it is very unlikely that there was anticipation.    To the best of our
knowledge, no existing study of family planning in China mentions this possibility.

number of households for statistical analysis.
                                                      14 In this paper, we only use the urban data


because family planning policies and access to savings instruments were relatively uniform


in urban areas, and equally importantly, because there was little sex-selection. The data are


organized as a household-level birth cohort panel according to the birth year of the rst child.


The empirical analysis focuses on households that had their rst child ve years before or after


the policy shift in 1972, i.e., 196777, an arbitrary interval that we chose to be symmetric


around the reform date. Figure 4a shows the kernel density plot for the distribution of the


ages of rstborn children in our sample.


       We restrict the sample to households headed by individuals who are 50 to 65 years of


age to focus on a point in the lifecycle when individuals are most likely to be saving for


their retirement.      This is the period of the life cycle when children require relatively little


expenditure from parents, when parents are still working, and when children are not yet


making transfers to parents. Figure 4b is a kernel density plot for the distribution of the ages


of the household heads in our sample.


       This is also the age range when co-residence is very low in the urban population.
                                                                                                     15 This


allays two concerns: (i) that the households we observe are headed by individuals who are


selected on characteristics such as propensity to save; (ii) that the household savings decisions


that we observe are inuenced by expenditure on children. Indeed, there are very few house-


holds with children living at home in our sample.
                                                          16 The narrow age band is also advantageous


because individuals are likely to be on the same part of the life cycle and therefore comparable


to each other. Note that this sample is younger than the sample of elderly parents ages 65 or


older with which we examined transfers and cohabitation in Section 2.


       The nal sample contains 475 households in eighteen cities. Table 1 shows the descriptive


statistics.     Households in our sample on average have total incomes of 49,584 RMB and

  14
       See the Data Appendix for a detailed discussion of the RUMiC and other survey data from China.
  15
       A 0.1% sample of urban households in eighteen provinces (UHIES, see Data Appendix) show that less
than 10% of individuals of this age range co-reside with children or parents. This is the lowest for any age
group.
  16
       In our sample, there are only ve households with any children eighteen or younger and only fteen
households with any children age 22 or younger. Figure 4c plots the kernel density plot of the distribution of
the youngest children in our sample.

expenditures of 32,421 RMB. Savings, the dierence between total income (except for transfer


income) and total expenditures, are on average 17,162 RMB.
                                                                            17 The average savings rate is


26%. Figure 4d plots the kernel density of household savings in our sample. It is approximately


normally distributed and takes negative as well as positive values. Figure 4e plots the kernel


density of household savings rates in our sample.


       The average household has approximately two children, 50.3% of which are male.                        On


average, parents had their rst child in 1973 and their youngest child in 1976. This means


that when the survey was conducted in 2008, households in our sample on average had children


aged 3235 years. Our sample contains households headed by individuals 5065 years of age.


On average, household heads are approximately 61 years of age and have approximately ten


years of education (i.e. one year of high school education). Approximately 42% of our sample


is headed by women.

3.4 Results
The Eects of Family Planning on Fertility                      Table 2 presents the estimated eects of


the introduction of family planning on fertility. Column (1) shows a specication that only


controls for city xed eects. The estimates show that parents that gave birth to their rst


child in 1972 or afterwards had, on average, 0.6 fewer children. In column (4), we estimate


equation (1) where we add controls for whether the rst child is a son and the interaction


of that term with whether the rst child was born during 1972 or afterwards. The estimate


for the uninteracted post-1972 term shows that parents who had their rst daughter in or


after 1972 had approximately one less child (-0.8). The sum of the uninteracted post-1972


term and its interaction with the rst child being a son, shown at the bottom of the table


along with its p-value, is also negative and signicant. But it is smaller in magnitude than

  17
       These variables are dened in detail in the Data Appendix. In results not presented in this paper, we used
several alternative denitions of expenditures, such as with or without including social security contributions
(which can be viewed partly as a form of savings).      These make little dierence to our results and are not
presented for brevity. They are available upon request.
  18
       This does not necessarily mean that these women had no male spouse  it could just be that the survey
respondent was the oldest female in the household. To be cautious and to avoid the potentially confounding
eects from having a female household head, we will control for this in our regressions.




                                                        13
the uninteracted term (-0.4).


       The results mean that parents who had their rst son in or after 1972 were also likely to


have had fewer children than those who had their rst son before 1972 but the reduction in the


number of children was smaller in magnitude than for parents that had a rst daughter. This


is most likely driven by the boy-biased stopping rule: before 1972, some parents stopped


having children once they had a son, with the result that males have on average fewer siblings


than females. This can be seen in the negative coecient on the dummy variable for whether


the rst child is a son.
                             19 All of the coecients discussed here are statistically signicant at


the 1% level. In columns (2)(3) and (5)(8), we add controls which we will discuss in the


next section.


       The results in Table 2 conrm that the introduction of family planning reduced total


fertility and that there is a prejudice in favor of sons. Both of these ndings are important to


keep in mind for interpreting our results later in the paper.




The Eect of Family Planning on Savings                      Next, we examine the eect of the introduc-


tion of family planning on savings. We estimate the same regressions as before, except that


we replace the dependent variable with household savings rates. Table 3 shows the reduced


form results. Column (1) presents the estimates when we only control for city xed eects.


On average, parents that had their rst child after 1972 saved 6,175 RMB more in 2008. The


estimate is statistically signicant at the 1% level. In column (2), we control for basic demo-


graphic characteristics of the parents: the age of the household head and its squared term,


the educational attainment of the household head and its squared term. These are important


since income and consumption patterns, and thus savings patterns, can dier by age (even in


our limited age range). Similarly, educated parents may have a dierent propensity to save


than less educated parents. Column (2) shows that including these controls has little eect


on the estimated eect of having the rst child in or after 1972.


       As we discussed earlier, controlling for the age of the household head introduces a specic

  19
       Consistent with the stopping rule, on average, boys in our sample come from households with 1.7 children,
while girls come from households with two children.




                                                        14
type of selection: it raises the question of whether parents that chose to have children at


an earlier time in life will save less than parents that chose to have children later in life for


reasons other than the dierence in total fertility. To address this, we drop the two controls


for the age of the household head in column (3). The estimate is only slightly smaller than


the one in column (2) and is statistically dierent from zero at the 1% level. The estimates


in columns (2) and (3) are not statistically dierent from each other.


       In column (4), we introduce controls for the sex of the rst child and its interaction with


whether he/she is born in or after 1972. We return to a specication where we only control


for city xed eects.        In column (5), we add the four controls for parental characteristics


(age and its squared term, the years of education and its squared term).                   The estimate of


the uninteracted eect of having a rst child in or after 1972 shows that parents that have a


daughter as a rst child in or after 1972 save 12,613 RMB more than parents that have a rst


daughter prior to 1972. The interaction eect shows the dierential eect for parents who


have their rst child in or after 1972 but who have a son. The sums of the uninteracted and


interacted eects are shown at the bottom of the table. This coecient, 1748, is positive, but


small in magnitude and statistically insignicant.


       Thus, parents that have their rst child in or after 1972 save much more if their rst child


is a daughter and may save a little more if their rst child is a son. Given the earlier results


that parents who had their rst child in or after 1972 also had fewer children on average,


especially if the rst child was a daughter, these results are consistent with parents saving


more when they have fewer children.
                                             20


       In column (6), we remove the controls for the age of the household head and its squared


term for the reasons that we discussed earlier. The estimates change little. In column (7),


we add additional controls. The control for whether the head of the household is under 55


years of age addresses the possibility that being over the mandatory retirement age (from

  20
       Note that the uninteracted dummy variable for whether a rst child is a son is large, positive and sta-
tistically signicant. This variable, which reects the eect of having a rst child who is male prior to 1972
may partly reect the fact that such households had fewer total children because of the stopping rule (recall
Table 2 column (4) shows that the coecient of the rst child being on the total number of children is -0.455).
Fewer children can, in turn, results in lower expenditures, and higher savings.




                                                       15
public enterprises) increases unemployment probabilities and savings behavior. Controlling


for the age of the youngest child addresses the possibility that having a young child increases


consumption and aect savings. The dummy variable for whether the youngest child is under


22 years of age also addresses this point. Finally, we control for whether the mother is the


household head in case this variable reects intrahousehold bargaining power and, thereby,


savings behavior. In column (8), we include all of the controls in column (7) except for the


age of the household head and its squared term. The estimates are precisely estimated and


statistically similar to the baseline in column (5).


       To summarize, the estimates in Table 3 show that parents that had their rst child in


or after 1972, in particular those with daughters, save more.               It is also interesting to note


that the estimates change very little with the changing controls.                 This is consistent with


our identication assumption that the introduction of fertility restrictions was randomly


assigned.
             21



The Implied Eect of Fertility on Savings                     We use 2SLS to scale the reduced form


estimates from Table 3 and interpret the instrumented estimates as a rough approximation


of the eect of fertility.      In Table 4 columns (1)(3), we report the instrumental variables


estimates. The absolute value of the instrumented estimates is roughly similar in magnitude


to the reduced form estimate. Column (3) shows that an additional child reduces savings by


approximately 18,570 RMB if the rst child is a daughter. This is statistically signicant at


the 1% level. The interaction eect of the number of children with a dummy for rst child


being male is positive and signicant at the 1% level. As before, this suggests that family


size matters less if the rst child is male.         This is shown more formally by the sum of the


uninteracted and interacted eects of the number of children, which is -7,518 RMB for the


level of savings in column (3).         The joint estimates are statistically insignicant (they and

  21
       We also conduct a placebo experiment to examine the possibility that our post-1972 variable is picking
up parents who prefer to have children later in life. We estimate an equation similar to equation (1), except
that we replace the post-1972 dummy variable with the household head's age at rst birth (both by itself and
interacted with a dummy for whether the rst child is a son). If our main results were driven by selection,
should nd the coecient for the interaction eect to be positive. We nd no eect: the coecient is 0.00187
and the standard error is 0.00777 (these results are not reported in tables).




                                                      16
their standard errors are not reported in the tables). We also see that the eect of the rst


child being male is strongly negative and signicant, consistent with the theory that parents


who have an oldest son expect that they will be taken care of.


       Finally, we consider the alternative mechanism raised by Wei and Zhang (2011) that


parents in regions with strong male-biased sex ratios and who have sons must save so that


their sons can obtain brides in the future.            We directly control for the interaction term of


regional sex ratio and a dummy variable for whether the rst child is a son (the uninteracted


eect of regional sex ratio is already controlled for by the city xed eects).
                                                                                             22 Our prior is


that this mechanism is less relevant for our study because there is little sex imbalance for


these cohorts. Indeed, column (4) shows that our key results are very robust to the inclusion


of this control.
                   23



The Eect of Fertility on Earnings                  Table 5 reports the instrumented eect of fertility


on earnings. For brevity, we report the 2SLS estimates. Column (1) shows that an additional


child results in 11,236 RMB less income in 2008 for parents if the rst child is a daughter.


Fertility has little eect on income for parents whose rst child is a son (‚àí11, 236              + 8, 636 =

‚àí2600).      Columns (2)(7) show that this is mainly driven by wage income. These results are


consistent with the notion that parents with only one daughter work more in order to increase


savings for old age.


       We acknowledge that in inferring the stock of savings from savings in one year, we must


assume that the two variables are positively correlated. For example, our interpretation would


be misleading if parents with more children accumulated more assets than parents with fewer


children and therefore had stopped saving before the age at which we observe them (50


65).     We believe that this is unlikely since more children require more expenditures when


the children are young. So, if anything, parents with more children would have accumulated


less assets before age 50. In urban China, the two main savings vehicles are savings deposits

       Regional sex ratio is measured as the fraction of males of those born during 19491975 in each city. We
experimented with several alternative measures and always obtain similar results. Estimates using these other
measures are available upon request.
  23
       Note that the uninteracted eect of whether the rst is a son is no longer meaningful by itself since it
captures the eect of having a son as the rst child in regions where there are no males.

and housing. Since savings deposits generate interest income and real estate generates rental


income, we can investigate this alternative explanation by examining interest income and


rental income, which should scale with the stock of assets. Column (5) of Table 5 shows that


there is no relationship between the instrumented fertility variable and interest and rental


income.
           24



The Eect of Fertility on the Savings Rate                      We recognize that fertility aects many


aspects of people's lives (e.g. it aects both level of savings and income). However, for the


purpose of the calibration, it will be convenient to summarize the eect on fertility by a


single variable, the savings rate. Since we wish to compare these results with a model where


only the number of children changes, we focus on the instrumental variables estimate. These


are reported in Table 4.         Columns (5) and (6) show that each additional child reduces the


savings rate by 11 percentage points. Column (7) shows that for parents with rst daughters,


additional children reduces the savings rate by 16 percentage points, while for those with sons,


an additional child reduces savings rates by four percentage points            (‚àí0.158 + 0.118 ' ‚àí0.04).
We note that the estimates on the savings rate are less precise than the estimates on savings


levels. This is likely due to the fact that fertility and the sex of the eldest child also aect


income. This is another reason to interpret the instrumented estimates on the savings rate as


illustrative.




3.5 Interpretation
The main empirical nding is that the reduction in fertility caused by the introduction of


family planning policies increased household savings, especially for parents with only one


daughter. This is consistent with the descriptive evidence discussed in Section 2 that parents


see children, and particularly sons, as an important source of old-age support.


       Note that our results also suggest that the relationship between fertility and savings is

  24
       In our data, we also observe households' own durables such as refrigerators, motorcycles, and cars; and
the imputed value of housing. We nd suggestive evidence that parents with children (instrumented) have, if
anything, more assets than parents with fewer children. The estimates are imprecise and are available upon
request.

driven by anticipated transfers rather than child-related expenditures. For example, consider


the alternative explanation that daughters and sons provide the same level of transfers to par-


ents, but parents with only one daughter save more because daughters cost less to raise than


sons. This is inconsistent with the stopping rule that we see in the data (see Table 2) which


suggests that parents prefer to have sons.             If sons and daughters provide the same level of


support and daughters cost less, then parents should instead prefer to have daughters. More-


over, we note that for the cohort of urban children that we are studying, major expenditures


related to child rearing (child care, housing, schooling, and even food) were state-provided.


Thus, there was little cost dierence between male and female children.
                                                                                       25




4         A Model of Fertility and Savings

The empirical estimates showed that an additional child reduced savings for a household that


lives in an otherwise identical economic environment as a household that has one less child.


However, if we are interested in the eects of a change of aggregate fertility, the assumption of


an otherwise unchanged economic environment is unlikely to be right. A change in aggregate


fertility has an impact on the economic environment, for example, through its eect on factor


prices, which in turn aects savings.
                                                26   The micro empirical evidence cannot therefore be


directly used to predict the relationship between aggregate fertility and savings. In order to


address this concern, we now develop a simple overlapping generation model of savings that


helps us to interpret the empirical results. We begin with the simplest version of the model


to build intuition and then proceed to a more quantitative version.

    25
         For example, in the 1989 UHIES, total expenditure for urban households with at least one male child was
on average 1122 RMB and for households with at least one female child was on average 1129 RMB. The gap
is similarly small for other years (19902005).
    As emphasized by Wei and Zhang (2011), the tendency in China in recent years has been towards a bride
price rather than a dowry, which would raise the cost of male children, though in this cohort, which predates
sex-selective abortions, this eect is probably not very important either way.
    26
         For example, Horioka and Wan (2007) nds limited evidence that, in China, average household savings
rates at the province level are associated with real interest rates.

4.1 The simplest OLG Model
The empirical ndings that the policy-driven reduction in fertility increases household savings


are consistent with the qualitative evidence that parents anticipate more transfers in expecta-


tion when they have more children. We therefore start from a variant of the classic Diamond


OLG model with two additional features: (i) children transfer a fraction                            œÑ   of their income to


parents, (ii) parents pay a linear cost, a             Œ∏   fraction of their income, to raise each child. We do


not model the decision to have children, but assume that every household is endowed with


an exogenous number of children             ni .   This choice is due to the fact that we want to consider


the eect of an exogenous change in fertility, as generated by the One Child Policy (or its


relaxation), on savings. Endogenous fertility is nonetheless discussed in Subsection 4.5.1. We


assume log utility, a Cobb-Douglas production function, full depreciation of capital within


one generation (given that a generation is 25 years, this is not a restrictive assumption) and


constant productivity growth at an exogenous rate                      1 + g.   The assumption of log utility im-


plies that income and substitution eects perfectly oset each other, so that a change in the


interest rate does not have any direct eect on savings. We relax this assumption later. The


economy is inhabited by a continuum of households with mass                               1.   Households are identical


except for the number of children. Household i, with children                       ni , solves the following problem

From this formula, it is clear that the model predicts that households with more children

save less. More specically, the number of children,                  ni ,   impacts the savings rate through two


channels. First, if       ni     increases, then parents have to spend more on children, so that their


disposable income is reduced and consequently they save less. We name this the expenditure
                                                                                             

channel. Second, if       ni     increases, then parents expect to receive more transfers in old age, their


need to save for retirement is therefore not as acute and this causes them to save less. We


call the latter mechanism the transfer channel.                   An additional child decreases the savings

     As we have demonstrated, this PE model is able to account for the cross-households


relationship between fertility and savings.                  However, a change in aggregate fertility has an


impact on prices as well. In order to discuss how aggregate savings are aected, we therefore


need to understand the aggregation and GE properties of the model.




4.1.1 GE
In order to nd the GE solution, we need to show how the model aggregates. Dening                                        n    and
                                                                                                                   ¬¥

s=        si di.   Aggregation is trivial due to the fact that households dier only with respect to


the number of children, and savings rates are linear in                      ni .
                                                                             ‚àÇsi
     The empirical results provide us with estimates of
                                                                             ‚àÇni , while, as already pointed out, we

on Chinese savings rates. To this end, we need to solve the GE of the model.


     We rst focus on steady states. The standard law of motion of capital for the Diamond

Comparison of PE and GE eects

                                                                                               

note that       ‚àÇP E,EQ is made of two       parts: (i)    ‚àÇP E,Expend ‚â° ‚àí                1+Œ≤       Œ∏   and (ii)   ‚àÇP E,T ransf ‚â°

‚àí       1+Œ≤     n    Œ±(1+Œ≤)+(1‚àíŒ±)œÑ     .   Part (i) is the expenditure channel: an additional child de-


creases savings due to the fact that current income is reduced by direct expenses for child

support. Part (ii) is the transfer channel evaluated at the equilibrium interest and savings


rates: an additional child increases the transfers received while retired so that households can


aord to save less.
                       27 The transfer channel,     ‚àÇP E,T ransf ,   is equal to zero when       œÑ = 0,   while it


is negative for all other admissible values of       œÑ.

       Second, notice that    ‚àÇGE,EQ    can be rewritten as




                                      ‚àÇGE,EQ = ‚àÇP E,Expend œï (Œ±, Œ≤, œÑ ) ,


where     œï (Œ±, Œ≤, œÑ ) ‚â§ 1   for all parameters and is equal to         1   only if   œÑ = 0.     From this last


equation, we see that absent any transfer from children to parents (i.e.,                 œÑ = 0),   we will get


‚àÇGE,EQ = ‚àÇP E,EQ :         the PE and GE eects of fertility on savings are identical because the


expenditure channel is identical in PE and GE. In contrast, for any positive                      œÑ , ‚àÇGE,EQ >

‚àÇP E,EQ ,    so that the eect of an additional child on saving is smaller in GE than in PE.


       It is important to note that the extent to which GE and PE eects of fertility on savings


are similar depends on the relative contributions of the expenditure and transfer channels


in explaining the PE relationship between fertility and savings.                  If the PE relationship is


generated only by the expenditure channel, as in the case in which                    œÑ = 0,   then the PE and


GE are identical. Instead if the PE relationship is generated only by the transfer channel, as


in the case in which       Œ∏ = 0,   then the GE eect is muted, and thus very dierent from the PE


one. In Section 4.3, we use the empirical estimates to assess the relative contributions of the


expenditure and transfer channels and quantify the dierence between PE and GE.




Discussion
PE and GE eects are dierent for two reasons: (i) in GE, the transfer channel is muted, so


that    ‚àÇGE,T ransf = 0;   and (ii) in GE, the expenditure channel is smaller than in PE, which is

  27
       Note that an additional child provides a negative income shock through channel (i), while it provides
a positive income shock through channel (ii).     Our interpretation of the timing of this model is that the
negative income shock happens when the household is saving while the positive income shock happens when
the household is dissaving.   Note that when we observe these households in the data, children are already
adults and beyond the age when they major expenditures are needed. The interpretation of the expenditure
eect therefore rests on the idea that households spent more on their children when their children were young,
thus postponing other expenditures (house purchase, house repair, etc.) until they are older.




                                                      23
given by   œï (Œ±, Œ≤, œÑ ) ‚â§ 1.

   We rst discuss (i).        An additional child provides a benet in the future: parents need


to save less today because they are expecting to receive more transfers from children after


retirement. The present value of these future transfers is lower if the interest rate is higher.


This is what Summers (1981) called a wealth eect, to distinguish it from the income eect of


increasing the interest rate, which exactly osets the substitution eect in this log utility case.


In GE, an increase in aggregate fertility raises the interest rate and under the assumptions of


log utility and full depreciation, this consequent reduction in the value of the transfer exactly


osets the direct impact of increased fertility on total transfers. As a consequence, the transfer


channel is eectively turned o:        ‚àÇGE,T ransf = 0.

   Next, we discuss (ii). The expenditure channel does not directly depend on the interest


rate. This is because both the spending on children and the savings decision are made in the


same period.     However, in GE, the direct eect of an additional child on spending reduces


aggregate savings, which then implies capital scarcity and higher interest rates. The resulting


reduction in the value of future transfers leads, as before, to higher savings, which partly


compensates for the reduction in savings coming from the expenditure channel. This is why


we nd that    œï (Œ±, Œ≤, œÑ ) ‚â§ 1.    Obviously, when there are no transfers from children (œÑ   =0   ),


this eect is shut down and        œï (Œ±, Œ≤, œÑ ) = 1.


Out of Steady-State Dynamics
So far, our focus has been on steady states.            We now show that the previous results, and


in particular the important role that GE forces have on the relationship between fertility,


transfers and savings, hold on the transition path from one steady state to another. The only


change that occurs when we consider the transition path is that there is a wage eect as well


as an interest rate eect: wage growth is slowing down (relative to steady-state trend) and the


interest rate is rising as the labor force grows (because of increased fertility). Both of these


eects encourage parents to save more: the interest rate eect for reasons already discussed


and the wage eect because lower children's earnings imply lower transfers in the future.

       More formally, we can substitute the equilibrium expression for interest rate,                  1 + rt+1 =
  1‚àíŒ±
Œ±kt+1 ,    and wage,    wt = (1 ‚àí Œ±) ktŒ± ,    in the formula for the savings rate to obtain:


                                                                                
                                        Œ≤                         œÑ ni        kt+1
                          si,t =               (1 ‚àí œÑ ‚àí Œ∏ni,t ) ‚àí      (1 + g) Œ± .

We can further manipulate this expression, substituting the law of motion of capital, which


must hold even out of steady state, and summing over all households in order to solve for the


aggregate savings rate on the transition path



                                                  Œ±Œ≤ (1 ‚àí œÑ ‚àí Œ∏nt+1 )
                                         st =                          .
                                                 Œ± (1 + Œ≤) + œÑ (1 ‚àí Œ±)

                                                                                            ‚àÇst        ‚àÇs
This formula mirrors the steady state formula in equation (6), such that
                                                                                           ‚àÇnt+1   =   ‚àÇn ,   ‚àÄt.   In


other words, in this example with full depreciation and log preferences, being on the path


to a steady state is identical with being at the steady with respect to how fertility aects


savings. This is because the smaller rise in interest rate along the transition path (because


capital does not jump to its new steady state value) is compensated by the reduction in wage


growth (which dissipates when we reach the new steady state).




4.2 Generalizing the model
In order to bring the model closer to the data, we enrich the set of demographic features and


relax the assumption of log utility in favor of a CRRA utility function.




Demographics            We introduce two new elements into the previous model: (i) we allow a


household to include a father and a mother, both of whom transfer to their own parents;


(ii) we distinguish between sons and daughters, to match the fact that parents rely more on


sons than daughters for old-age support. We assume that males and females earn the same.
                                                                                                                    28


However, daughters transfer a fraction,              Œª < 1,   of what sons transfer to their parents.
                                                                                                                    29

  28
       We could in principle allow for earnings to be dierent between men and women by adjusting the relative
shares of income transferred by men and women.
  29
       We could alternatively assume that females earn a fraction   Œª   of males and transfer the same proportion
of their income to parents.




                                                        25
Following the discussion in Section 3.5, we assume that the cost of raising children is the


same whether they are a boy or a girl.

stitution dierent than one, we use a CRRA utility function,                       u (x) =   1‚àíœÅ , where œÅ is the

inter temporal elasticity of substitution (IES). If                œÅ > 1,   then the IES is smaller than 1, which


implies that an increase in the interest rate decreases savings because the substitution eect


is weaker than the income eect.             œÅ=1         gives the log utility case already analyzed.

where   nm   and   nf   are the aggregate numbers of sons and daughters fertility, and         s   is the


aggregate savings rate.


   The steady state savings rate is the product of two square-bracketed terms. Within the


second bracket, the rst term is the cost of an extra child and the second term captures the


fact that an extra child brings more future income and hence reduces savings. In GE, these


two PE eects are augmented by two more eects, both operating through the denominator of


the second term. The rst is the wealth eect resulting from the increase in the interest rate


caused by the increase in fertility. The second is the feedback from the increase in savings,


which pushes the interest rate down and therefore mitigates the wealth eect.


   The rst square bracket captures the income and substitution eects resulting from the


increase in the interest rate. Assuming that        œÅ>1   (we later argue that this is the interesting


case), the increase in the interest rate induced by the increase in fertility must reduce the


part of savings that is determined by the income and substitution eects. This reduction in


savings in turn has a feedback eect which further raises the interest rate and further reduces


savings. This positive feedback loop is the reason why the GE eect can be larger than the


PE eect. We will provide some examples when we present the quantitative results.




4.3 Using the Micro Evidence to Identify Model Parameters
In this section, we use the micro empirical evidence from earlier to pin down some of the


key parameters of the model and predict the GE relationship between fertility and savings.

In particular, as previously emphasized, we wish to use the empirical estimates in order to


understand the relative weights that the expenditure and transfer channels have in explaining


the estimated PE relationship between households savings and fertility.


       The regressions from Section 3.4 give us two coecients that are useful for identifying


the relative magnitudes of the expenditure and transfer channels.                       The results in Table 4


column (7) show two relationships: (i) that households with only one son save on average


approximately 10 percentage points less than households with only one daughter; and (ii)


that households with two children save on average approximately 10 percentage points less


than households with only one child.
                                                 30       Admittedly, the coecients are not very precisely


estimated.      Thus, in Section C in the Online Appendix, we conduct a robustness exercise


to show how our results are sensitive to dierent parameter values.                      Finally, we note that


the average savings rate in our sample, which allows us to pick the discount factor                     Œ≤,   is 26


percentage points.


       Empirical results (i) and (ii) identify the contributions of the expenditure and transfer


channels to savings as a function of the parameter                 Œª,   which captures the relative transfers of


a daughter as a function of those of a son. As an intermediate step, it is useful to redene


the expenditure and transfer channels in the complete model.
                                                                                 31 We call the two channels


‚àÇÀúP E,Expend    and   ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf   to distinguish them from the previous formula of the simplest


model. They are given by

                                                      "                    #
                                                     Œ≤ÃÉt+1 (1 + rt+1 )‚àí1
                                  ‚àÇÀúP E,Expend   ‚â°                           Œ∏,                              (10)
                                                   1 + Œ≤ÃÉt+1 (1 + rt+1 )‚àí1

       The coecients are the following:   # kids -0.158, # kids times 1st is male 0.116, 1st is male -0.215.
Ignoring the constant, xed eects and controls in the regression, the predicted savings rates for households
with dierent numbers and sexes of children are the following: 1 son  ‚àí0.158 + 0.118 ‚àí 0.215 = ‚àí0.255, 1
daughter  ‚àí0.158, 1 son + 1 other child 2(‚àí0.158) + 2(0.118) ‚àí 0.215 = ‚àí0.295, 1 daughter + 1 other child
2(‚àí0.158) = ‚àí0.316. Thus, the dierence in savings rate between a household with only one son and only one
daughter is ‚àí0.255 ‚àí (‚àí0.158) ‚âà 0.1, and the dierence between households with two children and households
with one child is around 0.099, which is the average of ‚àí0.295 ‚àí (‚àí0.255), ‚àí0.295 ‚àí (‚àí0.158), ‚àí0.316 ‚àí
(‚àí0.255), ‚àí0.316 ‚àí (‚àí0.158).
  31
       The introduction of CRRA utility slightly alters the formula for the expenditure and transfer channels,
which now both depend on the values of the IES (Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution) and the interest
rate. Note that in PE, we can decompose the eect of an additional child on savings in the direct eect from
higher immediate expenditures (the expenditure channel) and the indirect eect from expected future transfers
(the transfer channel). Thus, we can still consider the formula under CRRA as capturing the expenditure and
transfer eects. Taking GE eects into account will aect savings through both the channels.

     In order to identify        ‚àÇÀúP E,Expend ,      we use empirical result (ii). According to the model, the


dierence in the savings rate between a household with one child and a household with two

we have

Equations (12) and (13) can be solved to obtain values for the expenditure and transfer


channels as a function of          Œª:

                                                                   

                                              ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf = 0.10                    .
                                                                           1‚àíŒª

It is immediately obvious that               ‚àÇÀúP E,Expend      is decreasing in   Œª,      while   ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf   is increasing in


Œª.   Intuitively, if    Œª   is close to one, parents expect similar transfers from daughters and sons.


For parents with sons and daughters to have very dierent savings, the level of the transfers


must be high enough to magnify the relatively small gender dierence in transfer rates into


large dierences in transfers and hence savings, which implies that                                 ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf   must be very


large. If   ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf    is large, all of the dierence in savings between households with one and


two children will be driven by the expectation of future transfers, and the expenditure channel



                                                                  29
will thus be of limited relevance, which explains why                   ‚àÇÀúP E,Expend     is instead decreasing in      Œª.

       Since it is costly to raise children, we assume that             ‚àÇÀúP E,Expend ‚â• 0.       This restriction implies

transfer considerably less than sons.             The range of                       corresponds to
h                   i
 0, 21 ‚àÇÀúP E,T ransf      i.e., the empirical evidence implies that the transfer channel dominates the


expenditure channel.


       Next, we want to solve for the primitive parameters                     Œ∏   and   œÑ.    To do this, we need to


pin down a few additional parameters. In particular, equations (13) and (12) show that we

                                    At+1 wt+1                                            At+1 wt+1
need to choose values for
                                      At wt ,   1+r   and   Œ≤ÃÉ .      We calculate
                                                                                           At wt , the growth rate of

wage income, from the UHS data. We use the average real deposit rate in China as the value


for    r.   Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti (2013) reports that the average real deposit rate in


China between 1998 and 2012 is equal to               0.91%.       We use this estimate. We then notice that


the average savings rate is strictly increasing in               Œ≤ÃÉ   and we thus pick         Œ≤ÃÉ   in order to match the


average savings rate in our data, which is equal to                     26%.   In order to calculate the average


savings rate, we need to pick a value for the average number of children. We use                               n = 1.88,

which is the average number of children in the sample used for our regression analysis. Then,


for a given value of        Œª,   we can calculate the corresponding values of                 Œ∏, œÑ .

       In Table 6, we report the estimated parameter values for the two extreme cases of                             Œª=0
              1
and     Œª=    3 . The value of      œÑ   implies that an adult male transfers between 8% and 15% of his


income to his parents. This is consistent with the UHIES data, which report that total transfer


expenditures are approximately 8% of total household income for the average household with


a male household head between 25 to 40 years of age.                           Our estimated value of           œÑ   is thus


consistent with the limited empirical evidence.
                                                            32


       The value of    Œ∏   is estimated to be no more than 10%, which implies that every child costs


no more than        10%     of household income. This is roughly consistent with the data reported


by the      China Health and Nutritional Survey, which shows that an urban household in 1989
  32
       We acknowledge that assessing the plausibility of the transfer rate is dicult. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no reliable data on transfers to parents at the individual level. Moreover, the ability of children to
insure old parents in bad states of the world and cohabitation during old age is likely to be very valuable to
parents and is dicult to measure or monetarize.




                                                         30
spends approximately 8% of total income on food, clothing and schooling for children.
                                                                                                                             33


       The value of      Œ≤   depends on the value of                  œÅ,   and thus varies for dierent calibrations. For


our preferred estimates,               œÅ = 1,       and   Œ≤   is equal to 0.995. This means that to match the high


savings rate in the data, individuals need to be quite patient.




4.4 Quantitative Results
With the estimates of the primitive parameters, we can now quantify how the GE eect relates


to the PE eect. Before doing so, we need to discuss how we deal with the interest rate within


the model. In the calibration exercise, we have used the market interest rate that households


face on deposits.            The model has instead a prediction for the marginal product of capital.


The marginal product of capital implied by the model in the baseline equilibrium, the one


with     s = 0.26    and     n = 1.88,          is not equal to the observed returns on savings in China. We


thus need to calibrate a last parameter  the wedge between the marginal product of capital


and the interest rate that households face on savings.                              We call this wedge           œà,   which solves
              h                              i
                    Œ±        n
                                 
1+r = œà            1‚àíŒ±       s       (1 + g)    , where the left-hand side of the equation is the market interest


rate in China, as previously discussed, and the right-hand side is the wedge multiplied by the


marginal product of capital in equilibrium as a function of savings rate and fertility, evaluated


at the baseline parameters of                  n = 1.88 and s = 0.26.           We assume that    œà    is invariant to policies


that aect fertility and we thus keep it constant throughout the counterfactual experiments,


so that changes in            n      and   s   are going to be reected into changes of the interest rate that


households face. Given this setup, we can vary the exogenous level of fertility                                       n,   and solve


for the endogenous savings rate                     s   that is predicted by the model.


       Using this simple procedure, we compute the hypothetical aggregate savings rates that


the model implies for values of                    n between 1 and 3.         We repeat the same procedure for dierent


values of     œÅ   between 0.5 and 3. In Figure 5, we plot aggregate savings rates as a function of

  33
       This result must be interpreted with caution. The fact that our empirical results use a sample of individuals
age 50 to 65 who spend less on children than younger parents who have younger children means that our results
could underestimate the eect of the expenditure channel. In light of this, the benchmark exercise considers
the case where parental expenditures on children,                Œ∏,   takes the maximum value (i.e.,   Œª = 0).   Appendix Section
C further explores the sensitivity of our calibration results to alternative parameter values.




                                                                       31
aggregate fertility for the case in which   Œª = 0.    In Figure 6, we repeat the same exercise for

                           1
the case in which    Œª=    3 . For comparison purposes, we include the PE relationship between

fertility and savings in the gure, which is from the earlier empirical estimates.


   Figure 5 is the case where      Œª = 0,   such that daughters transfer nothing.         The red line


displays the PE relationship, which is the observed savings rates of households in the same


economy with dierent numbers of children. The black solid line displays the GE savings rates


that are implied by dierent levels of aggregate fertility when      œÅ = 1.   It shows the savings rate


that the model predicts for a hypothetical situation in which all households would change


their fertility level. The black line is atter than the red line. This implies that an increase in


aggregate fertility has a smaller eect on savings than the one that we estimated comparing


dierent households.


   The dierence between PE and GE is large: a household that has one additional child on


average saves ten percentage points less; but if all households have one additional child, the


aggregate savings rate decreases by only 3.3 percentage points. The additional lines in the


gure show aggregate savings rates for dierent values of       œÅ.    As noted earlier, if   œÅ   is larger


than one, then the general and PE eects are more similar. For very high values of                 œÅ,   it is


even possible for the GE eect to be stronger than the PE eect. For example, as shown in


Figure 5, if   œÅ = 3, then due to a very strong income eect, the GE eect would be larger than

the PE eect.


   Figure 6 is identical to the previous one, but uses the parameters estimated assuming that

     1                1                                                                          1
Œª=   3 . When    Œª=   3 , the expenditure channel is completely shut down (since        Œª=       3 implies

Œ∏ = 0),   which means that an increase in aggregate fertility has no eect on aggregate savings


when   œÅ = 1.    This is why the black GE line is at at 26 percentage points in the gure. In


general, increasing   Œª   magnies the estimated dierence between PE and GE eects. This is


because for a high    Œª,   the transfer channel (which is substantially dierent in PE and GE)


plays a larger role in explaining the relationship between fertility and savings.


   In summary, the quantitative analysis shows that extrapolating from the PE evidence to


predict the eect of the removal of the One Child Policy is likely to signicantly overestimate




                                                 32
the resulting reduction in savings. We note that the literature has not yet formed a consensus


on the true value of       œÅ.   A recent review of the literature, Attanasio and Weber (2010) argues


that    œÅ is likely to be around 1.5.    Our results indicate that in this case, extrapolating from the


PE evidence to predict the eect of an aggregate increase in fertility would overestimate the


increase in savings rate by as much as 50%, even in the most conservative calibration with


Œª = 0.


4.5 Further Generalizations
Thus far, we have considered a model with the minimal amount of structure that is necessary


for matching the empirical results and which allow us to conduct the GE counterfactual.


We now explore the implications of an extended model where we endogenize fertility, human


capital investment and transfer rates. We investigate how they change the dierence in the


PE and GE eects of fertility on savings.              The discussion follows the baseline model from

4.5.1 Endogenous Fertility
In the baseline model, we assumed that fertility was exogenous, which was appropriate since


the PE empirical estimates relied on exogenous variation in fertility caused by family planning


policies and also because the GE counterfactual aims to understand the eect of an exogenous


increase in aggregate fertility caused by policy changes.               Now, we consider the case where


fertility is a choice.


       If we assume instead that parents treat children as investment goods (e.g. Caldwell, 1982


and Boldrin and Jones, 1988), then the decision to have a child is an investment that has


an immediate cost (from raising the child) and entails the future benet of transfers that are


received from the adult child.


       Suppose that parents can invest in two assets, children and savings, and try to optimize


their portfolio across these two assets.
                                              35 Because of the lumpiness of the number of children,

  34
       Section B in the appendix provides a more formal and detailed description.
  35
       We use the word invest to indicate actions that move wealth from one period to the next. In the context




                                                        33
not everyone will invest in the same number of children  i.e., at the optimum, otherwise iden-


tical families will choose dierent portfolios of children versus investment. In a cross-section


of families, the correlation between savings and the number of children will be negative.


    Now suppose a new regulation is introduced which restricts the preferred number of chil-


dren to be below a certain cuto. For the households for whom this constraint is binding,


the number of children will go down and savings will go up in PE. This is very similar to our


analysis of an exogenous change in the number of children.


    However, in GE, there are two additional eects. First, wages will rise faster than pro-


ductivity for some time, and this might induce some unconstrained households to increase


their fertility.   This will counteract the eect of the regulation.          Second, interest rates will


decline, making investment in children relatively more attractive. This again would push the


unconstrained households to have more children. Thus, the PE and GE relationships between


fertility and savings are still likely to be quite dierent with endogenous fertility.




4.5.2 Human Capital Investment
Here, we discuss the implications of allowing parents to choose the amount to invest in the


human capital of their children. In the model, parents are willing to invest in their children's


human capital in anticipation of higher future transfers  i.e., investment in children's human


capital increases their future wages and, as a consequence, anticipated transfers. Children's


education is thus an investment, which requires an upfront cost but pays a benet in the form


of higher expected transfers.


    We begin by assuming that there is no quantity-quality tradeo in PE, such that par-


ents' investment in their children's human capital is independent of the number of children.


Nevertheless, a quantity-quality tradeo emerges in GE: increased             aggregate fertility causes a
reduction in human capital investment per child. The reason is that higher aggregate fertility


increases the interest rate, which reduces the value of transfers and thus the incentives for

of our model, households invest to have income available for when they retire.    We use the word savings
to uniquely indicate investment in monetary instruments, for example in a bank account.       We adopt this
distinction due to the fact that in our model households can invest in both children and savings.




                                                     34
parents to invest in children's education. The decrease in human capital investment, in turn,


reduces expenditure per child, which will increase savings.     Under the assumptions of the


model in Section 4.1, the decrease in human capital caused by the increase in aggregate fer-


tility will compensate for the increase in expenditure caused by having more children. Recall


that the transfer channel is muted in GE (see Section 4.1.1). Thus, in GE, the relationship


between fertility and savings will be signicantly muted relative to the case in PE.


   Next, we consider the presence of PE quantity-quality tradeos such that households with


more children invest less in human capital per child. The PE quantity-quality tradeo does


not have a corresponding eect in the steady state of the GE economy because an increase


in fertility also reduces the human capital of parents and thus the opportunity cost of raising


children.


   These two results together imply that the introduction of endogenous human capital in-


vestment makes the dierence between PE and GE results even larger, and thus cannot


overrule our main qualitative result that GE forces are important to take into account for


understanding the eect of a change in aggregate fertility.




4.5.3 Endogenous Transfers
We now extend our model along the lines of Boldrin and Jones (2002) and assume that children


make transfers because they care about their parents' well-being. If we allow the transfer rate


to be endogenously determined, the PE and GE relationships between fertility and savings


become even more dierent.     When the transfer rate is endogenous, increasing the number


of children reduces the transfer rate from each child.    This occurs for three reasons.   First,


the increase in fertility decreases the incentive of each child to transfer to parents due to the


strategic interactions among siblings. Second, it implies that young individuals must spend


more on child rearing, and thus, they transfer less to their own parents. Third, an increase in


aggregate fertility increases the interest rate, which reduces the value of transfers to parents,


and thus reduces the incentives of altruistic children to make transfers.


   The rst two reasons are present both in PE and GE, while the third one emerges from




                                               35
the eect of fertility on the interest rate  in GE, the negative relationship between the


number of children and the transfer rate is stronger. As aggregate fertility increases, the total


amount of transfers received from children increase less than proportionally because each child


transfers less. Consequently, parents save more relative to the case with exogenous transfer


rates. Allowing for endogenous transfer rates thus magnies the dierence between PE and


GE results.




5    Conclusion

The goal of this paper is to illustrate the challenges of using PE estimates of behavioral pa-


rameters to analyze the eects of policies that aect the whole economy, but also the rewards


of using them in combination with a model to infer what the full equilibrium eect would


be. In the world described by our model, the PE eects of demographic changes substantially


overestimate the GE eect. It is important to consider this key fact  that accounting for


general equilibrium eects can substantially change the relationship between fertility and sav-


ings implied by partial equilibrium results  because many important macroeconomic policies


depend on the anticipated results of imminent changes in aggregate fertility caused by factors


such as the end of China's fertility restrictions, or the end of Japan's demographic collapse.


    At the same time, our study highlights the sensitivity of the model-derived quantitative


eects to the parameters that are used. Thus, an important endeavor for future studies on


the eect of aggregate fertility change is to obtain reliable parameter estimates from careful


micro-empirical estimates.


    There are, of course, many caveats to keep in mind in interpreting our main result. Most


importantly, rational expectations about the relatively distant future play an important role


in our argument. In our model, parents react to the fact that the current boom in fertility


will raise interest rates in the future when these children join the labor force. In contrast, if


parents do not make the connection between current fertility changes and future price changes,


the PE predictions would be the right ones. Finding reliable evidence that helps us determine


the plausibility of this assumption remains a very important part of this research agenda.

A        Data Appendix

The sample frame used in the RUMiC is the same as the one used in the National Bureau


of Statistics (NBS)      Annual Urban Household Income and Expenditure Survey (UHIES). Sam-
ple selection is based on several stratications at the provincial, city, county, township, and


neighborhood community levels. Households are randomly selected within each chosen neigh-


borhood community.          The RUMiC covers 19 cities in nine of the provinces.
                                                                                          36 The sample


aims to include 0.01% of households in the population. This sampling frame typically misses


migrant laborers. For our study, this is an advantage since we assume that urban households


we observe in 2008 also had urban status when they had their rst child.


       The survey was conducted in March and April, 2008. In addition to general information


(including fertility) for household members, the questionnaire also included the demographic


characteristics, education, and employment situation of other family members who are not


residing with the household head and spouse, including parents, children, and siblings.
                                                                                                   37 This


allows us to know the total fertility history and characteristics of adult children such as sex,


age and marital status.         In our study, total fertility is synonymous with the total number


of living children. In our sample, the total number of living children is very similar to the


total number of children ever born since infant mortality during the early 1970s was very low


(Banister and Hill, 2004).


       The information on household income and expenditure from the RUMiCI in China are


directly recorded from the UHIES survey (which is administered to the same households),


which records income and expenditure variables using a diary.               Specically, households are


required to record each item (disaggregated for hundreds of product categories) purchased


and income received for each day for a full year (in our case, 2007).                  Enumerators visit


sample households once or twice each month to review the records, assist the household with

questions, and take away the household records for data entry and the aggregation of the


annual data at the local Statistical Bureau Oce.


       The UHIES data is the best available data on urban household economic variables. Ac-


cording to interviews with NBS statisticians and a detailed examination of income and expen-


diture distributions conducted by researchers in study of the income distribution and income


taxation using the UHIES data, researchers concluded that the households that refuse to par-


ticipate are typically the poorest and the richest households (Piketty and Qian, 2009). This


makes it dicult to use the UHIES to study the extreme tails of the income distribution, but


should not aect our study, which focuses on the mean household.


       In our data, total household income is the sum of incomes from labor, business, property,


pension and retirement allowances and other social welfare benets. Total expenditure is the


sum of consumption expenditure (e.g.             food; clothing; housing; family equipment; service;


health; transpirations and communication; education; cultural and entertainment; other com-


modity and services), operational expenditure, property expenditure, social security expendi-


ture (e.g. individually paid pension fund, individually paid public housing fund, individually


paid health care fund, individually paid unemployment fund, and other social security).
                                                                                                        38


       Other recent studies of Chinese household savings or expenditures have mainly used the


following surveys, which we discuss briey to motivate the need to collect a new survey.


The UHIES (1988 ), which we discuss above, surveys contain high quality income and ex-


penditure data, but do not report total fertility. The China Health and Nutritional Surveys


(CHNS) urban sample is small. The China Household Income Project (CHIP) does not report


completed fertility and has a very small urban sample. The China Health and Retirement


Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS, 2008, 2011) contains similar information to our survey and


in addition, report transfers. We use these data for our descriptive statistics. Once we apply


our sample restrictions, the CHARLS and RUMiC provide similar sample sizes for our study.


Unfortunately, we are unable to use the CHARLS for the regression analysis because the ID

  38
       Food expenditure is the sum of expenditure on the following categories: grain, wheat, and rice coarse
grains; pork, beef, and mutton; edible vegetable oil, fresh vegetables, dried vegetables, poultry, meat, eggs,
sh; sugar, cigarettes, liquor, fruit, wine, beer, fresh melons and fruit cake; and milk.

variables required for linking the transfer data to other household data are not yet available


for the full-sized surveys (they are only available for the 2008 pilot, which we use and discuss


in Section 2).




B    Details on Further Generalizations

B.1 Endogenous Fertility Choice
We now extend the model of Section 4.1 and allow parents to optimally decide how many


children to raise. Children are an indivisible good, so that parents may choose                                ni,t+1 ‚àà N ,

where   N   is the set of non-negative integers. We also assume that parents have heterogeneous


costs of raising children, in order to have a non-degenerate distribution of fertility choices,


and we let the cost of raising children to be convex in the number of children itself.                                This


assumption is necessary in order to have a unique optimal solution for each household. The


parameter    Œ≥>1        controls the degree of convexity. Last, fertility is constrained by a possibly


binding constraint       Œõ.    As an example, the relaxation of the One Child Policy can be modeled


in this context as an increase in          Œõ.   The household problem now reads as

The optimal savings rate of the model is identical to the one of Section 4.1, and is given by

The dierence with the baseline model is that now the optimal number of children is endoge-


nous. In order to describe household behavior is useful to rst consider the latent number of




                                                               54
children,    nÃÉi,t+1 ,   that would be optimally chosen if household could have any real number of


children. This is given by


                                                                                       1

where     ¬µÃÉi ‚â• 0    is the rescaled multiplier on the constraint                 ni,t+1 ‚â§ Œõ.    It is immediate to notice


that, as long as the constraint is not binding,                     nÃÉi,t+1   is strictly decreasing in         Œ∏i .   However,


households cannot have a fraction of a child, so that true fertility,                             ni,t+1 ,   jumps discretely.


In particular, it is easy to verify that for each value                       n = {1, 2, ..., Œõ} ‚àÉŒ∏n , Œ∏n‚àí1       such that if


Œ∏i = Œ∏n     then    ni,t+1 = n    and if     Œ∏n‚àí1 ‚â§ Œ∏i < Œ∏n     then   ni,t+1 = n ‚àí 1.

     In order to understand the implications of this model for the PE estimates on the rela-


tionship between savings and fertility, it is interesting to compare two households which are


identical, but for the observed number of children. In particular, let's assume that household


1   has   Œ∏ 1 = Œ∏n   and household        2   has   Œ∏2 = Œ∏1 ‚àí ,    where        is a very small number. Household            1

is going to have         n   children, while household         2   is going to have         n‚àí1    children. We can then


compare the savings rates of the two households: since                                 is very small, it is immediate to


see that     s2 > s1 :    household      2    has less children and thus saves more. The model therefore is


consistent with the PE evidence that shows, comparing households that are identical but for


the number of children, that fertility and savings display a negative relationship.


     Let's now discuss the GE implications of the model for aggregate fertility changes. As an


illustrative example, let's consider the eect on savings of an aggregate reduction in fertility


as caused by a tightening of the fertility constraint.                            Within the model, we thus consider


the eect on fertility and savings of a decrease in                     Œõ.        The reduction in fertility is going to


have the same GE eects on prices as in the baseline model of Section 4.1. Specically, the


reduction in fertility is going to reduce the interest rate and, as long as the economy is out


of steady state, increase the growth rate of wage. However, the eect of the decrease in                                  Œõ   on


households' behavior is going to be dierent for dierent groups of households. In particular


we need to distinguish between two dierent possibilities.                               The rst type of households is


represented by those that are constrained by the tightening of                            Œõ.   Those households are going



                                                               55
to decrease their fertility, and for them the analysis is identical to the case with exogenous


fertility reduction: the extent to which their savings rate is going to increase depends on the


relative strength of the consumption and transfer channels and on the responses of prices.


There is, however, a second type of households, namely those that are not constrained even


after the tightening of    Œõ.   Those households are going to increase fertility on average. This


is easy to see from the fact that, keeping            ¬µÃÉi    xed at zero (since those households are not


constrained the multiplier is zero), the latent number of children is going to increase due to

            wt+1
fact that
             wt increases and      1 + rt+1    goes down. Hence, this second group of households is


going to increase fertility and consequently reduce savings. As a consequence, the eect of


the tightening of   Œõ   on aggregate savings rate is further dampened by the GE eects on this


second group of individuals, beyond what it is in the case with exogenous fertility.




B.2 Endogenous Investment in Human Capital
We extend the model of Section 4.1 and allow parents to optimally invest in their children's


human capital. We rst consider the case in which in PE there is no quantity-quality tradeo,


so that neither the costs nor the benets of investing in children human capital depend on the


number of children itself. We model human capital as an increase in individual productivity.


The wage income of an individual           i   at time   t   is thus given by      At wt hi,t .   Aggregate income


is produced, as in the baseline case, with a Cobb-Douglas production function, where labor


is now calculated in eciency units, as standard in the human capital literature, so that


Y = KtŒ± (At ht Lt )1‚àíŒ± ,   where   ht   is the average human capital of the working population. Due


to the assumption of competitive markets, the interest rate is                 1 + rt = Œ±ktŒ±‚àí1 h1‚àíŒ±
                                                                                                t        and wage


per eciency unit is     wt = (1 ‚àí Œ±) h‚àíŒ± Œ±
                                       t kt .         Parents may invest in the human capital,              hi,t+1 ,

of their children paying a convex cost          At wt hŒ≥i,t+1 ,   where   Œ≥ > 1.   Parents are willing to invest


in the human capital of their children in order to increase received transfers: if children have


more human capital they earn more and thus transfer more to parents.                              The problem of a


household reads as follows:




                                                         56

Solving the rst order conditions of the model we obtain an equation for optimal savings rate


and one for optimal human capital investment

                         Œ≤                                                     œÑ hi,t+1 ni                At+1 wt+1

                                                                                           1
                                                     At+1 wt+1 œÑ                            Œ≥‚àí1
                                      hi,t+1    =                                                 ,                             (15)
                                                  Œ≥At wt Œ∏ (1 + rt+1 )

The second equation shows that, at the household level, optimal human capital does not


depend on the number of children, but only on parameters that are identical across households,


so that   hi,t+1 = ht+1 ‚àÄi.

   Next, we focus on steady states and substitute 15 into 14 to get


                                                                             

                             si =             1‚àíœÑ ‚àí                ‚àí                                                            (16)
                                  1+Œ≤                Œ≥ (1 + r)        Œ≤ (1 + r)

from which we see that, even in the presence of endogenous human capital investment, fertility


and savings are negatively related at the household level, through both the expenditure and


the transfer channels.


   Let's now solve for the GE. The law of motion of capital is given by



                                                                       st
                                     kt+1 = (1 ‚àí Œ±)                           h1‚àíŒ± ktŒ±
                                                                  (1 + g) nt+1 t

so that in steady state

                                                                         n (1 + g)
                                               k Œ±‚àí1 h1‚àíŒ± =
                                                                         s (1 ‚àí Œ±)



                                                                  57
and hence, using the denition of the interest rate, we get that in steady state



                                                 n (1 + g) Œ±
                                        1+r =                .
                                                  s (1 ‚àí Œ±)

Substituting the equilibrium interest rate into 16 and summing over all households yield a


formula for the aggregate savings rate



                                               Œ±Œ≤Œ≥ (1 ‚àí œÑ )
                                 s=
                                      Œ±Œ≥ (1 + Œ≤) + œÑ (1 ‚àí Œ±) (Œ≤ + Œ≥)

which is independent from aggregate fertility. As such, despite the fact that at the household


level fertility and savings are negatively related, aggregate fertility and aggregate savings are


not related.


    This result comes straight from the equation 15 for human capital investment.             At the


household level, human capital investment does not depend on the number of children, but


is decreasing in the interest rate. At the aggregate level, however, human capital investment


is decreasing in fertility: an increase in fertility increases the interest rate which makes the


returns from investing in children human capital smaller.        A quantity-quality tradeo thus


emerges in GE, due to the role of fertility on the interest rate. Due to the assumptions about


the functions made in the model, the decrease in human capital investment exactly compensate


the expenditure channel relationship between fertility and savings. Moreover, the transfer


channel is muted in GE for the reasons discussed in the main text. The consequence is that


in GE there is no relationship between fertility and savings.




PE Quantity-Quality Tradeo               Alternatively, we could consider the case in which a


quantity-quality tradeo is present also in PE. A PE quantity-quality tradeo can be mod-


eled as a cost of human capital investment that is increasing in the number of children, so


that the cost of investing in children human capital is now given by    Œ∂ (nt+1 ) At wt hŒ≥t+1 ,   where

‚àÇŒ∂(nt+1 )
 ‚àÇnt+1      > 0.   This would imply that households with more children invest less in the human




                                                 58
capital of each one of them. The savings rate and optimal human capital are now given by



                                                          hŒ≥i,t+1

Substituting the optimal human capital into the savings rate, and focusing to a steady state in

B.3 Endogenous Transfers to Parents
We extend the model of Section 4.1 and let transfers from children to parents to be an


endogenous outcome.                In order to do so, we develop the model along the lines of Boldrin,


De Nardi, and Jones (2005).
                                           40 Individuals value their own consumption and the wealth of


their parents. Every individual thus solves

       The assumption that number of siblings of parents and children is identical implies that                             hi,t = hi,t+1 ,
which is useful to simplify the algebra and have simple results. We can relax this assumption and show that
the GE relationship between fertility and savings is muted up to a covariance term. These results are available
upon requests.
  40
       The Boldrin, De Nardi, and Jones (2005) setting is slightly dierent than ours. Boldrin, De Nardi, and
Jones (2005) uses a utility function of the form
                                                                        

such that children value the consumption of their parents when parents are old, rather than parents well-being
over the whole life. This assumption implies that parents have a strategic incentive not to save in the rst
period because savings crowd out transfers from children. We introduce the assumption that children care
about the total wealth of the parents to abstract from parents strategic behavior in savings. Conceptually,
we are assuming that children have the ability to commit to a level of transfer that does not depend on the
parents' behavior in the rst period, but only on the parents' income and macroeconomic condition.




                                                                       59

The previous notation applies. Also notice that when deciding how much money to transfer


to parents, individuals take as given the number of their siblings,                              nÃÉi ,   and the transfer of their


siblings,    œÑÃÉt .   We focus on a symmetric solution, so that in equilibrium                             œÑi = œÑÃÉ .

       Solving the rst order conditions of the model, we obtain the usual equation for optimal


savings rate and an additional equation that comes from solving for the optimal transfer rate

Using 17, 18, and the budget constraints, we solve for the optimal transfer rate as a function


of the number of siblings and children

       The analysis of the optimal transfer rate is informative about the model implications


for the PE and GE relationships between savings and fertility. The presence of endogenous


transfer rate does not change the PE relationship between fertility and savings, which is still


given by the usual equation 17.
                                                  41 In GE however, the interest rate has now two eects on


savings: (i) a wealth eect through the change in the value of transfers, which was present


also in the model with exogenous transfer rate; (ii) a change in the transfer rate from each


child. Both eects (i) and (ii) go in the same direction, so that GE forces are larger in the


model with endogenous transfer rate. As an example, let's consider the foreseeable eects of


the relaxation of the One Child Policy. The increase in aggregate fertility puts an upward


pressure on the interest rate. The increase in the interest rate decreases the total value of

  41
       The model implies that household level savings and fertility are negatively related, as long as we restrict
the parameter set to obtain the natural assumption that households with more children receive more transfers.




                                                                     60
transfers, so that parents save more with respect to the PE prediction. This mechanism is


identical to the case with exogenous transfer rate. But, in addition, the increase in the interest


rate implies that each child transfers less, due to the fact that parents value future transfers


less, and this reduces the total amount of transfers and thus again increases savings. This


additional channel means that the GE eect of an aggregate increase in fertility predicted by


the model with endogenous transfer rate is smaller than the one predicted by the model with


exogenous transfer rate.


    To sum up, this analysis showed that if we believe that children transfer to parents as a


result of altruistic behavior, then the GE relationship between fertility and savings is even


weaker than if we assume the transfer rate to be exogenous.




C      Alternative Calibrations

In the main calibration exercise we used point estimates from Table 4. However, as already


discussed, two of the three coecients of interest are not precisely estimated, and are in fact


not signicant, with p-values of respectively              0.23   and   0.24.   For this reason, in this section we


perform a robustness exercise to understand the implications of our model for dierent sets of


parameters. We allow the three coecients of interest, namely the coecient on the number


of kids (œÜ henceforth), the coecient on the interaction between the number of children and


the rstborn being a male (Œ∫), and the coecient on the rstborn being a male (Œæ ), to take one


of three possible values: (i) the baseline value, which is simply the point estimates as shown


in the Table 4; (ii) the baseline value minus one third of its standard deviation; and (iii) the


baseline value plus one third of its standard deviation. The choice of one third is motivated


by the fact that we want the transfer rate (œÑ ) implied by the model to be non-negative, and


the maximum values of           œÜ, Œ∫,   and    Œæ   that are consistent with      œÑ   being non-negative are in fact


œÜ + 13 œÉœÜ , Œ∫ + 13 œÉŒ∫ ,   and    Œæ + 31 œÉŒæ .   We have three values for each of the three coecients of


interest, hence we have          27   possible combinations.        For each of them we nd the primitive


parameters,    œÑ, Œ∏   and   Œ≤,   such that the model generates an average savings rate of                 0.26   and


matches the three coecients of interest. We then use the calibrated model to perform the



                                                            61
counterfactual exercises of increasing fertility by one child both in general and in PE. We


show that for almost all possible combinations of parameters the general and PE eects of


fertility on savings are very dierent. We now describe the results in more details.


   For brevity, we focus on our preferred estimates, the one with              œÅ = 1   and   Œª = 0.   In


Table 7 we report the calibrated transfer rate (œÑ ) for each triple of coecients. Each matrix


corresponds to one value for the coecient on the rstborn being a male (Œæ ), each row to


one value for the coecient on the number of kids (œÜ), and each column to one value for


the coecient on the interaction between the number of kids and the rstborn being a male


(Œ∫).   In Table 8 we report the calibrated consumption per child (Œ∏ ).          In Table 9 we report


the percentage of the PE eect on savings that is still present in GE. Table 9 shows that for


almost all combinations of coecients the dierence between PE and GE eects are sizable.


The only exception is the case in which both      Œæ and Œ∫ take a high value.   The reason is intuitive.


When    Œæ   and   Œ∫   are high, the dierence in savings rates between households with only one son


and households with only one daughter is very small. This dierence identies the transfer


rate, which is the driver of the GE eects. Indeed when          Œæ   andŒ∫ are high the transfer rate


is almost identical to zero, which implies that the relationship between fertility and savings


is purely driven by the consumption channel. And, as shown in the paper, the consumption


channel is identical in PE and GE.
