This paper analyzes a geographic quasi-experiment embedded in a cluster-randomized
experiment in Honduras. In the experiment, average treatment effects on school enrollment and
child labor were large—especially in the poorest blocks—and could be generalized to a policy-
relevant population given the original sample selection criteria. In contrast, the geographic quasi-
experiment yielded point estimates that, for two of three dependent variables, were attenuated. A
judicious policy analyst without access to the experimental results might have provided
misleading advice based on the magnitude of point estimates. We assessed two main explanations
for the difference in point estimates, related to external and internal validity.

1. Introduction

    In a typical regression-discontinuity design, treatments are assigned on the basis of a single,

continuous covariate and a cutoff. The identification of treatment effects relies on the assumption

that the relation between potential outcomes and the assignment variable is continuous at the

cutoff (Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw, 2001; Lee and Lemieux, 2010). The assumption is

particularly credible if a stochastic component in the assignment variable (e.g., a noisy test score)

ensures that the agents cannot precisely manipulate their values of the assignment variable. That

is, agents are subject to “local” random assignment (Lee, 2008; Lee and Lemieux, 2010).1

    Researchers have extended the continuity results to regression-discontinuity designs in which

assignment is based on a vector of variables (Imbens and Zajonc, 2009; Keele and Titiunik,

2015). A special case is the geographic discontinuity design (GDD), in which exposure to a

treatment depends on the latitude and longitude of agents with respect to an administrative or

territorial boundary. Researchers compare treated and untreated agents residing near boundaries,

using parametric and/or non-parametric methods (e.g., Black, 1999; Dell, 2011; Keele and

Titiunik, 2015). In the words of Lee and Lemieux (2010), these are often “nonrandomized”

discontinuity designs since agents are usually aware of boundaries (and associated treatments)

and can precisely choose their locations.2 This places a special burden on researchers to rule out

location-based sorting on observed or unobserved variables as a threat to the internal validity of

treatment effects (Keele and Titiunik, 2015, 2016; Keele et al., 2016).




1
  Cattaneo, Frandsen, and Titiunik (2015) push this interpretation further by implementing
randomization inference in samples near the cutoff.
2
  In rare cases, boundaries might be suddenly (and quasi-randomly) redrawn, leading to a more
credible “re-randomization” of households before endogenous sorting begins anew (e.g.,
Billings, Deming, & Rockoff, 2014).


                                                 1
    In addition to internal validity, one might assess the external validity of estimates obtained

from geographic designs.3 Suppose that a treatment is (non-randomly) assigned to 10 states, and

that policy-makers are interested in the average treatment effect in this population. Yet, for

identification purposes, geographic designs must exclude treated individuals that are (1) far from

a state border or (2) near a state border with no cross-state variation in the treatment (as often

occurs when treated states are contiguous). If excluded individuals have a different distribution

of variables that moderate treatment effects—such as income, race, or even distance-to-border—

then the geographic design will not recover the average treatment effect in the policy-relevant

population. The challenge is well-understood in the context of non-representative convenience

samples often used in randomized experiments (Hotz, Imbens, and Mortimer, 2005; Cole and

Stuart, 2010; Muller, 2015). We note that it also applies to geographic designs.

    This paper assesses both validity concerns in a geographic quasi-experiment (GQE) that is

embedded in a cluster-randomized experiment conducted in Honduras.4 In the original

experiment, 70 malnourished municipalities were identified, and 40 were randomly awarded

conditional cash transfers (IFPRI, 2000). Using the 2001 census, Galiani and McEwan (2013)

found that the treatment increased the probability that children enrolled in school and reduced

their probabilities of working outside and inside the home. The effects were especially large in



3
  External validity exists when causal relationships “[hold] over variations in persons, settings,
treatment variables, and measurement variables” (Shadish, Cook, and Campbell, 2002, p. 507).
Some authors assess the importance of variation in treatments (particularly implementer
characteristics) and measurement variables (Allcott, 2015; Bold et al., 2012; Lucas et al., 2014).
This paper focuses on the potentially moderating role of independent variables related to persons
and settings.
4
  We refer to it as a geographic quasi-experiment because assignment is not transparently random
(even local to borders), and because we must proxy the location of children using the coordinates
of their caserío (a cluster of dwellings). The latter introduces mass points in the putative
assignment variables of latitude and longitude in a geographic discontinuity design. For related
explanations, see Keele et al. (2016) and later sections of this paper.


                                                  2
two of five strata (or blocks) with the highest rates of malnutrition. In this subsample, the effects

on enrollment, work outside the home, and work inside the home were, respectively, 15, -6.8,

and -6.2 percentage points. Relative to the control group, these represented changes of 25%, -

54%, and -41%.

   We compare these results to those of a geographic quasi-experiment using the same census

data. Specifically, we identify a sample of treated children that are close to municipal borders

shared with untreated, non-experimental municipalities. Children on the opposite side of the

border constitute the quasi-experimental control group. Using the same covariates as Galiani and

McEwan (2013), we show that treatment-control balance for nearly all covariates improves in

samples that are increasingly close to the border (our preferred distance buffer is 2 kilometers).

We can also rule out that households sorted across municipal borders in direct response to the

treatment, addressing a common internal validity concern in geographic designs. Nevertheless,

we find that treated children are more likely to self-identify as Lenca—an indigenous group—

even very close to municipal borders. Ultimately, our analysis of the GQE sample finds that

point estimates for two of the three dependent variables are attenuated relative to the

experimental benchmarks.

   Is this because of imbalance in unobserved variables (i.e., a threat to internal validity) or

simply because the GQE sample has a different distribution of observed or unobserved variables

that moderate treatment effects? We separately assess each explanation using subsamples of the

randomized experiment. First, we re-estimate experimental effects in the subsample of treatment

and control children within 2 kilometers of any municipal border (we refer to this as experiment

1). These estimates are slightly (but consistently) stronger than full-sample results. There are no




                                                  3
mean differences in census covariates between the two samples, suggesting that distance-to-

border proxies unobserved moderators of treatment effects.

   Second, we further restrict the sample in experiment 1 to treatment and control children

residing near the border of an untreated, non-experimental municipality (we refer to this sample

as experiment 2). Note that it includes exactly the same treated children as the GQE. However, it

uses experimental rather than the quasi-experimental controls. This permits us to (momentarily)

abstract from internal validity. The point estimates for school enrollment and work-in-home are

attenuated relative to experiment 1. Descriptive statistics suggests that the sample in experiment

2 is better-off than that of experiment 1, given higher rates of electricity use, asset ownership,

and other income proxies. This plausibly explains the attenuated effects, since the literature on

conditional cash transfers finds smaller effects in when children are less poor (Fiszbein and

Schady, 2009; Galiani and McEwan, 2013).

   Third, we assess internal validity by comparing the unbiased estimates from experiment 2 to

those of the GQE (noting again that both include the same treatment group but different control

groups). Particularly for school enrollment, the GQE estimates are attenuated relative those of

experiment 2. It suggests that imbalance in unobserved variables results in downward biases in

the GQE enrollment estimates. This is perhaps consistent with the higher proportion of

indigenous children in the GQE treatment group, relative to its quasi-experimental control group.

   In summary, we find that the GQE cannot fully replicate the policy-relevant experimental

benchmark in Galiani and McEwan (2013) for reasons related to both validity concerns. Based

on these results, we make two concrete recommendations. First, it is essential that researchers

using a geographic design carefully assess treatment-control balance on a wide range of observed

covariates that are plausibly correlated with dependent variables (echoing the recommendations




                                                  4
of Keele et al., 2016 in this volume). Our GQE is an especially cautionary tale, since it had very

good (but not perfect) balance in observed variables, but still could not replicate school

enrollment estimates using the same treatment group and an experimental control group.

   Second, we recommend that researchers assess the external validity of their geographic

design by comparing the distributions of observed moderators of treatment effects—such as

household income—to those of a well-defined, policy-relevant population. Aided by theory or

prior empirical evidence on the relevance of moderators, this can be used to speculate about the

generalizability of a GQE. More concretely, Cole and Stuart (2010) describe how one might

construct inverse-probability weights and re-weight a convenience sample—whether

experimental or quasi-experimental—to resemble a well-defined population. We conduct and

report a similar analysis, re-weighting the sample of experiment 2 to resemble that of experiment

1. The weights are estimated using a wide range of covariates that are plausible moderators of

treatment effects. Ultimately, however, the weighted estimates in experiment 2 are still

attenuated relative to experiment 1, suggesting that some relevant moderators are unobserved.

   Our results contribute to a growing literature that compares regression-discontinuity designs

with a single assignment variable to experimental benchmarks (see Shadish et al., 2011 and the

citations therein). In this literature, several papers analyze conditional cash transfer experiments

in which eligibility was determined by a poverty proxy. Oosterbeek, Ponce, and Schady (2008)

found that experimental enrollment effects in Ecuador were large for the poorest households, but

that RDD effects were zero for less-poor households in the vicinity of the eligibility cutoff.

Similarly, Galiani and McEwan (2013) found no RDD effects on enrollment and child labor in

the vicinity of the cutoff used to determine assignment to the experimental sample, but large

experimental effects among households residing in municipalities with the lowest levels of the




                                                  5
assignment variable. In the absence of an experiment, both papers caution against generalizing

“away” from cutoffs when the assignment variable is a plausible or well-documented moderator

of treatment effects.5 A recent strand of methodological literature has considered situations in

which such generalizations might still be possible.6



2. The PRAF-II Experiment

A. Design and treatment

    In the late 1990s, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) designed a cluster-

randomized experiment to estimate the impact of conditional cash transfers (CCTs) on the

poverty, education, and health outcomes of households in poor Honduran municipalities. In the

absence of a national poverty map, researchers identified poor municipalities with a nutrition-

related proxy from a 1997 census of first-graders’ heights (Secretaría de Educación, 1997).

IFPRI (2000) ordered 298 municipalities by their mean municipal height-for-age z-scores.

Seventy-three municipalities with the lowest scores were eligible (the implied cutoff was -2.3,

highlighting the extremely high rates of stunting). Three were excluded due to accessibility,

leaving an experimental sample of 70.

    In 1999, IFPRI divided the sample into 5 quintiles of mean municipal height-for-age. Within

quintiles, municipalities were randomly assigned to three treatment arms and a control group (in



5
  Buddelmeyer and Skoufias (2004) analyzed Mexico’s well-known Progresa experiment (and a
proxy means test and cutoff used to determine eligibility). In contrast to other results, they found
that experimental enrollment estimates in samples “close” to the eligibility cutoff were roughly
similar or slightly larger than full-sample estimates.
6
  Angrist and Rokkanen (2015) show how RDD effects might be estimated “away” from the
cutoff if the assignment variable is ignorable, conditional on a set of covariates unaffected by the
treatment. Dong and Lewbel (2015) note that the relative slopes of lines fit to data within
bandwidths on either side of the cutoff provide insights into how modest changes in the
assignment cutoff could affect the magnitude of estimated effects.


                                                 6
a ratio of 4:4:2:4). Arms 1 and 2 received conditional cash transfers, while arms 2 and 3 were to

receive grants to schools and health centers. Moore (2008) suggests the grants were sparsely

implemented as late as 2002. Using this paper’s census data, Galiani and McEwan (2013) failed

to reject the null that average treatment effects in arms 1 and 2 were equal (relative to the

control). Arm 3 had small and statistically insignificant effects relative to the control (but its

effect was statistically different from arm 2). Following Galiani and McEwan (2013), we

compare 40 municipalities in a pooled CCT treatment arm and 30 in a pooled control group.

      In the CCT treatment, households were eligible for an annual per-child cash transfer of L 800

(about US$50) if a child between 6 and 12 enrolled in primary school grades 1 to 4.7 Children

with higher attainment were not eligible, and households could receive up to 3 per-child

transfers. During the experiment, transfers were distributed in November 2000, May-June 2001,

October 2001, and late 2002 (Galiani and McEwan, 2013; Morris et al., 2004). The average

household in experimental municipalities would have been eligible for transfers equal to about

5% of median per capita expenditure (Galiani and McEwan, 2013). This is smaller than most

Latin American CCTs such as Progresa (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009). Indeed, payments were

only intended to cover the out-of-pocket and opportunity costs of enrolling a child in school

(IFPRI, 2000).




7
    A school attendance condition was apparently not enforced (Glewwe and Olinto, 2004).


                                                   7
B. Data and replication

    Galiani and McEwan (2013) used the 2001 Honduran census—collected in late July 2001—

to estimate the short-run effects of offering CCTs to eligible children.8 Their sample contained

120,411 6-12 year-olds eligible for the education transfer, residing in the 70 experimental

municipalities. The census includes three dummy dependent variables: (1) whether a child was

enrolled on the census date, (2) whether a child worked outside the home in the week preceding

the census, and (3) whether a child worked exclusively in the home during the preceding week

(Appendix Table A.1 provides variable definitions).9

    Their preferred specification regressed each dependent variable on a treatment dummy,

dummy variables indicating randomization blocks, and a set of individual and household

covariates unlikely to have been affected by the treatment. Table 1 replicates the main results.

The regressions in this and subsequent tables control for block dummy variables, the 21

covariates described in Table A.1, squared terms for continuous variables, and dummy variables

indicating missing values of any covariate. In addition to analytic standard errors clustered by

municipality, we report symmetric p-values from the wild cluster bootstrap percentile-t that

imposes the null hypothesis (Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller, 2008).

    In the full sample, the treatment increases the probability of enrollment by 8.1 percentage

points (a 13% increase relative to the control group). The treatment reduces the probability of

work outside the home by 3.1 p.p. (32%) and work only inside the home by 4.1 p.p. (30%). The

effects are larger in the two poorest blocks (1 and 2), and closer to zero and not statistically



8
  A related literature uses a panel household survey—collected in 2000 and 2002—to estimate
effects on child health and nutrition (Morris et al., 2004), education (Glewwe and Olinto, 2004),
and adult labor supply (Alzúa et al., 2013).
9
  The interpretation of work-only-inside-home variable is governed by the flow of survey
questions.


                                                  8
significant in three less-poor blocks (3, 4, and 5). In blocks 1 and 2, the effect on enrollment,

work outside the home, and work inside the home are, respectively, 15 p.p. (25%), -6.8 p.p. (-

54%), and -6.2 p.p. (-41%). The magnitude of these effects is notable given the comparatively

small size of the transfer.10



3. A Geographic Quasi-Experiment

A. Sample

     The Honduran census does not record the precise location of dwellings. To proxy location,

we use the latitude and longitude of caseríos. In Honduras, 18 departments contain 298

municipalities and over 3700 aldeas (villages). Within the boundaries of villages, points identify

the center of over 24,000 caseríos (“hamlets”) that are contiguous groups of dwellings. We

calculated the straight-line distance between each caserío and its nearest municipal border.11

     We then identified a sample of 801 experimental, treated caseríos (with 23,974 children) that

share a municipal border with 794 non-experimental, untreated caseríos (with 25,025 children).

In the pooled sample of children, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the distance-to-border

distribution are 0.37, 2.02, and 4.22 kilometers, respectively. We henceforth refer to this as the

GQE (or geographic quasi-experiment) sample.




10
   Benedetti, Ibarrarán, and McEwan (2016) analyze a later Honduran CCT experiment—also
conducted in a sample of poor municipalities—which offered much larger transfers. They found
smaller effects on both enrollment and child labor, which they attributed to a weaker application
of the education enrollment condition.
11
   We identified the caserío coordinates for 93% of all 6-12 year-olds in the census (and 95% of
the full experimental sample). The missing coordinates are due to incomplete geocoding of
caseríos in an ArcGIS file obtained from the Infotecnología unit of the Secretaría de Educación
in 2008.


                                                  9
     The map in Figure 1 illustrates the subsample of GQE caseríos that fall within 2 kilometers

of a municipal border (in the next section, we provide a rationale for using this distance buffer).

It highlights that treated caseríos are a non-random sample of all treated caseríos. In particular,

treated caseríos are excluded when their municipalities are fully circumscribed by other

treatment or control municipalities in the experimental sample.



B. Covariate balance near municipal borders

     By focusing on treated and untreated children that reside near municipal borders, there may

be fewer differences in observed and, perhaps, unobserved variables that affect child outcomes.

We assess this in the top-left panel of Figure 2, using 21 covariates from the experimental

analysis. Dots indicate the absolute values of standardized treatment-control differences for each

covariate. The left-most dots pertain to the full GQE sample just described, while others refer to

GQE samples restricted by increasingly narrow distance buffers.

     Balance in the GQE sample is sensitive to distance-to-border, markedly improving when

caseríos fall within 2 kilometers of the border. In the 2-kilometer subsample, it is notable that 20

of 21 covariates show treatment-control differences of less than 8% of a standard deviation, and

none are statistically different from zero at conventional levels (see Table 2). This is despite the

fact that there are large mechanical differences in mean municipal height-for-age z-scores due to

the selection rule for the experimental sample (see Figure 3.) The bottom-left panel of Figure 2

shows F-statistics from omnibus tests of covariate balance.12 In each subsample, we regress the

treatment dummy on the 21 covariates, squared terms for continuous variables, and dummies



12
  A simulation in Hansen and Bowers (2008) shows that a similar test using logistic regression
leads to over-rejection of the null with a modest number of assigned units (100). In the present
case, we are concerned with comparing balance across subsamples.


                                                 10
indicating missing values. The F-statistic declines as distance-to-border restrictions are applied,

consistent with prior evidence.

     In the right-hand panels of Figure 2, we can compare balance in GQE samples to balance in

experimental samples with similar distance-to-border restrictions. As anticipated, given

randomized assignment, covariate balance in the experiment does not depend on the distance of

caseríos to municipal borders. The top-right panel shows that absolute values of treatment-

control differences for 21 covariates are rarely larger than 10% of a standard deviation,

regardless of distance. The bottom-right panel of Figure 2 shows relatively stable F-statistics of

around 2 from the omnibus test.

     In fact, the smallest F-statistics in the GQE are approximately twice as large as those in the

experimental sample. In the 2 kilometer GQE sample, this is driven by imbalance in a single

covariate (Lenca). Children on the treated side of borders are about 10 percentage points more

likely to self-identify as a member of the indigenous Lenca group (see Table 2). National poverty

headcounts are higher among Lenca than non-indigenous Hondurans.13 Nevertheless, this does

not necessarily imply imbalance in unobserved socioeconomic outcomes such as poverty,

because there is demonstrable balance in many poverty proxies such as schooling and household

assets.



C. Potential threats to internal validity

     Why might imbalance persist close to borders? One explanation is that Lenca households

manipulated treatment status by moving after experimental assignment, but prior to the census.




13
  In a national sample from 2004, the poverty headcount is 49% among non-indigenous
individuals and 71% among ethnic and racial minorities (World Bank, 2006).


                                                  11
We regard this as unlikely for three reasons. First, the cash transfer for a typical household was

extremely small (less than 5% of a household’s consumption) and unlikely to provide sufficient

liquidity for poor households to move. Second, 91% of children in the 2-kilometer GQE sample

were born in their municipality of residence, and only 4% lived in a different caserío, aldea, or

city in 1996 (five years before the census date). Both variables are among those with the smallest

cross-border differences in the GQE, and neither is statistically different from zero (see Table

2).14 Third, there is a similar pattern of imbalance in the 2-kilometer sample of untreated,

experimental caseríos that share a border with untreated, non-experimental caseríos (see Table

B.2; we later use this sample to conduct a placebo test). In other words, imbalance persists even

when there is no CCT treatment to create incentives for cross-border sorting.

     Thus, a second explanation is that some households chose dwellings years or decades before

treatment assignment, but were not indifferent to attributes of communities on opposite sides of

the border. Figure 4 illustrates the proportion of Lenca children in aldeas (a sub-territory of

municipalities), along with the GQE caseríos. Cross-border imbalance is most evident on the

eastern-most municipal borders of the experimental sample, but is certainly not a feature of all

border segments. Most notably, one interior segment cleaves the “twin cities” of La Esperanza

and Intibucá, both rich centers of Lenca culture. Though in separately-governed municipalities,

the towns are commonly referred to by a single name (and treated as such by locals).

     In summary, there is evidence of balance in the GQE sample (with a buffer of 2 kilometers)

on 20 of 21 covariates that are typically correlated with child education and labor outcomes.

From a design perspective, it is notable that covariate selection was imposed by an earlier paper



14
  It is possible that households somehow misreported their answers, but seems unlikely given
the fact that census data collection was independent of PRAF, IFPRI, and the original impact
evaluation’s data collection schedule.


                                                 12
(Galiani and McEwan, 2013). However, there is persistent imbalance in one covariate (Lenca)

that is plausibly correlated with unobserved determinants of child outcomes. In this volume,

Keele et al. (2016) report similar covariate imbalances close to borders, leading them to invoke

an assumption of conditional geographic mean independence (also see Keele et al., 2015). That

is, potential outcomes are assumed to be mean independent of treatment assignment within a

specified buffer, conditional on observed covariates.15 We make a similar ignorability

assumption within a 2-kilometer buffer and refer to the design as a geographic quasi-experiment.

     We do not assume local continuity in potential outcomes at municipal borders, as one might

in a “pure” geographic discontinuity design (Imbens and Zajonc, 2009; Keele and Titiunik,

2015). First, our evidence suggests that assignment is not locally randomized, given long-

standing municipal borders and households’ ability to sort around them. Second, we are forced to

proxy the location of dwellings using the latitude and longitude of caseríos. This leads to mass

points in the putative assignment variables,16 even though standard methods for analyzing

discontinuity designs rely on continuous assignment variables (Calonico et al., 2014; Keele et al.,

2016).



D. GQE estimates



15
   The standardized differences are within thresholds beyond which regression adjustment is
particularly sensitive to specification (Imbens and Wooldridge, 2009; Rubin, 2001).
16
   In a histogram of distance-to-border distribution in the GQE sample—available from the
authors—there is a puzzlingly large spike on the untreated side of the border, between 3 and 4
kilometers away. In fact, this is the town of Santa Bárbara (identified as a single caserío in
Honduran data). It stretches about 2 kilometers across at its widest point and contains 1178
dwellings with eligible children. If distance-to-border had been measured without error for each
dwelling, it might have “filled” an apparent notch in the histogram. This is the most severe
example in the GQE sample of mis-measurement of the assignment variable, given the use of
caserío rather than dwelling location. In the full GQE sample of caseríos, the mean (median)
number of dwellings is 16.6 (8), and the 90th and 95th percentiles are 33 and 47, respectively.


                                                13
     Using the 2-kilometer GQE sample, Table 3 reports estimates from ordinary least squares

regressions that control for the same covariates as Table 1, but excluding experimental block

dummy variables. The analytic standard errors apply multi-way clustering on both municipality

and border segments, given the spatial proximity of treatment and control caseríos (Cameron,

Gelbach, and Miller, 2011). A separate border segments exists for every unique combination of

bordering municipalities. Overall, there are 81 municipalities and 65 non-nested border

segments.17 As in Table 1, we also report symmetric p-values from the wild cluster bootstrap

percentile-t that imposes the null hypothesis, clustering by municipality (Cameron, Gelbach, and

Miller, 2008).

     In the 2-kilometer GQE sample, the treatment increases enrollment by a marginally

significant 5.7 percentage points, or 2.4 p.p. smaller than the experimental estimate in Table 1. In

blocks 1-2, the enrollment effect is 10.6 p.p., or 4.4 p.p. lower than the experimental estimate. In

blocks 3-5, both the GQE and the experiment find similarly small and statistically insignificant

estimates.

     The results are mixed for the two work-related variables. In the GQE sample, the treatment

reduces work outside the home by 2.4 p.p. in all blocks and 8.6 p.p. in blocks 1-2 (only the latter

is marginally statistically significant). The experimental estimates are roughly similar. Neither

the GQE nor the experiment suggest any effects in blocks 3-5. In contrast, the GQE estimates are

attenuated for work inside the home, relative to the experimental estimates. There is never a

large or statistically significant effect for this dependent variable in the GQE sample. Yet, in the

experiment, there were reductions of 4.1 and 6.2 p.p., respectively, in all blocks and blocks 1-2.



17
  When GQE estimates are reported within subsamples of blocks 1-2 and 3-5, control
observations in untreated, non-experimental municipalities are assigned to the block
corresponding to the treated observations on the opposite side of the border segment.


                                                 14
   Despite these differences between the GQE and the experiment, bootstrapped p-values in

Table 3 suggest that the estimates are not statistically distinguishable from one another. Even so,

one can pose a practical question: would a reasonable policy analyst—relying on the GQE point

estimates and blinded to the experimental ones—have reached conclusions as optimistic as those

of Galiani and McEwan (2013)? Most likely the attenuated GQE estimates would have yielded

more guarded conclusions.



4. Empirical Strategy

A. External and internal validity of the GQE

   We consider two explanations for the divergence in point estimates of the GQE and the

experiment, related to external and internal validity. Recall that treated caseríos in the GQE are a

non-random subset of all treated caseríos. First, they are close to municipal borders. Second, they

share a border with untreated, non-experimental caseríos. This naturally excludes caseríos in the

spatial core of the experimental sample. As Figures 3 and 4 suggest, excluded caseríos might

exhibit higher rates of child stunting or greater concentrations of indigenous children.

   Thus, treated children in the GQE are plausibly different in variables observed by the

econometrician—such as distance-to-border, height-for-age, and ethnicity—and perhaps in

unobserved variables, such as income. If these variables moderate treatment effects, then the

GQE estimates—even internally valid ones—will differ from the experimental benchmarks in

Table 1. In the present application, it is plausible that GQE caseríos are “less poor” than other

treated ones. Since treatment effects are much larger in the poorest municipalities (see Table 1),

this provides a plausible explanation for the attenuated GQE treatment effects.




                                                 15
   An alternative explanation for the divergence of point estimates is related to internal validity.

Suppose that treated children in the GQE differ in unobserved ways from their bordering control

group, even after conditioning on a rich set of covariates (e.g., they are more likely to be poor, an

unmeasured variable). This too could explain attenuated treatment effects, assuming that poorer

children are less likely to enroll in school and more likely to work.



B. Experimental samples used to assess validity

   Table 4 summarizes the experimental samples that we use to assess the external and, then,

the internal validity of the GQE. The full experimental sample was already used, in Table 1, to

obtain estimates of the average treatment effect (ATE). Given the design of the experiment, the

estimates are generalizable to a well-defined, policy-relevant population of Honduran children

residing in malnourished municipalities.

   We next limit the experimental sample to children residing in caseríos no more than 2

kilometers from any municipal border. This sample—denoted experiment 1—is used to obtain

estimates of ATE1. If distance-to-border does not moderate treatment effects, then ATE and

ATE1 (and estimates thereof) should be similar.

   We further limit the sample of experiment 1 to children residing in caseríos no more than 2

kilometers from a municipal border shared with untreated, non-experimental caseríos. This

sample—denoted experiment 2—includes exactly the same sample of treated caseríos (and

children) as the GQE. However, its control group consists of the experimental control group

subject to the same sample restriction (illustrated in Figure 5). By using an experimental control

group instead of a quasi-experimental one, we can abstract from the internal validity of the GQE

and focus on external validity. If observed and unobserved moderators are similarly distributed




                                                 16
across the samples of experiments 1 and 2, then ATE1 and ATE2 (and estimates thereof) should

be similar.

   If they differ, then it weakens the GQE’s claim on external validity. More constructively, one

can further diagnose whether the samples of experiment 1 and 2 differ in their distributions of

observed moderators of treatment effects. If they do, then one can re-weight the sample in

experiment 2 to resemble that of experiment 1, and re-estimate effects (Cole and Stuart, 2010).

To the extent that relevant moderators are observed and contribute to the estimation of the

weights, then weighted estimates should be similar to estimates of ATE1. If they still diverge,

then it suggests that a relevant moderator is unobserved. The next subsection will further

elaborate the assumptions and method.

   Lastly, we assess the internal validity of the GQE in two ways. We first compare GQE

estimates from Table 3 to those of ATE2, which uses an experimental rather than quasi-

experimental control group for the same sample of treated children. Any divergence is indicative

of bias in the GQE. Second, we implement the placebo test alluded to in an earlier section. We

construct a placebo sample of untreated, experimental caseríos no more than 2 kilometers from a

municipal border shared with untreated, non-experimental caseríos. We anticipate finding zero

effects in the “GQE” placebo sample, conditional on covariates. A positive or negative effect is

likely the result of imbalance in unobserved variables.



C. Inverse-probability weighting and external validity

  Using the potential outcomes framework, let the outcome 𝑌 for individual 𝑖 be a function of a

randomly-assigned treatment 𝑇𝑖 . The difference in potential outcomes under treated (1) and




                                                17
untreated (0) conditions is 𝑌𝑖 (1) − 𝑌𝑖 (0). Table 1 reported estimates of the average treatment

effect (ATE) in a well-defined, policy-relevant sample, denoted 𝑆.

     We will further report estimates of ATE2 in the non-random subsample of experiment 2,

denoted 𝑆2 . If the treatment has heterogeneous effects on individuals, moderated by a set of

variables 𝑋, then effects may differ across samples depending on the distribution of 𝑋. An

intuitive method of correcting for this difference is to re-weight 𝑆2 so that its distribution of

moderators is similar to 𝑆 (Cole and Stuart, 2010; Stuart et al., 2015).

     Closely following Hotz, Imbens, and Mortimer (2005), we specify three assumptions under

which the procedure can recover ATE from 𝑆2 .18 Assumption 1 is that the treatment is randomly

assigned in 𝑆2 :

                                       𝑇𝑖 ⊥ [𝑌𝑖 (1), 𝑌𝑖 (0)]|𝑆2 .

The assumption is satisfied because there was random assignment in 𝑆, and 𝑆2 is a subsample of

treatment and control groups obtained by imposing exogenous sample restrictions.

     Assumption 2 asserts that one’s presence in the subsample does not depend on potential

outcomes, given the moderators:

                                    (𝑖 ∈ 𝑆2 ) ⊥ [𝑌𝑖 (1), 𝑌𝑖 (0)]|𝑋𝑖 .

Hotz et al. (2005) refer to this as unconfounded location. Stuart et al. (2011) invoke a similar

assumption and refer to it as unconfounded sample selection. Both papers highlight the need to

measure all relevant moderators in order to satisfy the assumption. Lastly, Assumption 3 imposes

a requirement of common support for the moderators between the two samples. For each

moderator, it must be the case that:



18
  Given the assumptions described below, Hotz et al. (2005) show that 𝐴𝑇𝐸 =
𝐸[𝑌𝑖 (1) − 𝑌𝑖 (0)|𝑆] = 𝐸{𝐸[𝑌𝑖 |𝑇𝑖 = 1, 𝑆2 , 𝑋𝑖 ] − 𝐸[𝑌𝑖 |𝑇𝑖 = 0, 𝑆2 , 𝑋𝑖 ]|𝑆}.

                                                   18
                                        0 < 𝑃(𝑖 ∈ 𝑆2 |𝑋𝑖 ) < 1.

In the present context, assumption 3 does not hold for one moderator, namely distance-to-border

(since observations more than 2 kilometers from the border have zero probability of contributing

to 𝑆2 ). However, we can reframe the task as generalizing from the sample 𝑆2 to 𝑆1, which also

imposes the 2-kilometer distance restriction (Stuart et al., 2011). Common support holds for all

other covariates.

     Assumption 2 may not hold if there are unobserved moderators. A typical study cannot verify

this, just as a typical observational study cannot directly test for selection-on-unobservables into

a treatment or control group. In contrast, we can compare weighted estimates in experiment 2 to

estimates of ATE1. Any difference suggests that relevant moderators are unobserved.

     To implement the method, we estimate inverse probability weights (Cole and Stuart, 2010;

Stuart et al., 2015).19 In 𝑆1—which imposes the 2-kilometer distance buffer—we estimate a logit

regression in which the dependent variable indicates observations in 𝑆2 . The regressors include

21 covariates, 6 squared terms, and dummy variables indicating missing values.20 They further

include block dummy variables, mean municipal height-for-age, distance-to-border, and squared

terms for the latter two. Lastly, we calculate inverse probability weights for observations in 𝑆2 as

𝑤𝑖 (𝑋𝑖 ) = 1/𝑝̂ (𝑋𝑖 ), where 𝑝̂ is the estimated probability that an observation is selected for 𝑆2 .



5. Results

A. External validity: experiment 1




19
   Cole and Stuart (2011) prove that the method yields consistent estimates—in this paper, of
ATE1—under assumptions similar to those just described.
20
   When weighted estimates are reported in subsamples (e.g., blocks 1-2), we separately estimate
weights in that subsample.


                                                   19
   Tables 5 to 7 reports results for the three dependent variables. Experiment 1 includes children

residing in caseríos within 2 kilometers of any municipal border. Imposing this restriction

slightly increases the positive enrollment estimates and makes the work-related estimates slightly

more negative. In Table 4, for example, the enrollment estimate is 8.9 percentage points inside

the buffer (versus 8.1 in Table 1). Further limiting the sample to blocks 1 and 2, the estimate in

experiment 1 is 16.3 p.p. (versus 15 p.p. in Table 1). There is no ready explanation for the slight

increases in enrollment effects in Table 5 (and slightly more negative work effects reported in

Tables 6 and 7). The mean covariate differences between the full experimental sample and

experiment 1 are small and statistically insignificant (full results are available from the authors).

This suggests that distance-to-border is a proxy for other, unobserved moderators.



B. External validity: experiment 2

   Tables 5 to 7 also report estimates for experiment 2. Recall that it includes the same treated

observations as the GQE sample, but with an experimental control group. Imposing this sample

restriction reduces the enrollment estimates by 2.6 p.p. relative to experiment 1, apparently

driven by a 3 p.p. decline in the blocks 1-2 subsample. A similar pattern of attenuation is evident

for work-in-home estimates (Table 7), but not for work-outside-home (Table 6). For the latter

variable, the coefficient in the blocks 1-2 sample is slightly more negative.

   Did the sample restriction in experiment 2 change the distribution of plausible moderating

variables? In fact, observations in the experiment 2 sample are 8 percentage points less likely to

belong to blocks 1-2 (see Appendix Table C.1). There are also substantial differences for specific

covariates, especially within blocks 1-2 (see Figure 6). For example, households of children in

experiment 2 are 12 p.p. more likely to have electric light, 10 p.p. more likely to own a




                                                 20
television, and their mothers have two-thirds of a year more schooling, on average. In addition to

Galiani and McEwan (2013), the literature on Latin American CCTs usually finds that effects on

school enrollment are larger among poorer households (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009). This implies

that sample selection on observed (and perhaps unobserved) moderating variables—all common

proxies for poverty—is responsible for the pattern of attenuated estimates in experiment 2.



C. External validity: weighted estimates in experiment 2

   To further examine this issue, we estimated the probability that each observation in

experiment 1 was selected for experiment 2 (using the logit specification described earlier). The

mean difference in the estimated propensity score between the samples of experiment 2 and

experiment 1 is 0.045 (or 37% of the standard deviation in the experiment 1 sample). For each of

the 21 covariates, we then estimated the standardized difference between the weighted mean in

experiment 2—applying the inverse-probability-weights described earlier—and the unweighted

mean in experiment 1. As Figure 6 illustrates, re-weighting nearly eliminates observed

differences between the two samples.

   Finally, Tables 5 to 7 report weighted estimates in the experiment 2 sample. We anticipate

that the weighted estimates will more closely resemble those from experiment 1. On the contrary,

we find that the point estimates from unweighted and weighted specifications in experiment 2 are

quite similar (and both exhibit similar patterns of attenuation relative to experiment 1). One

interpretation is that sample selection into experiment 2 altered the distribution of unobserved

variables that moderate treatment effects, leading to a violation of assumption 2.

   What else might be done? One possibility is to implement a two-stage correction for sample

selection, à la Heckman (1979). In the sample of experiment 1, one estimates a first-stage probit




                                                21
with a dependent variable indicating selection into experiment 2. It includes the same

independent variables as the logit used to estimate the inverse-probability weights, in addition to

variable(s) that affects selection into experiment 1, but not child outcomes. Of course,

compelling exclusion restrictions are usually hard to come by (and no obvious candidates exist in

our application). Finally, in the second-stage regression, one includes the inverse Mills ratio as a

regressor (along with other covariates) and examines its sign and significance for evidence of

sample selection bias.



D. Internal validity

   Recall the estimates in experiment 2 use the same group of treated children as the GQE, but

with an experimental control group. How do they compare to the quasi-experimental GQE

estimates reported in Table 3? For enrollment, the GQE estimates are attenuated relative to those

of experiment 2 (which themselves were attenuated relative to those of experiment 1). This is

especially evident in the blocks 1-2 subsample. The enrollment effect is 13.3 p.p. in experiment 2

and 10.6 in the GQE. The work-related variables provide less obvious conclusions because the

estimates—in the experiment 2 and GQE samples—are small and not significant at 5% in blocks

1-5. In blocks 1-2, however, the point estimates for work-outside-home have a similar magnitude

in both samples. In summary, the evidence is suggestive the GQE enrollment estimates are

downward biased relative to the unbiased estimates from experiment 2.

   Finally, Table 8 reports the placebo test described earlier. In the first column, the coefficients

are small and statistically insignificant, providing some evidence that the GQE estimates are not

explained by selection-on-unobservables. The pattern is not as clear in blocks 1-2, likely due to

the much smaller samples of municipalities (recalling the experimental control group contained




                                                 22
fewer municipalities than the treatment group). Overall, the imprecision prevents us from ruling

out some bias in the GQE estimates.



E. Compound treatment irrelevance

   The GQE must assume that the conditional cash transfer is the only treatment that varies

across borders (or, if there is another, that is does not affect potential outcomes). Keele and

Titiunik (2015, 2016) describe this assumption as compound treatment irrelevance. In the

Honduran context, the most likely violation occurs when a municipal border is also a department

border. Although the management and financing of Honduran public schools is still highly

centralized, each department controls some functions, especially related to personnel

management. This leaves open the possibility that the assumption is violated, and so we assess

robustness to the dropping of observations near municipal border segments that also happen to be

department borders.

   Of course, this occasions further non-random sample restrictions, which may affect external

validity. Thus, Tables D.1 to D.3 repeat all experimental analyses from Tables 5 to 7 after

excluding municipal border segments that are also a department border. The immediate result is

a reduction in the number of municipalities in experiment 2 (from 52 to 43). Despite the reduced

precision, the substantive findings are similar to earlier ones, focusing especially on blocks 1-2.

The large effects for enrollment and work-at-home (in experiment 1) are attenuated in

experiment 2, while the effects are more robust across samples for work-outside-home. Applying

inverse probability weights to experiment 2 again has little effect on the point estimates. Table

D.4 then replicates the GQE estimates. Here too, the substantive conclusions are similar. The

only obvious difference is an attenuation of the enrollment estimate in blocks 1-2 (from 10.6 to




                                                 23
7.3 percentage points), though the full-sample estimates are within 0.2 percentage points of one

another.



6. Conclusions

    This paper analyzed a geographic quasi-experiment embedded in a cluster-randomized

experiment in Honduras. In the experiment, average treatment effects on school enrollment and

child labor were large—especially in the poorest blocks—and could be generalized to a policy-

relevant population given the original sample selection criteria (Galiani and McEwan, 2013;

IFPRI, 2000). In contrast, the geographic quasi-experiment yielded point estimates that, for two

of three dependent variables, were attenuated. A judicious policy analyst without access to the

experimental results might have provided misleading advice based on the magnitude of point

estimates.

   We assessed two main explanations for the difference in point estimates, related to external

and internal validity. The GQE sample is necessarily restricted to children residing close to a

municipal border with cross-border variation in the treatment. Sample selection modifies the

distribution of some observed and (perhaps) unobserved variables that moderate treatment

effects, relative to the original experiment. We find that this explains some, but not all of the

attenuation, especially for school enrollment effects. The remainder is plausibly explained by

imbalance in unobserved variables between treatment and control groups in the 2-kilometer GQE

sample. While there is treatment-control balance along a wide range of pre-specified covariates,

the GQE enrollment estimates are still attenuated relative to the benchmark estimates of

experiment 2.




                                                 24
    Both findings suggest that researchers using geographic designs should carefully describe

how their geographically-imposed convenience sample differs from that of a well-defined, policy

relevant population. If feasible, they might further apply inverse-probability weighting as a

robustness check (following Cole and Stuart, 2010 and the analysis herein). Moreover, they

should carefully assess treatment-control balance in the geographic sample. In this volume,

Keele et al. (2016) discuss related consideration when units of analysis (such as households)

cannot be precisely geo-located.

    The findings on external validity have broader implications for the design and interpretation

of randomized field experiments, which often rely on convenience samples defined by observed

and unobserved moderators of treatment effects (such as poverty, distance to urban centers,

agents’ willingness to submit to randomization, and so on). At a minimum, experiments should

specifically describe the criteria for sample selection (e.g., Campbell et al, 2012), and whether

these variables are plausible moderators of treatment effects. Our paper suggests that authors can

push this exercise further and assess robustness after re-weighting the experimental convenience

sample to resemble a policy-relevant population, with appropriate caveats about selection-on-

unobservables into the convenience sample (Hotz et al., 2005; Cole and Stuart, 2010; Stuart et

al., 2015).

percentile-t procedure with 399 replications. The regressions in this and all subsequent tables
control for block dummy variables, the 21 covariates in Table A.1, squared terms for 6
continuous variables, and dummy variables indicating missing values of variables. Sample sizes
are lower for the work-related variables because the census restricts the question to children 7
and older.
