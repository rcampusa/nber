     The primary purpose of this paper is to reconcile the previous findings

of discount rate endogeneity with the presence of discount rate announcement

effects in securities markets. The crux of this reconciliation is the

     Considerable empirical evidence has been presented (e.g., Waud (1970)) to

support the assertion that discount rate changes contain "announcement

effects" concerning the future course of monetary policy which significantly

affect security prices.1 Roley and Troll (1984) contend that the validity of

this assertion depends on the operating procedures employed by the monetary

authorities, Specifically, they present an analytical framework which

demonstrates that with a policy of interest rate targeting, which

characterized open market operating procedures prior to October 1979 (pre—79),

no meaningful announcement effects are possible since any effects on nrket

rates would be offset by changes in the level of nonborrowed reserves. Under

nonborrowed reserve targeting, which has characterized post-October 1979

(post—79) monetary policy, changes in discount rates affect interest rates

directly via (at least) changes in the expected short-run money path.

     Consistent with this view, Roley and Troll report no nnonco ffe&-c

from discount rate changes on the term structure of interest rates from
September 1977 to October 1979, but a significant announcement effect over the

October 1979 to October 1982 period characterized by increases (decreases) in

bond yields being associated with discount rate increases (decreases). Pearce

and Roley (1984) report similar results for stock returns over the identical

time period. Specifically, they find no announcement effect in the pre—

October 1979 period, but significant negative (positive) stock returns

associated with the announcement of discount rate increases (decreases) in the

later period.

     One difficulty with these studies is the assertion that discount rate

changes are unexpected; that is, discount rate changes are exogenous. This is

in contrast to both Lombra and Torto (1977) and Froyen (1975) who present

evidence that the discount rates is a function of open market interest rates
                                       2




and member bank borrowing. Santomero (1983) and the papers cited therein

describe current discount rate policy as passive and responding with a lag to

changes in open market rates. The evidence from these studies suggest that

discount rate changes are endogenous, and that even if these changes coincide

with a recent revision in monetary policy objectives, the policy revision

would already be incorporated into market yields. There would be no

announcement effect under either operating procedure, since no new information

is provided by the announcement.

     The presence of an announcement effect associated with an endogenous

(anticipated) discount rate change suggests that securities markets may not be

(semi—strong) efficient. Such a finding would be in stark contrast to the

numerous studies that either assume market efficiency for the purpose of

hypothesis testing or provide empirical evidence in support of market

efficiency.2 Further, the usefulness of the discount rate as a monetary

policy instrument is questionable if endogenous changes generate announcement

effects.

     The primary purpose of this paper is to reconcile the previous findings

of discount rate endogerieity with the presence of discount rate announcement

effects in securities markets. The crux of this reconciliation is the

distinction between "technical" discount rate changes that are endogenous and

"non—technical" changes which contain some informative policy implications.

In essence, we attempt to separate expected discount rate changes from

unexpected changes, or equivalently, the expected component of discount rate

changes from the unexpected component. If markets are efficient, the former

should have no announcement effects while the latter may be associated with an

announcement effect.3 Accordingly, the focus of the empirical analysis is on

the interaction between discount rate exogeneity, the specific monetary policy
                                          3




regime, and announcement effects. In addition, we examine whether the

behavior of these markets in the post—announcement period    is   consistent with

the rapid price adjustment implied by market efficiency.

     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II presents

a brief discussion of the theoretical link between discount rate changes and

market returns as well as a description of the data and methodology.

Preliminary tests reported in this section using our longer sample period

confirm the Roley and Troll and Pearce and Roley findings: a significant

announcement effect characterizes the post-79 period but there is no reaction

of securities markets to discount rate changes in the pre—79 period. The next

two sections   refine   the analysis to distinguish between technical and

nontechnical discount rate changes. Section III provides a description of the

classification scheme that we employ to identify technical and nontechnical

aiscounc race changes. Section IV extends Ute empirical tests of ectin II

using this classification. We find that in the pre—79 period there was no

securities markets response to either technical or nontechnical changes while

in the post79 period there was no response to technical changes. Only

nontechnical changes occurring in the post—79 period were characterized by

significant announcement effects. In Section V we test and find that there is

some evidence of a significant price adjustment in the day immediately

following the actual announcement, but no price adjustment beyond this first

day. Section VI contains our summary and conclusions.


II. Theoretical Framework and Preliminary Results

     Discount rate changes will affect market rates and equity returns if such

changes convey new information about either short or long-run monetary policy

objectives. Roley and Troll argue that an increase in the discount rate that

changes the implied short-run money path would be associated with an objective
                                        4




of returning to an implied long-run money growth path more quickly. As a

result, current (spot) and expected short—term rates rise in reaction to

reduced short-run money growth. Long—term rates and forward rates may also

increase to reflect the higher expected short-term rates. The opposite effect

on interest rates is expected for discount rate decreases. An increase in the

discount rate that changes only long—run monetary policy objectives would be

associated with a decline in long-run trend money growth, reducing expected

inflation and lowering future expected short-term rates. This implies no

change   in current short—term rates and a decline in long-term rates and
forward rates. The opposite is expected for discount rate declines. If the
perception of both short and   long-run policy objectives is changed, a discount

rate increase (decrease) may be   expected to be associated with an increase in
short—term rates but an ambiguous effect on forward rates and long—term
rts. ly nd Tr1l find increases (decreases) in the thonnt rate rsiiTt

in increases (decreases) in short—term and long—term rates, leading them to

conclude that the observed announcement effect is associated with changes in

short—run monetary policy objectives.

     The impact of discount rate changes on equity prices can operate through

two possible channels. This is most readily seen by viewing the value of the

firm as the present value of its future net cash flows. To the extent

discount rate increases (decreases) result in increases (decreases) in

interest rates, the rate at which the firm's cash flows are capitalized will

rise (fall) with a subsequent negative (positive) effect on stock prices.

Additionally, discount rate changes can alter expectations of future cash

flows.    Specifically, discount rate changes that increase or decrease real

economic activity will alter cash flow expectations in the same direction.

One would expect that to the extent both capitalization rates and cash flow
                                           5




expectations are affected by discount rate changes, these effects will work in

the same direction.4 Given the Roley and Troll findings discussed above, we

expect stock price declines to be associated with discount rate increases, a

finding that would be in agreement with the results reported by Pearce and

Roley.

     To assess the impact of discount rate changes on interest rates and stock

prices, we utilize an event-time methodology that is similar to that employed

by Roley and Troll in their paper and by Urich and Wachtel (1981), Roley

(1983) and Pearce and Roley (1983) in their studIes of financial market

reaction to money   supply   changes. The following model is estimated


                                                                               (1)



where R1t is the percentage change in the relevant interest rate or in stock

prices observed on announcement day t of a discount rate change and is

measured from the close of day t -    1   to the close of day t. ARDt is the

percentage change in the discount rate announced on day t, For the purposes

of this study, the announcement day is the day the discount rate change was

reported in the Wall Street Journal. Our tests for differences in financial

market reaction according to technical or nontechnical classification, as well

as the investigation of financial market speed of adjustment issue use

variants of (1) that are described in the following sections.

     The time period for this study is the eight year period from 1975 — 1982

(no discount rate changes in 1983). Over this period there were 36 discount

rate changes, 18 of which occurred prior to October 1979. Twenty—three of

these changes were increases and 13 were decreases. Table 1 provides a

reakdown of the discount rate change data based on the size of the change and

the period in which it occurred. The data indicate a clear shift toward
                                                6




larger absolute changes in the post—79 period as the average change increased

from 43       to   82 basis points.

        The   stock return data is the daily percentage return on the New York
Stock Exchange value weighted index and is          denoted SP. The interest rate data

are for constant maturity Treasury securities and include eight different

maturities: 90, 180 and 360 day bills and three, five, seven, ten and twenty

year bonds. These rates are obtained from DRI, who compile them from the

Federal Reserve Board Statistical Release H.15. These eight interest rates

are used to calculate seven forward rates           in addition to the   90 day bill

rate.     Using       forward rates avoids confounding the effect of discount rate

changes       on short—term     rates with the effect on long—term rates, since

movements          in short—term rates will be reflected in movements in long-term
rates, and         allows   more direct assessment of the effect of discount rate
changcs on the tern structure • Thcc forward ratos aro donotod
                                                             xyr and are
read as the interest rate x periods hence on a security with maturity             y.

Finally, it has          been shown (e.g., Yawitz (1977))   that under quite reasonable

theoretical specifications the risk and maturity structure of interest rates

is better modelled in terms of the so-called discount factor, which is simply

one plus the rate of interest. Accordingly, the percentge changes in both the

interest rate and discount rate series are calculated as the percentage change

in one plus the interest rate.5

        As an initial test, we estimate equation (1) over the pre—79 and post—79

periods for each of nine return series.6 The estimates of the market response

coefficient           are reported in Table 2. Our results confirm the Roley and

Troll and Pearce and Roley findings. For the equity series, there is no

significant market response in the pre—79 period but over the post—79 period

there is a significant negative (positive) response to discount rate increases
                                           7




(decreases).    The magnitude of the response coefficient suggests that a 100

basis point change in the discount rate results in approximately a one percent

change in stock prices on the announcement day, almost identical to the

magnitude reported by Pearce and Roley.

       A similar finding is reported for the interest rate data. Only one

interest rate series evidences a significant market reaction in the pre—79

period, while six of the eight interest rates indicate a significant market

response over the post-79 period.7 The pattern of coefficients suggests a

larger effect on short—term rates than on forward rates with a positive

response on each rate. This finding supports the view that discount rate

changes affect expectations about short—run monetary policy objectives.

Finally, the magnitude of the response coefficients mirror that of Roley and

Troll   and suggest, for example, that a 100 basis point increase in the
dirunt     rM- will increase the 90 T—Bill rate and ,0r.0 by approximately 50
and 18 basis points, respectively.8
       Although the above results confirm earlier findings, the   real   issue is
whether   the observed announcement effect, regardless of the monetary policy

regime, indicates a market inefficiency. If, as available evidence indicates,

the discount rate is endogenous, then the market may be inefficient since it

significantly reacts to an event that should contain no new information. The

hypothesis of this paper is that not all discount rate changes are entirely

endogenous   and those that are not may provide securities markets with new
information that will lead to an adjustment    in prices. Financial markets will

be   considered inefficient only if   technical discount rate changes are

characterized   by announcement effects.

iii.    Classification of Discount Rate Changes

       The previous discussion clearly indicates that to properly assess the

announcement effects of discount rate changes it is necessary to distinguish
technical from nontechnical changes. Roley and Troll recognize this and

attempt to explain daily discount rate changes via a regression equation,

relating     such changes to changes in the Fed Funds rate •   Due   to the low
explanatory power of the equation, they are led to conclude that the entire
change in the discount      rate is unexpected; that is, all discount rate changes

are nontechnical.9 This finding is also used by Pearce and Roley to justify

their   assumption of discount rate exogeneity.

        There are several shortcomings with this approach, however, that limit

its usefulness in predicting discount rate changes and cast substantial doubt

on the assumption of discount rate exogeneity. First, the current method of

ch.ancTina   the   discount rate requires the approval of the Executive Committee of

the Federal Reserve Banks board of directors, which are contacted by phone

every two weeks. Accordingly, the discount rate can only be changed at most

one day every two weeks. This implies a daily model of discount rate changes

is,    in some sense, attempting to capture a biweekly event so      that such a model

is unlikely to yield good forecasts. A second shortcoming is the tenuous

nature of constructing any reduced form model, This is particularly important

in modelling discount rate changes where there are nonquantifiable factors,

such as public statements by Federal Reserve officials, that may affect

expectations concerning discount rate changes. Third, given the discrete

nature    of discount rate changes and the volatility of the Fed Funds rate,      it
is    also not surprising that both the    explanatory and predictive power of such
an equation is low. Indeed, despite the infrequent changes in the discount
rate, the extent of Fed Funds variability suggests that non—zero predictions
                                            9




of   discount rate change are present for every day. Finally, as suggested by

points one and three, the     inability   to forecast the precise day of a discount

rate change, as such models attempt to do, does not necessarily mean that

changes in the discount rate are mostly unexpected, but only that their exact

timing cannot be predicted.

      Given the above, we rely on two different methods to classify discount

rate changes. The first is a statistical model that attempts to avoid or at

least mitigate the shortcomings of the Roley and Troll discount rate change

model.    In our approach, we use weekly and not daily data, since the former is

more consistent with Federal Reserve operating procedures. If the model

specification is RD = f(.), then the anticipated or technical component of an

actual discount rate change is f(.) and the unanticipated or nontechnical

component is ,RD —   f(.),   which is simply the error term from the xwdel. To

            1-h rrcts to daily forecasts we assume that a discount rate

change predicted in week t is anticipated regardless of the day in week t it

is actually announced and an unanticipated discount rate change in week t is a

surprise regardless of the day it is announced.

      Several different specifications were estimated, including variants of

those used by Roley and Troll, Lombra and Torto and by Brown (1981). One

notable finding is the rejection of model stability over the pre-79 arid post-

79 periods. In all cases, the mean square error was at least twice as large

in the   latter period. The best model, both          in terms of in—sample fit and

predicting actual discount rate changes, related changes in the discount rate

(measured   in basis points) to the spread between the Fed Funds rate and the
discount rate (denoted SPREAD) over the last four weeks and changes in member
bank borrowing, calculated for week t      as   the   change   in   borrowing   from week t—1

to t (denoted BORRGW), over the last four weeks. The results of this model
                                            10




estimation are reported in Table 3.        Although   still low, the explanatory power
represents    a substantial improvement over Roley and Troll. Given the discrete

nature of discount rate changes it is not surprising that the magnitude of

actual discount rate changes is always underpredicted. Nonetheless, if the

model incorporates the relevant information set, then by construction the

forecasts are optimal predictions based on available information and,

therefore, rational.

        The second method for classifying discount rate changes is much simpler

and more straightforward. When the Federal Reserve Board changes the discount

rate, it states the reason for its action in a press release at the time of

the discount rate change. For the purpose of this paper, technical changes

are those purportedly taken entirely to bring the discount rate in closer

alignment    with money market rates. All other changes, even if       they are

cjescrihd by the pre                    rdominant1v for technical reasons, are

classified as nontechnical.

        Two points   about   this second method&ogy and its implications need to be

made.     First, it implicitly assumes the reasons     given by the Fed are accurate

or    at least that the market perceives that they are accurate. As a check, the
interpretation presented in the       Wall Street Journal, which may more accurately

reflect the market's perceptions, was also examined. For the time period

1971—1980, only one discrepancy was found. Therefore, use of the press

releases for classification seems appropriate.0

        Second, many of the changes classified as nontechnical also are at least

partially    technical in nature according to    the press releases. For example,

the    rationale given for the discount rate change on September 22, 1978 was     "to

bring    [the] discount rate in closer alignment with short-term interest rates,
and as a further step to strengthen the dollar." This clearly contains both
                                            11




technical    and nontechnical elements. Accordingly, one possible explanation

for the endogeneity—announcement effect anomaly is that the endogeneity

finding reflects technical changes and the technical elements of nontechnical

changes, while the nontechnical changes are responsible for the observed

announcement effect. Our criteria for a discount rate change to be classified

as technical has the effect of biasing against a finding that nontechnical

changes exert a stronger effect on financial markets.

      These two technologies for classifying discount rate changes are distinct

in that the statistical method explicitly divides every discount rate change

into a technical and a nontechnical component, whereas our specification of

the   uFederal   Reserve announcement (FRA) classification method" classifies the

entirechange as either technical or nontechnical. Since discount rate
changes generally consist of both technical and nontechnical components, it        is

tempting    to   assert   the superiority of the statistical methr. (iven   the
difficulties     in modelling discussed above, however, the Federal Reserve

announcement classification method may provide a more accurate decomposition

of discount rate changes. It is an empirical question as to which is the

superior approach.

      Despite the differences in determining technical and nontechnical

composition, if both classification schemes reflect market expectations then

there should be some degree       of consistency across the models. That is, if   the

statistical method indicates that a large percentage of a discount rate change

is unanticipated (anticipated) then we would expect the FRA method to classify

the change as nontechnical (technical). If this       is true, the correlation
coefficients between the percentage of a discount rate change classified as
technical   under one method with the percentage of a discount rate change

classified as nontechnical under the alternative method should be negative,
                                                12




while the correlation coefficients of like classifications between methods

should be positive. This is, in fact, the case. The former correlation

coefficients are —.442 and the latter are .442.12


IV. Empirical Results

     Of the 18 pre—79 discount rate changes, 11 are classified as

nontechnical, while of the 18 post—79 discount rate changes, 12 are classified

as nontechnical.13 To begin the analysis, equation (1) is respecified to

capture the technical/nontechnical classifications:


                                         +
                                 =
                                             RDT + NTDNTt     + u                     (2a)



                                         ARDT                                         (2b)
                        it
                             =       +
                                          T tt + NTARD*NT
                                                     t t+       u' .
                                                                 t

In (2a), RDT (RDNT) is that amount of a given discount rate change that is

classified as technical (nontechnical) according to the statistical model. In

(2b) T(NT) is a dummy variable equal to one if the discount rate change is

classified as technical (nontechnical) according to the FRAC method and zero

otherwise. All other variables in (2a) and (2b) are as previously defined.

Our expectations about the coefficient T and                in the pre- and post-79

periods form directly from the monetary policy regime and market efficiency

propositions stated earlier. Under the pre—79 interest rate targeting regime,

we expect    =        = o since, regardless of classification, a discount rate
                 NT
change is not required, and will not by itself change the level of market

interest rates. Given the results reported in Table 2, for the post—79 period

we expect T = 0 for both interest rates and equity prices and NT > 0 for

interest rates and           < 0 for the equity return series. The expectations

of    and     are the same as for               and NT' respectively.
                                           13



        The results of estimating equations (2) for the two subperiods are

reported in Table 4. For the pre—79 period there is virtually no evidence of

announcement effects, regardless of either classification or the

classification method. When (2a) is estimated, only four of the response

coefficients are significant at the ten percent level and one at the five

percent level. Of the three significant coefficients on IRDNT, only one has

the theoretically expected positive sign. Using the FRA method, in only two

instances is       or       significant and the coefficient associated with

nontechnical    changes has the wrong sign. As expected, discount rate changes,

regardless of whether or not they are anticipated, do not affect market rates

under interest rate targeting (pre—79).

        A different picture emerges from the post—79 period. The      of virtually

every equation is higher than that reported in Table 2, indicating that

aitionl information is provided when discount        rate changes are separated
into    technical and   nontechnical changes.14 For six of the eight interest
rates   the market response coefficient to nontechnical discount rate changes is

positive and significant at the five percent level.      In no case is the

response    coefficient positive and significant at even the ten percent level
for technical changes. For equity returns, there is a negative and
significant effect of nontechnical changes, but no significant stock market
reaction    to technical changes. These statements are accurate for both

classification methods. Not surprisingly, for the seven significant response

coefficients, both         and '   are larger (in absolute value) than the

response coefficients reported in Table 2. While the results reported in

Table 2 mirror Roley and Troll and Pearce and Roley in implying a 100 basis

point increase in the discount rate results in a 50 basis point increase in

R90 and a one percent decline in stock prices, we find that nontechnical
                                          14




increases of identical magnitude increase 'o by 70 basis points and reduce

stock prices by 1.6 percent.

    These results provide strong support for the hypothesis that the market

responds differently to discount rate changes depending on whether they are

viewed as technical or nontechnical. That is, there is a significant

announcement effect associated with discount rate changes that provide the

market with new information, while there is no discernible announcement effect

associated with technical discount rate changes. This finding is consistent

with and supports    the   existence of the semistrong form of market efficiency.

     The   results   provide an explanation of the apparent anomalous finding of

an endogenous discount rate coexisting with announcement effects. Technical

discount rate changes are, by definition, endogenous. Nontechnical discount

rate changes actually consist of both technical and nontechnical elements.

ccrdir;ly, it is not surprising that discount rate chan'es as a whole fail

tests of statistical exogeneity. On the other hand, the announcement effect

reported here and in previous studies for the post—79 period for discount rate

changes as a whole seems to be due to inappropriately treating all discount

rate changes the same. Specifically, the results of this paper suggest that

the observed announcement effect is due only to nontechnical elements while

the technical elements do not generate a market reaction. The discount rate

endogeneity—announceiflent effect anomaly is not an anomaly at all and is simply

due to a misspecification.15

     Finally, the strength of these results is also reflected in the

consistency   of   the findings across discount rate change classification

methods.  In addition to yielding virtually identical qualitative results, the
coefficients    and      are similar for every asset price and in no case can
the null of equal coefficients be rejected. Despite the similarity, however,
                                                   15




it is of interest to see whether one model dominates the other. A cursory

examination suggests the FRA             classification     method is superior to the

statistical classification method since, as measured by the R2, the former

explains a higher variation of movements in asset price in all cases but one.

        To formally compare model structure, we employ the pairwise test of

alternative hypotheses suggested by Davidson and MacKinnon (1981) and utilized

by Urich and      Wachtel   (1984) to compare expectations models of money supply

announcements. This test asserts that if there are two model specifications

given by y =      f(.)   and y =   g(.),    then the null hypothesis that the    first
specification is true can          be tested by estimating the model

                                             =   f(•)   +                                    (3)

where
         Yg
              is the predicted value from y =           g(,).   If the first specification

f(.) is true (rolative to tho ltti:: g(fl, than                        will not e

significantly different from zero. Of course, both models can be accepted as

"true," just as each model can add explanatory power to the other and hence be

said to dominate the other.

        The t—statistics for the pairwise specification tests are given in the

last two rows of Table 4, with the model for the null hypothesis listed at the

left.  These test statistics indicate that with one exception neither model
can be said to dominate the other. It should be noted, however, that in all
but one case the test statistic is higher when predictions from the FRA are
added to the statistical model than vice—versa. We view this as additional
weak evidence      in   favor   of the   FRA method.


V. Speed      of Asset Price Adjustment
     As previously noted, an efficient             market adjustment implies that there

should   be no response of asset prices           to    discount rate changes in the post—
                                         16




announcement period. We define the post—announcement period as the five

trading days immediately following the announcement day t, i.e., days t+1 to

t+5. These five days correspond to the first trading week after the discount

rate change announcement. Equations (2) were then reestimated using five

alternative dependent variables to reflect asset price changes on days t+1

through t+5. Accordingly,            is defined as the percentage change in the

relevant interest rate or stock prices observed on the th        day    after a

discount   rate change and is measured from the close of day t+j—1 to the close
of t+j. Based on the comparison of model structure reported above, we
describe and report the results only for the FRA method, while noting that the
statistical method yielded virtually identical results for each method.
       Given the findings reported in Table 4, our primary concern and interest
is with nontechnical changes occuring in the post-79 period. The results from
the other three classifications can be easily cumrizcd 'nd hence      not

reported in a table. Of the 45 response coefficients estimated each for

technical changes in the pre— and post79 period, only one is significant at

the five percent leveL. For pre—79 nontechnical changes, only 4 of the 45

response coefficients are significant at the five percent level and one of

these has the wrong sign. For each asset and classification, F—statistics

based on the null hypothesis that the sum     of   the response coefficients over

the post announcement period equals zero were calculated. In no case could

this   null hypothesis be   rejected at even the ten   percent level.
       In Table 5 we report the   response coefficients and   F-statistics for the
classification of primary interest, nontechnical post—79 discount rate
changes. For the day following the announcement, four of the interest rate

and the stock price coefficients are significant at a      minimum of the ten

percent    level.16 This day t+1 price response was also found by Pearce and
                                               17




Roley for stock price adjustment to discount rate changes. For days t+2

through t+5, only 3 of a possible 40 response coefficients are significant at

the five percent level, and one of these has the wrong sign. Because of the

number of coefficients estimated over the post—announcement period, the

statistical significance of any small set of coefficients should be

interpreted cautiously. In particular, the number of statistically

significant coefficients we found for days t+2 to t÷5 would be expected even

if no actual relationship exists. A more convincing test of slow price

adjustment    is the   F—statistic based on the null hypothesis that the response

coefficients    over   the post—announcement period sunt to zero. These test

statistics    for nontechnical post—79 changes are reported in the last row of
Table 5.     In no   case can the   null   of no asset price reaction be    rejected   at
the   five percent level. Overall, the empirical results described above and

reported   in Table    5 provide strong     support for the   rapid price   djutmnt
associated with market efficiency and indicate that, to the extent markets
react   to discount rate changes, the reaction is        largely   complete by the   end    of
the announcement day and certainly complete by the end of day t+1.

VI. Conclusions
      The purpose of this paper has been to reconcile previous findings of both
an endogenous    discount rate and discount rate announcement effects with market
efficiency. By       classifying   discount rate changes as either technical or
nontechnical,    and recognizing that the latter are (at least) partially

endogenous, it is argued that the discount rate can fail tests of statistical

exogeneity and still exhibit announcement effects within the framework of

market efficiency. To be valid, however, only nontechnical discount rate

changes should exhibit announcement effects.17 Combined with the evidence

that the potential for announcement effects associated with discount rate
                                             18




changes depends on the monetary policy regime, the implication is that only

nontechnical post—79 discount rate changes should yield announcement

effects. The empirical evidence of this paper supports this view and suggests

previous studies were misspecified by not controlling for the purpose of the

discount rate change.

       The evidence also implies that the common assumption, contained in

virtually all theoretical and empirical macroeconomic models, that the

discount rate is either purely endogenous or purely exogenous, is

inappropriate. in addition, our findings may have some bearing on the

continuing debate over the usefulness of the discount rate as a tool for

macroeconomic policy. One argument against its use has been that it can

generate perverse announcement effects because the public, as Waud (1970, p.

250) states, reads "broader economic implications into even 'routine technical

.nnnt'"             Th   evidence here   indicates   that this is not the se

Markets react only when there appears to be a shift in policy-—which is when a

market   reaction is desirable——and not to technical adjustments in the discount
rate. At least from this       standpoint, one cannot rule out the discount rate as

a   useful tool of monetary policy.
       Finally,   our results support the existence of efficient markets based on

the   dual finding that only nontechnical changes are characterized by

announcement effects and that virtually the entire market adjustment occurs by

the end of the    announcement day.

       1For other studies that have reported significant announcement effects of
discount rate changes on a variety of securities markets, see Baker and Meyer
(1980), and Brown (1981), as well as those discussed in the text.

     2For a discussion of market efficiency and a review of some relevant
literature, see Fama (1970) and Copeland and Wes ton (1979).

     3This is a much stronger statement than is actually necessary.
Specifically, although a technical change in the discount rate may be known
with certainty, its timing may not. Since discount rate  changes have real
effects, this timing uncertainty may give rise to an announcement effect in
some markets even for endogenous discount rate changes. If timing uncertainty
is at least as great for nontechnical changes as it is for technical changes,
market efficiency would lead us to assert that the announcement effect of a
nontechnical change exceeds that associated with a technical change.
                                                                      Our
discussion in the text, which can be viewed as assuming no timing uncertainty,
is one example of this assertion and, given the empirical findings, simplifies
the exposition of the paper. it is important, however, to be aware of the
timing issue and to recognize that an announcement effect associated with
discount rate changes is appropriately viewed as a necessary but not
sufficient condition to assert that the market is inefficient.

     41n principle, one could separate out the numerator and denominator
effects of discount rate changes on stock prices. Such an analysis, however,
involves rather heroic assumptions and would be, at most, of tangential
relevance to our research.
                                                                              -

approxmatiOfl to calculating forward rates is presented by Shiller, Campbell
and Schoenholtz (1983) was shown by Roley and Troll to make little difference.

     61n the post—79 period there was either an imposition of or an increase
in a surcharge on discount window borrowing on the same announcement day as
three discount rate changes. To control for this, the estimation of all
equations over the post—79 period includes a dummy variable equal to one when
the surcharge change is announced on the same day as a discount rate change
and is zero otherwise. Exclusion of this variable does not change our
results.

       7me two rates   that do not indicate a response to discount rate changes
                                                                  Troll. This
correspond to the intermediate forward rate 5r5 used by Roley and     discount
is also the rate they reported as not being significantly affected by
rate changes.

       8The results in Table 2 indicate clearly that the size of the discount
rate   change is an important determinant of asset price reaction. To examine
this   finding further, we tested whether only the announcement of a discount
rate   change, regardless of magnitude, explains asset price reaction. This was
done   via estimation of the equation.

           < 0) and 8 = 0 for interest rates (stock prices). Otherwise we
epect C= 0 and 8 to be as discussed in the text. In all cases,        was not
significaCntly different from zero and 8 was similar in magnitude and
significance to the results reported in Table 2. This finding provides
further support for the specification given in equation (1).

     9Roley and Troll find that only when the fed funds rate increases by at
least 100 basis points is there a significant relationship between changes in
the fed funds rate and changes in the discount rate. Further, negative
movements in the fed funds rate do not indicate any significant relationship
between changes in the fed funds rate and changes in the discount rate.

     10We used the Federal Reserve press release to classify this
controversial discount rate change, which occurred on February 5, 1975.
Classification according to the Wall Street Journal's interpretation made
virtually no difference in the results.

     There are, however, at least two difficulties that are more severe for
the statistical method. In some sense, every week where a discount rate
change is not made has a "non—announcement" effect that could effect security
prices. This difficulty, of course, will characterize any study of
announcement effects when the timing of the announcement is not a priori
known. Additionl1y, discount rctc changes have been 25. 50 or 100 basis
points, but predictions of the statistical model may be any amount, so that
some predictions of discount rate changes (e.g., 11 basis points) may be
unrealistic. It may be more appropriate, then, to view the statistical method
as reflecting the probability of a discount rate change multiplied by the size
of the expected change. This suggests possibly using a logit model to
estimate probabilities of discount rate changes. Such a model would still be
characterized by the first difficulty and, further, there is no control for
size   or direction unless even more complexity is added via a multinomial logit
model.
     2The correlation between the percentage of technical components and
between nontechnical components across models are equal, and the correlation
between the technical and nontechnical components of the models equal in
magnitude but of opposite sign to the like correlations, because using
percentages normalizes all discount rate changes to be the same size and the
two classifications must sum to one.
     This, of course, does not hold if magnitudes are used instead of
percentages. The former are sensitive to the absolute size of discount rate
change. Since it is likely that both technical and nontechnical components
will increase with the absolute size of a discount rate change, a positive
correlation between the technical and nontechnical classifications of the two
methods could result. Even so, we expect the like classifications of the two
models to be more highly correlated than the opposite classifications. Using
magnitudes, the correlation between technical (nontechnical) classifications
of the two models is .70 (.86), while the correlation between technical
(nontechnical) classifications from the statistical method and nontechnical
                                      21




(technical) classification from the FRA method is .50 (.57). This finding
further reflects the consistency of the two models.

     13The data on technical and nontechnical discount rate changes is
available from the authors upon request.

     14The only case where a significant increase (at the five percent level)
in explanatory power is not observed using the FRA method is for the 5r2
forward rate. When the statistical analysis is employed, the explanatory
power of equations using the forward rates 3r2, 7r3 and 10r10 actually
declines.

     150ne conjecture consistent with the empirical evidence and perhaps with
future investigation is the notion that all discount rate changes are
technical in nature but the policy authorities choose the discount rate
announcement as an opportunity to signal changes in the direction and/or
magnitude of monetary policy. Several readers suggested t'e   alternative   view,
consistent with the above conjecture, that while all discount rate changes are
to some extent endogenous, nontechnical changes arise because of changes in or
uncertainty about the policy rule or the Federal Reserve reaction function.

      16 of these interest rates, 5r2 and 7r3, evidence no announcement
effect on day t. This finding may be due to relatively thin trading of
instruments in this maturity range so that the effect of discount rate changes
is not fully reflected in prices until after day t. The existence of thin
trading also implies abnormal returns could not be earned based on a trading
strategy implemented on day t.
     17This assertion assumes no timing uncertainty, otherwise, as previously
noted, an endogenous discount rdte geneating an announcement effect is not
necessarily an indication of market inefficiency.
