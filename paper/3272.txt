                     A POSITIVE THEORY OF SOCIAL SECURITY


                                    ABSTRACT

     In many countries. social security is a large fraction of the

government budget.    Why is it, given that at any moment in time the number

of recipients of social security benefits is smaller than the number of

contributors?    Kore generally, what determines the size of social security?

To answer these questions, this paper studies an overlapping generations

model in which all individuals currently alive vote on social security.

There is no commitment to preserve the legislation inherited from the past.

Voters are weakly altruistic and there is heterogeneity within each

generation.     The paper shows that in equilibrium the size of social security

is larger the greater is the proportion of elderly people in the population,

and the greater is the inequality of pre-tax income.     Both predictions of

the theory are supported by the empirical evidence in cross-country data.

                                I.   INTRODUCTION

     In many countries, social security is a large fraction of the

government budget.     Table I contains different measures of the size of

social security programs for a large number of developing and industrialized

countries in the late 19?Os and early l980s.        In many cases, and for most

industrialized countries, social security expenditures account for over a

third of total government spending.     Yet, it is difficult to explain why a

social security system exists, let alone why it is so large.       At any given

moment in time, the number of recipients of social security benefits is

smaller than the number of contributors.     So, why does a large majority of

the citizens support a system that redistributes towards a minority?

     The literature provides two answers to this question.        The first

stresses intensity of preferences and forms of political participation other

than through voting.     Concentration of benefits among a few and diffusion

of costs among many may explain why retired individuals successfully lobby

to preserve the social security system.1     But for this answer to be

convincing, the costs of the program on the average tax payer must be

relatively small.    This cannot be said of the social security systems

currently prevailing in many countries.2     It seems unlikely that such

programs would be politically viable without the support of a large number

of working individuals.

     The second answer provided by the literature attempts to explain why

workers who pay taxes may favor social security.       The explanation is based

on the assumption of no future revoting.     If the current majority can commit

the future majorities to preserve the law, then even a worker would support

social security, provided that his retirement age is sufficiently near.3

But the assumption of no future revoting is clearly counterfactual.           Society
                                        2




cannot precommit its future decisions on social security Legislation.           And

in practice, the legislation has been changed repeatedly over time.4

     This paper suggests an alternative explanation of why the social

security system is politically viable.      The central idea is that a social

security program redistributes both across and within generations.        The

contributions to the system are linked to wage income, but the benefits are

not (or are linked to a much smaller degree).     As a result, a social

security system also redistributes from high to low income households (for

the U.S., this fact is extensively documented by Roskin et al (1987) and by

Ferrara and Lott (1985)). Hence, poor workers-taxpayers may be in favor of

the program, since the gain to their retired parents is larger than the cost

to them.

     The first part of this paper studies this idea in a simple overlapping

generations model with heterogeneous individuals and exogenous population

growth.     The social security program is chosen in each period under

majority rule.     All the generations currently alive are entitled to vote.

Thus, there is no commitment and in any period the social security

legislation could be repealed.     The absence of commitment implies that

future voting decisions are taken as given by today's voters.      This breaks

the link between current contributions and future benefits.      In any period,

a vote on the social security program is a vote on how much to transfer from

the current young to the current old, with no repercussions on future

legislation.     A central feature of the model is that there is bidirectional

altruism:    parents care about their children, and children care about their

parents.    However, this altruism is sufficiently weak that no private

transfers occur in equilibrium.     AltruUm plays a role only in the political

equilibrium.5    A young voter trades off his tax burden from financing the
                                          3




program against the benefits received by his parent, and so does an olA

Voter.

     The main analytical result is that, with sufficient inequality in labor

income, a social security program is supported in equilibrium by a majority

of the voters.     Moreover, with aggregate shocks to the income of each

generation, the political equilibrium mimics an ex-ante optimal policy of

intergenerational risk sharing, such as that characterized by Cordon and

Varian (1988).

     The analysis also yields two positive implications:          in equilibrium the

size of social security is larger the greater is the pre-tax income

inequality and the larger is the fraction of elderly people in the

population.     The second part of the paper explores these two empirical

implications.     I compare the size of the social security programs of the

countries listed in Table 1, by means of simple cross-country regressions.

I find that indeed the cross-country differences of Table 1 are well

explained by the inequality of pre-tax income and by the age composition of

the population, according to the predictions of the theory.          This finding is

robust to alternative specifications and to the possibility of measurement

error in the explanatory variables.

     The paper outline is as follows.         Section 2 describes the model.

Section 3 characterizes the economic equilibrium.         The voters preferences

are described in Section 4.     Section       5 characterizes the political

equilibrium.     The empirical evidence is explored in Section 6.       Finally,

Section 7 concludes the paper.

                                          2.    The Model

     The economy is populated by overlapping generations.                                Each generation

Lives two periods; hence, in every period two generations are alive.

Members of the old generations are called "parents; members of the young

generations are called "kids".                Every parent has            (l+n)    kids; thus,      n > 0

is the rate of population growth.                Parents and kids are linked by mutual

altruism,     Specifically, let       i        denote the        th   household.          The preferences

of the ith kid born in period             t     are represented by:


                     —   Max[j—   H       +    U(c)      ÷   EtH+J                                       (1)



where c is consumption of the ith kid in period t,                                Ut')     is a well-

behaved utility function,                 is the expectations operator and                         is the

indirect utility function of the period                      t   parent in the       th     household.

The parameter     1 > y > 0      represents the degree of kids' altruism.                         Since a

period t kid becomes a parent in period t+l, he does not discount the

utility function     H1.      The preferences of the period t parent in the ith

household are:


                     —   Maxtd    + S(l+n)J]                                                               (2)



where    d1   is the consumption of the                      parent in period t and• 1 > 6 > 0

is a parameter that measures parents' altruism.                           According to (1) and (2),

altruism depends on family size.                As       n   grows, parents become less selfish

and kids more selfish.6

        Different households have the same preferences but different

endowments.     At the beginning of his life, the                           kid receives an endowment


w(1+e).       The individual specific endowment                       e    can be either positive or

negative and is distributed in the population according to a known function

C(.),     with bounded support        (s,1           inside      the unit circle, zero mean and
                                                    5




negative median.            The aggregate endowment w is drawn at random front                         a

known distribution with support                 (,tz].       The variables w and e are
mutually uncorrelated, and their period t realizations are known to

everybody at the start of period t.                 The serial correlation properties of

     and e do not matter.               Hence, in particular, it does not matter

whether the incomes of parents and kids belonging to the same household are

correlated with each other or not.                 As will become clear below, this is

because of the linearity of consumption in the parents' preferences.

        Each kid pays a non-negative social security tax proportional to his

endowment and may receive a non-negative bequest,                              b/(l+n),    from his

parent.    He can consume, save and leave a non-negative gift to his parent.

Hence the budget constraint of the ith kid in period t is:

                                           b'
                      w(l+e1)(l-r)                   c
                                                         i   +      +   f
                                         + y—.                                                             (3)



where         is the social security tax rate and s and 4                                 denote savings
and gifts respectively.           Individuals can freely borrow or lend.                      Hence,

savings can be positive of negative.

        In the second period of his life, each individual receives an endowment

a   from nature and a non-negative lump-sum                      social       security benefit         from

the government, plus any gift from its kids.                        Hence, the budget constraint

of the ith parent in period t is:


                      a +      + .Rtl -l + 4(t÷n)                   d     +   b                            (4)


where             is the rate of return on the savings accumulated (loans

contracted) in period           t-l.    By the non-negativity constraints on private
                  i
transfers,    I       bi 0,       all    i,t.
                                                6




        Output is non-storable and there are no outside assets (such as fiat

money or government debt).            Hence, in every period the kids' aggregate

savings must be zero in equilibrium:

                   5s dF(s) —          0                                                   (5)



where     FtC.)   is the period t distribution of savings among the kids'

population (to be derived below).

        Finally, the government budget must be balanced in every period.                Since

the mean of       e is   zero, the government budget constraint is:


                     —   (l-+.n)    wr                                                     (6)



        Two features of this model are worth noting.          First and most important.

the social security program redistributes from parent to kid as well as from

rich to poor.      This occurs because the benefit              is lump sum, whereas the

contribution is proportional to income.             This feature of the model reflects

the redistributive character of existing social security programs.                 Since

there is no crucial discontinuity in the model, the results hold even for

less extreme asymmetries between contributions and benefits.                 Second, the

linearity of consumption in the parents' welfare implies that all income

effects are absorbed by this term.             This in turn implies that private

intergenerational transfers are the same for all households, irrespective of

their relative incomes.            While this feature considerably simplifies the

description of the political equilibrium, it is not crucial for the

qualitative results.

        Events unfold according to the following timing.           At the beginning of

each period, the policy             (r,g)   is chosen under majority rule.     By the

government budget constraint, only one of the two policy instruments, say

r,      can be freely set.         Then private agents make their economic decisions.

A   political-economic equilibrium must satisfy two conditions:                     (i)     Economic

Equilibrium:       for any given policy, economic decisions are optimal for

private agents and markets clear,                  (ii)    Political Equilibrium:     The policy

is (weakly) preferred by.at least 50% of the voters to any other policy in                            a

pairwise comparison.


                                       3.    Econo.iic Eaui1ibri
       Consider    first the economic equilibrium for a given policy.                     The first

order conditions with respect to gifts and bequests imply (a subscript

denotes a partial derivative);

                    1         &1J(C)                                                             (7)


where the first (second) inequality is strict if the non-negativity

constraint on bequests (gifts) is binding.                   Throughout the paper I assume

that altruism is sufficiently weak that private transfers never occur,

irrespective of the policy or of the realization of aggregate output.

Specifically, I assume that:


                    U(O)
                               >            IJ(1.+)) >                                           (8)




Under (8), the inequalities in (7) always hold as strict inequalities, so

that       —   b   — 0.       Relaxing this assumption would make it more likely that

the political equilibrium involves a positive transfer through the social

security system (since voters would be more altruistic)                  •   even though it

would complicate the description of the voters                   preferences.

       The optimal amount of savings is determined by the first-order

condition:


                          —
                              U(c),          all   i                                             (9)
                                                        8




Imposing the equilibrium condition (5), and exploiting the budget

constraints, we then obtain a complete description of the economic

equilibrium as a function of the policy                          r:

                      c wt(l.r)
                          —               all       i



                          —   etwt(l.r)
                      d   — a 1- (l+n)wr        +   Rtlwtl(l.rtl)el
                          —   U(w(l.r))
                                  4.   The Voters Preferences
        I now turn to a description of the                      voters preferences for the policy.
Throughout     the rest of the paper by policy I will mean a social security tax

rate,           The government budget constraint then determines                                           residually.

        Insert the equilibrium expressions (10) in the utility function of kids

and parents.         After some transformations, we obtain their utility as a

function of past, current and future policies:

                          —
                              i1r (U(w(l.r))                +   .rwr   +   Rw(l.r)e                +

                                                                                           +   5(l+n)J1

where    u —
               fL.    + a.    Despite being rather complicated, these expressions are

linear in the individual specific parameters                           es'.   This is because all

income effects are absorbed by consumption when old,                                 di,       which in turn

enters linearly in the utility of each generation.                              This property of the

utility function considerably simplifies the characterization of the

political equilibrium.

        Since there is no outside asset and the voters preferences are

additively separable in                              there is no intertemporal link in the voters'

optimization problem:                the policy optimal for voter                                i     in period t is

surprising.           For the average voter, the social security program only

redistributes across generations, with no intragenerational consequences.

Hence, average kids want no social security, and their parents want as much

of it as possible.

        But for non-average kids (i.e.. if e ,.'                                       0),     the policy also has

intragenerational effects, since it redistributes from rich to poor

households,           Specifically, if the ith kid is richer than the average (if

> 0),     then he will be even more opposed to the social security system;

while his parent will be less strongly in favor (or may                                                even    oppose it,       if

e   is sufficiently large).                      And conversely, a poor kid may support the

social security system, while his parent will be even more strongly in favor

of it.

        More generally, by (12) and (13) the voters preferences can be tanked

according to the kids' relative income1                        e:   the larger is the kids' income,

the smaller is the preferred social security tax, for both kids and parents.9

But the parents always prefer a larger social security tax than their kids.

Under the additional assumption that the second order conditions of the voting

problem are satisfied for every voter, we can then conclude that the voters

preferences are single peaked.                The political equilibrium is thus given by the

policy preferred by the median voterJ°

        To identify the median voter, we have to combine the two groups of

voters, parents and kids.               Consider a kid with endowment           e1.   By (12) and

(13) the optimal value of                     for this kid is the same as for the parent of

a kid with endowment              e,    defined by)

Equation (14) enables us to match each kid with a parent who votes exactly

like him.     As expected, the
                                         th    parent is wealthier than the kth kid, since

parents always tend to favor the social. security system more than their own

kids.

        We are now ready to identify the median voters.                     Recall that each

parent has     (l+n)         kids, and that       et       is distributed according to the

function     G(.).       The median voters are a kid with endowments e? and the

parent of a kid with endowment e such that e? and e7 satisfy (14)

and are defined implicitly by:


                     (l+n) c(e?) +         G(e')       —   1   ÷                               (15)

than the median voter kid (who thus prefer higher social security taxes);

the second term is the number of parents poorer than the median voter

parent.     If (15) is satisfied, an equal number of voters lies on the
                                      mk                   mp                        m

Since     G(')    is increasing and e? <                                      e              by (14).           we have         e        <       e    <

e:       the income of the median voter kid is below the median income, whereas

the opposite is true of the median voter parentJ2

convenient to express the equilibrium in terms of the kids consumption,

rather than in terms of the policy.                                           Let        c*           be the kids' consumption in

the political equilibrium.                             Then,             c*      is found by setting the right hand

The political equilibrium is characterized by the condition:


                        (1+n)              G(è(c*)) +               G(&'(c*)l                —    I    +                                                  (17)


The function       C(.)                   is strictly increasing.                                 Differentiating (16) with

respect to        c*       and invoking the second order conditions, it can be shown

that     Ek(c*)        and            E(c*)            are also strictly increasing.14                                        Hence, equation

(17) identifies a unique equilibrium value                                                       c*.        The equilibrium policy,
                                                 12




      is then defined by:


                    — 1   -   —                                                                    (18)
                              t



      Thus, if the political equilibrium is at the median voters interior
optimum, the kids consumption is constant and does not depend on the

aggregate endowment.      The equilibrium social security tax moves in the same

direction as   w,     and fully insures the kids against any aggregate shock.

All aggregate risk is borne by the parents generation.

      Under what conditions does the political equilibrium involve a positive

amount of social security transfers?              This is equivalent to asking when are

the median voters not at the corner                     — 0.   The answer is easily obtained

from (17) and (18).       Since the left hand side of (17) is strictly increasing

in   c*,   the median voters are flQs at the corner                      — 0    if and only if:

                 (l+n)G[Ek(w)]             C(EP(wt)J > 1 +                                             (19)
                                       +



Whenever (19) is satisfied, the equilibrium involves a positive amount of

transfers through the social security system.                    Whether or not this happens

thus depends on the parameter values as well as on the realization of

aggregate output,

      By (16)-(18), the equilibrium size of the social security system

depends on two central features of society:                    (i)     the proportion of young

people in the population,         n.       And   (ii)     the distribution of labor income

among tax payers --    the function          C(.).       Consider first a change in the

proportion of young people in the population,                    n.    Applying the implicit

                                                                     dc*/dn >
                                                                                Q,1        Hence, by
function theorem to (17), it can be shown that

(18), the social security tax rate is negatively related to                           n.


Intuitively, if there are more kids in the population, a larger fraction of
                                              1.3




the voters will be opposed to the social security system; hence the

equilibrium size of             is smaLler.

     Next, consider the effect of changing the distribution of labor income

among the kids.       The more unequal is the distribution of labor income, the

lower are     emk    and    e (since the cumulative distribution G(.)              would

rise more rapidly for low values of            e).    Hence, the median voters

correspond to poorer individuals, who in turn prefer a larger social

security system (see above, equations (12) and (13)).               Thus, the size of the

social security system is larger in societies with a greater income

inequality.     The next section tests these two predictions of the theory.

     I close this section by comparing this equilibrium against a normative

benchmark.     There are two relevant dimensions.            First, how is aggregate risk

shared among generations.         Second, how is consumption allocated on average

between the young and old generations.               On the first dimension, the

political equilibrium exactly mimics the ex ante optimal policy of

intergenerational risk sharing (see Gordon and Varian (1988)).               Since the

parents are risk neutral, the optimal policy shifts all aggregate risk onto

the parents, like in the political equilibrium.               Thus, the ex ante optimal

policy can be implemented under majority rule, even in the absence of

commitments)7         On the second dimension (the average allocation of

consumption between young and old), the normative comparison is ambiguous.

Here we need a stronger criterion than Pareto efficiency.               Since there is

heterogeneity between rich and poor and young and old, the nature of the

optimal allocation of consumption depends on the weights given to different

individuals.        Depending on how these weights are chosen, the equilibrium

allocation of        c*    to every kid may be too large or too small compared to

the optimum.    -
                           6.   The Faoirical Evidence

      The theory has predictions for both time series and cross-country data.

But the time series predictions (that social security tax rates are

positively correlated with aggregate income) are not robust to minor changes

in the model.     In particular, increasing the risk aversion of the old

compared to that of the young reverses the time series predictions.        For

this reason, throughout the remainder of the paper I test the predictions of

the theory by comparing the size of the social security programs     of a large

number of developing and industrialized countries.


6.1   The Data

      For reasons of data availability, I aggregate together social security

and welfare expenditures)8      Table 1 displays three different measures of

the size of the social security programs of various countries.      The first

column measures real expenditures in social security and welfare per person

over 65 years of age.     The other two columns measure social security plus

welfare expenditures in proportion to GNP and to total. government spending

respectively.     Each ratio is the average for the period 1978-82 (or whatever

fraction of it is available).      The data appendix describes the sources more

in detail.      The sample of countries is determined by data availability.

taking also into account the variables listed below.

      The first measure of the size of the social security program (scaled to

the size of population over 65) is the closest equivalent of the variable         g


in the previous theoretical. model.     However, it could be measured with

error, because the conversion from nominal to real international prices may

be imprecise (see the data appendix), and because the size of the population

over 65 could reflect measurement errors.      For this reason, I also consider

 the size of social security in proportion to GNP and to total government
                                         15




spending.     This last variable    (in proportion to government spending) is

particularly meaningful, even though it has no theoretical counterpart in

the previous model.       Across countries, the size of the social security

program is strongly positively correlated with the overall size of

government.     This is to be expected, since the size of government depends on

factors neglected in the theoretical analysis (such as the availability of

tax bases and the general political preferences of the citizens) which aLso

determine the size of the social security program.

Hence, it may    also   be appropriate to test the predictions of the model when

social security is measured in relation to total government spending.

     Table 1 underscores how different is the size of social security in

different countries, both per capita and in proportion to C&P and to the

size of government.       Most of the industrialized countries (marked with an

asterisk) have relatively large social security programs; but this is also

true of some of the developing countries, particularly when social security

is scaled to total government spending.       Can these differences be explained

by the theory formulated in the previous sections?

     According to the preceding model, the size of social security is

related to the relative proportions of tax payers and retirees among voters,

and to the distribution of income,       I measure the former by the proportion

of individuals over 65 years of age in the total population ("prop65"), and

the latter by the ratio of the pre-tax income received by the top 20% of the

population over the pre-tax income received by the bottom 40% of the

population ('TincratioM).      Thus, the larger is the variable incratio, the

more concentrated is the distribution of income.       For a number of countries,

only the distribution of post-tax income is available.       A dummy variable

("post taxM) has been set equal to 1 (0)      if the variable "incratio" refers
                                            16




to post-tax (pre-tax) income.      In the empirical analysis this dummy variable

is interacted with the variable incratio, to isolate the countries for which

the distribution of income is measured before taxes in conformity with the

theory.

      to test the predictions of the theory. I estimate by OLS the following

regression:


                y —   fl0 + p1 prop65   +
                                                 incratio   ÷ fl3x ÷ u                    (20)


where -y   is the size of social security as measured by one of the three

variables listed in table 1,      u     is the error term and           x   is a vector of

additional explanatory variables neglected by our theory but which may

nevertheless contribute to explain international differences in the size of

social security.      Our theory predicts that        p1    and       2 are   positive.

Hence, the null hypothesis to be tested is:            H0: p1 — p2 — 0.

      I try different specifications of the vector                x   of additional

explanatory variables.      In the most comprehensive specification,               x

includes a dummy variable taking a value of I for industrialized countries

and zero otherwise, the post-tax dummy interacted with the variable

incratio, and two additional variables that may be related to the cost of

administering the social security system, namely the percentage of the

population living in urban areas ("urbanization"), and per capita income (as

a general proxy for the stage of development).

      Table 2 contains the summary statistics and the correlation matrix

among all the variables mentioned above.            Note that the three measures of

social security are highly positively correlated with each other.
                                       17




     The estimated coefficients for alternative specifications, for

different sample of countries, and for alternative measurements of the

dependent variable are reported in Tables 3 and 4.     Table 3 contains the

most parsimonious specification:    besides the variables dictated by the

model, only the post-tax dummy and the dummy for industrialized countries

are included as explanatory variables.      The regression fit is remarkably

good, considering the large variance in the dependent variables, except when

the sample only consists of the industrialized countries; this may be

because in the latter case we have too few observations.     The estimated

coefficients of the variables of interest (prop65 and incratio) always have

the correct sign.     If we neglect the sample of only the industrialized

countries, which is probably meaningless given the extremely poor fit, the

estimated coefficient of the variable propGS is always highly

significantJ9      The variable incratio is also significant for several

regressions, particularly when social security is measured in proportion to

total government spending.

     Table 4 contains the estimated coefficients when the other explanatory

variables (urbanization and/or per capita income) are added to the

regression.   Even though these additional variables are generally

significant, the same results of table 3 are obtained:      the variable prop65

always has a positive and highly significant estimated coefficient.      And the

variable incratio always has a positive estimated coefficient, which is also

statistically significant when social security is measured in proportion to

total government spending.    The same kind of result is obtained when

alternative combinations of the dependent variables and of the explanatory

variables are tried, and in particular when social security is measured in

relation to GNP.
      To further assess the robustness of the estimates I tried alternative

specifications besides those reported in Tables 3 and 4.    First,   I



interacted the industrialized dummy variable with the two variables of

interest, prop65 and incratio, to allow for differences in the slope

coefficients between the two sample of countries.    These new variables were

generally insignificant, and the other estimated coefficients generally

remained as reported in Tables 3 and 4.     Second. I replaced urbanization

and/or per capita income in Table 4 with the share of the agricultural

sector in CDP.   Again, the coefficients of interest did not change.

Finally, I created a new dummy variable that distinguishes between

democratic and non-democratic regimes.    Strictly speaking, the theoretical

model only applies to democratic systems.     But the new dummy variable was

always insignificant both when interacted with the coefficients of interest

and when included as an additional variable, and the other estimated

coefficients were not affected by it.

      I conclude from these regressions that we generally cannot reject the

predictions of the theory:   social security is larger in countries with a

greater proportion of elderly people in the population, and in countries

with a more unequal distribution of pretax income.     The predictions of the

theory are only rejected in the sample of industrialized countries, that

contains too few observations.


6.3   Sensitivity Analysis

      A central question is whether the previous results are robust to errors

in measuring the two explanatory variables of interest. prop65 and

incratio.   to answer it, I compute consistent bounds on their coefficients.

Under the conventional hypothesis of the error in variables literature, even

if these two variables are measured with error their true maximum likelihood
                                        19




coefficients lie within these bounds.2°

     Our procedure exploits the results of Klepper and Learner (1984).

Consider first equation (1) in Table 3.      First.   I estimate the coefficients

of prop6S and incratio by alternatively interchanging each of them with the

dependent variable (social security per individual over 65).        I   thus obtain

three estimates for each coefficient, one of which corresponds to that

reported in Table 3.     For both variables, the signs of the three

coefficients are the same across the three estimators.        As shown by Kiepper

and Learner (1984),    I can then conclude that the true maximum likelihood

coefficients lie within the convex hull of these three estimates.          I then

repeat the sante procedure for the remaining five columns of Table 3.         I find

that for both variables, the three estimates always lie in the same orthant.

Hence, I can compute the consistent bounds on the coefficients of prop6S

and incratio for all the regressors reported in Table 3.

     These bounds are reported in Table 5.      The lower bounds always happen

to coincide with the 0LS estimator of Table 3.        1 infer from this table that

the findings of the previous subsection are robust to the possibility of

measurement error in income inequality and in the proportion of the

population over 65 years of age.

     Finally, heteroscedasticity of the residuals is often a problem with

cross-sectional data.      indeed, here the White (1980) test on the covariance

matrix of the estimated residuals rejects the hypothesis that there is no

heteroscedasticity.      However, when the covariance matrixes for the

regressions of Table 3 are reestimated using White (1980) consistent

estimator, the     t   statistics are not substantially different from those

reported in Table 3 and the two variables of interest generally remain

significant.     In addition, when the regressions in Table 3 are reestimated
                                            20




by weighing each observation with per capita income, the results are

generally unchanged, even though the regression fit tends to deteriorate.


                                7.    Concludina Remarks

       This paper started with a question:         why does a majority of the voters

support a social security system that redistributes income towards a

minority of the population?          To answer this question,   I formulated a

positive theory of social security that relies on a simple central idea.

Social security redistributes both across and within generations.            For this

reason, it is supported by the recipients of the social security benefits,

as well as by the poorest tax payers.            Then this idea is formalized in a

simple overlapping generations model, two positive implications are

obtained.       The size of the social security program is larger       U)   the

greater is the proportion of retired individuals in the population; and

(ii)        the greater is the inequality of pre-tax income.      Both implications

are strongly supported by the empirical evidence on cross-country data.

        But the ideas studied in this paper lead to a second, deeper, question.

Why    is    it that in many countries most of the intragenerational

redistribution occurs through the social security system?            Outside this

system there are not many purely redistributive programs:             in most countries

welfare expenditures are small compared to the size of social security.               So,

why do we observe that inter and intragenerational redistributive policies

are intertwined together through a single policy instrument?            The model

analyzed in this paper cannot answer this question.             Specifically, suppose

that in the previous overlapping generations model we add one more

instrument that enables the government to transfer a lump sum also to every

young individual.        This additional instrument breaks the link between inter
                                     21




and intragenerational redistribution.     Hence, in equilibrium all the kids

would vote against any positive transfer to the parents, and the tax

proceeds would only be redistrthuted among the kids; the equilibrium would

then resemble that of Meltzer and Richard (1981), in which a majority of the

voters favors a policy that taxes and redistributes.     So, why isn't this

extra instrument used more systematically?

     Perhaps, the answer is to be sought in a more complex model of

political interaction.   In this paper, the voters preferences are single

peaked and the political equilibrium is the policy preferred by the median

voters.   But in a more general environment, the political equilibrium would

reflect the formation of different coalitions.     A coalition of poor tax

payers and retirees would presumably support a social security program like

that observed in most countries, and described in this model.     So, the

previous question could be reformulated as follows.     Why is it that in many

countries we observe the formation of this particular coalition of voters?

Considering that major reforms to most social security systems are fairly

recent and date to the same postwar period, it is likely that the answer to

this new question has much to do with particular historical circumstances.

Further exploring this issue, and more generally the question of how

coalition formation influences policymaking, is a difficult but exciting

task for future research.

     1This explanation is proposed for instance in Patton (1978).     Stuart

and Hansson (1989) study an overlapping generations model that implicitly

relies on this idea.     The same assumption, that the old choose the equilib-

rium policy, is also used in two interesting papers by Loewy (1988, 1989).

     2For instance, according to Boskin, Kotlilcoff, Puffert and Shoven

(1987), more than half of the workers in the U.S. pay more in OASDHI

contributions than they pay in personal income taxes.

     3This point has been explored in several papers.     See for instance

Browning (1975) and more recently Broadway and Wildasin (1989a,b) and

Cukierman and Meltzer (1989).

     1'Some   recent interesting papers (Kotlikoff, Persson and Svensson

(1988), and Sjoblom (1985)) argue that "reputation" can substitute for

commitment.     Succinctly, if a young generation reneges on a social security

program, it is punished by the succeeding generation who refuses to

reinstate the program.     The threat of this punishment may deter each young

generation from reneging.     These reputation equilibria are extensively and

critically discussed in Persson and Tabellini (1989).

     5Altonji,    Hayashi and Kotlikoff (1989) provides empirical support for

this assumption.

     6The specification of preferences is plausible and simplifies the

algebra, but is not crucial for most of the results.      Equally unimportant is

the assumption that individuals care about the indirect utility (rather than

the consumption) of their relatives.

      7Meltzer and Richards (1981) have analyzed the determinants of the size

of redistributive policies in a related framework.      However, they study a
                                                           23




static model, in which the issues of intergenerational redistribution and

commitment do not arise.

     9Note that all that matters here is the kids' relative income and not

that of their parents.                 This is because the social security tax is

proportional to the kids' income, and parents have a constant marginal

utility of consumption.

     10As in any optimal taxation problem, the second order conditions of

the policy optimization problem are more restrictive than just concavity of

the utility function.                 Since the voters' utility functions are linear in

the individual specific parameter                       ei,      they belong to the class of

intermediate preferences defined by Grandmont (1978).                                Preferences in this

class are single peaked.

     14Alternatively, the sign of                     Ek(c*)           and   E(c*)        can be determined as

can be used to show that                  E(c*) > 0.

     15For instance, if                  11(c) —   2n(c)        and the distribution C()              is


uniform over the interval                   [-e,el,       condition (la) reduces to:

that, even though a logarithmic utility function violates (B), condition

(F.l) is still consistent with zero private transfers for appropriate values

of w and z.

The denominator is positive.                      Since            is smaller than the median

 (see the text, p. 10),                  GIEk(c*)J < 1/2.              Hence,    dc*/dn > 0.

         '7Note that a similar finding would also hold if the parents were risk

 averse.       In this case, the political equilibrium would be more difficult to

 characterize, but it would have the feature that aggregate shocks are borne

 by both generations currently alive.                           Naturally, the political equilibrium
                                       25




would exactly implement the ex ante optimal risk sharing only for particular

parameter values.

     18When available, welfare is generally a small proportion of social

security plus welfare expenditures.     I use data on expenditures rather than

on contributions because the latter are available for a much small sample of

countries.
     l9      may be argued that when social security is measured by scaling

expenditures to the population over 65, we may be introducing some spurious

correlation between the dependent variable and the explanatory variable

prop65.   But if anything, this would bias the coefficient of prop6S

downwards, and hence it would make it more difficult to reject the null

hypothesis that prop65 has a zero coefficient.

     20The maintained hypothesis is that the measurement errors are

orthogonal to each other and to the unobserved correctly measured

regressors.

average of RE over the period 1978-82.        (v)     Finally. I compute the variable

listed in Table I by dividing this yearly average by the population over 65

(Source:     United Nations Demographic Yearbook       --   The population over 65 is

available only for one year every five, and not for the same year in every

country).

   The IMF classifies as social security expenditures the "transfer payments

designed to compensate for reduction or loss of income or inadequate earning

capacity".    Health expenditures are not included in social security

expenditures.    The bulk of social security expenditures generally consists

of pensions and retirement benefits.     Welfare expenditures are defined by

the 11fF as "assistance delivered to clients or groups with special needs,

such as the young, the old or handicapped".          Welfare expenditures are

generally much smaller than social security expenditures.

   2.     Social security nlus welfare expenditures in % of aN? and of Total.

Government Soendinz.      Here take a ratio for every year, and then I average

this ratio over the period 1978-82.         The numerator in this ratio is the

local currency variable used in (iii) above.         GNP is taken from the

International Financial Statistics (IMP), and total government spending of

the central government is taken from the Government Finance Statistics

(IMP).

   3.     ProD6S —   Proportion   of the total population over 65 years of age.

Source:     UN Demographic Yearbook.      Again, this variable is available every

five years, and for different years in different countries.

   4.     Incratio a   Ratio of pre-tax income received by the richest 20% to the
pre-tax income received by the poorest 40% of the population.          This variable

is computed from several different sources:          UN (1981), UN (1985), Jodice

and Taylor (1983), World Development Report (1987), Jam          (1975).   This ratio

generally refers to a different year for different countries.          In a number

of countries it refers to post-tax income.         In some other countries, it is

impossible to know whether it refers to pre or post-tax income.            When

uncertain, I assumed that it referred to post-tax income.          The results are

not sensitive to this assumption.

   5.     Post-Tax — A dummy variable taking a value of 1 if incratio is

computed from post-tax income, and 0 otherwise.

   6.     Industrialized — A dummy variable taking a value of I for the

countries defined as industrialized by the IMF, and 0 otherwise.

   7.     Urbanization — Urban population as a percent of total population in

1985.     Source:    World Development Report, 1988.

   8.     Per Canita Income — Average of real per capita income over the period

1978-82.     Source:    Summers and Heston (1987).

NOTE:  In the first column, the numerator is real expenditures on social
security plus welfare, averaged over the 1978-82 period; the denominator is
the population over 65, in a year in the period 1980-1987a (which year
varies across countries).   In the other two columns, the numerator is 100 *
social security plus welfare expenditures, and the denominator is indicated
above; the ratio is averaged over the 1978-82 period.   A * indicates an
industrialized country (according to the IMP definition).   Sources:
