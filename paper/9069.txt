Some Evidence on the Importance of Sticky Prices

                                             ABSTRACT

        We examine the frequency of price changes for 350 categories of goods and services covering
about 70% of consumer spending, based on unpublished data from the BLS for 1995 to 1997. Compared
with previous studies we find much more frequent price changes, with half of prices lasting less than 4.3
months. The frequency of price changes differs dramatically across categories. We exploit this variation
to ask how inflation for "flexible-price goods" (goods with frequent changes in individual prices) differs
from inflation for "sticky-price goods" (those displaying infrequent price changes). Compared to the
predictions of popular sticky price models, actual inflation rates are far more volatile and transient,
particularly for sticky-price goods.

1. Introduction

       The importance of price stickiness remains a central question in economics. After a ten-

year period of relative quiet, sticky-price models are again at, or near, the center of analysis of

business cycle fluctuations and monetary policy. Goodfriend and King (1997), Rotemberg and

Woodford (1997), Clarida, Gali, and Gertler (1999), Erceg, Henderson, and Levin (2000), Chari,

Kehoe, and McGrattan (2000), Christiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2001), and Dotsey and King

(2001) are examples of recent work built on the assumptions that firms adjust prices infrequently

and satisfy all demand at those posted prices.

       With the exception of Dotsey and King (2001), these studies employ time-dependent

pricing. Prices are maintained for a set number of periods (as in Taylor, 1999) or each period

a fixed fraction of firms have an opportunity to adjust prices to new information (as in Calvo,

1983). In both the Taylor and Calvo models price changes are not synchronized across firms.

In these settings monetary policy can influence economic activity for some period of time. By

contrast, Caplin and Spulber (1987) illustrate that state-dependent models of price changes

generate less clear predictions for the impact of monetary policy on real activity. As we

discuss at length, models with staggered time-dependent pricing imply that inflation rates

should be more persistent and less volatile if price changes are less frequent.

       The speed with which sticky-price models were first jettisoned then retrieved partly

reflects the lack of conclusive evidence on the extent and importance of sticky prices. Several

papers have shown that certain wholesale and retail prices often go unchanged for many

months (Carlton, 1986, Cecchetti, 1986, Kashyap, 1995, Levy, Bergen, Dutta and Venable,

1997, Blinder, Canetti, Lebow and Rudd, 1998, MacDonald and Aaronson, 2001, and

Kackmeister, 2001). Compared to these studies, we obtain broader evidence on the extent of

retail price rigidities and their consequences for the behavior of inflation. We employ

unpublished data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for 1995 to 1997 on the

monthly frequency of price changes for 350 categories of consumer goods and services

comprising around 70% of consumer expenditures. We find that many prices seldom change.



                                                 1
Prices of newspapers, men's haircuts, and taxi fares change less than 5% of months. By

contrast, many prices change very frequently. The prices of gasoline, tomatoes, and airfares

change more than 70% of months. We exploit this diversity. We classify goods by how

frequently they display monthly price changes in the 1995-1997 data, then ask how the

behavior of inflation differs between goods with frequent versus infrequent price changes.

        In the next section (section 2) we present the disaggregate data on the frequency of

price changes for 1995 to 1997. We contrast our findings to the existing literature. We find
much more frequent price changes, with half of prices lasting 4.3 months or less. We also

present a number of characteristics that predict whether a good will display a flexible price.

We find that variables capturing the volatility of market supply and demand can account for

much of the variation in price flexibility across categories. For example, goods that exhibit

frequent model changes typically exhibit flexible pricing.

        In section 3 we briefly sketch a general equilibrium sticky-price model that follows

work in Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2000). They model monopolistically competitive firms

with staggered price setting of a fixed duration (a la Taylor, 1999). The wrinkle we add is

multiple consumer goods with prices fixed for different durations across the goods. We

simulate this model to illustrate how flexible-price goods and sticky-price goods can differ in

their responses to shocks.1

        In section 4 we analyze monthly time series on prices and consumption for 123 goods
of varying price stickiness. In the workhorse Calvo and Taylor models, price stickiness

dampens the initial response of a good's inflation rate to a shock, stretching the inflation

impact out over time as successive cohorts of firms adjust their prices. Price stickiness

thereby reduces the magnitude of innovations to a good's inflation rate while, at the same

time, raising the persistence of its inflation. We do not see this in the data. For nearly all 123

categories, inflation movements are far more volatile and transient than implied by the Calvo

and Taylor models given the frequency of individual price changes in the BLS data. This

1 Several papers have incorporated sticky-price and flexible-price sectors into model economies. Examples
include Ohanian, Stockman, and Kilian (1995), Aoki (2001), and Benigno (2001).


                                                      2
discrepancy cannot be resolved by adding plausible measurement error or idiosyncratic

shocks. Across the 123 goods, volatility and persistence of a good's inflation rate are much

less related to the good's underlying frequency of price changes than predicted by these time-

dependent pricing models. In other words, the popular sticky-price models fail most

dramatically to predict inflation's behavior for goods with the least frequent price changes.

        The final section (section 5) summarizes and discusses directions for further work.


2. BLS Data on the Frequency of Price Changes

        For calculating the CPI, the BLS collects prices on 70,000 to 80,000 non-housing

goods and services per month.2 They collect these from around 22,000 outlets across 88

geographic areas. The BLS chooses outlets probabilistically based on household point-of-

purchase surveys, and choose items within outlets based on estimates of their relative sales.

The BLS divides consumption into 388 categories called Entry Level Items (ELIs).

        The BLS Commodities and Services Substitution Rate Table gives, for each ELI, the

percentage of quotes with price changes. For example, the 1997 Table indicates that 6,493

price quotes were collected on bananas in 1997, and that 37.8% of these quotes differed from

the quote on the same type of bananas at the same outlet in the preceding month. (The Table

does not contain information on the magnitude of price changes, just what share of price

quotes involved some change in price.) The field agents collecting prices use a detailed
checklist of item attributes to try to make sure they are pricing the same item in consecutive

months. When they cannot find an item, they substitute the price of a closely-related item at

the outlet. These "item substitutions" are the focus of the BLS Table, and we discuss them in

detail later in this section. Item substitutions happen to be rare for bananas (only 1 in 1997)

compared to other categories (3.1% of non-housing price quotes in 1997).

        The BLS has provided us with the unpublished Commodities and Services Substitution

Rate Table for the years 1995 through 2001. The BLS revised the ELI structure in 1998, so

2The sources used for this section, unless otherwise noted, were The Boskin Commission Report (1986) and the
BLS Handbook of Methods (U.S. Department of Labor, 1997, Chapter 17).


                                                     3
frequencies cannot be readily compared before and after 1998. For the 168 ELI definitions

which remained unchanged, however, the frequencies are quite stable over the seven years.

The correlation for any pair of years lies between 0.96 and 0.98. In order to maximize the

number of ELIs for which there is a price index covering more than a few years, we use the

1995-1997 BLS data and its ELI structure. This data covers 350 ELIs.

       In Table 1 we list, for each of the 350 ELIs, the 1995-1997 average monthly frequency

of price changes. For food and energy ELIs, in which items are priced monthly, this is the
simple average of the frequencies in the 1995, 1996, and 1997 BLS Tables. For the other

ELIs, the frequencies in the BLS Tables are a mixture of one-month and two-month price

change frequencies. In the five largest areas — New York City and suburbs, Chicago, Los

Angeles and suburbs, San Francisco / Oakland / San Jose, and Philadelphia — the BLS

collects quotes monthly for all goods and services. For the other geographic areas, the BLS

collects quotes monthly only for food and energy, and bimonthly for all other goods and

services. For each of 1995, 1996 and 1997, we obtained from the BLS the fraction of price

quotes that were monthly vs. bimonthly.

       If the monthly probability of a price change is the same across areas and from month

to month for a given ELI in a given year, then we can identify the monthly frequency of price

changes from the mixed frequency the BLS reports and the fraction of quotes which are

monthly versus bimonthly. In doing so we assume that the probability of a price changing
from p+ to p, one month, then changing back to p+ the next month, is zero. Based on scanner
data for select seasonal goods at certain Chicago-area supermarkets, Chevalier, Kashyap and

Rossi (2000) find that such temporary sales are actually quite common. To the extent they

occur, our estimated monthly frequencies understate the true monthly frequencies. Since

Chevalier et al. find that temporary sales typically last one week or less, even monthly price

quotes (as for the top five areas and for food and energy) understate the true frequency of

price changes. As we discuss later in this section, however, one could argue that temporary

sales mask the stickiness of "regular" prices.



                                                 4
         Let C = the mixture of monthly and bimonthly frequencies (data from the BLS

Tables), - = the constant monthly frequency of price changes (not directly observed), and D

= the fraction of quotes which are monthly (data we obtained from the BLS for each ELI for

each year). Then y = z*- + (1–z)*(- + (1–- )*- ). Since z ­ (0, 1) and - ­ [0,1], the

solution for - is the negative root of this quadratic in -. Table 1 reports - for each of the 350

ELIs. These are averages of the monthly frequencies we estimate for 1995, 1996 and 1997.

They range from 1.2% for coin-operated apparel laundry and dry cleaning to 79% for regular
unleaded gasoline. Figure 1 gives the histogram of frequencies for the 350 ELIs. Not all ELIs

are equally important, however, as their weights in the 1995 Consumer Expenditure Survey

(CEX) range from 0.001% (tools and equipment for painting) to 2.88% for electricity. Table

1 also provides the weight of each ELI and the resulting percentile of the ELI in the

cumulative distribution of frequencies. Weighting the ELIs, the monthly frequency of price

changes averages 26.1%. The weighted median is 20.9%. For the median category the time

between price change averages 4.3 months.3 Thus, for items comprising one half of non-

housing consumption, prices change less frequently than every 4.3 months.

         The 350 ELIs in Table 1 cover 68.9% of spending according to the 1995 CEX. The

categories not covered are owner's equivalent rent and household insurance (20.0% weight),

residential rent (6.6%), used cars (1.8%), and various unpriced items (collectively 2.7%). One

question that arises is whether scanner data, which are becoming increasingly available to
economists (e.g., Chevalier et al., 2000), might dominate the BLS average frequency data.

Scanner data afford weekly prices and quantities for thousands of consumer items. At

present, however, scanner data cannot match the category coverage of the BLS data. Hawkes

and Piotrowski (2000) report that only 10% of consumer expenditures are scanned through

AC Nielsen data for supermarkets, drugstores, and mass merchandisers. Categories not

scanned include rent, utilities, restaurant meals (about 40% of spending on food), medical

3 If prices can change at any moment, not just at the monthly interval, the instantaneous probability of a price
change is -ln(1--) and the mean time between price changes -1/ln(1--) months. We used this formula to
calculate the Mo. column from the Freq. column in Table 1. If prices instead change at most once per month,
then the mean duration is simply 1/-, about half a month longer.


                                                         5
care, transportation, insurance, banking, and education. As noted, the 350 categories in the

BLS Table cover 68.9% of consumer expenditures.

        Table 2 reports the median frequency and duration for years 1995 through 2001. Price

changes are somewhat more frequent over 1998-2001 than over the 1995-1997 period we

focus on to maximize compatibility with other data.


Comparison to Other Empirical Studies of Price Stickiness

        The BLS data suggests much more frequent price adjustment than has been found in

other studies.4 Blinder et al. (1998) surveyed 200 firms on their price setting. The median
firm reported adjusting prices about once a year. Hall, Walsh and Yates (2000) surveyed 654

British companies and obtained similar results: 58% changing prices once a year or more. In

contrast, the median consumer item in the 1995-1997 BLS Tables changes prices every 4.3

months. For 87% of consumption prices change more frequently than once a year. A possible

contributor to the difference in findings is that firms in the Blinder et al. survey sell mostly

intermediate goods and services (79% of their sales) rather than consumer items.

        Even compared to other studies of consumer prices, the BLS data imply considerably

more frequent price changes. Cecchetti (1986) studied newsstand prices of 38 American

magazines over 1953 to 1979. The number of years since the last price change ranged from

1.8 to 14 years. In our Table 1, magazines (including subscription as well as newsstand

prices) exhibit price changes 8.6% of months, implying adjustment every 11 months on

average. More importantly, magazines are at the sticky end of the spectrum in Table 1;

prices change more frequently than for magazines for 86% of non-housing consumption.

        Kashyap (1995) studied the monthly prices of 12 mail-order catalog goods for periods

as long as 1953 to 1987. Across goods and time, he found an average of 14.7 months

between price changes. This contrasts with the 4.3 month median in the BLS data. Based on

Table 1, prices change more frequently than every 14.7 months for 90% of non-housing


4The BLS data also suggest more frequent price adjustment than usually assumed in calibrated macro models.
Chari et al. (2000), for instance, consider a benchmark case in which prices are set for one year.


                                                     6
consumption. The 12 Kashyap goods consist mostly of apparel. In the BLS data, prices

actually change more frequently for clothing: the monthly hazard is 29% for apparel items,

versus 26% for all items. So prices for the goods in Kashyap's sample are far stickier than the

typical BLS item, apparel or otherwise. Mail-order prices may tend to be stickier than prices

in retail outlets. Another factor could be that Kashyap selected "well-established, popular-

selling items that have undergone minimal quality changes" (Kashyap, 1995, p. 248). As we

discuss below, changing product features appear to play an important role in price changes.
       MacDonald and Aaronson (2001) examine restaurant pricing (more exactly, pricing

for food consumed on premises) for the years 1995 to 1997 using BLS data. They find that

restaurant prices do not change very frequently, with prices displaying a median duration of

about 10 months. These are close to the durations we report for breakfast (11.4 months),

lunch (10.7), and dinner (10.6) prices in Table 1. This consistency is not surprising given we

are using the same underlying data source. Note, however, that prices change less frequently

at restaurants than for the typical good in the CPI bundle. Prices change more frequently than

for restaurant foods for about 80% of non-housing consumption.

       Kackmeister (2001) analyzes data on the price levels of up to 49 consumer products

(depending on the period) in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and Newark in 1889-1891,

1911-1913, and 1997-1999. The goods are at the ELI level or slightly more aggregated, and

include 27 food items, 14 home furnishing items, and 8 clothing items. He finds that the
frequency, size, and variability of price changes are higher in the last period than in the first

period. For 1997-1999 he finds that 31% of his goods change price each month. This is

higher than the mean frequency of 26% in our data; we conjecture the difference owes mostly

to the composition of goods rather than the sample period or cities.

       With data on price levels, Kackmeister is able to investigate how often a price is

temporarily marked down from a "regular" price that is itself much stickier. He finds that

22% of prices change each month excluding price reductions that reverse themselves one

month later. If the same fraction (9/31) of price changes arose from temporary sales in our



                                                 7
data, then our mean frequency net of temporary sales would be 18% (vs. 26% including

temporary sales). The median time between changes in regular prices would be 6.2 months

(vs. 4.3 months with temporary sales).5 Even 6.2 months is considerably shorter than the 12
months or more found by previous studies. Moreover, one could argue that temporary sales

represent a true form of price flexibility that should not be filtered out, say because the

magnitude and duration of temporary sales responds to shocks.


Differences in Price Stickiness Across Broad Consumption Categories

         Table 3 provides price change frequencies for selected broad categories of

consumption. The first row shows that the (weighted) mean frequency is 26% for all items.

The next three rows provide (weighted) mean frequencies for durable goods, nondurable

goods, and services, respectively, based on U.S. National Income and Product Account

(NIPA) classifications. Price changes are more frequent for goods (about 30% for both

durables and nondurables) than for services (21%). The lower frequency of price changes for

services could reflect the lower volatility of consumer demand for them.

         The next six rows in Table 3 provide frequencies for each of the six CPI Expenditure

Classes defined by the BLS. At the flexible end are transportation prices (e.g., new cars,

airfares), almost 40% of which change monthly. At the sticky extreme are medical care

(drugs, physicians' services) and entertainment (admission prices, newspapers, magazines, and

books), for whom around 10% of prices change monthly.

         In the final two rows of Table 3 we draw a distinction between "raw" and "processed"

goods. By raw goods we mean those with relatively little value added beyond a primary

input, for instance gasoline or fresh fruits and vegetables. Because their inputs are not well-

diversified, these goods may be subject to more volatile costs. Raw goods are a subset of the




5 According to the BLS, temporary sales are more common for food and clothing, the bulk of Kackmeister's
sample. For our sample, therefore, these calculations may overstate the effect of filtering out temporary sales.


                                                         8
food and energy items goods excluded by the BLS in its core rate of CPI inflation.6 As
expected, raw products display more frequent price changes (their prices change 54% of

months) than do processed products and services (whose average is 21%)Þ Even for

processed items, the frequency of price changes remains considerably higher than values

typically cited in the literature based on narrower sets of goods.


Market Structure and Price Flexibility

         Models of price adjustment (e.g., Barro, 1972) predict greater frequency of price

changes in markets with more competition because firms therein face more elastic demand.

The four-firm concentration ratio is often used as an inverse measure of market competition,

with a higher value expected to correlate with less elastic demand. Several papers have found

an inverse relation between the concentration ratio and the frequency of price changes or price

volatility in producer prices (e.g., Carlton, 1986, Caucutt, Gosh and Kelton, 1999). We

examine the relationship between the share of the largest four firms in manufacturing

shipments and the frequency of price change for our goods. The concentration ratio is taken

from the 1997 Census of Manufactures. To exploit this measure we match the 350 consumer

goods categories to manufacturing industries as classified by the North American Industrial

Classification System (NAICS). This matching can be done for 231 of the goods. The

categories we were unable to match are largely services.

         Column A of Table 4 reports the regression of price-change frequencies on four-firm

concentration ratios. (This is a weighted least squares regression with weights given by the

goods' importance in 1995 consumer expenditures.) There is an economically and statistically

strong negative relation. The coefficient of -0.30 implies that raising the concentration ratio

from 23% (the value for pet food) to 99% (the value for cigarettes) tends to decrease the

monthly frequency of price changes by more than 20 percentage points.



6 The set of raw goods consists of gasoline, motor oil and coolants, fuel oil and other fuels, natural gas,
electricity, meats, fish, eggs, fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, and fresh milk and cream. Unlike the BLS food and
energy categories, it does not include meals purchased in restaurants or foods the BLS classifies as processed.


                                                         9
        We consider two other variables related to market competitiveness. One is the

wholesale markup, defined as (wholesale sales minus cost of goods sold)/(wholesale sales).

The data for wholesale markups are from the 1997 Census of Wholesale Trade. We can

match 250 of the 350 consumer goods to a corresponding wholesale industry in the NAICS.

        Another factor potentially related to market competition is the rate that substitute

products are introduced. As mentioned above, the BLS Commodities and Services

Substitution Rate Table actually focuses on item substitutions. When an outlet discontinues
an item, the field agent collecting price quotes searches for the closest substitute at the outlet.

A BLS commodity specialist later compares the attributes of the selected item and the

discontinued item, and classifies the substitute as either comparable or noncomparable to the

discontinued item.7 We expect markets with greater product turnover, as measured by the

rate of noncomparable substitutions, to price more flexibly. Changes in the product space

may induce changes in the prices of incumbent products. Pashigian's (1988) markdown

pricing model for fashion goods has this feature, as do many models in which quality

improvements are introduced over time. Another hypothesis is that newer products have

rapidly falling production costs as firms slide down learning curves. Finally, frequent

introduction of new products may proxy for ease of market entry more generally.

        Column B of Table 4 provides results relating the frequency of price changes to the

three measures of market structure (concentration ratio, wholesale markup, and rate of
noncomparable substitutions). Each coefficient has the anticipated sign and is economically

and statistically significant. The coefficient on the concentration ratio is as large as in column

A. The coefficient of –1.20 on the wholesale margin implies that increasing the margin from

12% (the value for meat products) to 35% (the value for toys and games) tends to decrease the

monthly frequency of price changes by more than 25 percentage points. A 1% higher

noncomparable substitution rate, meanwhile, goes along with a 1.25% higher frequency of

price changes (standard error 0.3%).

7 Item substitutions occur for 3.4% of monthly price quotes in our sample. The BLS deemed 46% of all
substitutions noncomparable over 1995-1997.


                                                     10
         As presented earlier in Table 3, products closely linked with primary inputs (raw

products) display more frequent price changes. The regression in Table 4, column C

examines how the frequency of price changes covaries with the three measures of market

power, but now controlling for whether a good is a raw product. The coefficient implies that

price changes are 34% more common for raw products (standard error 2.7%). The four-firm

concentration ratio and wholesale markup, both of which appear very important in the column

B regression, become quite unimportant when controlling for whether a good is raw or
processed. The rate of product turnover robustly predicts more frequent price changes. Its

coefficient actually increases, with 1% more monthly substitutions associated with 2.2% more

price changes (standard error 0.3%). Since the coefficient on the rate of product turnover

significantly exceeds unity, price changes are more frequent in the presence of greater product

turnover even aside from price changes mechanically associated with item substitutions.8

         In column D of Table 4 we relate the frequency of price changes simply to the rate of

noncomparable substitutions and the raw good dummy. These variables are available for the

full set of 350 goods. The two variables explain a sizable fraction of the variation in

frequencies across the 350 goods (adjusted R# of 0.56). A 1% higher rate of product

substitutions is associated with a 2.9% higher rate of price changes (standard error 0.3%).

Thus each product turnover is associated with nearly two price changes in addition to that

directly associated with the item substitution.
         We examined several other variables aimed at capturing market structure. A higher

import share might be expected to raise competition and the frequency of price changes. (We

obtained data on imports from the U.S. Department of Commerce.) We find a statistically

insignificant correlation of 0.09 between import share and the frequency of price changes.

Furthermore, import share did not help predict price flexibility after controlling for raw goods.

We likewise expected higher inventory holdings in industries with market power and higher


8 Prices of comparable substitutes enter the CPI without adjustment, so they are associated with price changes
only if the substitute's price differs from the last price collected for the discontinued item. Noncomparable
substitutes enter the CPI with quality adjustments, so they are almost always associated with price changes.

markups. Therefore greater inventory holdings might be associated with less frequent price

changes. The frequency of price changes was indeed very negatively correlated, -0.51, with

the ratio of wholesale inventories to sales. But, again, this effect was not robust to controlling

for the raw-good dummy. The frequency of price changes was also typically lower for goods

with a high ratio of manufacturers inventories to shipments (correlation -0.14). This variable

was also insignificant in explaining frequency of price changes controlling for whether a good

was a raw good. (The data for manufacturing and wholesale inventories were taken,
respectively, from the 1997 Censuses of Manufacturing and Wholesale Trade.)



3. A General Equilibrium Model with Goods of Varying Price Stickiness

        In this section we briefly describe the implications of a general equilibrium model

with Taylor-style staggered price setting. The critical feature is that firms in the respective

consumer goods sectors set their prices for different durations. Our purpose is to illustrate

how the flexible-price sector responds differently to shocks than the sticky-price sector does.

Our model borrows heavily from a model in Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2000). Our only

substantive deviation is in having two consumer good sectors. Within each consumer good

sector, price setting is staggered evenly across monopolistically competitive firms.

        Consumers have momentary utility given by

                                                            ("–5

where - = a CES consumption aggregate, 7 = real money balances, 6 = labor supply, and 1 =

the time endowment. Time subscripts are implicit. Following CKM, we set = = 0.94 based

on the empirical ratio of 7Î- (M1 to nominal consumption), ( = 0.39 based on the interest

elasticity of money demand (from regressing log 7Î- on the nominal three-month Treasury

bill rate), < = 1.5 so that steady state 6 is 1/4, and 5 = 1 (unit intertemporal elasticities).

        The CES consumption aggregate is given by




                                                  12

where -0 Ð3Ñ = production of flexible-price good 3 by a monopolistic competitor, -= Ð4Ñ =
production of sticky-price good 4 by a monopolistic competitor. As shown, each sector has a

a continuum of firms of measure 1. We set =0 = == = 0.5 so that the sticky and flexible

sectors have equal weight in - . We assume ) = 0.9 so that the elasticity of substitution

between varieties within each sector is 10. This means firms desire a price markup of 10%

above marginal cost, in line with Basu and Fernald's (1997) evidence. We set 3 = 0 (Cobb-

Douglas) so that the nominal shares of the flexible and sticky sectors are constant.

         Firm production technologies are linear in labor and random walk productivity a:


                                  -0 Ð3Ñ = + 60 Ð3Ñ a3, -= Ð4Ñ = + 6= Ð4Ñ a4 .

Labor is mobile across firms and sectors, so the labor market clearing condition is

                                             "               "

                                            0               0

              7>
where .> =    7>–"   is the gross growth rate of the money supply. For simulations, reported in the

next section, we employ 37 = 0.52, the serial correlation of monthly M1 growth over 1959 to

2000. First, however, we examine responses to a 1% money impulse under the assumption

that log .> follows a random walk (37 = 0). This case is helpful for illustration because the

ultimate price change is the same size as the money innovation.

         For both sectors, any firm setting its price in period > does so before observing the

current period shocks.9 After prices are set the current shock is realized and all firms produce

9 In the next section we will compare some predictions of this model to time series data. All of the implications
are robust to modeling the current shocks as observed before adjusting firms set their current prices.


                                                       13
to satisfy the quantity demanded of their variety at their preset price. In the flexible sector

prices are preset for 2 periods (the 90th percentile of frequencies in our Table 1). In the

sticky-price sector prices are preset for 15 periods (the 10th percentile of frequencies in Table

1). In each sector, price-setting is staggered evenly (1/2 the flexible sector firms set their

prices before a period, the other half before the next period; 1/15th of the sticky sector firms

set their prices before a period, 1/15th before the next period, and so on). Firms set their

prices to maximize expected discounted profits over the period the prices will be fixed. Their
information set includes the entire distribution of preset prices of other firms in their own

sector and in the other sector. If prices were preset for only one period, firms would set price

equal to the steady state markup over expected nominal marginal cost.

        Figure 2 presents equilibrium responses to a permanent 1% increase in the money

supply. Aggregate consumption and labor supply both jump 1% in the month of the shock,

then decline monotonically towards zero over the next 15 months. The decline is sharpest in

the first two months as the two cohorts of firms in the flexible-price sector get a chance to

respond with higher prices and lower output. In contrast, in the sticky-price sector the price

gradually rises and output gradually falls over the 15 months following the shock.

        As illustrated by Figure 2, both inflation and output growth are more persistent in the

sticky sector than in the flexible sector in response to a money shock. This reflects the greater

length of time needed for all cohorts to respond in the sticky sector. The initial impact on
inflation is also smaller in the sticky sector than in flexible sector, as a smaller share of firms

respond in the month after the shock in the sticky sector. Thus, in this model, price stickiness

dampens the initial inflation impact and spreads it across many periods, thereby lowering the

volatility of inflation innovations and boosting the persistence of inflation.

        We also simulated versions of the model with 4, 5, 8, 15, 20 and 30 sectors,

respectively. Each time we set the stickiness and weight of sectors to approximate the

empirical distribution in Table 1. Not surprisingly, the aggregate response function was

smoother the greater the number of sectors. In each case we compared the aggregate



                                                 14
responses to a monetary shock to those in a one-sector model in which all prices were fixed

for the same duration. We found that a single-sector model with prices fixed for 4 months,

roughly the median duration in the empirical distribution, most closely matched the aggregate

response in the multi-sector models. One-sector models with durations near the reciprocal of

the mean frequency (3 months) or with the mean duration (7 months) did not mimic the multi-

sector model nearly as well, based on squared deviations over 20 months of impulse

responses. For this reason we emphasized the median duration when summarizing the
empirical distribution of price change frequencies.

         Figure 3 shows model responses to a permanent 1% increase in the technology

parameter +. In the first month, because prices do not respond, labor hours decline, with no

impact on aggregate consumption. Beginning in the second month consumption rises, and

then continues its rise until the higher productivity passes fully into increased consumption,

with no long run impact on labor hours.

         Notice from Figures 2 and 3 that, both in the aggregate and in the sticky-price sector,

inflation displays high persistence regardless of whether the underlying shock is to money or

to TFP. (The movements in consumption, by contrast, are persistent in response to permanent

TFP shocks, but not in response to permanent money shocks.) Stickiness dampens the initial

response of inflation to TFP and money shocks alike. In the next section we test these

predictions for sectoral inflation with time series data on monthly inflation for sectors of
varying underlying price stickiness.



4. Time-Series Patterns for Flexible-Price Goods vs. Sticky-Price Goods

         We match our 350 categories of consumer goods to available NIPA time series on

prices and consumption from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. We construct real

consumption as the ratio of nominal expenditures to price deflators.10 The data run from

10 For the vast majority of categories, the PCE Deflators are CPI's. For the following categories in our sample
the BEA puts weight on input prices as well as the CPI: (in order of their weight) hospital services, college
tuition, airline fares, high school and elementary school tuition, technical and business school tuition, and nursing
homes. These categories add up to 5.7% of consumption and 8.5% of our sample.


                                                        15
January 1959 to June 2000. Although we can match most of our 350 ELI categories to NIPA

time-series, in many cases the NIPA categories are broader. The matching results in 123

categories covering 63.3% of 1995 consumer spending and most of our 350 ELIs (which

made up 68.9% of spending).

        Menu-cost models of price adjustment (e.g., Barro, 1972, or Caplin and Spulber,

1987) predict that price changes are more frequent in markets with high trend inflation (or

deflation). Taylor (1999) cites a number of studies with empirical support for this prediction.
For our sample of 123 goods we examined whether the frequency of price changes was

greater for goods that display a higher absolute level of inflation. The average rate of

inflation is based on the good's NIPA personal consumption deflator from 1959 to 2000.

Observations are weighted by the good's relative importance in 1995 consumer expenditures.

Surprisingly, we observe a negative correlation of -0.18 (s.e. 0.09, here and below) between a

good's absolute average inflation rate and its frequency of price changes. Controlling for a

good's rate of noncomparable substitutions, however, reduces the magnitude of this

correlation to -0.11. (A good's rate of noncomparable substitutions is negatively correlated

with its trend inflation rate at -0.47.) For the recent period of January 1995 to June 2000,

which corresponds to the period for which we have data on the frequency of price changes,

there is a small positive correlation of 0.09 between a good's absolute average inflation rate

and its frequency of price changes. Controlling for the good's rate of noncomparable
substitutions raises this correlation to 0.17.

        In Tables 5 and 6 we examine the persistence and volatility of inflation and

consumption growth for the 123 goods. We place particular emphasis on how inflation rates

differ in persistence and volatility across goods in conjunction with underlying frequencies of

price change as measured from the BLS panel. Table 5 restricts attention to inflation and

consumption growth from January 1995 to June 2000. Table 6 repeats all statistics for the

considerably longer period of January 1959 to June 2000. Implicit in examining this longer




                                                 16
period is an assumption that the relative frequencies of price changes across goods after 1995

represent reasonably well the relative frequencies for the earlier sample period.

        We first examine persistence and volatility of aggregate inflation, where the

aggregation is over our 123 consumer goods. We fit this aggregate monthly inflation rate to

an AR(1) process. The top panel of column A in Table 5 shows that the aggregate inflation

rate is not very persistent over 1995-2000. Its serial correlation is 0.20 (standard error 0.13).

        The lower panel in column A of Table 5 depicts how persistence and volatility of
inflation vary across goods. For each of the 123 categories we fit the good's monthly inflation

rate to an AR(1) process. This allows us to examine how inflation persistence and volatility

differ across goods in relation to each good's underlying frequency of price changes over 1995

to 1997. We use the AR(1) coefficient to measure persistence. We focus on the standard

deviation of innovations to a good's AR(1) process for inflation as a measure of volatility.

We do so because, as discussed below, it is straightforward to depict how price stickiness

dampens the volatility of innovations to inflation with Calvo and Taylor pricing.

        The average serial correlation across the 123 sectors is close to zero at -0.05 (standard

error 0.02). Across the 123 categories, the correlation between the frequency of price changes

and the degree of serial correlation is 0.26 (s.e. 0.09). Thus, contrary to the predictions of the

Calvo and Taylor models of price stickiness, goods with more frequent price changes exhibit

inflation rates with more serial correlation. Consistent with the sticky-price models, however,
goods with more frequent price changes display more volatile innovations to inflation (the

correlation between the frequency of price changes and the standard deviation of inflation

innovations is 0.68, s.e. 0.07).

       Column B in Table 5 looks at monthly growth rates of real consumption spending.

Here the predictions of sticky-price models are less clear. The models are typically written

assuming that output is demand-determined in the presence of a preset price. Therefore, price

rigidity tends to exaggerate sales responses to product demand shocks, but mute the impact of

cost disturbances (e.g., Gali, 1999). For 1995 to 2000 aggregate real consumption growth



                                                17
across the 123 goods shows negative serial correlation at -0.32 (s.e. 0.12). Across the 123

categories, goods that exhibit more frequent price changes display more volatile but less

persistent consumption growth rates.

        Table 6 examines the patterns of persistence and volatility for the broader 1959 to

2000 period. Inflation was low and stable for the 1995 to 2000 period. The standard

deviation of inflation for consumer goods was about 20% lower over 1995 to 2000 than over

1959 to 2000. Volatility of consumption growth was also lower, by about 12%. For inflation
the drop in volatility reflects the fall in persistence of inflation, whereas for consumption

growth it reflects a fall in the volatility of innovations.

        Looking across the 123 goods, we see that inflation does show positive serial

correlation over the longer period. But the magnitude of this persistence, averaging 0.26

(standard error 0.02) across goods, is fairly modest. There is a negative correlation between a

good's frequency of price changes for 1995 to 1997 and its inflation persistence over 1959 to

2000, as anticipated by the sticky-price model. But it is small in magnitude and not

statistically significant. The correlation between the frequency of price changes and the

volatility of innovations to inflation is 0.52 (s.e. 0.08). This positive correlation is predicted

by the Calvo and Taylor sticky-price models, as less frequent price changes should mute the

volatility of inflation innovations. Alternatively, one could infer that sectors facing larger

shocks choose to change prices more frequently.
        Column B of Table 6 continues to look over 1959-2000, but at monthly growth rates

of real consumption. Consumption growth rates show modestly negative serial correlation at

the disaggregate level, and have more volatile innovations over this longer sample than over

1995 to 2000. Similar to the pattern for 1995 to 2000, goods with more frequent price

changes have less persistent, but more volatile growth rates in consumption.

        The correlations reported in Tables 5 and 6 do not convey the magnitude by which the

inflation processes differ across the goods. For this reason, we regressed the estimated serial

correlation and innovation standard error of inflation for each of the 123 goods on its



                                                 18
frequency of price changes in the BLS data for 1995 to 1997. Table 7 presents the serial

correlation (33 ) and volatility (53 ) that these regressions imply for a good with monthly
frequency of price changes of 48.5% (the 90th percentile of frequencies in our Table 1) versus

one with frequency of 6.1% (the 10th percentile of frequencies in Table 1).

        Column A of Table 7 gives results based on goods' 1995 to 2000 monthly inflation

rates. Persistence is very low for both flexible-price and sticky-price goods. Persistence is

actually higher for the flexible-price good (3  0.01 versus 3  –0.11). The standard

deviation of inflation innovations is far higher, by a factor of eight, for the flexible-price

good. Column B of Table 7 shows that consumption growth volatility is also greater for the

flexible-price good. Consumption movements are more persistent for the sticky-price goods.

        Results based on the broader 1959 to 2000 period appear in column C of Table 7.

Now both goods show positive serial correlation in inflation and the persistence is larger, as

expected, for goods with less frequent price changes. But note that persistence remains fairly

modest and the greater persistence for the sticky-priced good is modest in size (3  0.28,

versus 0.24 for the flexible good) and not statistically significant. The patterns for

consumption growth across flexible and sticky goods, reported in column D, largely parallel

those for the shorter 1995-2000 sample period.

        The results presented in Tables 5 through 7 are based on data that is not seasonally

adjusted. We also examined the volatility and persistence of inflation with monthly seasonal

dummies removed. The results for the persistence and volatility of inflation rates are

remarkably similar to those presented without seasonally adjusting. Importantly, this implies

that regular seasonal cycles in pricing (e.g., synchronized seasonal sales) do not generate the

transience and volatility we see in goods' inflation rates.


Inflation in the data vs. in Calvo and Taylor sticky-price models

        We argue that the workhorse models of price stickiness imply more persistent and less

volatile inflation than we observe in the data. We find it is even more difficult for the models

to explain the cross-good patterns we observe for persistence and variability of inflation. We


                                                19
illustrate these points in two ways. First, we take our staggered pricing model from section 3

and ask how goods' inflation and consumption growth respond to realistic aggregate monetary

and technology shocks as well as sizable idiosyncratic technology shocks. We compare these

responses to the patterns in the data described in Tables 5 through 7. Second, we focus on the

pricing equation central to the Taylor and Calvo models of price stickiness. We find it is not

possible to explain the volatility and transience of inflation rates for the 123 goods for

reasonable depictions of time series for the marginal costs of producing. In sum, we do not
see support for popular time-dependent models of price stickiness.11

         These facts might be easier to reconcile with state-dependent models of price

stickiness in which the frequency of price changes is endogenously greater in the presence of

more volatile shocks. In these models, such as Willis (2000), firm price adjustments can be

more synchronized in response to sectoral shocks, producing much larger inflation

innovations and much less inflation persistence.

         Employing the sticky-price model from section 3, we produce model statistics for

persistence and volatility of inflation for goods with monthly frequencies of price change of

1/2 and 1/15. These statistics parallel those reported from the data in Table 7. For exposition,

we first treat the case of only aggregate shocks to money growth and productivity. Calibrating

to monthly M1 growth from 1959 to 2000, money growth exhibits a serial correlation of 0.52

with a standard deviation of innovations equal to 0.44%. We calibrate the growth rate of

productivity to quarterly TFP growth for 1959 to 2000 (with parameters translated suitably to

reflect an underlying monthly process). We treat the growth rate of TFP as i.i.d., as this is

consistent with the data. The standard deviation of its monthly innovation is 0.40%.

         Results appear in column A of Table 8. The principal finding is that both the flexible

and sticky good exhibit much greater inflation persistence in the model than is observed in the

11 A number of papers discuss the difficulty faced by sticky-price models in generating persistent movements in
output in response to monetary shocks (e.g., Erceg, Henderson, and Levin, 2000, Chari, Kehoe, and McGratten,
2000, Dotsey and King, 2001). This does not conflict with our statement that these models generate too much
persistence in inflation. More related, Fuhrer and Moore (1995) contend that popular sticky-price models do not
generate enough persistence in inflation. They focus on a setting in which firms face nominal marginal costs that
are serially uncorrelated in levels. As we discuss below, this is highly counterfactual.


                                                       20
data. (The reported statistics reflect 100 separate stochastic simulations, with 480 monthly

periods per simulation.) For both goods the serial correlation is approximately equal to ("–

-3 ), where -3 is the good's monthly frequency of price changes. The mismatch with the data
is particularly striking for the sticky-price good. Here the model predicts persistence of 0.91

(standard deviation 0.02 across simulations). By sharp contrast, the value for the data is only

0.28 for 1959-2000 and -0.11 for 1995-2000. The model does mimic the data in that inflation

innovations are much more volatile for the flexible-price good. In fact, the model yields

innovations to inflation that are six times as large (in terms of standard deviation) for the

flexible good as for the sticky good. In the data this ratio is a factor of eight.

        Column B of Table 8 provides similar model statistics, but for real consumption

growth rates. The model predicts negative persistence in consumption growth that is fairly

consistent with observed values (Table 7, columns B and D). The model does not capture,

however, the much greater volatility of consumption for flexible-price goods in the data. This

can potentially be solved by allowing for idiosyncratic shocks concentrated on these goods.

        Column C of Table 8 allows for productivity shocks idiosyncratic to each good. These

shocks are orthogonal to the aggregate shocks, as well as to shocks in the other sector. We

calibrate the volatility and persistence of these shocks to the behavior of industry TFP for the

459 manufacturing industries in the NBER Productivity Database.12 This yields an

autocorrelation, in levels, of 0.98, with a standard deviation for innovations of 1.3%. Adding
these idiosyncratic shocks has very little impact on inflation persistence in the model.

Persistence (33 Ñ drops only to 0.47 from 0.48 for the flexible-price good, and only to 0.90
from 0.91 for the sticky-price good. Inflation innovations become about 50% more volatile.

As a result, the variance of inflation in the model is fairly close to that observed in the data for

both goods. The upshot is that the sticky-price model, calibrated to the frequency of price

changes observed in the BLS panel, is not able to generate the low persistence of inflation we

see in the data. This is particularly so for goods with less frequent price changes.

12 The NBER Productivity Database contains annual data for 1959 through 1996. We map the parameter values
estimated from annual data to values for an underlying monthly process.


                                                   21
        Column D of Table 8 considers the impact of the good-specific shocks on

consumption growth rates. These real shocks particularly add volatility to consumption

growth for the flexible-price good, and eliminate the negative persistence in its growth rate.

        It is natural to ask if hitting the sticky-price sector with less persistent idiosyncratic

shocks can enable the model to better fit the data. We explored a number of possibilities.

The model's inability to capture the transience of inflation rates appears quite robust.

Suppose, for instance, that sticky-price goods are subject to idiosyncratic productivity shocks
with no serial correlation in levels (even though the industry TFP evidence is at odds with this

assumption). Although this lowers the persistence of inflation, it also dramatically reduces

the volatility of a good's inflation rate, as the sticky-price model predicts little response of

prices to transitory shocks. If firms in a sector adjust their prices only every 15 months, they

put little weight on shocks that are around for only a month or two. To overcome this the

transitory shocks must be very large. To illustrate we chose the persistence and volatility of

idiosyncratic shocks to each sector to match the persistence and volatility of inflation rates for

both the flexible and sticky goods. Idiosyncratic productivity in the sticky-price sector must

display serial correlation in levels of only 0.3 and must have the implausibly large monthly

standard deviation of 59%.


Inflation and realistic marginal cost processes

        The preceding exercises embedded staggered pricing in a particular general

equilibrium model. The model featured money in the utility function and exogenous money

supply growth, both calibrated in particular ways to the data (e.g., the latter to M1 growth).

There is little consensus on how to model and calibrate money demand and monetary policy

shocks, so we made these assumptions for simplicity rather than for realism. The model is

special in other ways, affecting how marginal costs of production and, therefore, price

changes respond to shocks. In particular, labor's share is one, with no role for capital or

material inputs, and wages are assumed to be perfectly flexible.




                                                 22
         We contend that the transience and volatility puzzles documented above are not

simply a byproduct of the way we modeled money demand, shocks to monetary policy, wage

setting, and so forth. Popular time-dependent models of infrequent price changes contain a

strong force ratcheting up inflation persistence and holding down inflation volatility, relative

to the underlying marginal cost of producing. Consider the Calvo (1983) model as outlined in

Rotemberg (1987), Roberts (1995), and in many recent papers on price stickiness.13 In each
period firms in category i change their price with probability -3 . This probability is fixed and

therefore independent of how many periods have elapsed since a firm's last price change.

Conditional on changing price in period >, firms set price as a markup over the average

(discounted) marginal cost the firm expects to face over the duration of time the price remains

in effect. The natural log of this price (minus the constant desired markup) is

as each period "–-3 of the firms carry prices forward, with -3 setting their price at B3> .
         To illustrate, suppose the log of marginal cost follows a random walk, an assumption

that, as we discuss below, is roughly consistent with the evidence. In this case the model

implies a process for inflation for good i of




13 Although we focus on the Calvo formulation here, the discussion applies as well to Taylor models such as the
one presented in section 3. The Taylor model shares critical features of the Calvo model: in any period many
sellers do not adjust their prices, and those who do set their prices to reflect the expected discounted value of
marginal cost viewed over a considerable time horizon. In the figures to follow we report on the ability of the
Calvo model to fit the persistence and volatility of goods' inflation rates. We obtained very similar results when
we conducted the same exercises with the Taylor model.

where &3> is the i.i.d. growth rate of good i's marginal cost. If price changes are infrequent
(that is, -3 is well below one), the sticky-price model exerts a powerful force for creating

persistence in inflation and sharply dampening its volatility. Across all consumer goods

examined in section 2, the average monthly probability of price change is roughly 0.2. If, as

an example, we reduce -3 from 1 (perfect price flexibility) to 0.2, the serial correlation in

inflation implied by the model goes from zero to 0.8. At the same time, the standard

deviation of innovations to the inflation process is reduced by 80% and the unconditional

standard deviation of the inflation rate is reduced by two-thirds.

        Figure 4 makes this point more generally. Across the 123 categories of consumer

goods for which we have monthly time-series for inflation, the frequency of price changes

(based on the BLS panel) varies from less than 0.05 to more than 0.70. The solid line graphs

the serial correlation of monthly inflation predicted by the Calvo model as a function of this

frequency of price change. Under the assumption that the growth rate of marginal cost is

serially uncorrelated, this predicted serial correlation is simply one minus the frequency of

price change. The figure also graphs the observed serial correlation for each of the 123

consumer goods for the shorter sample period January 1995 to June 2000. With only a few

exceptions, the observed serial correlation falls far below the model's prediction. The average

observed serial correlation is close to zero, whereas the average predicted value is around 0.8.

For goods with frequencies of price change below the median value of 21%, no good exhibits

a serial correlation in the data that is within 0.4 of the model's prediction.

        Figure 5 repeats the exercise in Figure 4, except that it presents inflation's observed

serial correlation over the entire 1959 to 2000 period. The goods' inflation rates are more

often positively serial correlated for the longer sample period, as reported in Table 6. But, for

all but a handful of goods, the observed persistence is well below that anticipated by the




                                                24
Calvo model. In fact, the observed persistence is typically closer to zero than to the model's

prediction, especially for goods with less frequent price changes.

         Figures 4 and 5 presume a growth rate for marginal cost that is serially uncorrelated.

Perhaps the failure of the Calvo model in these figures is an artifact of our assuming too much

persistence in innovations to marginal cost. Addressing this question requires a measure of

marginal cost, or at least its persistence. Bils (1987) creates a measure of movements of

marginal cost under the assumption that output, Y3> , can be linked by a power function to at
least one of its inputs, call it N3> :


                                     ]3> = R3>! 03> Ðall other inputsÑ .

The Cobb-Douglas form is a special case for which any input can take the role of input N.

Bils focuses on the case where N is production labor. Marginal cost can be expressed as the

price of N, call it W, relative to N's marginal product. For the production function above, the

natural log of marginal cost is simply


                                      D3> = 68Ð!Ñ + A3> + 83> – C3>


where w, n, and y refer to the natural logs of their upper case counterparts. Gali and Gertler

(1999) and Sbordone (2002) also use this approach to construct a measure of marginal cost in

order to judge the impact of price stickiness.

         Suppose we treat labor as the relevant input, n, and measure WN simply as payments

to labor.14 In this case, D3> is, up to a constant term, simply the natural log of the ratio of the

wage bill to real output. The BLS publishes a quarterly time series on this ratio, labeled unit

labor costs, for the aggregate business sector. We examined the persistence in the growth rate

14 Bils (1987) argues against this assumption. If labor is quasi-fixed he shows that the marginal price of labor
may be much more procyclical than the average wage rate paid to labor. We pursued the correction suggested
there for calculating a marginal wage rate that reflects the marginal propensity to pay overtime premia. This
does raise the volatility of innovations to marginal cost modestly. Across 459 industries, the average standard
deviation of innovations to an AR(1) process for marginal cost estimated on annual data from 1959 to 1996 is
increased by about 20 percent. The estimated serial correlation for marginal cost is only slightly reduced.
Incorporting this adjustment alters little the results we depict in Figures 6 and 7 and describe below.


                                                        25
of this quarterly series. For our shorter sample period, 1995 to 2000, the growth rate of unit

labor cost is actually positively serially correlated, but not significantly so. The AR(1)

parameter is 0.12 with standard error 0.25. For the broader 1959 to 2000 sample the growth

rate of unit labor cost is more serially correlated. The AR(1) parameter equals 0.41, with

standard error 0.07. This is consistent with the observation from Tables 5 and 6 of greater

serial correlation in inflation over the longer period. We obtained very similar results with the

BLS series on unit labor costs for the nonfarm business sector as for the aggregate business
sector. None of these estimates suggest less persistence in marginal cost than presumed by

our assumption of a random walk for marginal cost. In fact, the persistence in the growth rate

for this measure of marginal cost suggests the lack of persistence in inflation rates is even

more problematic for the Calvo and Taylor models.

         We also examined the persistence and volatility of unit labor cost as measured for 459

manufacturing industries in the NBER Productivity Database. The advantage of this source is

that the data is much more disaggregate than the BLS measure of unit labor cost. The

drawbacks are that it is only available annually and only for manufacturing. Manufacturing

output is considerably more volatile than consumption. Also, average sales across the 459

manufacturing industries is an order of magnitude smaller than average consumption across

the 123 categories. So there is reason to think that, if anything, marginal cost is more volatile

for these manufacturing industries than for the consumption sectors.
         For each of the 459 industries we estimated a separate AR(1) model for the log level

of production workers' unit labor cost. Based on annual data for 1959 to 1996, the average

AR(1) parameter is 0.98 (standard deviation 0.05 across industries) and the average standard

error of innovations to marginal cost is 6.9% (standard deviation 3.1% across industries).

This is not statistically different from a random walk.15 If we take only the most recent third

of the NBER data, years 1984 to 1996, the data show less persistence and less volatility in

15 The implied monthly AR(1) process consistent with this annual evidence has a serial correlation of 0.997 and
an innovation standard error of 2.5%. Estimates based on labor costs for all workers, not just production
workers, yield almost the same results. Estimates based on unit materials cost also produce very similar results,
with an average AR(1) parameter in annual data of 0.99 rather than 0.98.


                                                       26
unit labor cost. The average AR(1) parameter falls to 0.75 (standard deviation 0.27) and the

average innovation standard error to 4.9% (standard deviation 2.6% across industries).16
           Lastly, we compare these estimates to the behavior of marginal cost needed to explain

the behavior of actual inflation rates for the 123 consumer goods. Figures 6 and 7 plot, with a

point for each good, what persistence and volatility of marginal cost reconcile the Calvo

model with the observed persistence and volatility of that good's inflation rate. Figure 6 is

based on inflation rates for 1995 to 2000, Figure 7 on those for 1959 to 2000. The figures

make clear that the popular time-dependent sticky-price models not only predict far too much

persistence  they also predict far too little volatility.

           Looking at Figure 6, to be consistent with observed inflation, many of the goods

require little or no persistence in marginal cost in conjunction with tremendous volatility of

innovations. In most cases marginal cost innovations need to exhibit a standard deviation

well above 10% monthly. The figure employs three separate symbols for goods that rank

among the stickiest third, middle third, and most flexible third according to their frequency of

price changes in the BLS panel. The volatility required of marginal cost is enormous for

goods with infrequent price changes. The figure also plots, for reference, the average

persistence and volatility of marginal cost estimated for 1984 to 1996 of the NBER

Productivity Database. Even if we move two standard deviations below the mean persistence

and two standard deviations above the mean volatility, these values are far removed from

what is needed for the Calvo model to fit the behavior of most goods' inflation rates.

           Figure 7 shows the required marginal cost processes given goods' inflation rates over

1959 to 2000 (rather than 1995 to 2000). The figure also presents mean behavior of marginal

cost based on years 1959-1996 of the NBER Productivity Database. Here a handful of goods

do exhibit inflation rates that are consistent with the average estimated process for marginal

costs. But, for the vast majority of goods, inflation is far too transient and its innovations far

too volatile to be consistent with the Calvo model under plausible behavior for marginal cost.


16   The implied monthly AR(1) process has serial correlation 0.96 and innovation standard error 2.1%.


                                                        27
         Measurement error in the underlying BLS price quotes could conceivably explain the

divergence between theory and evidence. Serially uncorrelated errors in price levels would

contribute negative serial correlation to inflation, making inflation appear too transient. They

would also, of course, add noise and make measured inflation more volatile. To fully

reconcile the theory and evidence, however, such measurement error would have to be

implausibly large. Prices are collected by different field agents at 22,000 outlets across 88

geographic areas, so measurement error is unlikely to be correlated across quotes. And given
that the median number of quotes in a sector is 700 per month, uncorrelated errors should

largely average out in the aggregation up to the sectoral level. To explain the low serial

correlation of sectoral inflation rates (-0.05 in the data vs. 0.79 in theory), the standard

deviation of measurement error at the quote level would have to be around 27% conditional

on a given price change.17 This is larger than the 25% average absolute size of price changes

in Kackmeister's (2001) micro data. It also exceeds the "tolerances" in the BLS Data

Collection Manual: field representatives must verify and explain changes in prices exceeding

20% for food items and 10% for other items.

         In the above calculation, we assume measurement error only when the BLS field

representative records a change from the previous price. BLS field agents must circle the

previous price (shown on their collection sheets) if it is the same as the current price,

presumably limiting the number of spurious price changes. When a field agent records no
change in price when one has in fact occurred, however, this should contribute non-classical

measurement error and mimic the predictions of the Calvo model. That is, such measurement

error should affect the frequency of price changes and the sectoral inflation rates just like true

price stickiness does in the Calvo model.

17 The observed serial correlation should be a weighted average of 0.79 and -0.50, with the weights equal to the
fraction of inflation variance coming from the signal and the noise, respectively. Noise would need to contribute
65.1% of the variance to drive inflation's serial correlation down from 0.79 to -0.05. In Table 6 the mean
variance of inflation is 0.691%, so the standard deviation of measurement error in inflation would have to be
0.671%. Measurement error in the level of sectoral prices would need a standard deviation of 0.474% (=È0.5 x
!Þ671), and in the levels of individual prices it would need to be 12.5% (= È700 x 0.474). Finally, conditional
on a price change the standard deviation would have to be 27.4% (= 12.5%ÎÈ0.21 ).


                                                       28
       As discussed in section 2, Kackmeister (2001) found that temporary price discounts

were common for 49 food, home furnishing, and clothing items over 1997-1999. Temporary

sales constituted 29% of all price changes in his data (each sale accounting for two price

changes), with the average price discount equal to 30%. Temporary sales clearly work to

reduce the persistence of price changes. Unless they are synchronized across sellers,

however, they face the same difficulty as measurement errors in explaining the low

persistence of inflation rates. We calculated the impact of temporary sales on the volatility
and persistence of inflation rates based on Kackmeister's figures, which we view as a

generous description of the importance of sales for our broader set of goods. Temporary sales

of that magnitude would reduce the serial correlation for the median good from a model value

of 0.79 to 0.57. This remains well above the average value in the data of -0.05. Furthermore,

these temporary sales help much less in addressing the volatility puzzle. Eliminating the

impact of these sales would reduce the standard deviation of the inflation rate by only about

11% for a good with the mean variability of inflation.

       What about temporary sales that are synchronized across a sector? Can these address

both the transience and volatility puzzles? As we noted earlier, seasonally-adjusted sectoral

inflation rates show the same low persistence and high innovation volatility, so synchronized

sales that reflect time-dependent pricing do not appear to explain our findings. More

promising, we believe, are randomized and synchronized sales that cover a large fraction of a
sector. Note, however, that such sales imply that sellers are conditioning on each other's

pricing decisions; we view this as support for state-dependent pricing behavior. Importantly,

synchronized sales cannot explain why the staggered-pricing model falls so far short in

explaining the transience and volatility for goods that display infrequent price changes. The

importance of temporary sales is limited for these goods, as otherwise they could not display

such low frequency of price changes.

5. Conclusions

       We have exploited unpublished data from the BLS for 1995 to 1997 on the monthly

frequency of price changes for 350 categories of consumer goods and services. We found

considerably more frequent price changes than have previous studies of producer prices or

consumer prices based on narrower sets of goods. The time between price changes was 4.3

months or shorter for half of consumption. Taylor (1999, p.1020) summarized the prior

literature as finding that prices typically change about once a year.
       We examined whether time series for inflation are consistent with the workhorse

Calvo and Taylor sticky-price models, given the frequency of price changes we observe. We

found that, for nearly all consumer goods, these models predict inflation rates that are much

more persistent and much less volatile than we observe. The models particularly over-predict

persistence and under-predict volatility for goods with less frequent price changes.

       A model with synchronized price changes within sectors might explain the volatility

and transience of observed inflation rates. Synchronization might arise due to large sector-

specific shocks under state-dependent pricing. Temporary price reductions could also help

resolve the transience and volatility puzzles. Regular prices might behave more like the

predictions of the Calvo and Taylor models. Purely seasonal sales would not do the trick,

however, because seasonally-adjusted inflation rates exhibit the same low persistence and

high volatility. Allowing for synchronized sales in models with state-dependent pricing
appears more promising, as does variation in desired price markups more generally.

       We have focused on implications of the popular Calvo and Taylor versions of sticky-

price models. More elaborate sticky-price models may preserve the predictions of these

models while better explaining the observed behavior of prices at the aggregate and good

level. Sims (2001), for instance, models firms as actively responding to market-level

information, yet choosing to largely ignore monetary policy variables. We believe that the

behavior of prices we observe, particularly the volatility and transience of inflation rates for

goods with infrequent price changes, should help in disciplining such models.
