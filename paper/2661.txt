         THE EFFECTS OF JAPANESE SOCIAL SECURITY RETIREMENT BENEFITS
            ON PERSONAL SAVINGS AND ELDERLY LABOR FORCE BEHAVIOR


                                     ABSTRACT



     Using   Japanese annual time series data covering the period from 1946

to 1982, this paper shows that social security wealth depresses personal

savings. The effect was a reduction of approximately 143 thousand yen per

capita wealth in real terms from 1970 to 1980. However, declining labor

force participation of the elderly (i.e., earlier retirement), stimulates

personal saving by an estimated 12 thousand yen over the same period. The

study found that the benefit effect dominates the retirement effect. In

addition, this study has identified a negative interdependency between the

personal savings and labor retirement behaviors of the elderly; that is, an

individual saves more before retirement if he expects to stay a shorter

time in the labor market, and vice versa.

                                 I. Introduction


        Ever since its institution, the social security system has alleviated

the financial problems of the elderly under changing economic and social

conditions. Recently, in the United States, this system has come under

fire. The main thrust of this attack is twofold: (1) that personal savings

decline as compulsory public savings, such as social security retirement

benefits, increase and (2) that social security retirement benefits have

created a trend towards earlier retirement.

        In the debate over social security and savings in the United States,

the pivotal issue continues to be whether social security retirement bene-

fits increase or decrease personal savings. Despite an abundance of

empirical studies on this issue, no conclusion has been agreed upon.1

        Boskin's (1977) pioneering study of the effect of social security

retirement benefits on the retirement decision concludes that social

security retirement benefits influence the elderly to leave their jobs

early or to restrict their market work, thereby reducing the labor supply

    1Feldstein (1974; 1982), Feldstein and Pellechio (1979), Munnell
(1974), and Darby (1979) find a significant negative effect of social
security retirement benefits on personal savings, whereas Barro (1978),
Blinder, Gordon and Wise (1983), Leimer and Lesnoy (1982), Lesnoy and
Leimer (1985) and Modigliani and Sterling (1983) find it to be insignifi-
cant.

of the elderly (see Pellechio 1979, Burtless and Moffitt 1984 and 1985,

Hurd and Boskin 1984, Mitchell and Fields 1984, and Burtless 1986, which

support this induced retirement effect). In contrast, Blinder, Gordon and

Wise (1980) do not reject the hypothesis that social security retirement

benefits delay the retirement of the elderly.2

     These results suggest that the effects of social security retirement

benefits on personal savings and the retirement decisions of the elderly

are still open to debate. This paper examines the effects of social

security on personal savings and labor force participation of elderly men.

This sort of application is useful for several reasons. First, it helps

us to understand implications of retirement policies. Secondly, if social

security retirement benefits reduce lifetime personal savings and lower the

labor supply of the elderly, capital formation and aggregate labor supply

are reduced and, hence, aggregate output is lowered (Burtless and Moffitt

1984). Finally, a quantitative evaluation of the effects of social

security retirement benefits on personal saving behavior and labor force

participation of the elderly rests on empirical studies.3

     Very few such studies have been done in Japan. Noguchi (1983) finds

the effect of gross social security wealth on household net wealth to be

negative, but significant in only one of many specifications. Other stu-

dies, for examples, Ishikawa and Iieda (1984), Ando, Yamashita and Murayama



    2Burkhauser and Turner (1978; 1982b) come to a similar conclusion as to
the effect of social security on the market work behavior of prime-age
males.

    3Burtless (1986) also emphasizes the influence of the timing of changes
in social security retirement benefits on lifetime labor supply and
savings, but the estimation of this type of model depends on development of
much better data than that currently available.

(1986), and Dekle (1986), examine the saving behavior of Japanese

households, but totally ignore the influence of social security retirement

benefits. Some other studies, such as those of Takayama (1982) and Ito

(1983), inquire about the relationship between social security retirement

benefits and the retiremeflt behavior of elderly men: the former is a

theoretical paper, presenting little empirical evidence on the impact of

social security retirement benefits on retirement decisions; the latter,

although empirical, does not use an econometric multivariate analysis.

Consequently, neither of the studies supplies a good estimate of quan-

titative effects.

     This study examines the influence of social security retirement bene-

fits on the personal savings and labor force participation of elderly men

in Japan. The hypothesis to be tested is that personal savings over the

life cycle are determined simultaneously with retirement decisions, as

discussed and emphasized by King (1983) and Thompson (1983). using three

different social security retirement wealth measures, the analysis is based

on Japanese annual time series data over the period from 1946 to 1982.

     The organization of the subsequent sections is as follows. Section II

contains a brief review of the social security system in Japan. Section

III describes the theoretical model. The empirical results are presented

in Section IV and conclusions in Section V.

    II. A Brief Review of the Welfare Pension, Savings and Labor Force
                       Participation of Elderly

     The social security program (Welfare Pension) in Japan was introduced

in 1942 and covers a majority of Japanese workers. It is a partially

funded system, not a pay-as-you-go system.4 Under the Welfare Pension a

flat tax rate of 10.6 is applied to monthly labor earnings up to a maximum

of 410 thousand yen, the minimum being 45 thousand yen for male workers.

The rate is 8.9 for females.5 Half of the social security tax rate is

paid by the employer, as in the U.S.

     The receipts of the Welfare Pension tax (social security tax) are

deposited in special treasury accounts (Trust Fund Bureaus) and the fund is

managed by the Treasury Investment and Loans Division. As of 1985, the

accumulated pension fund was 27,983 billion yen. For the purpose of

improving living conditions, the fund is used for housing, living environ-

ment improvements, small enterprises, culture, education, agriculture,

forestry, fisheries, etc. The proceeds of the interest payments are used

for a part of administrative costs of the social security program.

     Retirement benefits of the Japanese Welfare Pension (social security

retirement benefits, or SSRB) are indexed to the inflation rate and

generally require contributions for a minimum of 20 years. The normal

retirement age is 60 for men and 55 for women.6 The basic schedule of




    4Another social security retirement program is the National Pension for
self-employed workers and housewives who are not in the paid labor force.

    5After April, 1986, the rates were raised to 12.4 percent and 11.3 per-
cent for male and female workers, respectively.

    6After April, 1986, the normal retirement age for female workers was
raised to sixty years old with gradual adjustments.

monthly social security retirement benefits for a typical individual             '9"

where        number of preretirement working years, and W1 monthly labor

earnings at time t.    The amount of monthly social security retirement

benefits is reduced according to the amount of an individual's monthly

labor earnings as shown in Table i.

                            [Table 1 should be here]

        The ratio of social security retirement benefits to disposable income

per capita in real terms was only about 50*, on average, during the 10

years 1972-1982. The replacement rates of a social security,             old-age,

pension for a single worker in Japan were 26* in 1969, 37* in 1975 and 54*

in 1980. The relatively low replacement rates in Japan compared to the

United States seems to have some relation to Japanese saving behavior.                 The

 ratio of personal savings to disposable income in real per capita terms

was about 20* on the average during the 10 years 1972-1982.              This ratio is

 remarkably high compared to the ratio (about 5*, on average) in the United

 States.

        In 1953 the ratio of personal savings to disposable income suddenly

 declined from 17.6* in 1952 to 11.2* in 1953, and the low ratio continued

until 1958. Then the ratio of personal savings to disposable income

increased to 16.7% in 1959 from 13.5% in 1958.

     Coincidentally the labor force participation rate of males ages 60 and

over increased to 73.5% in 1953 from 68.5% in 1952. The rate remained high

until 1958, and then dropped from 74.3% in 1958 to 69.9% in 1959. The

ratios of personal savings to disposable income have been relatively high:

18.9% on the average since 1960. The labor force participation rates had

been gradually declining since 1960. Therefore, there seems to be some

negative relationship between the ratio of personal savings to disposable

income and the labor force participation of men ages 60 and over. The

overall labor force participation of the elderly in Japan, however,

declined by about 10 percentage points from 1946 through 1982.

     A primary, goal of the present paper is to study the effects of social

security retirement benefits on personal savings in the preretirement

period and the labor force behavior of the elderly.8 Therefore, the paper

focuses on the labor force participation rates of the elderly, ages 60 and

over, rather than the labor supply, that is, hours of work. An advantage

of using the labor force participation rate of the elderly is that one can

view the outcome in this multivariate analysis as the probability of

retirement for the elderly.



per capita in real terms, was about 50 percent, on average, over the period
from 1970 to 1982. This rate is low in comparison to the U.S. standard
(Aldrich 1982) and may have encouraged the Japanese to maintain a high rate
of personal savings.

    8Japanese workers normally retire from their lifetime jobs at the age
of 60, at which time they are entitled to receive social security retire-
ment benefits (as of 1985). In this study, the period before the age of 60
is called the preretirement period and the period beginning at age 60 is
called the postretirement period.

                                  III. Theoretical Model


     Social security retirement benefits affect the the life-cycle savings

and labor supply decisions of an individual simultaneously. If the indivi-

dual anticipates social security retirement benefits and saves less during

the preretirement period, this is the benefit effect.          If, however, he

expects to retire earlier due to the anticipated benefits, he may increase

his rate of savings during the preretirement period; this is the retirement

effect. Which of the two effects will dominate is a testable hypothesis

and is an empirical matter.

     The social security wealth variable in the model can assume three

alternative forms: gross social security wealth GSSW, net social security

wealth NSSW, and social security tax contributions SSTC.

(1) Gross Social Security Wealth (GSSW) is defined as:

                                               60-a             k-60

      SSBt
                =    per capita disposable income of an individual of age a
                     at time t,

      1.601a =       probability    of an individual of age a to survive until

                     age 60,

           60 =      probability    of an individual of age 60 to survive at

                     least to age k, k>60
                                                 -8-


                =       growth rate of per capita income at time t,

      Pt
                =       inflation   rate at time t, and

                =       rate   at which an individual discounts his expected

                        social security retirement benefits at time t.

     In constructing the social security wealth variable, Leimer and Lesnoy

(1982) and Lesnoy and Leimer (1985) suggest modifying the original social

security wealth variable used by Feldstein (1974) and Munnell (1974). This

study takes into account the suggestion by Leimer and Lesnoy (1982). For

example, Aat Bt. L60 a' L 60' and a,t are not constant in the analysis.


(2) Net Social Security Wealth (NSSW) is defined as:


NSSWat =    GSSWa t -          SSTAXat             (3)

where NSSWat = net social security wealth of an individual of age a at

                         time t,

                          59
     SSTAXat =            E    Ra,t x L         x 0a t x [(l+g)/(1÷i)]Ja
                                          jia

                    =   present value of social security tax per person of age a
     SSTAXa
                         at time t,


           Ra
                    =   ratio  of social security tax per covered worker of age a
                         to per capita disposable income at time t, and


                a
                    =   probability       of an individual of age a to survive until age j.

(3) Social Security Tax Contributions (SSTC) is defined as:


     SSTCa,t = OASDIa t '                CPI             (4)



where OASDIa        =   contributions of an individual of age a at time t
                        under the old—age, survivors and disability insurance of
                        the Welfare Pension program, and

            CPI. = consumer price index at time t.

     The amounts of savings and social security retirement benefits exert

different influences on the quantity of lifetime labor supply. Conversely,

labor supply affects life-cycle savings. Consequently, a model should

reflect not only the effects of social security retirement benefits upon

the personal savings and labor force behavior of elderly, but also the

interactions between the two behaviors. The specification of our simulta-

neous equation model is as follows:

      =

          b7UYDt+b8EDUCAt+b9AGRICLt+vt        (6)

where the variables in the model are defined in Table 2 (the subscript "i"

is omitted for brevity), and u and v are residual terms, assumed

independent, with zero means and constant variances.9

                           (Table 2 should be here)

     The rationale for including the variables in the model is found in

similar studies in the literature (Barro 1978, Burkhauser and Turner 1978

and 1982b, Feldstein 1974, Leimer and Lesnoy 1982, Munnell 1974, and

Noguchi 1983). Therefore, only the variables of interest are discussed.

In the personal savings equation (equation 5), the coefficient of social

security wealth reflects both the benefit and retirement effects, but does

not allow for the separate estimation of each effect (Leimer and Lesnoy

1982). Hence, this study includes the labor force participation rate of



    91n the model, the omission of a LF6O variable from equation (5) would
cause the estimated coefficient on the SSW variable to be biased towards
zero. This happens if a1 and a2 are negative and if SSW and LF6O are nega-
tively correlated.
                                    — 10   —




men ages 60 and over to capture the retirement effect (see Munnell 1974).


     It is common to relate consumption to permanent income by using a

distributed lag on past income. Therefore, it is reasonable to employ

lagged disposable income in the extended life cycle saving model (Barro,

1978; Darby, 1979; and Leimer and Lesnoy, 1982). Even though lagged

disposable income does not affect the current flow of resources, it has a

positive effect on personal savings if, given the value of current dispo-

sable income and other variables, the variable has a positive impact on

current personal savings.

      This study includes two different wealth variables: WEALTH1 includes

physical assets (e.g., houses), which are less liquid than WEALTH2 (e.g.,

stocks, bonds, trusts and insurance). In Japan, physical assets are usually

held through life for a bequest purpose rather than a speculative one (Sato

1987); therefore, illiquid wealth, WEALTH1, will have a different impact on

personal savings than WEALTH2.

     The product of U and YD (UYD) is included in the savings function to

adjust for the cyclical variation in personal savings and for the deviation

of income from the normal position (Barro, 1978). The deviation of income

from its normal position, represented by UYD, will make the individual

anxious about future prospects and hence motivate him to increase his per-

sonal savings. Japanese business firms accumulate retirement pension

allowances for their employees. These allowances are 40 percent tax deduc-

tible and are transferable by firms into retained earnings (RETAIN). An

increase in retirement pensions funded by firms tends to discourage indivi-

dual personal savings. An increase in the governments budget surplus
                                   — 11   —




(GOVTSUR) has a positive influence on personal savings through an increase

in future disposable income from the lowering of taxes and the price level

(Barro 1978).

     In the labor force participation equation (equation 6), an increase in

social security wealth (SSW) may induce earlier retirement, resulting in a

prolonged retirement period. Consequently, the labor force participation of

the elderly (LF6O) declines. Why is the labor force participation rate at

age sixty and over one of the independent variables? Barro's and

Feldstein'S interpretation of social security wealth measured in their

models does not include a variable which explicitly measures the retirement

effect of social security retirement benefits (Leimer and Lesnoy, 1982).

SSW alone measures both effects, but does not allow for the separate esti-

mation of each one. An additional variable is needed to explain the

retirement effect.1° Higher personal savings (S) will make it less

necessary for the elderly in the postretirement period to stay in the labor

market and earn for consumption.

      Education (EOUC) widens the choice of job opportunities, by making

new types of employment available to the elderly at the age of 60, after

their lifetime jobs, and consequently influences the individual's retire-

ment. Thus, a rise in EDUCA increases the years of labor   force par-

 ticipation (Harioch and Honig 1983; Modigliani 1986). An accelerating

 industrial development in Japan has provided the elderly with job oppor-

 tunities, while the opportunity for employment in the agricultural sector



    10Since a mandatory retirement age implicitly exists at the age between
 55 and 60 under the Japanese lifetime employment system, this study uses
 the labor force participation of males aged 60 and over.  Munnell (1974)
 uses a labor force participation of males aged 65 and over for the U.S.
 study. The starting age for receiving social security retirement benefits

(AGRICL) has declined. AGRICL, therefore, will have a negative effect on

LF6O.

        Finally, the simultaneous equation model provides estimates of the

effects of social security wealth, separately, on personal savings and

labor force participation of the elderly. In addition, the empirical

results will shed light on the interdependency of lifetime personal saving

and labor force behavior of the elderly.

                           IV.   Empirical Results


     The data used to estimate the model are an annual time series covering

the period from 1946 to 1982. The simultaneous equation model Consists of

an equation for personal savings and an equation for the retirement deci-

sions of men ages 60 and over. Table 3 presents the second-stage results

after correcting for serial correlation. The social security wealth

variable takes three alternative forms: gross social security wealth GSSW

in model I, net social security wealth NSSW in model II, and social

security tax Contributions SSTC in model III. The alternative forms will

show the sensitivity of the empirical results to the different specifica-

tions of the social security wealth variable.

                         (Table 3 should be here]

     One of the robust results in the personal savings equation (the S

columns) is that the social security wealth variables, GSSW, NSSW, and

SSTC, are statistically significant and negative. Another striking result

is that the estimated coefficients on the labor force participation rate of

men ages 60 and over, LF6O, are negative and statistically significant in

models I and II. On the other hand, in the labor force participation

equation (the LF6O columns), the estimated coefficients on the personal

savings variable are significantly negative in all models. Therefore,

simultaneity exists between personal savings and retirement decisions of

the elderly.

     Concerning the effect of social security wealth on personal savings,

the marginal propensity to save with respect to GSSW, NSSW, and SSTC is
                                   — 14   —




—0.004 in model I, -0.005 in model II, and -0.979 in model III, respec-

tively. The point elasticities evaluated at the sample means are -1.56

(GSSW), —1.65 (NSSW), and —0.49 (SSTC). In terms of elasticity, the magni-

tude of anticipated social security retirement benefits (GSSW and NSSW) is

substantially greater than that of current social security tax contribu-

tions (SSTC): the first two elasticities are three times larger than the

last one. Utilizing these estimated elasticities, the study examines the

relative contributions of GSSW, NSSW, and SSTC to the recent Japanese per-

sonal savings experience for the period of 1970-1980. Personal savings per

capita in real terms increased by 68 thousand yen from 140 thousand yen in

1970 to 208 thousand yen in 1980. The increase in GSSW and NSSW over the

period resulted in approximately a 143 thousand yen reduction in personal

savings per capita in real terms, while the increase in SSTC resulted in a

77 thousand yen reduction in personal savings.11 Therefore, personal savings

are depressed by approximately 68 percent due to the increase in GSSW and

NSSW, ceteris paribus, while the reduction in savings due to the increase

in SSTC is by approximately 53 percent.

     The point elasticities of personal savings with respect to the labor

force participation of elderly males, LF6O, are -1.36 in model I, -1.46 in

model II, and -0.76 in model III, at the sample means. A reduction in LF6O,

(i.e., earlier retirement), makes individuals in the preretirement period

save more for consumption during a prolonged postretirement period. The

estimated impact on personal savings of earlier retirement was about a 23



   lIThe method for this calculation is adapted from Shapiro and Shaw
(1983). The estimated reductions in personal savings during the period
from 1960 to 1980 were about 291 thousand yen due to the effects of GSSW
(or NSSW) and about 118 thousand yen due to that of SSTC. In this period
personal savings per capita in real terms increased by 143 thousand yen,
                                   - 15   -




thousand yen increase in personal savings per capita in real terms from

1960 to 1980 and a 12 thousand yen increase from 1970 to 1980. Hence,

during the two periods from 1960 to 1980 and from 1970 to 1980, the abso-

lute amount of the upward impact of the retirement effect (LF6O) on per-

sonal savings was about one-tenth of the amount of downward impact of the

anticipated social security retirement benefits effect (GSSW and NSSW) and

about one-fifth of the amount of downward impact of the social security ta

contributions (SSTC). The benefit effect outweighs the retirement effect

and the net effect consequently depresses personal savings.

     In LF6O equations, the estimated coefficients on the personal savings

variable are significant and negative: -0.039, -0.039, and —0.040, in

models I, II, and III, respectively, implying that an increase in personal

savings induces earlier retirement, i.e., reduces labor force participation.

As previously discussed, the marginal propensity to save with respect to

LF6O is also observed to be significantly negative. These two results

suggest a negative interdependency between the personal savings and labor

force behaviors of the elderly. The point elasticities evaluated at the

sample means indicate that a one percent increase in personal savings will

lead to a reduction in the labor force participation rate of the elderly,

i.e., earlier retirement, in the range 0.052 to 0.060 percent.

     Most of the other variables are statistically significant and have the




from 65 thousand yen in 1960 to 208 thousand yen in 1980. The estimated
reductions obtained from Models I and II are invariant since the estimated
coefficients on social security wealth variables are very insensitive to
the specifications.

expected signs. The estimated positive coefficients on physical assets,
WEALTHI, in both the personal savings and labor force participation

equations indicate the stimulation of personal saving effort for the pur-

pose of obtaining a house and the long mortgage payment which is likely to

postpone an individual's retirement. The retained earnings variable,

RETAIN, has a significantly negative impact on personal savings, suggesting

that an increase in anticipated private retirement pensions provided by

firm results in lower personal savings. The government surplus variable,

GOVTSUR, has a significantly positive effect on personal savings.

      In sum, social security retirement benefits have a negative effect on

personal savings, i.e., the benefit effect, and declining labor force par-

ticipation has a positive effect on personal savings, i.e., the retirement

effect. The benefit effect dominates the retirement effect.12

                               V. Conclusion


     In the debate over social security and savings, the pivotal issue con-

tinues to be whether social security retirement benefits increase or

decrease personal savings. Abundant studies fail to produce consistent

results. Therefore, the effect of social security retirement benefits on

personal savings is still open to question in the United States. This

study adapted and applied the methodology used in U.S. studies to Japanese

data; the social security system in Japan is relatively similar to that of

the United States, but few empirical studies have been done.

     Despite the fact that life-cycle saving and labor supply behaviors are

mutually determined, studies of the effects of social security retirement

benefits on personal savings and retirement decisions often ignore this

'interdependency. This study has examined the interdependency between the

personal savings and labor force participation of elderly men in Japan.

     Using Japanese annual time series data covering the period, from 1946

to 1982, the study shows that social security wealth depresses personal

savings: the effect was approximately a 143 thousand yen reduction per

capita in real term from 1970 to 1980. However, the declining labor force

participation, i.e., expected earlier retirement, stimulates personal

savings, by an estimated 12 thousand yen increase over the same period.

Examination of the estimates shows that the benefit effect dominates the

retirement effect in Japan. In addition, the Study has identified a nega-

tive interdependency between the personal savings and retirement behaviors

of the elderly. That is, an individual saves more before retirement if he
                                   — 18   -




expects to stay a shorter time in the labor market, and vice versa.
     A lack of understanding of the behavioral patterns of personal saving

and retirement of the elderly can lead to inappropriate policies. The eco-

nometric model estimated in this study is of course based on a number of

maintained assumptions, and it would be useful to relax them in future

research. Given more complete information, such as the timing of changes

in social security rules, and data on private pensions, actual estimation

of a model depends on development of much better data than that currently

available. To advance the understanding of the socioeconomic activities of

the elderly, more studies of this type are required in Japan.
