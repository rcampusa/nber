                                           ABSTRACT

The G-8 Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) is the next step of the Highly Indebted Poor
Countries Initiative (HIPC). There are two reasons why MDRI is unlikely to help poor countries.
First, the amount of money at stake is trivial. The roughly $2 billion of annual debt payments to be
relieved under MDRI amounts to roughly 0.01 percent of the GDP of the OECD countries—a mere
one-seventieth (1/70) of the quantity of official development assistance agreed to by world leaders
on at least three separate occasions (1970, 1992, 2002). Second, the existence of debt overhang is
a necessary condition for debt relief to generate economic gains. Since the world's poorest countries
do not suffer from debt overhang, debt relief is unlikely to stimulate their investment and growth.
The principal obstacle to investment and growth in the world’s poorest countries is the fundamental
inadequacy in these countries of the basic institutions that provide the foundation for profitable
economic activity. In light of these facts, the MDRI may amount to a Pyrrhic victory: A symbolic
win for advocates of debt relief that clears the conscience of the rich countries but leaves the real
problems of the poor countries unaddressed.

Introduction

        At the Gleneagles summit in July 2005, the heads of state from the G-8 countries—the

United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, and the United Kingdom—called

on the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, and the African Development Bank

to cancel 100 percent of their debt claims on the world’s poorest countries. Since the G-8

countries provide the lion’s share of the funding for these multilateral lending institutions, the

world’s richest countries have agreed in principle to forgive roughly $55 billion dollars owed by

the world’s poorest nations. The details of the proposal, like what debt forgiveness would or

should mean to the future of these lending institutions, remain to be worked out. The wisdom of

the proposal for debt forgiveness is the subject of this article.

        We begin by considering two earlier episodes of debt relief. In the 1980s, debt relief

under the “Brady Plan” helped to restore investment and growth in a number of middle-income

developing countries. However, the debt relief plan for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries

(HIPC) launched by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in 1996 has had little

impact on either investment or growth in the recipient countries. We will explore the key

differences between the countries targeted by these two debt relief schemes and argue that the

Gleneagles proposal for debt relief is, at best, likely to have little effect at all.

        Debt relief is unlikely to help the world’s poorest countries, because unlike the middle-

income Brady countries, their main economic difficulty is not debt overhang but an absence of

functional economic institutions that provide the foundation for profitable investment and

growth. The Brady countries had functional (if underperforming) economies, viable private

sectors, something for foreign capital to be interested in. The low-income HIPCs, have none of




                                                                                                     1
the above. Counterintuitively, we show that debt relief may be more valuable for Brady-like

middle-income countries than for low-income ones, because of how it leverages the private

sector.



1. When Debt Relief Worked: The Case of Debt Overhang

          Debt relief can promote investment and growth when debt overhang inhibits a country’s

economic performance. A country suffers from debt overhang if it owes more money to its

creditors than it is able to pay (Krugman, 1988). Debt overhang can arise either, because a

country borrows excessively or because a previously manageable stock of debt becomes

intractable due to a change in a country’s circumstances—like a fall in the price of its exports

relative to imports or poor economic management. A country experiencing debt overhang will

be unable to attract new creditors, since lending to such a country would, by the definition of

debt overhang, result in a stream of expected repayments whose present value is less than that of

the loan.

          A country suffering from debt overhang will invest less than it would in the absence of

such an overhang and consequently may forego projects with a positive net present value (Sachs,

1984). Underinvestment occurs because the stock of debt acts as an implicit tax on new

investment. A country’s government raises the resources it needs to service its debt by taxing

firms and households. An increase in the government’s debt increases the private sector’s

expected future tax burden. Because higher taxes divert the benefits of new investment from the

private sector to the existing debt holders, they also reduce the private sector’s incentive to

invest. In summary, a country suffering from debt overhang is unable to service its debt, obtain




                                                                                                    2
new loans, and invest as much as it should.

       Krugman (1989) and Sachs (1989) point to a way out of this inefficient equilibrium, by

showing how both borrower and lenders can gain from debt relief. The logic runs as follows.

When debt is at reasonable levels, the market value of the debt rises one-for-one with its face

value. As the face value of the debt increases beyond a critical threshold, however, debt

overhang ensues. With a rising risk of default and slow economic growth, the market value of

the debt begins to fall—even as its face value continues to rise. In such a country, physical

investment slumps along with the country’s expected future growth rate. The argument for debt

relief runs this sequence of events in reverse. If increasing the face value of the debt of a country

with debt overhang reduces the market value of its debt, then if creditors reduce the face value of

the debt, its market value will rise. For the borrower, debt relief also reduces the implicit tax on

investment and reinstates the incentive for the country to undertake efficient investments and for

new lenders to extend credit.

       But debt relief will not happen without coordination, because any individual creditor

would prefer to maintain the full value of its claims while others write off some debt (Sachs,

1989). A third-party-coordinated debt relief program has the potential to solve this problem by

forcing all creditors to accept some losses, and thereby paving the way for profitable new

lending, investment, and growth (Cline, 1995).

       The theory of debt overhang and efficient debt relief captures the experience of a number

of middle-income developing countries hit by the debt crisis in the 1980s. During the

international commercial bank lending boom from 1970 to 1981, the inflows of financial capital

to these countries exceeded the outflows. Starting in 1982, however, rising interest rates, a




                                                                                                       3
global recession, and poor economic policy choices substantially reduced the expected value of

the banks’ loan portfolios in the debtor countries. As their current and future economic prospects

dimmed, debtors began defaulting, new lending to them ceased, and outflows of financial capital

exceeded inflows for an extended period of time.

       In March of 1989, U.S. Treasury Secretary, Nicholas Brady, initiated a plan under which

16 debtors reached debt-relief agreements with their private creditors. Eleven of the 16 were

middle-income countries in Latin America: Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican

Republic, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The other five countries

were Bulgaria, Jordan, Nigeria, Philippines, and Poland. The commercial banks wrote off a

fraction of the debt owed to them, and the countries agreed to implement major economic

reforms such as reducing inflation and liberalizing trade (details discussed in Cline, 1995).

These plans were announced on a country-by-country basis, starting with Mexico in September

1989 and then continuing throughout the first half of the 1990s. In the twelve months preceding

the signing of its debt-relief agreement, the average Brady country’s stock market appreciated by

60 percent—a $42 billion increase in shareholder value—while there was no significant increase

in the stock market values of a control group of similar countries that did not sign Brady

agreements (Arslanalp and Henry, 2005a).

       Debtor-country stock prices rose, in part, because the market anticipated that debt relief

would restore net capital inflows. Before countries signed their Brady Plan agreement, most of

them had experienced about ten consecutive years in which the outflow of financial resources

exceeded the inflow. After signing their Brady agreement, each of the 16 countries saw an

immediate turnaround in which the inflow of financial resources exceeded the outflow and




                                                                                                    4
continued to do so for the next several years.

           To appreciate the full significance of the change in flows of financial resources, it is

important to distinguish between the direct and indirect effects of debt relief. The direct effect is

that debt relief reduces a country’s debt servicing obligations. The indirect effect is that debt

relief cleans the books and paves the way for new creditors to lend (Summers, 2000). The direct

effect is quantitatively less important. The Brady Plan led to the forgiveness of approximately

$60 billion of debt, but that number is modest in comparison to the $210 billion of cumulative

net capital inflows that the Brady countries received in the five-year period following the official

settlement with their creditors (Arslanalp and Henry, 2005b).

           The resurgence of capital inflows reflects the pithy Dornbusch (1993, p.103) maxim:

“Unresolved debt problems, not debt per se, are an obstacle to investment. It is hard for a man to

establish a relationship with a lender if the estranged wife keeps barging in claiming alimony.”

Indeed, the Brady countries experienced an investment boom in the aftermath of debt relief. The

average annual growth rate of their capital stocks rose by 1.9-percentage-points—from 1.6

percent per year in the five years prior to debt relief, to 3.5 percent per year in the subsequent

five years.1 The data on the growth rate of GDP per capita paint a consistent picture of economic

recovery, rising from an average of 0 to 1.6 percent per year over the same time period. Again, a

control group of countries do not exhibit such an increase in the growth rate of capital and GDP

per capita (Arslanalp and Henry, 2005a). It is also important to note that the increase in GDP

growth can not be accounted for solely by the rise in capital stock growth. Therefore, total factor

productivity may also have increased due to the accompanying economic reforms (Henry, 2003).

2. The Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative

        A follow-up episode of debt relief for a very different set of countries began in 1996. At

that time, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) launched the Heavily

Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative in order to “provide a framework for all creditors,

including multilateral creditors to” begin reducing the debt burden of “the world's poorest and

most heavily indebted countries, and thereby reduce the constraint on economic growth and

poverty reduction” (World Bank, 2004).

        The original HIPC initiative specified that in order to qualify for debt relief a country

must meet two conditions. First it must have a GNP per capita of $695 or less. Second, it must

have a debt burden deemed to be "unsustainable,” which was defined as meaning a ratio of the

net present value of debt to exports in excess of a country-specific threshold of 200 to 250

percent, or for very open economies, a net present value of debt exceeding 280 percent of

government revenue. The debt burden must be unsustainable even after the full use of traditional

debt-relief mechanisms under the Paris Club, which is an informal group of 19 countries that

seek coordinated solutions when a debtor nation finds itself unable to repay (Rieffel, 2003;

<http://www.clubdeparis.org>). In 1996, 41 countries met these criteria; after recalculating debt

sustainability, three countries were added and six subtracted, so that 38 countries are now

involved in the HIPC initiative.2 Table 1 list these 38 countries and provides data that indicate

the depth of their poverty.

        After qualifying for debt relief, the eligible countries needed to produce a track record of

Vietnam, and Yemen were taken out of the group.




                                                                                                           6
reform for three years to reach a “decision point” at which time the creditors arranged a debt

relief package. After no more than three additional years of proven policy implementation,

countries reached their “completion point” and some measure of debt relief transpired.

         Under the original framework, only six countries reached their completion points, a

fraction of their debts were forgiven, and a consensus emerged that the process needed to move

more quickly. Consequently, the G-7 introduced the enhanced HIPC initiative at its fall 1999

meeting in Cologne, Germany. The enhanced initiative reduced the ratios that qualified a

country’s debt burden as unsustainable to 150 percent for net-exports and 250 percent for

government revenue. The second initiative also made it easier for countries to reach a decision

point, allowed them to begin receiving debt relief as soon as they reached the decision point, and

provided greater relief. Under the enhanced HIPC initiative, 16 additional countries began

receiving debt relief in 2000, and six more joined this group by October 2005.3

         From 1996 to 2000, the per capita GDP of the 38 heavily indebted poor countries grew at

1.9 percent per year—a 2.5 percentage point increase over the period from 1980 to 1995. It is

tempting to attribute the increase in growth to the onset of the HIPC initiative in 1996, but more

careful consideration produces at least two reasons to be hesitant about embracing that

conclusion.

         First, since the actual receipt of debt relief, as opposed to the qualifying process, did not

begin until 2000 for most countries, it is not clear that debt relief drove the increase in growth. It

is possible that the announcement of future debt relief in 1996 could have stimulated growth in

advance of implementation, but the data do not support this alternative explanation. The 22

                                                                                                                          7
countries that began receiving debt relief by the year 2000 experienced an almost identical

change in growth as the 16 countries that had not. Turning attention to the post-implementation

period does not change the story much. From 2001 to 2003, the 22 countries grew at 2.2 percent

per year while the group as a whole grew at 2.0 percent per year.

       Second, because the largest increase in growth occurred before the implementation of

debt relief, the reforms required as a precondition may have been the principal cause (Fischer,

Hernández-Catá, and Khan, 1998).

       In spite of the limited evidence that the 1996 HIPC initiative has had an impact on

growth, whether in its original or enhanced form, many argue that more generous debt relief

delivered with greater dispatch would yield better results (Sachs, 2005).



3. The Gleneagles Proposal

       The two previous HIPC debt relief initiatives focused on forgiving some of the debt and

sometimes stretching out the repayment schedule on the remainder. In contrast, the Gleneagles

declaration of June 2005 promises forgiveness of all the debt owed to the three multilaterals. For

the debtor countries involved, the critical number is not the $55 billion stock of debt being

forgiven but the reduction in debt service, which is only $1-$2 billion per year because of the

highly concessional interest rates on the loans. To get a better sense of the economic

significance of the numbers at stake, it is helpful to introduce the concept of the annual net

resource transfer. The net resource transfer to a country is simply its annual net inflow of

capital—gross capital inflows minus gross capital outflows:

(1)      Net Resource Transfer = New Lending + Grants + Portfolio Equity +
         Foreign Direct Investment - Debt Service .



                                                                                                  8
On average, more than 90 percent of all capital inflows to the world’s poorest nations take the

form of new lending, almost all of which goes to the public sector, or grants (also known as aid).

Therefore, in the discussion that follows, we focus on new lending, grants, and debt service.

        Table 2 highlights three central facts about the impact of the Gleneagles debt relief

proposal on the net resource transfers to heavily indebted poor nations. First, the quantity of

money at stake for the developed nations of the world is trivial. The $2 billion of annual debt

payments is equal to roughly 0.01 percent of the GDP of the OECD countries. Replacing the

funds that would have been received by the multilateral development banks would cost about 1

cent for every 100 dollars of OECD GDP—not exactly a budget-busting expense.

        Second, contrary to popular belief, debt service does not cause a net drain of resources

from the group of 38 heavily indebted poor countries. Although capital outflows in the form of

debt service amount to a nontrivial fraction of the GDP of the heavily indebted poor countries—

roughly 3 percent between 2000 and 2005—their gross inflow of capital over the same period of

time was much larger—roughly 15 percent of GDP. In other words, despite their debt servicing

obligations, the heavily indebted poor countries receive more capital than they pay out to their

creditors.

        Third, for the past 30 years rich country governments have made no significant increase

in the net quantity of resources that they transfer to the heavily indebted poor countries. Given

this third fact, it follows from equation (1) that debt relief cannot have a major impact on the

overall magnitude of net resource flows. Debt relief reduces debt servicing, but instead of the

net resource transfer rising when this occurs, grants or new loans tend to fall. In other words,

debt relief in the past has been given instead of, not in addition to, foreign aid. The sum of new



                                                                                                     9
lending and grants to the heavily indebted poor countries increased continually from 1970 to the

mid-1990s. But starting with the onset of the HIPC initiative in 1996, aid flows (i.e., grants) as a

fraction of GDP decreased. Prior to 1996, aid flows amounted to roughly 13.7 percent of GDP in

the heavily indebted poor countries. Since 1996 that figure has dropped to between 9.9 and 11.1

percent. Together, the fall in aid flows and the postponed reduction in debt service has been

associated with a decline in the HIPCs’ net resource transfers (although they are still positive).

         Since its impact on the NRT is minimal, debt relief cannot propel the HIPCs toward

sustained growth and poverty reduction.



4. Debt Overhang vs. Weak Institutions

         Debt relief helped the Brady countries in the 1980s, because it removed an obstacle of

debt overhang that was standing in the way of new lending, investment, and growth.4 However,

the heavily indebted poor countries that were the focus of the 1996 HIPC initiative and now the

Gleneagles declaration do not suffer from debt overhang.

         If debt overhang hinders capital flows to the heavily indebted poor countries, then just as

the Brady countries experienced negative net resource transfers during their bout with debt

overhang, the heavily indebted poor countries should now be experiencing negative net resource

transfers. But this is not the case. In contrast to the Brady countries, net resource transfers to the

heavily indebted poor countries have been positive in recent decades, as shown in Table 2.

Exactly how debt relief will help a set of countries in the midst of an uninterrupted stream of

4
  This is not to say that debt relief solved all of the economic problems of the Brady countries. Starting with Mexico
in 1994 and most recently in Argentina in 2001, a number of Brady countries have encountered severe economic
crises since the Brady plan. Even when debt relief is helpful, it is not a vaccination against future economic
troubles.




                                                                                                                   10
positive net resource transfers since the 1970s is not clear. Presumably, one could argue that

debt relief will make the already positive net resource transfers to these countries even larger.

However, this counterargument ignores the point made earlier that capital inflows such as grants

and new loans do not remain constant when countries receive debt relief.

        Indeed, the potential for efficient debt relief in the presence of debt overhang is

predicated on the incentives and rationale that drive lending by profit-maximizing entities such

as commercial banks, who dominated the lending to the middle-income countries involved in the

Brady plan of the late 1980s and early 1990s. In contrast, official lending, the primary source of

debt for the heavily indebted poor countries, responds to a very different set of considerations.

The principal creditors of the heavily indebted poor countries, multilateral lending institutions

such as the International Development Assistance arm of the World Bank, have a broader

mandate. Part of their mission is to channel funds, through a combination of concessional loans

and grants, to development projects that may yield large social gains in the long run, but are not

immediately profitable (Taylor, 2004). Under the present system, it is unlikely that these

multilateral institutions will respond to debt relief by then making larger future loans, and it is

quite unclear how debt relief from multilateral institutions will affect private lending to these

countries.5

        The underlying issue here is that the private sector investment channel, which plays a

central role in models of debt overhang, is all but absent in the heavily indebted poor countries.


5
  Some argue that the multilateral financial institutions should not lend to poor countries at all, but give grants
instead (Bulow, 2002; Bulow and Rogoff, 1988, 2005; Taylor, 2004). The history of aid programs does not inspire
confidence that they can be conditioned and monitored to achieve their intended goals (Easterly, 2003). But past
failures and current research contain important clues for the design of more effective (and realistic) future aid
endeavors (Besley and Burgess, 2003; Birdsall and Williamson, 2002; Brainard, Graham, Purvis, Radelet and Smith,
2003; Burnside and Dollar, 2000).




                                                                                                                11
In models of debt overhang, remember, the government’s debt burden deters investment because

it imposes an implicit tax on private sector investment. But for debt overhang to deter private

investment, the country must have a private sector with viable investment projects to deter.

       One indication that a country’s private sector has viable projects is that it attracts foreign

capital to fund those projects. The Brady countries and the heavily indebted poor countries show

stark differences on this score. As early as 1974, capital flows to the Brady Countries’ private

sector (private debt + foreign direct investment + portfolio equity) comprised nearly half of their

total net resource flow, but the private sector of the heavily indebted developing countries has

never attracted a significant amount of capital. Capital inflows to the private sector in the

heavily indebted poor countries have accounted for as little as 4 percent of inflows and have

never exceeded 13 percent (Arslanalp and Henry, 2005b).

       Furthermore, the difference between the composition of capital flows to the

predominantly middle-income Brady countries and the heavily indebted poor countries continues

to widen. At the peak of the 1985-89 debt crisis, official grants plus public and publicly

guaranteed debt accounted for 73 percent of the net resource transfer to the Brady countries, but

by 1994, the private sector was the destination for the majority of their net resource flows. No

such shift has taken place in the heavily indebted poor countries that have received debt relief.

In fact, the opposite has occurred—official flows and flows to the public sector have become

more, not less, important. The role of official grants has increased to the point where they now

constitute the majority of net resource flows to the heavily indebted poor countries (Arslanalp

       The resurgence and expansion of the private sector in the Brady countries drove their




                                                                                                    12
post-debt-relief recovery in investment and growth, with foreign capital flows playing a

significant financing role. Since the private sector in the heavily indebted poor countries has

never attracted a quantity or composition of foreign resources comparable to that of the Brady

Countries, it is hard to believe that even complete and immediate debt relief would generate

capital inflows, investment, and growth of any consequential magnitude.

       Recent research about the ways in which legal and financial institutions affect economic

development help explain why private capital does not flow to the heavily indebted poor

countries and, moreover, why it would be unlikely to do so even in the event of complete and

immediate debt forgiveness. Table 3 illustrates a considerable body of research which makes the

point that the quality of institutions that provide the foundation for development is vastly lower

in the heavily indebted poor countries than it is in other nations. The first column of Table 3

refers to the G-7 countries: that is, the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and

the United Kingdom. The second column is the 16 Brady countries, which again were mostly

middle-income countries in Latin America. The third column is the 38 heavily indebted poor

countries. The final column is a so-called Group of Six heavily indebted but not as poor

countries: Indonesia, Pakistan, Colombia, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Turkey. The rows of Table 3

provide various measures of institutional quality.

       The first row of Table 3 compares the institutions of these groups of countries using the

index of economic infrastructure constructed by Hall and Jones (1999). The index ranks 130

countries and attempts to capture the extent to which a country’s economic infrastructure

provides “an environment that supports productive activities and encourages capital

accumulation, skill acquisition, invention and technology transfer.” The rankings cover 130




                                                                                                  13
countries. The median G7 country ranks 14th while the median Brady country 63rd; the median

HIPC comes in a distant 102nd.

       The second row of Table 3 compares economic infrastructure using the Heritage House

Index of Economic Freedom and gives similar results. This index ranks 161 countries and is

based on measures of 10 broad factors of economic freedom including property rights, regulation

and trade policy (http://www.heritage.org/research/features/index/index.cfm).

       La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer and Vishny (1997, 1998, 2002) measure the degree

to which a country’s laws protect the rights of investors by constructing a composite index of

shareholder rights, creditor rights, efficiency of the judicial system, rule of law, and the

accounting system. They find that a country’s measure on this index exerts a significant

influence on its access to external finance. The third row of Table 3 shows that the median

Brady country ranks lower than the median G7 country on the LaPorta et al. index of investor

protection, which runs from 0 to 10. While the median Brady country ranks low, the heavily

indebted poor countries lack sufficient financial development to even merit a ranking. It is

debatable whether the LaPorta et al. index is the most relevant measure of economic

infrastructure for such destitute countries, but it rounds out the central point that the heavily

indebted poor countries rank low on every conceivable metric of the quality of institutions that

affect economic growth (World Bank, 2005).

       Table 3, then, highlights a fact almost too obvious to state, but once stated, whose

implications are unavoidable: Unlike the mostly middle-income Brady countries during the

1980s, the HIPCs principal problem is not debt overhang but an absence of economic

infrastructure—both hard infrastructure like roads and schools, and soft infrastructure like




                                                                                                    14
markets and property rights. Without the crucial foundations for profitable economic activity, it

strains the imagination to believe that even full and immediate debt forgiveness will precipitate

the burst of foreign capital flows, investment, and growth that it did in the Brady countries.

       Ironically, the political and financial resources devoted to securing debt relief for the

HIPCs might be more profitably employed towards a number of countries not being considered

for such programs at all. These include the group of six heavily indebted but not as poor

developing countries—Indonesia, Pakistan, Colombia, Jamaica, Malaysia, and Turkey—whose

economic infrastructures closely resemble those of the Brady Countries.

       The principle of policy targeting states that distortions arising from a market failure

should be tackled with policy instruments that address the failure directly (Bhagwati, 1971;

Dixit, 1994). Both debt overhang and inadequate economic infrastructure produce inefficient

outcomes that result from market failure. However, the nature of the market failure, and

therefore the appropriate policy intervention, differs in each case. Debt relief can be an efficient

policy response to debt overhang, because it forces each lender to internalize the negative

impact—on the borrower and other lenders—of the lender’s refusal to reduce its claims.

       But the HIPCs market failure stems not from lender intransigence, but a failure of

institutions. Their governments fail to provide a rule of law that protects investors, property

rights, and contracts. These same governments fail to provide roads and other physical

infrastructure, in part because of an inability to name and pursue public needs, and in part

because their countries are so poor that their tax base provides too little revenue for such work.

In theory, greater inflows of foreign capital could help both in identifying projects with a large

social payoff and in financing those projects. But as mentioned earlier, debt relief efforts since




                                                                                                     15
1996 have actually accompanied declining net resource transfers. Unless the heavily indebted

poor countries find ways to address their lagging institutional infrastructure, foreign investors

will remain extremely hesitant about committing additional resources to them.



Conclusion

       The main beneficiaries of the Gleneagles debt relief proposal would appear to be the rich

countries who garner good political press at a trivial cost (Rogoff, 2005). Forgiving debt does

not address the fundamental problem of inadequate economic institutions that impedes

investment and growth in the world’s poorest countries. And, to the extent that additional

resources are part of the solution, the indirect approach of debt relief does little, if any, good. In

the past debt relief has had a minimal impact on net resource flows, and there is nothing in the

Gleneagles proposal to suggest that it will be much different. One of the central development

issues of our day is whether the high-income countries of the world will stand ready to help with

real money when the low-income countries demonstrate that they are ready to put the resources

to good use. The danger is that the Gleneagles declaration may amount to a Pyrrhic victory: A

symbolic win for advocates of debt relief that clears the conscience of the rich countries but

leaves the real problems of the poor countries unaddressed.
