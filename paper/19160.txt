We argue that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may not harm China’s
long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital induced by the intergenerational transfer
arrangement under China’s poor-functioning formal social security system. Parents raise their children
and depend on them for support when they reach an advanced age. The decrease in the number of
children prompted by the OCP resulted in parents investing more in their children’s educations to ensure
retirement consumption. In addition, decreased childcare costs strengthen educational investment through
an income effect. Using a calibrated model, a benchmark with the OCP is compared to three counterfactual
experiments without the OCP. The output under the OCP is expected to be about 4 percent higher
than it would be without the OCP in 2025 under moderate estimates. The output gain comes from
a greatly increased educational investment driven by fewer children (11.4 years of schooling rather
than 8.1). Our model sheds new light on the prospects of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing
the OCP’s growth enhancing role through human capital formation under the intergenerational transfer
arrangement.

Abstract

We argue that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may not harm

China’s long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital induced by the

intergenerational transfer arrangement under China’s poor-functioning formal social security

system. Parents raise their children and depend on them for support when they reach an

advanced age. The decrease in the number of children prompted by the OCP resulted in

parents investing more in their children’s educations to ensure retirement consumption. In

addition, decreased childcare costs strengthen educational investment through an income

effect. Using a calibrated model, a benchmark with the OCP is compared to three

counterfactual experiments without the OCP. The output under the OCP is expected to be

about 4 percent higher than it would be without the OCP in 2025 under moderate estimates.

The output gain comes from a greatly increased educational investment driven by fewer

children (11.4 years of schooling rather than 8.1). Our model sheds new light on the prospects

of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing the OCP’s growth enhancing role through human

capital formation under the intergenerational transfer arrangement.

1. Introduction

China’s government introduced the one child policy (OCP) in 1979 with the aim of

controlling rapid population growth. As a result, China experienced a great

demographic transition from high to low rates of fertility and mortality in the

twentieth century (McElroy and Yang, 2000). According to UN world population



                                                                                            2
prospects, there will be an increase in the population of young adults (and its share of

the total population) before the 2020s, a decrease in the childhood population after the

1990s and a continuous increase in the elderly population after 1979. In the

demographic transition, the elderly population is expected to exceed the working-age

population by 2025.1 (See figure 1)

                                  Insert figure 1 here

    How the OCP would affect China’s future growth has become one of most widely

considered questions regarding China’s future growth. We first analyze the

relationship between population and economic growth. There have been debates on

this topic for hundreds of years. In his most influential book, Malthus (1798) asserts

that given limited resources, population growth hampers economic growth. Boserup

(1981) is more optimistic. He argues that population may have a scale effect that is

beneficial to economic growth. The Malthusian model treats technological progress as

exogenous, which has also been challenged in more recent studies. Romer (1986,

1990) and Jones (1999) emphasize that the role of population in economic growth

becomes neutral or even positive when allowing technological progress to be

endogenous. Thus, these theories offer no consensus about the OCP’s impact.

    Other economists have tried to conduct empirical investigations on this topic. Li

and Zhang (2007) show that the birth rate has had a negative influence on economic

growth, also suggesting that the OCP is growth enhancing. Bloom and Williamson

(1998) highlight the role of the working-age population. According to their studies on

East Asia, the OCP would first enhance economic growth through a fast increase in

 In our calibrated model, we define the generational groups as childhood (0-24 years),
young adulthood (25-49 years) and elderly (50 or more years). Typical definitions
place childhood from 0 to 14 years, youth at 15 to 64 years and old age at 65 or more
years, but the trend of China’s demographic transition is robust to different
definitions.

                                                                                       3
the working-age population, which is called a demographic gift. However, this

demographic gift would dissipate with the rising volume of elderly individuals in the

near future, as depicted in Figure 1. The idea of a disappearing demographic gift in

China has become increasingly popular in the past several years, particularly in light

of the labor shortages experienced in some coastal provinces. Cai (2010) and Zhang et

al. (2011) view it as a sign that the Lewis Turning Point has been reached and express

concern over the challenges to China’s future growth.

  We argue that the demographic changes caused by the OCP may not harm China’s

long-term growth as conventionally believed, given parents’ behavior response as

reflected in their children’s educational investment in the OCP under China’s

intergenerational transfer arrangement. Within a poorly functioning formal social

security system, Chinese parents raise their children and depend on them for support

once they have reached an advanced age. Thus, the decrease in the number of children

prompted by the OCP results in parents investing more in their children’s education to

ensure retirement consumption. In addition, the decreased childcare costs strengthen

the educational investment through an income effect. Using a calibrated model, we

compare a benchmark with the OCP to a counterfactual experiment without the OCP.

The model sheds new light on the prospects for China’s long-term growth.

  The framework is a three-period overlapping generation economy under the OCP.

In the model, only the parents work for wage income and they take care of the

children and the elderly. The children depend on their parents for support. As a

reward, the parents then depend on their children upon reaching an elderly state. We

assume that the parents ask for a share of their children’s future wage income in the

internal agreement. The parents make decisions and supply labor to the production

sector. Childcare costs are fixed, so they choose their own consumption and the level


                                                                                     4
of the children’s education. The parents have an incentive to invest in their children’s

education because it can increase their children’s future wage income, which will be

shared by parents who have retired in that period.

     By plugging China’s demographic structure as shaped by the OCP into the model,

we calibrate the main parameters of the model using data from 1975 to 2000.2 We

then conduct three counterfactual experiments without the OCP. Under moderate

estimates, we find that the output in 2025 would decrease by 4.1 percent without the

OCP despite an increase in the working population of 28.2 percent without the policy.

Our model contributes to the literature in several respects. First and most importantly,

it shows that the OCP is growth enhancing in the long term under the

intergenerational transfer arrangement. It is a well-known fact that Chinese parents

depend on their children for retirement consumption under a poorly functioning social

security system (Banejee et al., 2010). However, there has been little attention paid to

the implication for China’s human capital and growth. Unlike other studies, our model

treats children’s education as an investment rather than a consumption good. This

implies that the intergenerational transfer arrangement would urge parents to invest

more in their children’s education with the OCP in effect, which could by and large

offset the adverse effects of the disappearing demographic gift. Our results are

consistent with those of Li and Zhang (2007), which support the neo-Malthusian

school of thought.

     Second, we provide an explanation of Chinese parents’ stronger preference for

more educated children compared to other countries. Li et al. (2008) and Rosenzweig

and Zhang (2009) find that family size has a negative effect for average child

quality(education). This is usually interpreted as a quantity-quality tradeoff originated

    The time period in the model is 25 years.

                                                                                        5
by Becker and Lewis (1973), which assumes that both the number and education of

children can increase parents’ utility. Yet it does not explain why Chinese parents

prefer education to a greater degree than parents from many other countries. We state

that under the intergenerational transfer arrangement, parents share the return of

education investment in children, thus they have a stronger investment incentive to

ensure their retirement consumption when fertility is constrained by the OCP. It also

partly explains the great increase in the education of the Chinese working-age

population since the 1990s.

  Three recent papers are most related to our study, and our study supplements the

literature. Liao (2012) uses a calibrated general equilibrium model and finds that the

OCP promotes human capital and increase per capita output. In her model, the

incentives for investing in children’s education come from the price effect (general

equilibrium) and parents’ preference (quantity-quality tradeoff). Wei and Zhang (2011)

study the competitive saving motive (for a son’s relative attractiveness in the marriage

market) created by the rising sex ratio caused by the OCP. They show that the

competitive saving motive explains much of China’s high savings rate. Neither of

these studies takes the intergenerational transfer into account. Banejee et al. (2010)

notes the popularity of parents’ dependence on their children and introduces it into a

life cycle model to explain Chinese households’ savings behavior. Their focus is on

the OCP’s impact on savings, however, and they do not consider its influence on

education or the long-term growth effects.

  The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we provide some

background. We summarize the OCP and its impact on demographic structure and

provide evidence of parents’ dependence on their children. In Section 3 we describe

the model. In Section 4 we discuss the calibration. The experiments and results are

provided in Section 5 and Section 6 concludes the paper.


2. Background

1. The One Child Policy and China’s Demographic Structure

China’s OCP was formally introduced as a family planning policy that was introduced

in 1978 and initially applied to first-born children beginning in 1979. It officially

restricted married urban couples to having only one child, while allowing exemptions

in several cases including twins, ethnic minorities, rural couples and parents without

any siblings themselves. It was created by the government to alleviate economic,

social and environmental problems in China.

    The policy has been strongly enforced mainly through fines that are imposed based

on family income and other factors3, but the implementation varies from location to

location. As mentioned above, the majority of provinces now permit two parents who

were only children themselves to have two children. All non-Han ethnic groups are

usually allowed to have two or more children. Han Chinese living in rural areas are

also permitted to have two children if their first child is female.

After the introduction of the OCP, the fertility rate in China fell from 2.63 births per

woman in 1980 to 1.61 in 2009. According to authorities’ claims, the policy has

prevented about 400 million births in 30 years4, which proved the policy to be

remarkably effective. There has been some debate regarding whether there had

already been a sharp reduction in the fertility rate in the early 1970s (five births per

woman) in China. Thus, the policy is probably only partially responsible for the

reduction. However, it has played an important role in shaping China’s demographic

structure since the end of the 1970s.

                                  Insert figure 2 here

    As figure 2 shows, the proportion of the group aged 24 years and below in the total

population has declined since 1975, from 58.42% in 1975 to 40.53% in 2000.

According to the medium estimates of the world population prospects5, this trend will

continue, declining to 26.80% in 2025, and 21.42% in 2050. Meanwhile, the

proportion of the group aged 49 years and above has continued to increase since 1975,

from 27.48% in 1975 to 38.02% in 2010. It is expected to reach 52.01% in 2050. This

demographic structure has strong implications for China’s future growth.


2. Intergenerational Transfer Arrangement

There is a widely held belief that Chinese parents view their children as a form of

pension for when they are elderly. Although China has made a great deal of effort in

pension reform, Herd, Hu and Koen (2010) point out that under current rules,

effective replacement rates are fairly low and projected to decline further, both for

rural and urban residents, which may be difficult to sustain with the elderly living

increasingly less frequently with their descendants. Furthermore, as the countryside

ages, the problems can become even worse.

    A recent survey in China confirms the inefficiency of the pension system. Until

2010, only 24.1% of the elderly relied mainly on a pension while 40.7% depended on

projection variants are produced. We use the medium fertility projection variant. For

their family members for support.6 Using data from the China Household Retirement

Longitudinal Survey (CHRLS), Benerjee et al. (2010) find that as expected, more than

half of the surveyed elderly live with their children and parents are more likely to live

with their children if one of the parents is in poor health, which is consistent with the

belief that children take care of their parents when the latter are elderly. The

advantage of having many children is consistent with the observation that the fraction

of parents living with at least one adult child increases from 56% for parents with

only one child to over 70% for those with seven or eight children.7


3. Educational Transformation

While the educational status of the working-age population has continued to rise in

the past six decades, its structure has undergone major change since the 1990s. Figure

3 shows the average years of primary, secondary and tertiary schooling for the

working-age population based on Barro and Lee (2010). It is clear that tertiary

education gains much higher growth and contributes most to the rise in educational

attainment in the past two decades. This is also documented in Li et al. (2011).

Furthermore, China still exhibits great potential in increasing their human capital

compared to the US, especially in tertiary education (see figure 4).

                               Insert figure 3 and 4 here

    As the World Bank (2012) reports, hundreds of millions of unskilled Chinese

workers joined the global labor force as part of China’s “opening up” strategy in the

1980s and 1990s. Now, tens of millions of tertiary-educated Chinese workers will join

the global workforce to significantly expand the global supply of skill-intensive

products. The number of college graduates could swell by 200 million over the next

two decades—more than the entire labor force of the United States.


3. The Model

We imagine a simple life cycle divided into three periods: childhood, young

adulthood (parents), and old adulthood (retired). It is assumed that children will not

work, but rather that they will depend on their parents for support, including

subsistence consumption (childcare costs) and educational investment. As a reward,

they agree to provide part of their future wage income to their parents’ retirement

consumption when they enter the workforce in the next period.

    The parents supply labor to gain wage income and make decisions. They are

responsible for their children’s subsistence consumption and for their parents’

retirement consumption. They independently choose their own consumption and their

children’s educational investment. Educational investment costs money, but will

increase children’s wage in the next period. We assume that fertility is exogenously

determined under the OCP. That is, parents take the number of children as given.


1. The Basic Model

Define Ltz  etz as the population and educational attainment of generation z , when

z  c y o represents children, young adults and old adults. The survival rate of

children and the life expectancy of old adults might change over time, so we allow

Lct  Lty1  Lot  2  This is easy to check using Table 1.8 We assume that the education


8
 Because our period is 25 years, the quantity of survival rate and life expectancy is a
little different compared to the regular concept.

                                                                                          10
level remains constant as children grow up into young adults, i.e. etc  ety1 

  The lifetime utility function of young adults at t is U  cty  cto1  , where ctz is

generation z ’s consumption in period t . We do not add childhood’s subsistence

consumption here, because it is assumed to be the same for everyone and provided by

parents. We also assume that neither children’s nor their own education level enters

an agent’s utility function. It is not uncommon for children’s education to enter the

parents’ preference, given Becker and Lewis (1973), but here we ignore it to focus on

the effect of intergenerational transfers.

  We assume a constant return to scale (CRS) Cobb-Douglas production function:

                                                             1

                                          At Kt  Lty exp( ety )          

where output is determined by technology At  capital stock K t and human capital

H ty . For human capital, we follow the growth literature (e.g. Hall and Jones, 1999;

Bils and Klenow, 2000) by setting H ty  Lty exp( ety ) . This specification is consistent

with the common Mincer (1974) equation, which implies that the log of the

individual’s wage is linearly related to that individual’s years of schooling. It could

also be interpreted that an additional year of schooling raises a worker’s efficiency

proportionally by  . Choosing the exponential form could allow us to draw on the

large volume of micro evidence on  to quantify the impact of schooling on human

capital and growth.

  Assume that capital accumulation and technology progress are exogenous, and the

only income that a young adult earns is his wage income wt Lty  1    Yt  As

discussed above, a young adult would support their retired parents and children. To

simplify the model, we assume that they would share a fixed proportion of their wage

                                                                                          11
income (  ) with their parents and pay a constant childcare cost ( c sub ) for each of

their children. The remaining part is allocated between their own consumption and the

children’s educational investment. We assume that the educational cost for each

child’s additional years of schooling is pt , and parents make an equal investment for

each child.

  Thus, the young adults maximize utility subject to the budget constraint.

increase with the opportunity cost (wage) of schooling because in reality, tuition rises

with the level of education.

  Parents’ dependence on children for retirement consumption does influence

children’s education. When  (proportion of shared wage income) increases,

children’s educational level increases.


2. The OCP’s Impact on Education and Growth

Now consider the impact of the OCP. From the budget constraint (1) and first-order

condition (2), it is clear that under stationary population growth ( Lct  Lty  Lot ), the

educational investment would also be stationary. The enforcement of the OCP

decreases the number of Lct , which have two channels through which to affect

children’s education: (1) income effect. That is, there would be fewer mouths to feed

(the childcare cost, Lct c sub , decreases) and the parents’ real income increases; (2)

substitution effect. That is, with fewer children, the parents would increase their

children’s educational investment to ensure shared wage income during retirement.

This is a materialistic motive for the well-known quantity-quality tradeoff.

  For simplicity, the changes of technology, capital, cost of education and childcare,




                                                                                                                              13
survival rate are assumed to be constant. Then it is easy to show that9

Proposition 1. When   At  K t  pt  c sub   t 1 remain constant, the enforcement of the

OCP (1) increases each child’s educational level, and (2) even increases output.

     It is a little surprising that the output would increase under the OCP. Why the

response in the human capital can over compensate? Intuitively, this is caused by the

income effect (higher real income and less childcare cost) besides the substitution

effect (quantity-quality trade-off). Thus, the dependence on children will make

parents make strong response to the demographic change caused by the OCP, which

will offset the negative effect on economic output caused by a decreasing labor force.

The proposition has strong implications for China’s long-term growth. It predicts an

relatively optimistic future.

     Proposition 1 depends on the assumption that parameter in tuition cost, pt , is

constant. In reality, pt might increase very fast when the educational attainment

reaches a certain level. In that case, OCP’s impact on growth could turn to be

moderate or even negative. However, since China’s current educational attainment is

relatively low compared to the developed countries, the positive impact could still

dominate in the near future.


3. Discussion of the Model

Sharing Rule

We assume a linear sharing rule on wage income to describe the intergenerational

transfer arrangement between young adults and their retired parents. Although we

think it reasonable based on what happens in China, there could be alternative

choices.

9
    Proof is provided in Appendix.

                                                                                           14
     One alternative is a linear sharing rule on wage. That is, young adults promise the

elderly an average retirement consumption of  wt .(replacement ratio) The model

becomes

                                max  U  cty  cto1  
                                 y c

     This model is similar to our basic model when population growth is stationary




    Lty1  Lot 1  . However, the enforcement of the OCP will make Lct  Lty . Thus, it has

the advantage of underlining the burden of the increasing elderly population caused

by the OCP. When the elderly population increases, education will increase reflecting

its high return.

     Another alternative is that young adults promise a fixed amount of retirement

consumption  c old  for each parent. The model becomes


                          max  U  cty  cto1  
                           ct  et
                           y c


                                                                                                 1

                          cto1  c old Lot 

     In this case, the young adults would have no incentive to invest in children’s

education because their retirement consumption is ensured. This model makes sense if

we apply some revisions and let children make decisions on their consumption and

education and pay back their education costs as a loan to parents. The elderly’s

retirement consumption seems like a lump sum tax to them, which would give them

more incentive to gain a higher education. We assume that the parents determine

children’s investment.

Educational Credit Constraints

We assume that households face a credit constraint on educational investment, such

                                                                                                                       15
that parents must cover all of the costs in the current period. While credit for

education in China has grown in recent years, it still amounts to a small fraction. Most

children’s tuitions and other educational costs are paid by their parents.

Incentive for Educational Investment

The standard model of human capital investments, such as that provided by

Ben-Porath (1967), assumes that the individual chooses the investment (in terms of

time) under perfect capital market conditions, and that the only margin of choice is

between market work and schooling. Bils and Klenow (2000) use it to examine the

relationship between schooling and growth.

  Things are different in China. Parents typically make decisions about children’s

educational investment under binding credit constraints. Parents invest in their

children, partially from altruistic parental love and partially in the interest of an

ensured retirement consumption. It is difficult to differentiate one from the other but

due to China’s poor social security system, the latter could be more important, so we

emphasize it.

Measurement of Human Capital

There are various approaches to measuring human capital in the literature. Mankiw et

al. (1992) assume a human capital production technology identical to that of physical

capital and use the proportion of the adult population enrolled in secondary school as

a proxy for human capital investment. However, the school enrollment does not

adequately      measure   the           aggregate        stock    of   human     capital   available

contemporaneously as an input in production. It seems inappropriate to use it as a

stock variable.

  More recent studies (e.g. Hall and Jones, 1999; Bils and Klenow, 2000) define

                                  eiy 
human capital as H iy  exp             
                                              Liy , where    reflects the efficiency of a unit of


                                                                                                   16
labor with eiy years of schooling relative to one with no schooling (   0   0 ). The

derivative    eiy  is the return to schooling estimated in a Mincerian wage

regression (Mincer, 1974).

  We take the more recent approach to measure human capital because it ensures that

our estimates of human capital are consistent with the private return to schooling seen

in the micro data. Our definition is similar to that of Young (2003) and Wang and Yao

(2003) in that it takes both the quantity and the quality of the labor force into

consideration.


4. Calibration

1. Data and Measurement Issues

In our model, a period is 25 years. To account for the effect of the OCP, we must

cover the periods both before and after its enforcement. The model is calibrated to

Chinese data from 1975 to 2000. In 1975, the OCP had not yet been introduced. In

2000, the OCP’s impact on demographic structure emerges. The main parameters can

be calibrated based on the two periods. To explore the effect of the OCP, we compare

it to a counterfactual experiment without the OCP. We also discuss the model’s

implication for China’s long-term growth in 2025 and 2050.

Demographic Structure

Our data cover three periods (1975, 2000, 2025) of China’s demographic structure

gathered from World Population Prospects: The 2010 Revision (United Nations,

Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division, 2011), which

provides detailed population distribution by 5-year age groups in 5-year intervals

(1950-2010). It also gives the population prospects from 2010 to 2100. We define


                                                                                      17
children as aged 24 years and below, young adults as aged 25 to 49 years and the

elderly as aged 50 years and above. The results are in Table 1. For 2025, we use the

estimated population under medium-fertility variant.

Physical Capital Stock

Many papers have reported estimates of the capital stock in the course of estimating

productivity growth in China (e.g. Chow and Li, 2002; Huang et al., 2002; Young,

2003). The estimates of Bai et al. (2006) regarding the capital stock in China differ

from these earlier estimates in two principal ways. First, they make use of the updated

data reported by China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) after the 2004 census.

Second, they calculate the capital stock in market prices rather than in constant

prices.10 We follow the method of Bai et al. (2006) and use their updated estimates of

the capital stock. We take 1978 as the base year to generate real capital stock.

Human Capital Stock

In our model, human capital is measured as a function of years of schooling and

current labor force. The current labor force is the population aged 25 to 49 years in

the current period. The data on years of schooling are calculated from Barro and Lee

(2000, 2010). Their estimation procedure is a perpetual inventory method that uses the

census/survey observations on attainment as benchmark stocks and new school

entrants as flows that are added to the stocks with an appropriate time lag. They

provide a detailed data set on educational attainment by 5-year age groups over 5-year

intervals (1950-2010). Using their data, we construct the number of years of schooling

for aged 25 to 49, ety , as

                                                    5

base year to generate real GDP.

                                                                                                                                   19

         growth in 2000-2025 keep the same as 1975-2000, we calibrate p2000 to fit

         the model.

         3.     (Cases I, II and III) We then conduct three counterfactual experiments

         based on three different estimates (from high to low) of the OCP’s impact on

         China’s demographic structure. We use the calibrated model to simulate the

         possible impact of the OCP on education and output under these

         counterfactual scenarios.

     Step I corresponds to the period before the OCP, which is calibrated to show how

the model fits the data. It captures a prior belief. Step II provides the basic benchmark

under the OCP. Step III conducts three counterfactual experiments to evaluate the

impact of the OCP on educational output, based on the three estimates of

counterfactual demographic structure.

     Note that this study focuses on how OCP’s impact under different scenarios

                                              y
designed in Step III. Although the number of e2025 in step II is set by a linear

prediction here, it won’t change our main results.


3. The Three Estimates of Demographic Structure

There is no consensus on the OCP’s influence over China’s demographic structure.

The official claim is that the OCP prevented 400 million births in China from 1978 to

2008. Although this is often cited by the government, it is hotly debated. A common

critique is that the fertility rate usually decreases when an economy grows, according


12
 We get the number by assuming the young adults’ years of schooling grows from
2000 to 2025 at the same speed as from 1975 to 2000.

                                                                                       20
to the experiences of other industrialized countries. Thus, the effect could be

exaggerated. Thus, we take the officially reported number as a high estimate and also

consider moderate and low estimates (200 and 100 million). The estimates are

adjusted according to the time period for our model. 13 The three estimates are

presented in Table 3.


4. Parameters

Table 2 summarizes the parameters in the calibration. Following Liao (2012), we

choose a CRRA preference with a risk-aversion parameter of   05 and the

subjective discount factor   09557 . It is also assumed that these preference

parameters are constant over time.

     For the technology parameter, we first take K from Bai et al. (2010). Because the

labor share has been approximated at 50 percent in China (Wang and Yao , 2003;

Brandt and Zhu, 2010), we set   05 . According to Heckman and Li (2004) and

Zhang et al. (2005), the return to years of schooling is about 10-11 percent for the late

twentieth century in China. We then set   010 .

     The other parameters of exogenous driving force include c sub    p The average

cost of rasing a child (excluding education costs) is 22.7 percent of a family’s income,

which follows Liao’s (2012) calculations based on Ye and Ding’s (1998) survey.14 So

c sub is calculated from our data on family income and the childhood population. We


13
  Take the high estimate for example. Because our period is 1975-2000, we compute
the population aged 24 and below as Lc2000n  Lc2000  400000  22  30 We also
project it into 2025 as population aged 25-49, using a same survival rate as the rate
under the OCP.
14
   Ye and Ding (1998) compare the cost of child care in Xiamen to that in Beijing. In
Xiamen, a child’s care cost about 29 percent of a family’s annual income in 1995. The
percentage was 16.4 percent in Beijing. Thus, the average cost of child care is 22.7
percent.

                                                                                       21
set the share of young adults’ wage income transferred to their elderly parents as

  015 .

  The parameter for educational cost p is calibrated as discussed in the calibration

strategy.


5. The Effects of the OCP

1. Results for 1975

Table 4 shows the calibration results for each generation’s expenditure (consumption

and education) in 1975. The data in the first row give the share of expenditure by each

group while those in the second row give the total expenditure and those in the third

row give per capita expenditure. We set the parameters of the share of expenditure on

child care and retired adults as 23 and 15 percent, respectively.

  The young adults would spend 30 percent on their own consumption and 32 percent

on their children’s educational investment. The average consumption of young adults

and retired adults is close. These results provide confidence for our further analysis.


2. The OCP’s Influence: Three Counterfactual Experiments

Panel (a) of Table 5 shows the calibration results of each generation’s expenditures

(consumption and education) in 2000. If we believe that the young adults’ years of

schooling reach 11.4 in 2025, then the output becomes 207,788.15. Thus, the growth

rate could reach 8.4 percent from 2000 to 2025, whereas it remains at 7.0 percent

from 2010 to 2025. The young adults would spend 33 percent on their own

consumption and 29 percent on their children’s education.

  We then turn to our main results on the OCP’s influence by conducting three

counterfactual experiments assuming that there was no OCP in 1978.

                                                                                          22
  Under high estimates (Case I shown in Panel (b)), which assume that the number of

children increases by 56.4 percent without the OCP, the young adults’ years of

schooling would decrease to 5.12 in 2025. The young adults would spend 25 percent

of their income on their own consumption and 24 percent on their children’s

education. As a contrast, they must spend 35 percent of their income on child care

because there are many more children to feed.

  Under moderate estimates (Case II shown in Panel (c)), which assume that the

number of children increases by 28.2 percent without the OCP, the young adults’

years of schooling would decrease less, reaching 8.07. The young adults would spend

29 percent of their income on their own consumption and 27 percent on their

children’s education. The child care costs would decrease to 29 percent because the

number of children would not be as big as in Case I.

  Under low estimates (Case III shown in Panel (d)), which assume that the number

of children increases by 28.2 percent without the OCP, the young adults’ years of

schooling would decrease to 9.67, which would be higher than in Case II. The young

adults would spend 31 percent of their income on their own consumption and 28

percent on their children’s education. The child care costs would decrease to 26

percent.

  Taken together, the results indicate that young adults will increase the investment

in their children’s education when the OCP comes into effect. To ensure their

retirement consumption, the more strictly the policy is implemented, the fewer

children young adults will have and the more they will invest in their children’s

education. The behavioral response of substituting quantity with quality (education)

will offset the OCP’s negative influence on output. Because the presence of fewer

children substantially reduces the child care costs, the output under the OCP will be



                                                                                   23
higher than that without the OCP due to the income effect. Taking moderate estimates

as an example, the output would be 199153.50 without the OCP, which is 4.2 percent

lower than the output under the OCP.


6. Conclusion

We claim that the demographic changes caused by the one child policy (OCP) may

not harm China’s long-term growth. This attributes to the higher human capital

induced by the intergenerational transfer arrangement under China’s poor social

security system. Parents raise their children and depend on them for support once they

have reached an advanced age. Thus, the decrease in the number of children prompted

by the OCP results in the parents investing more in their children’s education to

ensure their retirement consumption. In addition, the decreased child care costs

strengthen the educational investment through the income effect. Our numerical

simulation proves these insights. Using a calibrated model, we compare a benchmark

with the OCP to three counterfactual scenarios without the OCP. The output under the

OCP is about 4 percent higher than without the OCP in 2025 under moderate

estimates. The output gain comes from the greatly increased educational investment in

fewer children (years of schooling 11.4 rather than 8.1). Our model sheds new light

on the prospects of China’s long-term growth by emphasizing the OCP’s growth

enhancing role through human capital under the intergenerational transfer

arrangement, which also provides a motive for the popular quantity-quality tradeoff

theory.

  Human capital could still play an important role in China. We assume that the

average years of schooling will reach 11.4 in 2025. Compared to 13.4 years of

schooling in the US in 2010, there is still some potential for China to maintain its high


                                                                                       24
growth in the future. Thus, we think that the disappearing demographic gift will not

hurt China’s growth in the next several decades.

(1) Assume that etc decreases when Lct decreases. Then in the left part of the

equation the numerator increases while the denominator decreases. This contradicts

the constant in the right part.

(2) Assume that exp   etc  Lct decreases (with an increased etc ) when Lct decreases.

Then, in the left part of the equation the numerator increases while the denominator
