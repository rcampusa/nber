          THE EFFECTS OF HUMAN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DECISIONS ON SHAREHOLDER VALUE


                                             AESTR/sCT

     We examine the effects of selected human resource management     decisions   on the

abnormal change in total shareholder return. Announcements of human resource decisions

are classified into five types--general HR system announcements, compensation and

benefits, staffing, shutdowns and relocations, and miscellaneous. Using an event study

methodology we investigate whether any of these HR decisions had a discernible effect on

either the level or variation of abnormal total shareholder return. We find no consistent

pattern of increased or decreased valuation in response to the different types      of   HR

announcements, even after controlling for the likely effect of such announcements on total

compensation costs. We do find substantially increased variation in abnormal total

shareholder return around the announcement date, which indicates that HR decisions do

provide information to the stock market. The events associated with increased variation

in total shareholder value are permanent staff reductions and shutdown/relocations. The

absence of consistent valuation effects combined with the evidence of increased variation

in shareholder value may be attributed to uncontrolled firm-specific factors, the

categorization of the HR events or, simply, to the unique interpretations the market

placed upon these events.

      The relation between human resource decisions and organizational performance is a

central issue in the study of managerial decision-making. Despite the considerable

attention given to the increased importance of effective human resource management by

professionals and academics      substantially fewer studies have focused on the effects of

human resource management decisions on organization performance than on the determinants

of the HR decisions themselves. (Dyer and Holder, 1988; Schuler, 1987; Kleiner cC p1.,

1987; Ulrich, 1987). Part of the explanation for the relative scarcity of this type of

research may be the absence of well-developed theories, other than the price-theoretic

models that emphasize the relation between unit compensation costs and employment, that

relate strategic HR decisions to medium and long-ten corporate outcomes. In addition,

less attention has been devoted to creating a taxonomy of the relevant HR strategies that

might be used to measure the effects of alternative decisions on organizational

performance.

      The most common organizational performance outcomes considered are employee

behaviors and attitudes. Studies of the effects of alternative gainsharing plans on

employee suggestions, performance, and satisfaction (Schuster, 1983, 1984; Bullock and

Lawler, 1984), the effects of merit pay on performance and satisfaction (Pearce and Perry,

1983, Heneman, 1984), and flexible work schedules on attendance, absenteeism, and

satisfsction (Gannon, Norland and Robeson, 1983) are all examples. Other research argues

that the perceptions of multiple organizational stakeholders (stockholders, employees,

managers, and regulatory agencies) regarding the constituents of HR activities are the

relevant outcomes (Tsui, 1987). This type of analysis has been conducted using a variety

of HR related indices as measures of performance (Fitz-enz, 1984). The indices include

productivity estimates (for example, the ratio of sales revenue to total employee salaries

 and the ratio of production volume to labor use), and staffing rates, (for example,

 turnover rates, promotion rates, and offer/hire rates). A series of studies have applied

 cost-benefit analysis to some of these indices (Boudreau. 1987, in press; Cascio, 1987;

 Alexander and Barrick, 1987).




                                                3
      Other authors have examined the relation of HR decisions to the economic performance

of organizations. Economic performance has been defined using accounting measures (for

example, net income, return on assets, and return on equity) and using financial market

measures of shareholder wealth (holding period dividends plus capital gains). Studies in

this genre Include the effects of new collective bargaining agreements (Abowd, 1989),

concession bargaining (Becker, 1987). strikes (Neumann, 1980; Becker and Olson, 1986 and

Tracy 1987, 1988), executive compensation (Baker. Jensen and Murphy, 1988; Brickley,

Bhagat and Lease, 1985; Tebranian and Uaegeleln, 1985; Gomez-Mejia, Tosi and Hinkin,

1987), and executive succession (Reinganum, 1985; Etebart, Horrigan and Landwehr, 1987;

Lubatkin, Chung, Rogers and Owers, 1989).

      To summarize, the relation between human resource decisions and organizational

performance appears to have focused most on immediate outcomes (behaviors and attitudes)

less on intermediate outcomes (accounting measures, financial health, and economic

outcomes), and hardly at all on ultimate outcomes like survival (Thorndike, 1949). It may

be, of course, that HR decisions operate directly upon the immediate outcomes and only

indirectly on the intermediate economic and ultimate survivability outcomes.

      This study attempts to analyze the effects of HR decisions on shareholder wealth.

Ve do so recognizing that stock market measures of firm   performance   may   have   too much

"noise" in many situations to permit detection of the direct effects of HR policies and

practices. However, recent evidence documenting the direct effects of labor relations

events on the shareholder value of the firm suggests that similar effects may be found for

other HR decisions (Abowd, 1989; Becker and Olson, 1987; Ruback and Zimmerman 1984; and

Tracy. 1988). An important feature of these studies is that the authors use an economic

model of the information content of the HR announcement. This model predicts which

announcements should be associated with increased shareholder wealth (events associated

with unexpected decreases in total compensation or increases in profitability) and which

announcements should be associated with decreased shareholder wealth (events associated

with unexpected increases in total compensation or decreases in profitability). These

studies focused on specific types of HR management events (primarily contract negotiations


                                            4
and strikes) and used models appropriate for these events. We have no general model that

can classify HR events by their expected effects on shareholder wealth. Consequently, we

use conventional event study methods in an effort to detect (1) any significant direct

effects of HR announcements on shareholder wealth and (2) any evidence that market

reactions of unpredictable direction occur.

      Section I summarizes the use of event study methods to study HR decisions. Section

II describes our specific methods for classifying HR events. Section III lays out the

results. Section IV concludes.

I. Assessing HR Decision Effects Using the Event Study Methodology

     We use the event study methodology developed in accounting and finance (Ball and

Brown. 1968; Beaver, 1968; Fama. Fisher. Jensen and Roll, 1969) and applied in the recent

labor relations studies cited above. The basic premise of the event study is that capital

markets react immediately to new information that materially affects the future

profitability of the firm. An event is an announcement by the firm or an action in the

marketplace that conveys incremental information to stock market participants allowing

them to revise prior expectations regarding the prospects of a corporation or identifiable

group of corporations (Patell, 1976). The efficient markets hypothesis implies that this

new information will rapidly diffuse throughout the market, and some market participants

will act on the information in a manner that changes the value of shareholders' wealth to

reflect the consequences of the new information. A change in either the expected future

cash flows or the riskiness of a firm's stock, which will affect the discount rate used to

reduce cash flows to present value, will result in a change in the price of the firm's

common stock. If the change in expected cash flows or riskiness is expected to be

advantageous, the price of the stock will rise. If the change in expected cash flows or

riskiness is expected to be harmful, the price of the stock will decline. Depending on

the firm's capital structure, shareholder value may be equated with the total value of the

firm or it may constitute some portion of total firm value. Regardless of the firm's

capital structure, the event study methodology defines firm performance in terms of

chanees in shareholder value, which is generally called total shareholder return.


                                              S
The Event Study Structure
      Although   event studies usa many different techniques, they Involve five general

steps (see Bowman, 1983; Brown and Warner, 1980 1985; and Schwert 1981). The steps are:

      (1)   Identify the events of interest,

      (2)   Model the normal (expected) total shareholder returns,

      (3)   Estimate the abnormal (unexpected) total shareholder returns.

      (4)   organize and group the abnormal returns according to event type, and

      (5)   Analyze summary measures for abnormal returns by event type.

      The event of interest may be a single action affecting a group of firms

simultaneously, such as a new regulatory agency announcement, or an action affecting

different firms at various times, such as numerous firms making layoff announcements. The

most critical component of the event measurement is the determination of the time that the

public first learned that the event occurred (see Brown and Warner 1980, 1985). This date

is called the event date. The importance of correctly ascertaining the event date stems

from a property of stock returns implied by the efficient markets hypothesis and

empirically valid for total shareholder returns of firma with active capital

markets- - stock returns are neither serially correlated nor serially cross-correlated.

Hence, on any given date a sample of abnormal returns has a zero mean. Further, a sample

of cumulative abnormal returns (the sum of abnormal returns over a specified time

interval) also has a zero mean. When abnormal returns and cumulative abnormal returns are

computed for a group of firms that experienced a similar event, using the event date as

the reference point, the average abnormal return for the group has a positive (negative)

mean if the event is associated with the arrival of favorable (unfavorable) information on

the market. Similar arguments hold for the cumulative abnormal return over a time

interval that includes the event date. Other influences on total shareholder return are

effectively controlled by the statistical properties cited above. When the direction of

the effect cannot be predicted ax ante, the variance of abnormal returns and cumulative

abnormal returns is greater on and around the event date than for a reference period

before or after that date.


                                               6
     The estimation of the expected return is accomplished by statistical modeling of the

relation between total shareholder return over a given holding period (typically one day

or one month) with the total shareholder return for the same holding period arising from

the capital market, a diversified portfolio of common stocks (typically a broad-based

portfolio of common stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange). The abnormal return is

computed as the difference between the holding period total shareholder return and its

estimated expected value, given the return on the market. The abnormal, or unexpected.

return is computed for the reference period used to estimate the expected return model

(typically 250 days for daily returns and 5 years for monthly returns) and an event period

surrounding the event date (typically 21 days for daily returns and seven months for

monthly returns).

      Formally, in our study the abnormal return was calculated using the following

definitions (for daily return data):

          —    (D +          -

          — dividend per share over day t for security i
          —   price     (ex dividend) of security i at the end of day t

      R— Cj+            £IR_,t+ARLt
      where
          —    return   on the market portfolio for day t;

      c and ft —      estimated   intercept and slope for security i; and

              — abnormal return for security i on day t.

      The price per share has been adjusted to reflect the effects of stock splits and

stock dividends over the period t-l to t. The return on the market portfolio is measured

by the percentage New York Stock Exchange value weighted portfolio including dividends

(Center for Research in Security Prices, 1987). The estimated abnormal return (the

residual from the estimated expected return model) was calculated as:

              AR —          -(+      Li

The intercept and elope of the expected return model were estimated over a 253 day period

during the calendar year preceding the event date (called the estimation period). The


                                                   7
same intercept and slope were used to calculate abnormal returns in the period surrounding

the event date (called the event period). Abnormal returns have a zero mean over the

estimation period because of the properties of ordinary least squares, the technique used

for estimation.

         The abnormal returns were grouped according to a classification system developed for

the HR events. Statistics, based on the abnormal returns, were computed for the event

period, generally 5 days- -2 days before the event, the event day and 2 days after the

event. Hence, when daily returns are used:              t —   0 for the event day; the day before the

announcement is t —       -1;   and the day after the announcement is t — 1.       Abnormal returns

were grouped by event type and day relative to the event day (t). and then averaged across

firms. The average abnormal return for a day t is defined as:

                                  N
                     AAR —        E AR/N
                                 i—i

where AR — abnormal         return for firm i on event day t and N — number of events in the

group.

         Average cumulative abnormal returns (average CAR's) were also computed for the event

period and an eight day period preceding t —            -2 (see Fama et al. . 1969).   The formula used

was:



                     CARt — E          AAR
                                t—tl

where I is the relevant event group and t1 and t are the beginning and ending day of the

period.

         To estimate changes in the variance of abnormal returns, we calculated variance

ratio statistics based on the five day event period and the 253 day estimation period.

The statistic F1 was calculated according to the formula:

                                   2
                                   E AR1J5
                            —
                                  t—-2
                     F1
                                             2
                                   E AR/25l
                                  t—ti


                                                    8
where the period t1    to   t2   delimit,   the estimation period. The numerator was divided by S

(instead of 4) because the average abnormal return was not different from zero (and

therefore was not estimated). The           denominator     is divided by 251 (or some number   less   than

251) to reflect the number of actual trading days used in the estimation of the expected

return regression for company I (less two          to   account for the estimation of m     and ).

II.   Methodology for HR Events

Definitions

        Previous HR based event studies have evaluated the effects of one specific type of

event (for example, wage settlements or executive compensation plans) on shareholder

value, in this study, we examine a broad range of human               resource   decisions for the years

1980 and 1987. The events were grouped Into five major classes and nine distinct

subcategories. The major classes are: (1) general HR system changes, (2) compensation and

benefit changes, (3) staffing changes, (4) relocations and shutdowns, and (5)

miscellaneous HR events. Within each major event category, subcategories were coded that

attempt to classify the events into homogeneous categories based on similarity of the

likely consequences of the event on total compensation costs. The subcategories of each

major event are as follows:

        (1)   General HR system changes

              no subcategories

        (2)   Compensation and benefits

              (a)     increase

              (b)     Decrease

        (3)   staffing

              (a)     Permanent reduction

              (b)     Temporary reduction
              (c)     Recall or increase

        (4)   Relocation or Shutdown

              (a)     Relocation

              (b)     Shutdown


                                                        9
      (5)   Miscellaneous

            (a)   Health and safety

            (b)   All others (not estimated because of noncomparability across

                  years)

The Data Appendix (part A) lists all events for the calendar year 1980 by event type and

subcategory, including a synopsis of the     article. Data Appendix (part B) lists the

same information all events for the calendar year 1987.

Event Data: Source and Dating

      The sample for this study included any firm with traded securities on the New York

Stock Exchange in 1980 or 1987. The source for events and the event dates was the j

Street Journal. One hundred fifty-four firms had a total of 452 events in 1980. One

hundred two firms had a total of 195 events in 1987. The event date was taken as the date

that the information was provided to the market via publication in the           All   1980 and

1987 issues of the Journal were scanned for events. Although deficiencies associated with

the use of the j and the Wall Street Journal Index have been noted (Thompson, 1985;

Thompson, Olsen and Dietrich, 1987; Thompson, Olsen and Dietrich, 1988), the majority of

event studies in accounting, finance, and labor relations have used one or both of these

sources.

      The total shareholder return and stock price information for those firms

experiencing HR events was extracted from the Center for Research in Security Prices

(CRSP) daily stock returns file (1987). In this study, the daily return, which reflects

dividends paid plus the change in the price of the security for each trading day, was

used. In order to account for the poseibility that information was leaked to the market

prior to the event appearing In the , an event window spanning two dayc before the

event through two days after the event was evaluated. In order to allow for the

possibility that the information slowly leaked into the market, an eight day period

beginning ten days before th. event and ending three dayc before the   event   wai also

studied.

Expected Security Price Reactions


                                            10
     The announcement of a human resource decision has several potential effects. The

event may signal that an action was taken to attempt to improve performance and would thus

be seen as beneficial. Alternatively, the action may be perceived as an act of

desperation and it may send a negative signal to the market and the firm's shareholders.

Of course, shareholders and the market may be indifferent to the HR decisions described in

the "events". The major difficulty in categorizing the events is determining the element

of new information or "surprise" in each announcement. With events that can be directly

quantified (for example, earnings announcements or new collective bargains) a statistical

model can be used to separate the expected and unexpected components of the announcement.

In our case, no direct model of the expected announcement is available. Instead, we

categorize events by the direction of the effect on total compensation costs (when that

effect can be determined); however, we must note that even though an event is known to

increase total compensation costs (for example, a staffing increase or a compensation

increase) this does not mean that the unexpected component of the increase is positive.

      We can speculate that certain information conveyed to the market through HR events

would be unexpected. On the one hand, if the managers of the firm are always acting in

the shareholders' best interest, the expected effect of any HR change is to increase the

value of shareholders' wealth. This expected effect is capitalized into the security

price gradually as the information about the general HR environment at the firm is

revealed. The new information content- -unexpected part- -of every type of HR announcement,

then, must be positive on average. On the other hand, the announcements also may contain

some new information about the state of the product market (or other relevant economic

factors). In these cases, the unexpected effects of the announcement will, on average,

imply positive security price effects when the product market information is good and

negative security price effects when the product market information is bad.

      Consider the case of a permanent staffing reduction. The first order effect of this

change is to reduce total compensation costs and to reduce output (or at least productive

capacity) within the organization. If the staffing reduction was in the shareholders'

best interests, costs fall by more than the reduction in sales revenue so that profits


                                            11
rise. On average, the unexpected component of th, staffing change should have a positive

effect on stock prices for this reason. However, if the staffing reduction is greater

than the market expectation based on economic conditions in the fins's industry, then, the

unexpected component of the announcement also includes new information that the product

market (or other economic conditions) are worse than previously expected. This part of

the unexpected component of the staffing change will have a negative effect on stock

prices. On net, it is very difficult to model these effects on stock prices without a

comprehensive model for decomposing the announcement into an expected component and

unexpected components that reflect new information about HR policies and new information

about the state of the product market.

         Before considering the results of our event study, we report the results of a

statistical analysis of the magnitude, variability, and sample size required for

estimability of the average abnormal return caused by unexpected changes in sales, cost of

goods sold, operating income, direct wage expense and sales less direct wage expense. The

experiment was conducted using 3,450 firms from Standard and Poors' COMPUSTAT annual

financial data files. For each firm we calculated net sales, cost of goods sold,

operating income, estimated direct wage expenses, and sales less direct wage expenses. Je

estimated the present value of the after-tax change in cash flow resulting from a one

percent change in each of these quantities holding all other income statement items

constant. The present value was calculated using horizons of one year. three years and

infinity. The abnormal return was estimated as the ratio of the present value of the

change in cash flow divided by the December 1979 market value of the company's common

stock.

         This experiment, summarized in Table 1, reveals the difficulty of measuring the

effect of HR events on stock prices when the effect on other economic factors can be

perfectly controlled and when the effect on other factors cannot be controlled at all.

Notes:
     a. The standard deviation of the abnormal return is in
        parentheses (stated as a percent).
     b. The number in the third row of each panel is the
        estimated sample size required to detect the effect
        using a five day window with daily abnormal returns
        with a standard deviation of .03 (Brown and Warner
         1985).
Sources:
     1. Based on a sample of 3450 COMPUSTAT firms (NYSE, AMEX,
         and OTC) using fiscal year 1979 data for Net Sales
         Cost of Goods Sold, Operating Income and Employees.
     2. Abnormal returns are stated as a percentage of the
         December 31, 1979 market value of all common stock
        outstanding.
     3. Direct wage costs were estimated as $11,416 times
        employees. The annual earnings figure is the average
        annual earnings in private non-agricultural employment
        for 1979 derived from BLS data in CITIBASE.

deviation and the average standard deviation of daily abnormal returns (.03, see Brown and

Warner 1985).

      An unexpected one percent increase in direct wage expenses that is expected to last

only one year produces an average abnormal return of only - .43% and has enough variability

to require 979 events for an estimate that exceeds its standard error by two. If the HR

event is of this order of magnitude and contains no information about the product market,

it will be virtually impossible to detect the effect with stock price data. On the other

hand, if the unexpected one percent increase in direct wage expenses is associated with a

one percent increase in sales; that is, if the event signals an unexpected increase in

profitable production, then only 68 events would be required to detect it even if the

duration is only one year.

      The   signs of the abnormal returns in Table 1 can be reversed to discuss downturns.
If a one percent decrease in direct wage costs (perhaps from an unexpected layoff of one
percent   of the workforce) is expected to last three years then the direct wage effect

(+1.17%) may be detected with 143 events. If the HR event also signals a one percent

downturn in sales then the -4.85% effect is detectable with only 19 events.

      The detectability of larger stock price changes arising from HR events involving

larger unexpected changes in costs or direct wages can be estimated from the infinite

horizon rows of Table 1. An unexpected change of ten percent in direct wage costs that

lasts only one year is essentially the same as a one percent change that lasts forever.

So, it should be detectable with 22 events provided those events are not associated with

the introduction of other information.

      Finally, in order to provide some additional guidance regarding the magnitude of the

estimated effects, we discuss the portfolio consequences of various abnormal returns. An

average CAR of 1% means that a portfolio consisting of stocks about to experience the

event will increase in value (on average) 1% between the close of business on day t—-3 and

the close of business on day t—2. If the event could be forecasted perfectly, then a 1%

holding period return could be realized (gross of trading costs) by assembling such a

portfolio on day t—-3 and liquidating the positions on day t—2. Average CAR's of 1% for


                                             14
five-day event periods are economically significant, although not particularly large. For

HR events, our estimated absolute CAR's ranged from .02% to 2.68%. For industrial

relations events absolute CARs have been estimated in the 1.5% to 3% range. (See Ruback

and Zimmerman, 1984; Becker and Olson, 1986; and Tracy, 1988.)

The Estimation procsdur.

     The usual procedure for calculating the expected total shareholder return from daily

return data is to use an estimation period of about 250 days that ends about one month

before the event period begins (sea Brown and Warner, 1985). We modified this procedure

because of the relative frequency with which HR events occur. Events such as permanent

reduction announcements may. and did, occur once or more for a given firm in a particular

year. For example. General Electric made five such work force reduction announcements in

1980. Furthermore, any number of combinations of event types may be experienced by firms

in our study within a given period. For instance, in 1980, Firestone announced plans to

shut down five plants (3/20/80), and initiated permanent layoffs of white collar workers

(5/5/80). To account for this potential multiplicity of HR events, which is attributable

to the broad nature of the HR policies, we chose to modify the time frame for the market

model estimation process. We have used returns for each firm from the preceding calendar

year to generate our expected returns. This reduces the potential for including

confounding events in the estimation period. The abnormal return was then derived from

the difference between the observed and the predicted returns. The abnormal -return may be

generated for any number of days before or after the event. We chose to analyze abnormal

returns for days -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2. The cumulative abnormal return was computed for the

5-day period from day -2 through day +2. A second cumulative return spanning from day -10

through day -3 was also derived to examine the pre-event movement in the total shareholder

return, if any.

III. Results

      In this section we discuss the results for average cumulative abnormal returns and

variance ratios for each of the analysis years. There is a separate discussion of the

1980 and 1987 studies. The CAR   analyses   were performed for all events and for the first


                                               15
event for each company. The variance ratio studies were performed using the first event

for each company. 1980 Abnormal Returns

      All Events. In 1980 there were 452 HR events in 154 firms. Staff reduction

temporary (157), staff reduction permanent (87), and shutdown (80) events occurred most

frequently, as seen in Table 2.

      In general, the results in this Table indicate that the stock market did not react

predictably to most of the human resource interventions announced in 1980. Only the

staffing recall/increase subcategory had a relatively large positive average cumulative

abnormal return (average CAR) for the 5-day period (+.95%          1.37%). The Staffing:

Temporary Reduction event had an average CAR     of   -1.19%    .45%, which is the only

statistically significant average CAR   during   the event period. The negative cumulative

abnormal return for Staffing: Temporary Reduction remains statistically significant when

the data for all events in 1980 and 1987 are pooled (-1.11%          .43%).

      First Events. In an attempt to isolate the effects of the human resource events

under study, a second set of analyses was performed for the 1980 sample using only the

first event for each firm. The results are shown in Table 3.

      In 1980, there were 154 such events relating to 154 firms. When only the first

event was considered, the Shutdown (43), Staffing Permanent Reduce (38), and Staffing

Temporary Reduce (25) types of events were the most frequent as shown in Table 3.

      With the exception of the Compensation Increase category, which was negative for the

"all events" and positive for the "first events only", the direction of the associations

observed for the overall sample are also observed in the first event only sample. As in

the overall sample, the first event only subset exhibtts a large negative average CAR for

the Temporary Staff Reduction category. This negative average CAR is also significant for

the pooled 1980 and 1987 first event analysts (-2.11%          1.00%).

1987 Abnormal Returns

     All Events. In 1987, there were 195 events in total. Staff reduction Permanent

(88) was the predominant event type. General Human Resource (28) and Shutdown (24) were

the next most frequent event types, as can be seen in Table 4.

      The 1987 results also show a general lack of predictability in the stock market

reaction to the HR events. In three of the nine categories the direction of the

relationship is the same as in 1980 (compensation increase, compensation decrease, and

shutdown), although no average CAR is statistically significant at conventional levels.

      First Events. In 1987, there were 102 first events, as defined previously, relating

to 102 firms. Considering only the first events, the Staffing Permanent Reduction (52)

and Shutdown (18) events occurred with the most frequency, as shown in Table 5.

      Comparing the total 1987 sample with the first-event only subset, we see that

several important categories (Compensation Increase and Staff ing Permanent Reduction) have

changes in average CAP, signs. These changes are influential enough to result in different

signs for the average CAR values for the all events sample (+.12%) and the first-event

only subset ('.15%). Again, no cumulative abnormal returns are statistically significant.

Variance changes

      In order to determine whether the variability of abnormal returns changes around the

event date, we computed the ratio of abnormal return variances for the event period

relative to the estimation period. Figure 1 displays a histogram of these variance ratios

for the first-event sample in 1980 compared to the theoretical F-distribution that would

be obtained in the absence of variance shifts around the event. As is clear in the

figure. there are too many large values of the variance ratio to accept the hypothesis of

no change in abnormal return variance. This impression is confirmed by the Kolmogorov 0-

statistic (D—.lll, probability value <   .01).        The new information in the HR events is

moving stock prices, but not in a predictable direction.

      Figure 2 shows a similar histogram for the 1987 first-event sample. Again, there

are too many large variance ratios, compared to the theoretical F distribution, to accept

the hypothesis of no variance change. The Kolmogorov 0-statistic confirms this conclusion

(D—.l47, probability value < .01).

      Having concluded that there is evidence of a variance shift surrounding the event

period in both 1980 and 1987, we examined lists of the events associated with the large

variance shifts. For the year 1980 there are 26 events in the largest variance ratio

category. Seven of these events are permanent staff reductions and nine are plant

shutdowns. Although we were not able to predict the average effects of these events

precisely, the variance ratios confirm that such events are associated with large swings

in the stock price. Similarly, for 1987, there were 13 events in the largest variance

ratio category. Nine were associated with permanent reductions in force, one was a

shutdown and one was a relocation. The results for 1987 are consistent with the 1980

variance results. Major reductions in staff or changes in plant location are associated

with large abnormal returns of unpredictable direction. An analysis of the 1980 and 1987

variance ratios for all first events associated with permanent reductions of staff

supports this conclusion (Shapiro-Wilk statistic —    .869, probability value <.01 for 1980
and W — .150, probability value <.01 for 1987). Analysis of the 1980 and 1987 variance

ratios for all first events associated with plant shutdowns was inconclusive.

      A final issue that arises in connection with the finding that HR events increase the

variance of abnormal returns around the announcement date is the possibility that the .fl

Street   Journal selects stories in a manner that are associated with increased the

variability of stock returns precisely because of their newsworthiness. We contacted the

[ in an effort to determine the sources and coverage of HR news stories. The two

primary sources are company press releases and reporters covering a geographic region or

company. Most announcements originate as press releases. Most descriptive stories

originate from beat reporters. All stories are written by WSJ reporters. Press release

information is investigated by the reporter and is not printed verbatim as distributed by

the company. The Journal's goal is to write a story on the same day the information is

received and substantially all press releases about HR changes result in some news

coverage. Some companies routinely disclose more information in the form of press

releases and general interviews than other companies (private correspondence. 1989).

Company policy regarding HR event press releases would appear to affect the probability of

the event appearing in the .      This   means that certain companies are more likely than

other companies to appear in our analysis. It does not, apparently, mean that certain

stories are more likely to appear for that company. The tests we performed for changing


                                               24
variances controlled for the individual company's abnormal return variability; therefore,

the possibility that high variance companies disclose more HR information would not bias

our results.

IV. Conclusion

      In this study, we extended the use of the event study methodology to consider the

effects of a variety of human resource decisions on shareholder return. Human resource

announcements occur frequently, at least as compared to the accounting, control, and

regulatory events that are often the focus of event studies. The magnitude and

variability of the theoretical abnormal returns associated with unambiguous HR events--

events that signal an unexpected increase or decrease in compensation costs holding other

components of cash flow constant- are such that our task was a difficult one from the

outset. Apparently, most HR events are not unambiguous new information. The temporary

staff reduction event, which had a significant negative cumulative abnormal return, must

contain some additional bad news about the product market since by itself the staff

reduction must reduce compensation costs.

      Like all other event studies, our conclusions rely on the assumptions that we have

1) properly identified and 2) adequately isolated true events. However, we believe that

human resource management announcements constitute valid events. Bowman (1983, p. 561)

has argued that, "A very broad interpretation should be placed on what constitutes an

event." Becker and Olson (1987) also suggest that capital market research supports the

proposition that the market reacts to managerial decisions that affect cash flows and that

maximize price per share. Certainly human resource management decisions meet these

qualifications.

      Our results indicate that the direction of the effect of HR management events is

difficult to predict absent a more fully specified model for the unexpected change in

total compensation expense and organizational efficiency associated with the announcement.

Our analysis of the increased variance in abnormal shareholder return surrounding HR

announcements suggests, however, that these events do provide information that influences

stock prices, Subsequent analyses might focus on the extension of this concept to other


                                            25
Hit intervention types, longer time periods, broader samples than New York Stock Exchange

firms, and the use of models that explicitly consider the new information content of the

announcements themselves.
