Does Sorting Students Improve Scores? An Analysis of Class Composition

JEL No. I21

                                                ABSTRACT

This paper examines schools’ decisions to sort students into different classes and how those sorting
processes impact student achievement. There are two potential effects that result from schools creating
homogeneous classes—a “tracking effect,” which allows teachers to direct their focus to a more narrow
range of students, and a peer effect, which causes a particular student’s achievement to be influenced
by the quality of peers in his classroom. In schools with homogeneous sorting, both the tracking effect
and the peer effect should benefit high performing students. However, the effects would work in opposite
directions for a low achieving student; he would benefit from the tracking effect, but the peer effect
should decrease his score. This paper seeks to determine the net effect for low performing students
in order to understand the full implications of sorting on all students.

We use a unique student-level data set from Dallas Independent School District that links students
to their actual classes and reveals the entire distribution of students within a classroom. We find significant
variation in sorting practices across schools and use this variation to identify the effect of sorting on
student achievement. Implementing a unique instrumental variables approach, we find that sorting
homogeneously by previous performance significantly improves students’ math and reading scores.
This effect is present for students across the score distribution, suggesting that the net effect of sorting
is beneficial for both high and low performing students. We also explore the effects of sorting along
other dimensions, such as gifted and talented status, special education status, and limited English proficiency.

1. Introduction
       While a large body of literature exists on education inputs such as teacher quality,
school expenditure, and class size, a related but lesser-studied issue is how students are
actually divided into classes. Schools may use several different strategies to allocate a given
number of students within a grade across different classrooms. Some schools may choose to
sort students by ability level and create classes of relatively homogeneous students.
Alternatively, schools may choose to sort students with varying abilities evenly across classes.
Other schools may try to match students and teachers, while taking into account individual
students’ learning styles. Analyzing these types of sorting decisions is important because if a
particular sorting mechanism is found to be especially beneficial, many schools would have the
ability to implement valuable changes without the need for large amounts of additional
resources. Other changes to educational inputs—including technology available to students,
reducing class size, and attracting more qualified teachers—require substantial increases in
spending. Changing the sorting guidelines for a particular school only requires rearranging the
students among the classes that already exist and could be accomplished, in many situations,
with minimal additional resources.
       The decision to sort students by ability has two distinct effects on students. The first,
the direct tracking effect, produces efficiency gains for teachers in the way that they are able to
structure their classrooms and pedagogy. Sorting allows teachers to narrow their instruction
to a particular group of students and to tailor their teaching styles to meet the needs of those
specific students. This should be beneficial to all students, including both high and low
performers. Teachers in low ability classrooms will be able to focus on foundational skills that
are imperative to the continued progress of their students, and teachers in high ability
classrooms will be able to spend time on more advanced material that would be otherwise
omitted in a more heterogeneous setting. Both groups should see improvements in
performance as a result of this effect.
       The second consequence of ability sorting is the resulting peer effect. Schools that
homogeneously sort by ability necessarily place high ability students with high ability peers
and low ability students with low ability peers. If students are directly influenced by the
quality of their classmates, this would benefit students at the high end of the score distribution
while hurting students who are already at the low end. The net effect of sorting, then, is
                                                                                                    3


positive for high ability individuals but undetermined for low ability individuals. If the peer
effect is greater than the tracking effect, then low scoring students are on balanced harmed by
schools’ sorting procedures. However, if efficiency gains from tracking outweigh the peer
effect, then sorting should have an overall beneficial impact on students across the score
distribution.
       The purpose of this study is threefold. First, we determine how schools sort students
into various classes using student-level data from Dallas Independent School District. This data
is unique in that it allows a student to be linked not only to his school, but also to his individual
class. This allows us to observe the entire distribution of students within a class and evaluate
sorting along a number of dimensions. We examine sorting primarily by previous test scores,
in addition to gifted and talented status, special education status, and limited English
proficiency (LEP). We find evidence of substantial variation in sorting policies across schools.
       Second, we use the variation that exists across schools to identify the effect of sorting on
student performance. We construct several “sorting indices” that measure how homogeneous
or heterogeneous the classes within a particular school are, based on the different dimensions
described above. Applying an innovative instrumental variable technique that uses one grade’s
sorting index as an instrument for the sorting index of another grade, we estimate the impact of
sorting on student achievement.
       Third, we consider that the effects of sorting are not necessarily the same across
different types of students and we allow for heterogeneity in the sorting effect across a
distribution of students. We determine the differences in the effects between high and low
scoring students in addition to considering effects for students who are classified as gifted and
talented, special education, or LEP. We pay careful consideration to students at the bottom
end of the score distribution to determine if sorting has an overall positive or negative effect
for them, revealing the relative impacts of the tracking effect compared to the peer effect.


2. Related Literature
       There are two important strains of literature related to this paper: the peer effects
literature and the tracking literature. Studies within the tracking literature typically
characterize the classes in a school or group of schools as homogeneous or heterogeneous and
attempt to analyze the effects on student outcomes. The definition of tracking may vary from
study to study, as there is a wide assortment of actual tracking practices in reality, ranging
                                                                                                    4


from explicitly creating clearly defined and curriculum-distinct “tracks” for particular types of
students to simply dividing students into groups based on ability level and providing them all
with roughly the same program of study. Tracking also exists at different levels of instruction.
Some school systems practice within-school tracking and others divide students across schools
based on various measures. These methods vary largely across countries. Betts (2011)
provides a thorough review of this literature.
       Several papers provide descriptive statistics using large, nationally representative
samples. Rees et al. (1996) report data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of
1988 (NELS). Using teacher-reported information, they conclude that the majority of 8th and
10th grade classes appear to be tracked by performance. For example, only about 14 percent of
8th grade students were enrolled in a heterogeneous math class. They also find that students
from low income groups and minority students are more likely to be enrolled in lower-level
classes and less likely to be enrolled in advanced classes. Betts and Shkolnik (2000), using data
from the Longitudinal Study of American Youth (LSAY), examine the qualities of tracked classes
in middle school and high school and find differences in average teacher characteristics
between low ability and high ability classes. Low ability classes tend to be smaller, but they
also tend to have teachers with less experience and education.
       In estimating the causal effect of tracking on student achievement, one of the key issues
confronted by researchers is how to deal with the selection problem that arises because
students are not randomly assigned to a tracked or non-tracked school—or to a particular class
within a school. Hoffer (1992) compares tracked and non-tracked schools at the middle school
level. Using a propensity score approach to attempt to combat the selection issue, he finds
heterogeneous impacts by student type: tracking seems to be beneficial for high-scoring
students, but he finds negative effects for low-scoring students. Betts and Shkolnik (2000) use
principal-level survey data and student testing scores and compare achievement for students of
several different ability levels across schools that track and those that do not. They find some
evidence for heterogeneous effects but argue that they are relatively small and, in most cases,
not significantly different from zero.
       Hanushek and Woessmann (2006) exploit variations in tracking practices across
countries to determine if a country-wide system of creating curriculum-specific tracks at the
secondary school level is beneficial for students. Using a difference-in-difference method that
examines changes in outcomes between primary and secondary schools for tracked and non-
                                                                                                     5


tracked countries, they find strong evidence of increased inequality in test scores as a result of
tracking. They also suggest that tracking may actually decrease average performance overall,
so that both high and low achieving students in a tracked system lose relative to students in a
non-tracked system.
       Figlio and Page (2002) explore tracking in conjunction with school choice using data
from NELS. They address the endogeneity problem by instrumenting for whether or not a
school tracks students by using several county-level instruments based on graduation
requirements, number of schools, and presidential voting data. They find no evidence that
tracking benefits high-scoring students at the cost of low-scoring students; instead they suggest
that tracking may in fact benefit low-scoring students as well.
       Duflo et al. (2011) also provide support for the idea that tracking may help both high-
scoring and low-scoring students. In order to avoid the selection problem, they conduct a
randomized trial in Kenya by funding an extra teacher for primary schools with only one class
in a particular grade. After creating the extra class, they divide the students into either
homogeneous or heterogeneous classes, with respect to their previous testing scores. The
authors find that being enrolled in the homogeneous classes significantly increases students
testing scores, and that the effect holds for both high-scoring and low-scoring students.
       Related work in the peer effects literature attempts to identify the effects of a student’s
peer group on his own behavior. If peer effects exist, then an individual is influenced by the
characteristics or decisions of those around him. This has clear implications for sorting
because dividing students into separate classes based on student characteristics automatically
places them in a particular peer group. While homogeneous sorting would result in gains for
high ability students who would now have a larger proportion of high achieving classmates,
there are potential harmful effects for low ability students who now have more low achieving
classmates.
       Lefgren (2004) uses variation in tracking policies to evaluate peer effects and highlights
the relationship between the two. Using student-level data from Chicago Public Schools, he
measures the degree of tracking within a school by the amount of variation in students’
incoming test scores that can be explained in a regression of classroom dummy variables. He
implements an instrumental variable strategy based on interactions between the level of
tracking within a school and observed student ability. His findings provide evidence of
significant but very small peer effects.
                                                                                                    6


       Other papers examine peer effects beyond the context of tracking. Sacerdote (2001)
analyzes peer effects at the college level by exploiting random variation in peers caused by
random assignment in college housing. Using a dataset of about 2,000 college freshmen from
Dartmouth College, all of whom have randomly assigned roommates, he examines the impact of
peer groups—both at the roommate level and at the dorm level—on several variables,
including choice of major, GPA, and fraternity membership. He finds convincing evidence of
peer effects for several outcomes. Specifically, a student’s peers have a strong impact on
whether he will join a fraternity, and which fraternity he will join. This effect is particularly
strong at the dorm level. He also finds effects for GPA, especially between roommates. An
individual’s GPA is positively and significantly impacted the GPA of his roommate.
       Ding and Lehrer (2007) provide an analysis of peer effects in secondary schools using
data from Jiangsu Province in China. They are able to avoid the selection problem inherent in
many peer effects studies because the students in their data set are assigned to a particular
school based only on observable test scores, rather than on unobservable characteristics.
Using a panel of about 1,300 students, whom they follow from middle school completion into
college admission, they find strong evidence of peer effects. They conclude that peer effects are
heterogeneous with respect to student type: high-performing students benefit significantly
more from having high-performing peers than do low-performing students. They also conclude
that all students benefit from having more homogeneous peer groups (or peer groups with less
score variation), although the impact is again larger for high-performing students.
       Lavy et al. (2011) use administrative data from high schools in Israel to determine the
mechanisms through which peer effects work. Using students’ birthdays to qualify them as
“repeaters” and potentially of lower ability, they exploit variation in the proportion of low
ability students within a classroom. They then use that variation to determine the peer effect
and conclude that more low ability students within a class negatively impacts the performance.
Using a student-level questionnaire, the authors describe several channels through which the
peer effect may work, documenting effects on disruptive classroom behavior and relationships
among students.


3. A Sorting Model


3.1 Sorting by Test Score
                                                                                                        7


        To examine the effect of sorting on students’ academic achievement, we begin by
considering the following model:

                                                                                               (1)
where       represents the test score of student i in class j at school k in time t and
      represents the same student’s previous year score. We include             , a vector of student-
level controls, and       , a vector of classroom characteristics.
        The variable γjkt is a sorting index for a class j, describing the dispersion of the students
in the classroom based on observable characteristics, such as test score. Higher levels of γjkt
indicate a class that is sorted in a more homogeneous way. Lower levels of γjkt indicate more
heterogeneous sorting, or that the test scores in the class are more evenly dispersed. It follows
that positive values of     suggest that homogeneous sorting is helpful in improving student
performance, and that negative values provide support for hypothesis that heterogeneous
classes are more likely to improve achievement.
        It is possible that a particular type of sorting will have different effects for different
groups of students. For example, sorting high-scoring students into one class and low-scoring
students into another class may allow the classes to move at different paces, which may benefit
both groups of students. The teacher in the low-scoring class may be able to focus on
foundational skills necessary to the improvement the students, while the teacher in the high-
scoring class may have the opportunity to move on to new, more challenging material without
the fear of losing the understanding of the class.
        However, this type of sorting may not necessarily benefit both groups. An alternative
hypothesis is that by creating evenly distributed groups, students with more understanding of
the material may be able to help those with less understanding. In this situation, low-scoring
students might benefit without causing a cost for high-scoring students. It may even be
plausible that this situation could benefit both high scorers and low scorers.
        In order to examine how sorting may affect different types of students, we allow φ to
vary by students’ observable characteristics, as shown in the following model:


                                                                                               (2)
                                                                                                                8


where students are ranked by their previous test score and placed into one of two groups. The
variable           is equal to one if student i is a high-scoring student, and               is equal to one
if student i is a low-scoring student.


3.2 Other Methods of Sorting
        In addition to examining schools’ decisions to sort by previous score, we also consider
their decisions to sort according to other characteristics, such as gifted and talented (GT)
classification or special education status. For example, some schools may group all of its GT
students into a single class to allow them to move at their own pace, while other schools may
divide them into several classes with other non-GT students.3 Having GT students included in a
regular classroom could potentially help or hurt non-GT students in the same ways that high-
scoring students could affect low-scoring students.
        Similar logic holds for special education students. Some schools create separate
classrooms for special education students, while other schools include those students in
regular education classrooms. Either of these sorting processes may have implications for both
types of students—and those implications may be different for special education students,
compared with regular education students.
        we empirically examine both GT and special education sorting and allow the sorting
effect to vary across student type, in a model similar to model (2). we also include measures of
sorting by limited English proficiency (LEP) status, which may be particularly relevant for the
state of Texas, which serves a large population of LEP students4.


3.3 A Sorting Index
        To empirically determine the effects of both types of sorting, we first construct a
measure defining how “sorted” a class is. Consider the following measure for each grade within
a school:


                                                                                                      (3)



3
  Even if GT students are divided into classrooms with many non-GT students, they still may be “pulled out”
for several hours during the school day or during the week. Unfortunately, the Dallas ISD data contains only
one classroom per student, so it is not possible to tell if the students participate in this type of program.
4 For example, more than 20 percent of students in Dallas ISD are classified as LEP students.
                                                                                                         9


where       represents the score of student i in class j and school k,       is the score average in
school k, and N represents the total number of students in school k. The index           , then,
measures overall score dispersion within a school. Likewise, consider the following measure
which represents the level of dispersion within an individual classroom:



                                                                                                   (4)



where     is the score average within class j and    represents the total number of students in
class j. Using the two above measures, we define the following index for each classroom:




                                                                                                   (5)


which reflects the score dispersion in classroom j relative to overall score dispersion in school
k. Higher values of        indicate less variation in the classroom scores relative to the overall
variation in the school and suggest that the class is homogeneously sorted. Lower values of
        indicate that more variation in the classroom and suggest that students are distributed
in a more heterogeneous way.
        We define a similar measure to gauge sorting along other dimensions, such as gifted and
talented, special education, or LEP status. Consider the following index:


                                                                                                   (6)


for                        This index is analogous to equation (5), except that the testing scores
are replaced with a binary variable indicating GT, special education, or LEP status. Consider
the sorting process for GT students. Higher values of           indicate that schools place gifted
and talented students into a separate class (or classes), rather than dispersing them evenly
across all classes, which would be suggest by a low value of             .


3.4 Endogeneity of the Sorting Index
                                                                                                    10


       It is essential to consider not only the effect of sorting on students’ scores but also why
they are sorted into their given classes at the outset. Although the dataset allows identification
of characteristics such as previous score and other student classifications, teachers and
principals certainly observe many other variables which may be used to divide students into
different classrooms. Principals may attempt to “match” certain students with certain teachers,
or they may have policies whereby parents can request a certain teacher for their children.
       Unobserved variables such as behavior may also play an important role in the
classroom assignment process. For example, if a principal observes that several students have
had behavior problems in the past, he may try to divide those students evenly across the
classes within a grade, or he may assign them to a particular teacher who has had previous
success with behavioral problems. In this case, behavior is an unobserved variable that affects
a school’s sorting index. An endogeneity problem arises if behavior, or other unobserved
variables correlated with sorting, impact students’ test scores.
       In order to deal with this endogeneity, we propose to instrument for one grade’s sorting
index using the sorting index from another grade at the same school. If the administration at
school k uses certain guidelines in assigning students to classes in grade g, it is likely that those
guidelines are also used for other grades in school k. Therefore, the sorting indices for classes
in grade g should be correlated with the sorting indices for grade g+1. However, there is no
reason to believe that the way in which classes are sorted in grade g+1 should impact the
scores of students in grade g. Therefore, sorting indices in grade g-1 should provide valid
instruments for sorting indices in grade g.
       The problem that arises when trying to match indices from individual classes across
grades is that there is no way to map the classes from fourth grade to specific fifth grade
classes. Sorting indices for each class within a grade can be created, but they cannot be
mapped one-to-one across grades. Instead, we create a grade-specific sorting measure that can
be used for all classes within a grade. Instead of using the classroom-specific       , we create a
grade-specific measure       , which is simply the average score dispersion across all classes
within the grade:


                                                                                              (7)
                                                                                                    11


The variable J indicates the number of classrooms in school k. The sorting index we use in the
empirical analysis, then, is

                                                                                              (8)

and its interpretation is similar to that of equation (5). Higher values of sortk indicate less
dispersion of scores within classes relative to score dispersion with the school, which means
more sorting (or more homogeneous classes). Lower values of sortk indicate more dispersion
of scores within classes, which means less sorting (or more heterogeneous classes). In the
empirical estimation, we use sortk for the fifth grade to instrument for sortk for the fourth
grade.
         Table 8 reports the correlation between fourth and fifth grade sorting indices, with one
observation per school. Correlation coefficients range from 0.37 to 0.57.


4. Data

4.1 Student-Level TAKS Data from Dallas ISD
         One drawback to many datasets used to explore how school inputs or characteristics
affect achievement is that students cannot typically be linked to their actual classes. For
example, the Texas Education Agency (TEA) collects student-level testing data from the Texas
Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) for all public school students starting in third
grade. The dataset is a rich panel of information on student achievement and characteristics.
However, while students’ schools and grade levels are available in the dataset, their specific
classes are not. This makes it impossible to link a particular student to his classroom and to
actually determine how schools have divided students across classes within a grade.
         While students are not linked to specific classes in the statewide dataset, several school
districts do collect student-level data that may be linked to a class variable. We employ a
unique dataset from Dallas Independent School District that contains both class and grade
identifying information. This allows me not only to track a student to his class, but also to
examine the distribution of scores and other characteristics within and across classrooms for a
particular grade.
         The dataset includes student-level math and reading TAKS scores for two school years.
we examine all third grade students in the 2003-2004 school year who become fourth graders
in 2004-2005, a total of 9,325 children from 135 different schools in Dallas ISD. In addition to
                                                                                                       12


achievement scores for both years, the dataset contains race and gender variables and
identifiers for students qualifying for programs such as free or reduced lunch, gifted and
talented, special education, and limited English proficiency. Summary statistics are shown in
table 1.


4.2 Test Score Variables
           Texas reports students’ scores in two ways. The first score is a student’s raw score,
which corresponds to the number of questions he answered correctly on the exam. For the
2004-2005 exam, the maximum raw score is 42 points. The second score measure is a
student’s scale score, which is scaled using the Rasch partial credit method to control for the
difficulty of the exam across different administrations of the test. Scale scores are used to
compare two different cohorts’ scores. For example, scale scores could be used to compare
fourth graders in 2004 with the following group of fourth graders, who took the exam in 2005.
           Although the scores allow for direct comparison in this way, they are not meant to be
vertically linked. That is, a third grader’s 2004 score should not be directly compared to his
fourth grade 2005 score in order to gauge improvement. Because that is precisely the
comparison we want to make, we convert the scale scores into z-scores, by subtracting out the
mean score and dividing by the standard deviation in a given year. A student’s z-score is given
by

                                                                                               (9)

where             is student i’s scale score in period t, and   and   represent the mean and
standard deviation of the scale scores. A student’s score is now a representation of where he
lies along the distribution of scores. we generate z-scores for both the current year (2004-
2005) and the previous year (2003-2004).


5. Empirical Results


5.1 Do Schools Sort?
           Before examining any effects of sorting or class size, it is first important to determine
whether any schools appear to sort students based on observable characteristics and how
prevalent this type of sorting is. We explore potential sorting based on several different
                                                                                                      13


observable characteristics: previous math score, previous reading score, gifted and talented
status, special education status, and LEP status.
        To investigate sorting based on students’ previous scores, we create dummy variables
for each class and compare the mean scores by running the following regression:


                                                                                              (10)

where sijt-1 is student i’s test score in the previous year and Dj is a dummy variable for class j.
Therefore, β1 gives the mean score for the first class and β2, β3, … , βJ show the differences in
score relative to the first class. If schools divide their students into classes randomly, then
there should be no difference in the previous year score means for any of the classes. That is,
β2, β3, … , βJ should not be significantly different from zero or from each other.
        Alternatively, if schools do divide students into classes based on their previous year
scores, then there should be significant differences in the average scores. Consider the case in
which a school has three classes within a single grade. The administration may choose to sort
students into three groups—low-scoring students who need additional assistance to improve
their grades, average-scoring students who are achieving at grade-level, and high-scoring
students who are ready to move on to more challenging material. In this case, β2, and β3 would
be significantly different from zero, as well as different from each other.
        We also examine basic evidence of how schools sort according to students
classifications into GT, special education, or LEP categories. We run the following linear
probability model:


                                                                                              (11)

where                         and is a dummy variable indicating that classification. The right
hand side of this equation is analogous to equation (9), where DJ is a dummy variable for class
j.
        It should be noted that schools may face constraints related to which teachers are
certified to teach students who fall into these particular categories. For example, if a principal’s
strategy included dispersing GT students equally among all the classes within a grade, he would
be forced to deviate from that strategy if some of the fourth grade teachers were not certified.
Ideally, teacher characteristics would be included in the analysis to reveal potential sorting
                                                                                                  14


constraints. However, because the data allows linkage to a specific class but not to a teacher,
this is not possible.
           We run regressions (9) and (10) for each of the 135 schools in the district to determine
which schools potentially sort by the various dimensions. Examples of the results for two
particular schools are shown in tables 2A and 2B5. Consider, for example, the results for school
186, which are given in the first table. This school has four classes of fourth graders—two with
lower average math scores and two with higher average math scores. The average score for
class 1, given by the constant, is 26.1 (the maximum raw score is 42 points). The coefficient for
class 2 is not significantly different from zero, and the point estimate is only 1.2 points,
suggesting that there is no substantial score difference between the two classes. However, the
estimates for class 3 and 4 are both statistically significant and indicate a 4.9 point and 6.1
point difference in score from class 1. Class 1 also has significantly lower reading scores than
any of the other classes.
           While classes in this school appear to be sorted by previous testing scores, they do not
seem to be sorted along other dimensions. There is no significant difference in the number of
gifted and talented students across the classes. About 11.8 percent of the students in class 1
are classified at GT; while the percents are higher in magnitude for the other classes, none of
the differences is statistically significant. There is also not a significant difference between the
number of special education students across the classes, as shown in column (5) of the table. It
does appear, however, that the students are sorted by LEP status. Class 1 has significantly
more LEP students than the other classes, particularly classes 2 and 4.
           Table 2B shows an analogous example for school 235, a non-sorting school. There are
no significant differences in the reading and math scores for any of the classes in this grade.
The magnitude differences in the reading scores are particularly small. There is also no
significant difference in the number of GT, special education, or LEP students across classes.
           Table 3 shows a summary of the results from all of the schools. A school is tagged as a
“sorting school” along the math or reading score dimension if the average score for any of the
class dummies is statistically different from the others. Similarly, a school is considered a
“sorting school” along the GT, special education, and LEP dimensions if any of the class
dummies is statistically different from the others in equation (10). Of the 135 schools, almost
three-fourths sort along at least one dimension. Almost 19 percent are math score sorters and

                                                                                                    15


24 percent are reading score sorters. About 28 percent appear to sort by GT status, 57 percent
sort by LEP status, and 13 percent sort by special education classification. Many schools
appear to sort along multiple dimensions; almost 40 percent sort by at least two dimensions,
and more than 20 percent sort by at least three.
        About one-fourth of the schools in the dataset have no significant difference in any of
the variables across different classes. It is important to note that even if score averages are not
significantly different, schools may still be considering score in a strategic division of students
into classes. Some schools may be purposefully allocating students of different abilities equally
among classes. If administrators believe that an equal division of student ability is beneficial to
some or all students, then there should be no significant score average score difference
between classes, even if the school is acting strategically.
        Table 4 presents a summary of schools that sort along at least two dimensions. Of the
group of math sorting schools, 11 also sort by reading score, 15 also sort by GT status, 15 also
sort by LEP status, and 5 sort by special education status. The diagonals of the table represent
the total number of schools that sort along that particular dimension.
        Table 5 presents results showing how observable characteristics predict whether or not
schools sort, and along what dimensions. The dependent variable in each regression is equal to
one if the school is classified as a sorting school. For example, schools with a higher variation
in reading scores are more likely to sort by previous reading score. Schools with more gifted
and talented and special education students are more likely to sort along those dimensions.
Many of the coefficients are insignificant, and there appears to be a substantial amount of
sorting present in schools that is unrelated to school or student characteristics.
        In addition to comparing average scores and characteristics across classes, we also
examine how two individual students’ characteristics affect the probability that they will be in
the same class. Consider the following regression for two students i and j:

                                                                                             (12)
where          is equal to one if students i and j are in the same class. The vector     includes
various measures of differences between the students, including difference in math score,
reading score, GT status, LEP status, and special education status. Negative values of      indicate
more homogeneous classes, because higher differences in scores (or other characteristics)
would decrease the likelihood of being in the same class. Positive values of     indicate more
                                                                                                  16


heterogeneous classes, because higher differences in scores would increase the likelihood that
the two students are in the same class.
       In order to run equation (11) we first construct all potential pairs of students within a
grade in a given school. The regressions are evaluated separately for each school. An example
is presented in table 6. This school appears to sort homogeneously. Students with larger
differences in scores—both math and reading—are less likely to be placed in the same class.
This is also true for LEP, GT, and special education status. None of the other coefficients are
significantly different from each other. For example, the female coefficient is negative, but very
small in magnitude and insignificant, indicating that classes do not appear to be sorted by
gender. Table 7 summarizes the regressions from each school. The results are qualitatively
consistent with the mean comparisons across classrooms. Difference in LEP status is the most
commonly significant coefficient, confirming that many schools tend to divide students along
this dimension.




5.2 Effect of Sorting by Test Score
       It is not immediately clear whether sorting students will be beneficial for them or which
types of sorting will be most beneficial for different types of students. As described earlier, an
intuitive argument can be made for the benefits of tracking students into homogenous classes,
as well as for evenly dividing them into heterogeneous classes. To explore this issue
empirically, we create a sorting index for each class within a school measuring how dispersed
its students are when compared to the overall school population at a single grade level.
Following the formulas described in equations (5) and (6), we construct two indices:
which measures overall score dispersion within a grade in school k, and         which is a
measure of score dispersion within the classes of school k. As described in section 3, the
variable             reflects how “sorted” the classes of school k are, relative to the overall

score dispersion in the school. Higher levels of       indicate classes that are more
homogeneously sorted, and lower levels of          indicate that classes are more heterogeneous.
we construct this variable separately for math scores and reading scores.
       The baseline results for math scores are found in column (1) of table 9A. The
dependent variable is a student’s 2005 math TAKS score, measured as a z-score. The results
                                                                                                         17


suggest a positive, statistically significant relationship between the sorting variable and math
score, indicating that, sorting is beneficial to students. This suggests that, on average, students
gain by being placed into a more homogeneous classroom, compared to one with more
dispersion in testing scores.
           Column (2) presents the same regression excluding the tails of the “score gain”
distribution as a robustness check6. Students who showed extreme gains or extreme losses
from 2004 to 2005 (moving from a raw score of 1 to 42, for example) are removed from the
sample in this specification, because a change this large raises concerns about the validity of
one or both of the scores. With these observations removed, the sorting effect is slightly larger
in magnitude, but still strongly significant.
           We also run the same regression with a student’s gain in math score on the left hand
side, rather than the level 2005 math score. The results, given in table 9B, are similar to the
level results. The sorting coefficients are positive and significant in both specifications,
suggesting that more homogeneous classes produce an increase in math scores for the average
student.
           We examine similar effects for reading scores. A summary of the math and reading
results is presented in columns (1) and (2) of table 10. Note that each value represents the
coefficient on the sorting index from a separate regression. All regressions include the same
controls listed in tables 9A and 9B. The results for sorting by reading scores are similar,
although smaller in magnitude, compared with the effects on math score.
           As explained in section 3.4, there are potential endogeneity problems inherent in
estimating the effect of sorting on student performance. Schools choose how to divide students
into classes, and it is likely that they make this determination using variables that are
unobserved to the researcher. Unobservable characteristics such as behavior may affect both
schools’ sorting decisions and student performance, causing the sorting coefficient to be biased.
To correct for this, we create                    for the fifth grade in every school to be used as an

instrument for the fourth grade sorting index. The two indices should be correlated if schools’
sorting guidelines are similar across grades and administrators use common mechanisms
within a school to divide students into classes. The instrument exogeneity condition requires
that there be no effect of the fifth grade’s sorting index on the scores of the fourth grade


6   The top and bottom 2.5 percent of the distribution is excluded from this regression.
                                                                                                     18


students. This is intuitively plausible; there is no reason to believe that the way fifth grade
students are divided into classes would have any impact on the academic performance of the
fourth grade students in their school.
          Columns (3) and (4) of table 10 show the results of the 2SLS estimations for math score
and reading score, respectively. The estimates are positive and significant in for both math and
reading scores, and generally larger in magnitude than the OLS estimates, suggesting there was
a downward bias in the original results. These results hold across various specifications—for
both level scores and score gains, and when the tails of the score gain distribution are excluded.
These estimates confirm that, on average, more homogeneous classes are beneficial for
students in increasing both math and reading achievement.


5.3 Allowing for Heterogeneity in the Sorting Effect
          One of the concerns within the literature regarding sorting is that it may benefit one
group of students at the cost of hurting another group. For example, several researchers7 have
suggested that while sorting may raise achievement levels for high achieving students, it
actually lowers the performance of low achieving students. To test for this possibility, we rank
students according to their previous year testing score, create dummy variables for high and
low scoring students, and allow the sorting effect to vary across the two groups.
          Table 11 presents the results allowing for heterogeneity in the sorting effect by student
ability. The first rows report the coefficients for math score. While the results suggest slightly
larger effects for high scoring students, there are still large, positive, and significant results for
the low scoring group. The estimates for the two groups are not significantly different from
each other. This suggests that it is not the case that sorting causes high ability students to gain
at the cost of low achievers; on the contrary, both groups of students benefit from more
homogeneous classes. These results are consistent with the conclusions of Duflo et al. (2008)
and give credence to the line of reasoning that suggests that more homogeneous classes allow
teachers to teach to a more narrow range of students, which is beneficial for both high and low
scoring individuals. The results for reading score are similar. While the coefficients overall are
still slightly smaller than the ones for the math results, all 2SLS specifications indicate a
positive significant effect of sorting on reading score.


7   See Hoffer (1992) and Betts and Shkolnik (2000).
                                                                                                       19


5.4 Other Types of Sorting
       In addition to examining how schools sort in regards to previous testing score, we also
examine sorting along several other dimensions—gifted and talented status, special education
status, and LEP status. The estimates for gifted and talented sorting are presented in tables 12-
13. Overall, the results indicate effects that are positive but not statistically significant in the
2SLS regressions. Allowing for heterogeneity between GT students and non-GT students
reveals that most of the positive results are being generated for non-GT students, although the
point estimates are still not significant.
       Results for special education students, given in tables 14-15, suggest negative (but not
significant) sorting effects for math and negative, significant effects for reading. The results
that allow for heterogeneity in the effect, as presented in table 15, suggest negative effects for
non-special education students and positive (but not significant) effects for special education
students.
       Regressions for limited English proficiency students are reported in tables 16-17.
While the 2SLS estimates are generally not estimated precisely, most of the specifications
indicate that the sorting coefficient is positive, suggesting that more homogeneous classes are
useful in increasing performance.


5. Conclusion
       The purpose of this study is to examine how schools sort students into classes, how
those sorting mechanisms affect student achievement, and whether there are heterogeneous
sorting effects across a distribution of students. Using detailed student-level data that allows a
student to be linked to his classroom, we find evidence of a wide variation in sorting practices
across schools. Many schools appear to sort along various dimensions, including previous
math and reading scores, gifted and talented or special education status, and limited English
proficiency.
       We find strong evidence that sorting students into more homogeneous groups is
beneficial, particularly for sorting by previous testing score. Interestingly, when allowing for
heterogeneity in the sorting effect across a distribution of students, we find positive and
significant results for both high scoring and low scoring students, suggesting that both groups
benefit from sorted classes. This is consistent with the hypothesis that dividing students into
                                                                                              20


more homogeneous groups allows teachers to direct their focus to a more narrow range of
students and meet the needs of their particular classroom more efficiently.
       This study has valuable policy implications because unlike many school policy variables,
the composition of classes can often be changed with little need for increased funds. A school
with a fixed number of classrooms and teachers can increase efficiency by rearranging students
in the most effective way possible. This study suggests that creating classes with lower levels
of dispersion of score or ability level may improve the achievement outcomes for students
across the score distribution.
