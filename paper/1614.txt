                         the Wild Card Option in
                    the Treasury Bond Futures Market


                                  ABSTRACT



    The Chicago Board of Trade Treasury Bond Futures Contract allows the short

position several delivery options as to when and with which bond the contract

will be settled. The timing option allows the short position to choose any

business day in the delivery month to make delivery.   In addition, the

contract settlement price is locked in at 2:00 p.m. when the futures market

closes, despite the facts that the short position need not declare an intent

to settle the contract until 8:00 p.m. and that trading in Treasury bonds car,

occur all day in dealer markets. If bond prices change significantly between

2:00 and 8:00 p.m., the short has the option of settling the contract at a

favorable 2:00 p.m. price. This phenomenon, which recurs on every trading day

of the delivery month, creates a sequence of 6-hour put options for the short

position which has been dubbed the "wild card option." This paper presents a

valuation model for the wild card option and computes estimates of the value

of that option, as well as rules for its optimal exercisc.

 I.   Introduction




      The Treasury bond futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade gives

 several delivery options to the short position. The quality option, which

allows the short to deliver any of several eligible delivery bonds, has

already been studied fairly extensively. Because many bonds are eligible to

be delivered against the futures contract, and the conversion factors used to

adjust for the bond actually delivered do not perfectly reflect relative price

differences, the short-side trader will choose to deliver the "cheapest

eligible bond. Kilcollin (1982) presents a discussion and analysis of

conversion factors and their effects on the optimal delivery bond. Gay and

Manaster (1984a) present a theoretical valuation model for the quality option

when two classes of commodities with uncertain
                                                 end-of-period spot prices may
be delivered. Garbade and Silber (1983) provide a similar analysis and

estimate parameters of the valuation formula for a variety of agricultural

commodity futures. Kane and Marcus (1984) have used Monte Carlo simulations

to value the quality option in the Treasury bond futures market.

      In contrast, the various timing options embedded in the delivery process

have received comparatively little attention. One of the most important of

these is the so-called wild card option. The wild card option arises because

the futures market closes each trading day at 2 p.m. (Central Standard Time),

which locks in the futures settlement price for the rest of the day, while the

short trader has until 8 p.m. of each trading day in the delivery month to

declare an intent to deliver on the contract. Because government bonds trade

in a dealer market that is effectively open until the 8 p.m. delivery-notice

deadline, a 6-hour "put option" is created at 2:00 p.m., which allows the

short trader to deliver the bond at that day's settlement price.
     The short-side trader 'exercises1 his option by choosing at 8:00 p.m. to

deliver at that afternoon's 2:00 p.m. settlement price. Otherwise, the

contract is continued into the next day. That day, the contract is marked to

market and by 8:00 p.m. the short position once again must decide whether to

deliver. This process continues until delivery, which is required to be made

by the end of the delivery month.

     One recent paper that deals explicitly with the wild card option is by Gay

and Manaster (1984b). That paper considers a simple delivery rule for the

                                                                     q77-1 93 nr   ntl



to   derive an empirical assessment of the value of the wild card option. No

theoretical valuation formula for the option is offered, however. Moreover,

we will argue below that the Gay-Manaster trading rule is not value-maximizing

for the short position.

     The   derivation of both the optimal exercise strategy and the valuation
formula for the   wild card option are       complicated by the   presumption that, in

equilibrium,   the futures price must be bid down       by the value of the option.

Because    the payoff to the     option   depends upon the futures price, which in turn
impounds   the option value, the determination of the valuation and exercise
rules   requires the solution of a fixed-point problem. This simultaneity is

often overlooked; for example, Gay and Manaster's (1984b, p. 9) exercise rule

implies that, in the absence of transaction costs, delivery should be made

whenever spot bond prices decrease after 2 p.m.1 In fact, we demonstrate

below that bond prices must decline by more than a critical value before

delivery is optimal. The excess profit offered by delivering at B p.m. over

that of marking to market on the next trading day must compensate the short

position for the fact that the wild card option expires upon exercise. This




                                              -2-
 feature makes the delivery decision an optimal stopping problem: once the

 short trader chooses to deliver, potentially more profitable future exercise

 of the option is no longer possible. Hence, the delivery profit must be large

 enough to compensate for the loss of the right to carry the wild card option

 into the next trading day.

      This paper presents a valuation model for the wild card option. We show

that the option is in some ways similar to an American option with the unusual

feature that, at the start of each trading day, the exercise price is

readjusted to put the option out of the money. Section II contains a

discussion of the features of the delivery process in the T-bond market that

create the wild card option, and presents a valuation formula for the option.

This valuation rule gives the amount by which the equilibrium T-bond futures

prices should be bid down in equilibrium to compensate the long position for

the   delivery option conveyed to the short position. Section III is devoted to
numerical exercises that demonstrate the quantitative significance of the
option.    We find that the value of the option at the start of the delivery

month can be 20 cents (off the current futures price of 65 dollars). This

value is smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude, as the value of the

quality option (Kane and Marcus, 1984). Finally, Section IV contains a

summary and discussion of the implications of our results.



II. The Delivery Process and the Valuation of the Wild Card Option

      The basic trading unit in the CBT 1-bond futures market is a 10O,OOO face

value U.S. Treasury bond. Any such T-bond with a maturity of at least 15

years which is not callable for at least 15 years from the first day of the

delivery month may be delivered to settle the contract. In order to adjust




                                       -3-
for differences in the values of deliverable grade bonds, the CBT establishes

conversion factors (OF) to determine actual payments at the delivery of the

contract.       The long side of each contract pays the short side an amount equal
to the futures contract settlement price times the conversion factor. The CF
is chosen to adjust for the relative values of the admissible delivery grade
bonds. The CF equals the fraction of par value for which the delivery bond
would sell if it were priced to offer an 8 percent yield to maturity. Bonds
with coupon rates above 8 percent will have a CF greater than one, and

    Al though the futures price is frozen for the day as of 2:00 p.m., the

short side trader has until 8:00 p.m. to announce his intent to deliver. If

he delivers, the conversion factor of the delivery bond is calculated and the

long—side trader is invoiced for an amount equal to q F2pm(t) where q is

the conversion factor and F2(t) is the closing futures (settlement) price

at date t. Letting B8pm(t) denote the market value of the delivered bond,

the short position's profit from delivery is2



            F2p(t) - 88pm(t)                                              (1)




    If the short chooses not to deliver, the contract is continued to the next

day. The expected (as of 8:00 p.m. on day t) profit or loss to the short

position from the next day's marking to market is



         F         Ct) - E       [F      (t÷1)]                           (2)
             2pm             8pm,t 2pm


where the second term in (2) denotes the expected value of the next day's

closing futures price based on the information available as of 8:00 p.m.


                                                        -4-
     If there are no transactions costs involved in establishing a position in

the futures market, then the short will choose to deliver if expression (1) is

greater than (2). With no transaction costs, any position in the futures

market may be re-established after the profits from either strategy (1) or (2)

are realized. To operationalize the delivery rule, an expression for

Eapmt[F2pm(t+1)] is required.

     To derive such an expression, note that if the futures market were open

continuously, then at all times during the delivery month the futures price

and spot price of the currently-optimal delivery bond would have to satisfy

the no-arbitrage condition



                             rr(t)   = qF(t)     -   8(t)    =    0

or

                                     F(t) =    3(t)/q



where ir(t) is the profit to the short side and the optimal delivery bond is

the one which minimizes the price to conversion factor ratio, B(t)/q.

     In reality, the short position may choose to deliver at 8:00 p.m. at the

closing (2:00 p.m.) futures price, or if it is more profitable, may continue

the contract to the next day, and mark to market. To reflect this option, the

equili5rium futures price must he bid down by the option's value V(t), so that

the observed futures prices, F(t) must he



                             F(t) =    B(t)/q        -   V(t) .           (3)




                                          —5--
       otice that if a contract were settled while the futures market were open,

the profit from settlement would be



                                                      =   qF(t)    -   B(t)
                                                      =   -qV(t)


The short trader would suffer a loss equal to the wasted wild card option

scaled by the conversion factor.                      In fact, one would expect that the contract

more alive than dead.4 Thus, the settle versus mark to market decision will

be made each day at 8:00 p.m., and the sequence of delivery decisions can be

treated as occurring once each day during the delivery month.

        Using (3), we immediately deduce that



                                                                                 -                                        (4)
                   E8pmt[F2pm(t+l)] =            E8pffl[Bpffl(t+l)/                   V2(t+1)]

With no trend growth in the bond price (or alternatively, noting that trend

growth over one day is of second-order importance compared with daily price

fluctuations), the expectation of B2p(t+l) is simply the current price,

B8pm(t)•5 Moreover, V2(t+l) is nonstochastic: as of 2:00 p.m. on

date t1, before any bond price movements occur while the futures market is

closed and the settlement price is locked in for the day, the option value is

a function only of time to maturity and the parameters of bond price

dynamics. Since the bond price and futures price have not yet become

misaligned, the option value is independent of                              the         actual level of the bond

price.           In fact, its value for any day in the future at times during which the

futures market is open is nonstochastic. Hence, (4) becomes

    Finally, comparing the profits from marking to market [equation (6)] with

and the incremental profit of marking to market over that of delivering is

                                                      (q-l)V2(t)

                                                                              V2pm(t+1)
                                                                                                (8)




    Equations (7) and (8) highlight the difference between our formulation and

that of Gay and Manaster (1984b). They derive the optimal delivery strategy

without accounting for the impact of the wild card option on the futures




                                                       -7-
price. (See their equations (2) and (3).) Consequently, the last two terms

in (8) do not appear in their delivery rule, and they conclude that in the

absence of delivery costs, and with a conversion factor greater than one, the

short should deliver whenever bond prices decline between 2:00 p.m. and 8:00

p.m.7 In contrast, equation (8) demonstrates that the delivery decision

cannot be predicted by simple rules of thumb. On one hand, marking to market

continues the contract and keeps the wild card option alive into the next

day. This is reflected in the term qV2(t) in equation (8); this

consideration discourages delivery. On the other hand, (8) shows that one

must also consider the change in the value of the option as time passes.

Since the value of the wild card option must decrease as the delivery month

nears its end, V(t÷1) will be less than V(t), so that F(t1)-F(t) will be

larger than would be suggested by movements in the spot bond market alone.

Consequently, marking to market produces lower profits for the short position

than would be indicated by changes in the spot price alone; this pattern

encourages delivery.

    Notice    also the crucial role played by the conversion factor in the
valuation of the wild card option. If the conversion factor equals 1.0, then
the only value for the option that is consistent     with (7)   or (8) is V(t) = 0
for all t. For q = 1, delivering and marking to market produce identical
profits,     As q diverges from 1, however,   the value of the option to choose
between delivering and marking to market can grow rapidly.

    The role of the conversion factor in determining settlement behavior may

best be understood by considering the CF as a scale factor. The daily profit

to the short position from a mark to market strategy equals (-B/q -       V)   while

the settlement strategy gives a profit of -B - qV.       When bond prices fall,




                                        -8-
the short position profits. Note however, that the profit accruing from the

bond price decline is divided by q in the mark to market strategy. Hence,

when q exceeds 1.0, settlement will tend to dominate marking to market for

bond price decreases, because marking to market scales down profits by 1/q.

Conversely, for increases in bond prices, the short position suffers a loss

that can be scaled down by the factor 1/q by marking to market. Hence,

ignoring the option value (and transaction costs), the optimal settlement rule

for q > 1 would be to settle whenever bond prices fall after 2:00 p.m. and

mark to market when prices rise. The delivery rule should be reversed for q <

1, since then the factor 1/q exceeds 1.0, and scales up profits or losses.

This rule was simulated.by Gay and Manester (1984b) using past contracts.

    When the value of the option is also considered, the settle versus mark to

market decision is more complicated, since settlement forfeits the right to

carry the option into the next trading day. Hence settlement requires that

bond    prices fall by more than a finite critical value (for q > 1) before
settlement is optimal . However, the role of the conversion factor as a
scaling factor remains. In fact, one might view the wild card option as the
right   to scale up profits by a factor of q when bond prices fall (for q >   1)
or to scale down losses by that factor when prices rise (for q < 1) on the day

that the option is exercised.8 Hence, it is clear that the optimal strategy

is to wait for an afternoon with large price swings before settling the

contract.

    Implementation of equation (8) as a means of determining when to deliver

requires that the value of the wild card option as a function of time left in

the delivery month be known. This is the standard optimal stopping problem

(DeGroot,    1970). Fortunately one can solve (8) recursively to determine that



                                        -9-
valuation formula. Consider first the value of the option on the last day

that the contract is traded, which we will denote by T. At this date, the

short position's wild card option is valueless. The last change in the

futures price has been recorded, and there is no longer an option to mark to

market rather than to deliver.9 Hence, V2(T) =                 0.
   At 2:00 p.m. on date T-1, the short has one more six-hour period in which

the choice between delivering or marking to market may be made. The expected

profit is thus



            E2pm,T_l[max (settlement profit, mark-to-market profit)]            (9)




The equilibrium condition in the futures market (assuming no risk premium to

either side of the contract) is that expression (9) equal zero. Rewriting

(9), we obtain



                                      +                               = 0       (10)
        E2pm,T_l(settlement profit)        E2Pffl,T_l[max(XTlO)]


where       was defined in equation (8). But the expected settlement profit is

simply E2pm,T_l[(_B8pm(T_l) +                            Since the expected
                                   qF2p(T_l)].
end-of-day bond price equals the current price (see footnote 5), and with

                           -               by equation (3), the expected 8:00
F2pm(T_l) =    B2p(T_l)/       V2pm(T_l)
p.m. settlement profit is



                                                  -                             (11)
               2pm(Tl) +       [B2p(T_l)/              V2pm(T_l)]   _V2p(T_l)


and equation (10) becomes




                                             -   10-
                         V2p(T_1) + E2PfflTI[max(XT1.       0)] = 0

or

                         V2(T-1) =     (l/)E2p,1_1    [rnax(X11,0)]                (12)




The realization of XT1 depends on Bgpm(T_I) which is a random variable as

of 2:00 p.m. on day T-1.

       The solution to



            V(t) = E9m 4[max(X4., O)]/q                                            (13)




requires the determination of a fixed point since V(t) is itself part of

and thus appears on the right-hand side of (13). However, given the

probability distribution for B8pm(t) conditional on information available at

2:00 p.m. on date t, the expectation of X. for a given V(t) is easily

calculated, and determination of the fixed point is a straightforward

numerical exercise.

       Once V(T-1) is determined, equation (13) can be solved for V(T-2), and so

on back to the first day of the delivery month. The end result is a schedule,

V(t), for each date t      during   the delivery month. This schedule can then he

used   by the short position in conjunction with equation (7) to determine at
8:00 p.m. of each delivery day whether delivering or marking to market is the
appropriate strategy. The exercise strategy          is straightforward: mark to

market   if X. is greater than zero; otherwise settle the contract.
     For example, using the assumption that next-day bond prices are
distributed lognormally with        mean drift equal to zero, the expectation in (13)

equals




                                           —11—

Because the one-step--ahead value of the option is already established (as we

work backwards from time 1), an iterative technique can be used to solve (14)

for V(t). Notice that V(t) appears on the RHS of (14) in E. Hence, at each

step of the solution, the fixed point for V(t) in (14) must be calculated.



III. Numerical Results

    In order to quantify the value of the wild card option, we present

solutions to equation (14) for several configurations of the delivery bond's

conversion factor and standard deviation of bond returns. The value V(t) that

results is the amount by which the futures price should be bid down in

equilibrium because of the option.

    We considered conversion factors of 0.75, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75. Conversion

factors of bonds currently eligible for delivery range from approximately 1.0




                                                              -12-
to 1.75. The standard deviation of annual bond returns was set to either .05,

 .10, or   .20. These values correspond to the range of va'ues calculated by

Bodie, Kane, and McDonald (1984) for bond return variability during different

subperiods in the 1970s and 1980s. The six hour standard deviations of the

bond rate of return were calculated from the annual standard deviations on the

basis of 52 trading weeks per year with five trading days per week. We also

assumed that the spot bond market supports active trading for 12 hours a day.

The range that we consider for the annual standard deviation, 5-20 percent,

should account for the fact that the number of trading days per week and hours

per day need not be exactly as assumed.

    Figure 1 is a graph of the value of the wild card option as a function of

trading days remaining in the delivery month. Because trading in the contract

is suspended seven business days prior to the end of the month, there are

typically no more than 16 days on which the wild card play can be made. Three

curves appear in Figure 1, corresponding to the three posited values for

standard   deviation in conjunction with a conversion factor of 1.5. As
expected, the value of the wild card option increases with the delivery bond's
standard deviation. The value   of the option rises quickly as days remaining

in the delivery month increase from zero, but the rate of increase falls

steadily with time to maturity. At the start of the delivery month, with 16

days remaining until the contract stops trading, the value for the option

reaches .083, Z.165, and .329 per contract on Z100 of T-bond par value, for

the three standard deviations respectively. These values are smaller than,

hut of the same order of magnitude as the value of the quality option

calculated in Kane and rlarcus (1984). The quality option (i.e., the value of

the short position's right to choose the optimal delivery bond) for contracts




                                      -13-
three months prior to the delivery month was calculated to be in the range of

1.39 to 4.60. As the delivery month approaches and the delivery bond

becomes more easily predicted, the quality option diminishes in importance,

and the wild card option becomes more important for the short position.

    Figure 2 is similar in design to Figure 1, but examines the impact of the

conversion factor on the option value. The calculations here use the

mid-point annual standard deviation value of 10 percent.     In this case the

values of the wild card option at the start of the delivery month equal Z.277,

.li4, .i65, and $.189 for the conversion factors .75, 1.25, 1.5, and 1.75

respectively. The value of the option is obviously quite sensitive to the

difference   between the conversion factor and 1.0.   Since the conversion

factors   themselves increase with   the difference between the coupon rate of the

delivery bond and the eight percent coupon rate of the benchmark bond on which

the contract is nominally written, the value of the wild card option will vary

with   the general level of market yields. Thus, if   market yields were

permanently   to   fall from current levels, so that all delivery bonds would have

coupon rates closer to eight percent, the wild card option would be devalued.

    Figures 3 and 4 demonstrate the amount by which the delivery bond's price

must rise or fall on any afternoon in order to induce the short position to

initiate delivery. Equation (8) shows that when         is negative, settlement

of the contract will be optimal. For conversion factors greater than one,

this will require a bond price decrease. We have calculated the necessary

decrease   for bonds intitially selling at par value (Z100). Figures 3 and 4
show that with few days left in the     delivery month, even slight declines in

bond   price will set off delivery. Because there is little time left in which
to obtain a "favorable draw" from the distribution of bond-price changes, the



                                         -14-
value of the wild card option is low, and even small decreases dictate

contract settlement. However, as time remaining in the delivery month

increases, the condition for settlement becomes more stringent. The analysis

is symmetric for conversion factors less than one. Figures 3 and 4 also

illustrate the bond price increase required to initiate delivery when q < 1.

    Because of the sensitivity of bond prices to weekly money-supply

announcements, one might argue that the weekly variance rate of bond returns

ought to be 11concentrated on the announcement day. We examine the impact of

this potential nonstationarity in Figures 5 and 6, in which the annual

standard deviation of bond-price changes is kept equal to the midrange value

in Figures 1 and 3 (i.e., 10 percent), but in which the standard deviation of

every fifth day's return is made to be (1k) times as large as the previous

four days' standard deviation. Increases in k thus correspond to greater

concentration of price movements on the money-supply announcement day. Values

of k equal to 0.5 and 1.5 are considered, and the conversion factor 1.5 is

used. The values in Figure 5 and 6 thus may be compared to the midrange

curves in Figures 1 and 2, since all use identical conversion factors and

annual standard deviations. The option values in Figure 5 are all slightly

greater than the corresponding values in Figures 1 and 2,     reflecting   the fact

that valuation function is convex in the bond-return standard deviation.

    The outstanding feature of Figure 5 is the dramatic dependence of the

option value on potential price movement during the announcement day. For the

extreme case, k =   1.5,   the option value is almost flat for days in-between

announcements. Virtually the entire value of the option accrues from the

bond-price variability associated with the three announcement days of each

delivery month. The decrease in bond price necessary to set off a settlement,




                                        -15-
which is depicted in Figure 6, is correspondingly spiked at announcement

days. Figure 6 demonstrates that the critical price decrease required to

induce contract settlement increases dramatically for each announcement day

left in the delivery month, while it is almost unaffected by the remaining

number of non-announcement days.



IV. Conclusion

     We have developed a valuation framework for the wild card option implicit

in   the Treasury-bond futures contract. Market equil ibrium requires that the
futures price be bid down by the value of this option. For the current set of
delivery bands, and with an annual standard deviation of 10 percent, our
results indicate that the value of the option at the start of the delivery
month is consistent with the futures price being bid down by approximately

one-fifth of a point (from a current base of roughly 68). As the month draws

to its end, however, the option value approaches zero.

     Our valuation framework also gives rise to a value-maximizing contract-

settlement rule. We presented the critical bond-price decreases necessary to

induce contract settlement as a function of days left in the delivery month

and the bond's variance rate and coversion factor.

     A natural question arises as to whether   actual settlement behavior of
traders   closely mimics that dictated by our model. Gay and Manester (1984b)

conclude that traders act suboptimally and that futures prices are consistent

with that suboptimal settlement behavior. If so, delivery behavior based on

the rules derived herein should provide the short position with superior

profits. We currently are simulating the use of these rules using past

contracts to examine their efficacy in increasing the short positions's

potential profit.


                                       -15-
                                   FOOThOTES

1. This rule is reversed when the delivery bond's conversion factor falls

   below 1.0. However, the conversion factor exceeds one for virtually all

   eligible (non-flower) bonds.

2. The invoice price also includes the accrued interest on the delivered

   bond. For expositional simplicity, we will omit this term in the

   following analysis. Since the actual profit at delivery is -B + (qF+A)

   -(B-A) + qF, where A is the accrued interest, one can think of the short

   position as delivering the bond stripped of its accrued interest in return

   for qF. Hence B in our notation may be considered the

   net-of-accrued-interest value of the bond. This is the price at which the

   bond is quoted in the security market.

3. This formulation ignores the uncertainty involved in the mark-to-market

   strategy.   If that risk is not diversifiabie, a discount factor could be

   applied to (2).

1.. It is conceivable that for some specifications of interest rate dynamics,

   settlement prior to 8:00 p.m. could be optimal. For example, with a

   strongly mean-reverting interest rate process, a large interest rate

   increase and associated bond-price decrease early in the afternoon would

   tend to be followed by bond-price recovery. Settlement before the

   anticipated recovery could then be value maximizing. Such a possibility

   is rule out by the log-normal bond-price dynamics that we posit.     If we

  were to use a stochastic process for which settlement prior to 8:00 p.m.

  were an important possibility, then equation (13) below would

   underestimate   the value of the wild card option.
5. Letting A denote accrued interest on the delivery bond, the short's profit
   upon delivery actually equals [-(B-A)     +   qFi, and (3) becomes

                                      -17-
                       (t) =   [B(t)   -
                                           A(t)]/q   -   V(t)
  Hence, one actually requires in (4) that B2pm(t+1) include the trend

  growth in the value of the bond less its accruing interest, or' put

  differently, the trend growth in the quoted price of the bond. This will

  be quite close to zero for bonds selling near par. It is simple to add a

  growth factor to B8(t) to account for the expected one-day growth in

  the net-of-accrued-interest bond price. Our valuation estimates results

  were virtually unaffected by such an addition, and we therefore ignore it

  to avoid cluttering the notation. We also assume here that the optimal

  delivery bond for the next day is known as of 8:00 p.m.

6. As noted, because the futures price continually adjusts along with the

  bond price to new information during the trading day, it will never he

  optimal to deliver prior to 2:00 p.m., and indeed delivery before 8:00

  p.m. would be highly unlikely. Only when bond prices decline after 2:00

  p.m. is it profitable to settle. After 2:00 p.m., the option value moves

   in response to bond price fluctuations. Until then the value is fixed.

   If, at 8:00 p.m., settlement is not chosen, the option takes on its

   next-day's value which is, again, fixed until 2:00 p.m. This feature

   distinguishes the wild card option from more conventional American

   options. When the futures market reopens every morning, the futures price

   immediately adjusts to reflect the information that arrived since 2:00

  p.m. on the previous afternoon. Thus, the option goes immediately out of

  the money at the start of each day.

7. When the conversion factor is less than 1.0, increases in the price of the

  delivery bond will cause the short position to settle the contract. The

   term multiplying 3 in equation (3) changes sign when q passes though

  1.0. This issue is discussed further below.


                                       -18-
S. This   insight suggests an easy way to    eliminate   the wild card option.

   Rather    than use the CF to scale up the invoice price to reflect the
   quality of the delivery bond, which results in profits qF-B, the CF
   could be used to scale down the number of bonds required to satisfy the
   contract. This procedure would result in settlement profits to the short
   position of F-B/q. Marking to market would thus result in identical
   profits   as settlement, and this complicating effect on contract strategy

  would be eliminated.

9. This date is actually 7 business days prior to the end of the delivery

  month. At that time, the futures market is closed and the settlement

  price no longer changes. While the short has the right to decide when

  during this last week to deliver, he is obligated to deliver by the end of

  the week at the given settlement price, and with no special information

  regarding the one-week movement in the bond price, the value of this

  "waiting option" should be negligible.
