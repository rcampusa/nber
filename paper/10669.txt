Disease has traveled with goods and people since the earliest times. Armed globalization spread

disease, to the extent of eliminating entire populations. The geography of disease shaped patterns

of colonization and industrialization throughout the now poor world. Many see related threats to

public health from current globalization. Multilateral and bilateral trade agreements do not always

adequately represent the interests of poor countries, the General Agreement on Trade in Services

may restrict the freedom of signatories to shape their own health delivery systems, and it remains

unclear whether current arrangements for intellectual property rights are in the interests of citizens

of poor countries with HIV/AIDS. However, to the extent that globalization promotes economic

growth, population health may benefit, and there has been substantial reductions in poverty and in

international inequalities in life-expectancy over the last 50 years. Although there is a strong inverse

relationship between the poverty and life-expectancy in levels, gains in life expectancy have been

only weakly correlated with growth rates and, in the last decade, the HIV/AIDS epidemic has

widened international inequalities in life expectancy. The rapid transmission of health knowledge

and therapies from one rich country to another has led to a swift convergence of adult mortality rates

among the rich of the world, particularly men. Globalization would do much for global health if

transmission from rich to poor countries could be accelerated.

0. Introduction

When economists write about globalization, they focus on the movement of goods, people,

information, and ideas, and they look at the effects on economic growth, poverty and inequality.

Health is not a primary focus of their attention. By contrast, much of the literature in public

health sees globalization as a threat to international health. On the relatively few occasions where

economists have addressed health, they focus on the indirect effects, arguing that the economic

benefits of globalization are good for health—because poverty is the major determinant of health

in poor countries—and that, if there are unwelcome side-effects on health, they can best be dealt

with by suitable public health measures, not by policies that slow the globalization process. Both

sides of this (mostly non-) argument have substance, and one aim of this paper is to present some

of the arguments from the public health literature as seen through the eyes of at least one

economist. There is also much to be learned from looking at previous episodes of globalization,

and at the history of trade and health, and it is with this that I begin.

    If it is true that income is the primary determinant of health, at least in poor countries, then

the consequences of globalization for public health depend on its well-researched (although still

disputed) consequences for economic growth, particularly for the poorest countries. Although the

income to health mechanism is undoubtedly present—everything is easier with money, and some

improvements are impossible without it—I argue that the transmission of health related

knowledge is ultimately more important. Social forces, including not only income, but also

education and politics, are central because they govern they way in which new knowledge is

transformed into population health. The health and life-expectancy of the vast majority of

mankind, whether they live in rich countries or poor countries, depends on ideas, techniques, and


                                                    2
therapies developed elsewhere, so that it is the spread of knowledge that is the fundamental

determinant of population health. The trade-borne transmission of infectious disease has been the

focus of international health authorities since seventeenth century Italy and remains important

today. But, at least since the middle of the last century, a more important influence has been the

international transmission of ideas, techniques, and technologies. It is plausible that the recent

acceleration of the pace of globalization has been accompanied by faster transmission of health in

rich countries, although it is probably too soon to be sure. But the current lack of treatment of

HIV/AIDS in subSaharan Africa, as well as the annual deaths of 10.5 million children in poor

countries that would not have taken place had they been born in rich countries, are major failures

of globalization to date.



1. Health and globalization in history

Disease has been an unwelcome companion of trade at least since the plague of Athens in 430

BC killed perhaps as much as one third of the population. The black rats, which carried bubonic

and pneumonic plague to Europe in 1347, were most likely carried by trading ships. More than

three hundred years later, the city states of northern Italy developed the first systems of national

and international public health in their attempts to control recurrent episodes of the disease, Carlo

Cippola (1981, 1992). Merchants wanted quarantine restrictions to be internationally coordinated

in order to minimize the disruption to their business, yet even at this early date, health concerns

tended to run second to the needs of trade. In 1630–31, when Pistoia (near Florence) had locked

its gates to quarantine itself against the encroaching plague, and had expelled all foreigners,

mountebanks, and Jews, the city was temporarily opened up to all comers to facilitate the export


                                                  3
of its wine, Cipolla (1981, pp53–4.). And in the trade and health dispute between Florence and

Genoa in 1652, quarantines were used to favor domestic over foreign traders as much as to

protect public health. At the same time, the fundamentally mistaken notions of the how the

plague was spread, particularly the overstatement of the risks of person to person contagion, and

the lack of understanding of the role of rats and fleas, led to the imposition of quarantines that

did little to hamper the spread of the plague but which sometimes destroyed the livelihood of a

trade-dependent city, as in Verona in 1575, Cipolla (1992, p. 78). This story of policy-making in

the face of a mistaken understanding and of bitterly contested quarantines was to be repeated into

the 20th Century, see for example Margaret Humphreys on yellow fever in the southern US in the

late 19th century.

    The Pan-American Sanitary Bureau (now PAHO) was founded in 1902, and was the first of

the international public health agencies. Like the public health magistrates in seventeenth century

Italy, the original function was to deal with merchants’ dissatisfaction with the lack of

international coordination of health measures. Fifty years earlier, in 1851, the first international

sanitary conference was held in Europe, as the rising volume of international trade, driven by

reductions in costs from better ships and railways, came into conflict with national health

measures. Not only had national quarantine measures failed to halt the spread of cholera during

the epidemics of the first half of the century, but the measures were costly to merchants who

sought international co-ordination, David Fidler (2001). But these concerns did not lead to

international health control until the setting up of the World Health Organization in 1948.

International public health has always been as much concerned with facilitating trade as with

protecting health and, as many writers have noted, when the two come into conflict, as with


                                                  4
Pistoia’s wine in 1630, or in the dispute between Florence and Genoa in 1652, trade tends to

trump health. In perhaps the most extreme example, Britain went to war with China in 1839–42

to open Chinese markets to the import of British opium from India.

   Disease followed the movement of people as well as of goods. The decimation and even

eradication of the peoples of central America and Oceania by European germs are well-known,

Jared Diamond (1997). In the slave trade between west Africa and the Americas around a sixth of

the victims died during the middle passage, and enough bodies were thrown overboard for sharks

to learn to follow the ships, Encyclopedia Brittanica (2004). Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson

and James Robinson (2001, 2002) argue that patterns of colonization were shaped by the

mortality of white imperialists, so that in places where it was unhealthy for colonists to settle, the

imperial powers set up extractive (plantation and mining) regimes for whom the health of the

native population was of little direct concern. These regimes permanently compromised the

development prospects of the countries which were affected. The Bengal famine of 1770, in

which a third of the population died, did not inspire the East India company to suspend its tax

collection, and Emma Rothschild has argued that this example was very much in the minds of

American colonists in the years leading up to the revolution; taxation without representation was

a recipe for impoverishment and famine.

   Quarantine is used to control the movement of people, as well as of goods. And as was the

case for goods, health policy for immigrants and travelers is always affected by other factors. The

National Institutes of Health in the United States was set up to research yellow fever and cholera

after the first Federal Quarantine Act of 1878. Only federal (or international) agencies can hope

to solve the coordination and verification problems that arise when local (or national) authorities


                                                  5
have unfettered authority to restrict the movement of goods and people. The US Immigration Act

of 1891 excluded those with “loathsome and contagious diseases,” but through a process of

labeling immigrants and ethnic groups as inherently diseased, the quarantine measures became

methods of discrimination and exclusion, even in the absence of threats to public health, Howard

Markel and Alexandra Stern (2002). While it makes obvious sense for a harbor master to refuse

admission to a ship signaling the cholera on board by flying the yellow jack, it is much less clear

that US immigration policies that preclude the entry of those with specified diseases (trachoma a

century ago, AIDS, TB, and syphilis now) has had any positive effect on public health. Indeed,

the US Congress, led by Senator Jesse Helms, made AIDS an excludable disease for immigrants

in 1987 against the opposition of the then Secretary of Health and Human Services. Once again,

the public health was subservient to domestic political needs.



2. Globalization and health: arguments from economics and public health

Although several economists have addressed the health consequences of globalization, health is

most notable by its absence from even critical discussions of globalizations in the economics

literature. Michael Bordo, Alan Taylor, and Jeffrey Williamson’s (2003) edited volume on the

history of globalization has no chapter on health, nor does health appear in the index, an absence

shared by the terms “colonialism” and “slavery,” as noted by Branco Milanovic (2003). The

recent (2004) report of the World Commission on the Social Dimensions of Globalization, whose

membership included globalization critic Joseph Stiglitz, gives only cursory mention to

international health, confining its references to HIV/AIDS and TRIPS (trade-related aspects of

intellectual property rights). Health is evidently not one of the discontents of globalization. The


                                                  6
World Bank’s 2002 flagship publication on globalization, Globalization, growth and poverty,

written by Paul Collier and David Dollar, lists good health and good healthcare provision, along

with education, as essential preconditions for successful globalization, a view that is shared by

many of those who are more critical of globalization, such as Andrea Cornia (2001). Indeed,

since the conditions are not met in much of the world, including most of Africa, this argument is

consistent with the critics’ view that globalization is often harmful to health in the poorest

countries of the world.

   For economists who are broadly in favor of globalization, the story about health runs

something as follows. Stanley Fischer (2003) notes that much of the current disagreement is

factual, whether or not human wellbeing has improved over the past two or three decades. And

as he points out, both life expectancy and child mortality have improved dramatically since 1970,

with the notable exceptions, particularly after 1990, of subSaharan Africa, and to a somewhat

lesser extent, the countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. That globalization

might have had something to do with these improvements comes from the idea that higher

incomes promote better health. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a broad increase in world

incomes, and a reduction in poverty, both as a fraction of the world’s population, and in absolute

numbers. What happened to income inequality is disputed, but the most favorable view,

associated with David Dollar and Aart Kraay (2001), is that there was no relationship between

growth and changes in income inequality so that, on average over countries, the growth in

incomes of the poor was the same as growth at the mean, so that growth was a powerful engine

of poverty reduction. Although this argument has many problems—the data on inequality are not

very good, GDP growth may be overstated and many of the items that are growing more rapidly


                                                  7
neither reach the poor nor are covered in the inequality statistics, Angus Deaton (2004)—there is

little doubt that there has been real poverty reduction in the world as a whole. The link between

income and health in poor countries is typically thought to be strong, Samuel Preston (1975,

1980), Lawrence Summers and Lant Pritchett (1998), so that it is entirely plausible that

globalization-induced poverty reduction has improved population health.

   Even the strongest defenders of globalization note qualifications. Cheaper and faster travel

enhances the dangers of the spread of infectious diseases. When travel was by sea, most

infectious diseases would pass through the incubation period during the voyage and the ship

could be prevented from landing. But a traveler could go six times round the world during the

incubation period of SARS, Sir George Alleyne (2004). The spread of HIV/AIDS was certainly

accelerated by the ease and volume of modern travel. Yet it is surely not the case that reversing

or slowing globalization, even if it were possible, is the appropriate policy response, Dollar

(2001). Indeed it can been argued that the same speeding up of communications makes the

response to the disease faster and more effective, see in particular the WHO’s description of its

response to SARS, WHO (2004). Dollar also notes that the international architecture, particularly

the WTO and TRIPS agreements, needs to be set up in a way that ensures that the health of the

poor is not threatened, for example by undermining occupational or environmental health.

   The literature in the health sciences takes a more negative view of globalization. Some of the

difference is that non-economists take a broad definition of globalization, encompassing not only

the international transfer of goods, information, and ideas, but also such policies as privatization,

user fees, and structural adjustment programs. In much of this literature, globalization is seen, not

as a voluntary expansion of exchange, but as the forced adoption of American models of social


                                                  8
and economic arrangements. Even when such models would not be freely chosen, developing

countries have little choice in the matter because they have little effective power in the

international organizations, such as the World Bank, the IMF, and the World Trade Organization,

which are dominated by western, and particularly American interests. Poor countries lack both

the financial and human resources that would allow them to be equal participants in the

international bodies in which decisions are taken that affect them and, beyond that, in setting the

rules under which the international system operates. Globalization is seen as completing the

unfinished business of colonization, Ronald Labonte (2003).

   One particular source of (widely shared) concern is the 1995 General Agreement on Trade in

Services (GATS), whose (not very clearly defined) provisions can be read as requiring

governments to open national health services to international commercial suppliers of health

services and health insurance; indeed, only “service provided in the exercise of government

authority” are clearly excluded, not those supplied “on a commercial basis, nor in competition

with one or more service suppliers,” Aaditya Mattoo (2003). Such provisions may limit the

ability of governments to design and operate their own health systems, and are seen by many as a

threat to public health. Privatization of health services, even if incomes are growing rapidly (and

perhaps especially if income are growing rapidly), is seen as a threat to the health of the poor,

who are typically served (if at all) by public provision. That there are grounds for such concern is

illustrated by the much slower improvement in population health in China that accompanied the

rapid economic growth after the reforms, Jean Drèze and Amartya Sen (2002, Chapter 4.) The

assessment of the GATS by Leah Belsky et al (2004) suggests that the worst fears may be

exaggerated, but the authors acknowledge that there is a great deal of uncertainty about how the


                                                  9
agreement will operate. There are also concerns about bilateral trade agreements, particularly

between the US and other countries, in which the interests of the US pharmaceutical companies

are strongly represented. Press reports indicate that countries, in exchange for access to American

markets, are pressed to impose high local prices for drugs, threatening the health of their own

citizens, as well as to restrict re-exportation of drugs to the US, threatening the health of

Americans.

   The multinational (especially American) pharmaceutical industry is under attack by the

opponents of globalization for putting profits ahead of lives. Defenders accuse their critics of

wilfully misunderstanding the trade-offs involved between funding research and selling drugs,

although it is not always clear how much of the basic research was funded by the companies as

opposed to US taxpayers through NIH. US trade policy is seen as serving corporate interests,

particularly those of the pharmaceutical industry. One acrimonious debate has been over the $15

billion promised by the Bush administration for fighting AIDS, and whether these funds may be

spent on the cheaper (and likely more effective) anti-retroviral drugs manufactured in India. Even

so, it is far from clear that the unavailability of patented drugs is the main barrier to population

health in poor countries, many of whom have weak health delivery systems that already fail to

deliver many essential drugs that are not under patent. Other multinational corporations,

particularly in tobacco and food, are also seen as a threat to public health. Smoking began as a

luxury for the rich in rich countries, but as the health risks became apparent, it became a habit of

the poor in rich countries. Even that is now under threat, as public health legislation, law suits,

and taxation make it more and more difficult to sell tobacco in the west. Consumers in poor

countries may be the next safe haven for tobacco, and while WTO rules allow governments to


                                                  10
control tobacco sales, provided they do not discriminate between domestic and foreign brands,

some countries worry that their ability to regulate is no match for well-funded international

corporations. Food companies are also seen as a threat, and the WHO and other health writers

emphasize the growing “epidemic” of obesity in poor countries, noting that Africa is now the

only continent in which the majority of deaths are from infectious diseases, rather from heart

disease and cancer, World Health Report (2004). Of course, the rise in non-communicable

disease is in large part the result of reductions in infectious disease child mortality, both of which

are entirely positive developments. And some of the increase in obesity comes from the fact that

fewer people in poor countries now engage in manual labor; and even in the US, there is far from

general agreement on the causes of recent increases in obesity, and what role, if any, has been

played by fast food companies, see for example David Cutler, Edward Glaeser, and Jesse Shapiro

(2003.)

   Anti-globalizers also challenge the economists on their own ground. They question whether

globalization has promoted economic growth in general, and argue that it has widened income

inequalities, both within countries, and between them. Contrary to the standard economic model

in which more open trade reduces the return to labor in the labor-scarce north, while increasing it

in the labor-rich south, thus narrowing the difference between them, they argue that globalization

has benefitted the rich and hurt the poor in both the north and the south, while leaving behind (or

making worse off) whole countries that are unable to participate in globalization, because they

lack geographical access, or an educated and healthy population. Such arguments receive some

support from a recent economic literature that investigates trade in intermediate goods, or

outsourcing, which replaces high cost but relatively low-skill western workers with highly-


                                                 11
trained but much cheaper workers in developing countries, particularly India, Robert Feenstra

and Gordon Hanson (2001), Susan Zhu and Daniel Trefler (2001). It is argued that increases in

income inequality undermine social cohesion, and are bad for population health, not just for

those who lose out, but also for everyone who lives in a less equal society, Richard Wilkinson

(1996, 2002), Ichiro Kawachi, Wilkinson, and Bruce Kennedy (1999). The critics note that,

overall, health in the south has not improved as rapidly in the 90s as it did in the 80s; for

example, infant mortality rates in India fell by 30 percent in the 1980s but only by 12.5 percent in

the 1990s, Deaton and Drèze (2002), and indeed the rate of decline in child mortality in the

1990s was lower than in the 1980s in all of the WHO’s regions except the Western Pacific, Omar

Ahmad, Alan Lopez, and Mie Inoue (2000).

   That the income distribution has widened between countries is correct, and many countries

have indeed seen widening domestic income inequality. Yet it is also true that, because the

economies of India and China have grown so rapidly in the 90s, income distribution among the

citizens of the world has become more equal. In any case, there is no evidence that income

inequality by itself is a risk to population health, Deaton (2003); the early (and immensely

influential) cross-country correlations between life-expectancy and income inequality, Wilkinson

(1992), were driven by flawed measures of inequality and cannot be reproduced with credible

data.



3. Life-expectancy, incomes, and the gifts of globalization

The starting point for any discussion about incomes, health, and knowledge, is Samuel Preston’s

(1975) investigation into the changing relationship between life-expectancy and GDP. The


                                                 12
millennium version of the Preston curve is shown in Figure 1, which plots country life-

expectancy (using circles whose size is proportional to population) against per capita GDP in

purchasing power parity dollars. The curve is a non-parametrically fitted regression function,

weighted by population. For the current argument, the main feature of this curve is that the slope

of life-expectancy with respect to income is steep among the poorest countries. While no one

would argue that the slope of a regression function is the same as the effect of income on life-

expectancy, many writers have found it plausible that, at low incomes, income itself is an

important (perhaps the most important) determinant of health. Preston himself argued that

technical change in private and public health knowledge was more important overall (or about

equally important, Preston, 1980) than changes in income, but noted that the poorest countries

had benefitted little from new knowledge, presumably because the implementation and adoption

of even inexpensive techniques cannot be done without money. Adequate nutrition is also an

important determinant of health in poor countries, and the link between income, food, and

nutrition is a direct and obvious one. The same can be said for the construction of clean-water

supplies and for waste disposal. Such arguments are central to the economists’ case that

globalization is indirectly good for health, at least in those countries where globalization has

increased per capita income.

   Figure 2 shows the changes on changes version of Figure 1, plotting changes in life-

expectancy from 1960 to 2000 against the corresponding average annual rate of growth of GDP

in real PPP dollars. The relationship here is much weaker and the positive slope depends almost

entirely on China (an unweighted regression has an insignificant slope that is only one fifth of the

size), whose increase in life-expectancy since 1960 reflects not only genuine new progress, but


                                                 13
also that 1960 was a year of crisis mortality during the “Great Leap Forward.” Between 1970 and

2000, when life-expectancy in China increased, not by 34 years, but by 8.5 years, the worldwide

correlation between the growth rate of GDP and the change in life-expectancy is only 0.18, and

the population weighted regression corresponding to Figure 2 has a slope of 0.2 with a t-value of

only 1.9. Both the slope and its significance increase somewhat among the initially poorest

countries; for the 26 (58) countries whose logarithm of real per capita GDP in 1970 was less than

7 (8), the slope is 0.49 (0.32), with a t-values of 2.1 (2.2). The connection between income and

life-expectancy at low incomes may be plausible but, even among the initially poorest countries,

differences in income growth explain less than a sixth of the variance in improvements in life-

expectancy, and even an increase in the 30-year growth rate by 2 percent a year would add only 1

year to life-expectancy. Even if it were accepted that globalization increases growth rates under

suitable conditions, then this is a weak channel through which globalization might improve

health. Of course, the argument works the other way too. If globalization has indeed

impoverished some countries, the effect on their population health has also likely been modest.

   The weak relationship between growth and gains in life-expectancy calls for discussion. It

simply defies belief that the low levels of life-expectancy on the left of the Preston curve in

Figure 1 have nothing to do with poverty. In which case we would expect those countries that

have done the most to eliminate poverty over the last forty years to be those showing the greatest

gains in life-expectancy. Among many economists, including those who believe in the indirect

health benefits of globalization, that this relationship holds is taken as proven fact, and the

citation most frequently given is Pritchett and Summers’ aptly-titled paper “Wealthier is

healthier.” Yet Pritchett and Summers, although they use a different selection of data and a


                                                  14
shorter time period, find exactly the same result as here, that changes in life-expectancy are

insignificantly related to changes in real income. The finding of their title comes from the

relationship between income and infant (or child mortality) not life expectancy. As they point

out, estimates of life-expectancy for a good number of countries are derived from measures of

infant and child mortality (though this is less so now, given the importance of HIV/AIDS), which

makes it surprising that the relationships with income would be so different. The tracking down

of these discrepancies is an important task, but is beyond the scope of this paper.

   The literature on mortality decline in poor countries provides many clues towards resolving

the conflict between the strong effects of income in Figure 1, and the weak or absent effects in

Figure 2. While income makes many things possible in the long run, the more important

proximate determinants of mortality decline are clean water, health systems, a demand for

adequate and adequately operated health systems, and basic sanitary knowledge. The provision of

the last two has much to do with education, particularly the education of women, and all seem to

depend on active participation in health matters of people and, see in particular Jack Caldwell

(1978, 1981) and Drèze and Sen (2002). To this “integrated” route to mortality decline, many

would add the “vertical” and externally-driven (by WHO and other international agencies)

disease eradication campaigns against malaria, smallpox, river blindness, and polio, as well as

the later campaigns for immunization, breast-feeding, growth monitoring, and oral-rehydration

therapy. All of these routes to mortality decline have been effective, and sometimes have been so

in the absence of economic growth. In some cases, as in China after the economic reforms,

growth may actually hinder progress, at least for a time. Yet it is hard to imagine many of these

programs being sustained in the long-run in the absence of growth if only because education and


                                                 15
health are themselves the foundations of higher incomes in the future. Indeed, Drèze and Sen

argue that it is unlikely that post-reform growth in China could have taken place without the

health and literacy achievements that provided it. More broadly, the WHO’s (2001) Commission

on Macroeconomics and Health has recently emphasized the economic benefits that are to be

expected from improvements in health. While the statistical analysis to support this picture

largely remains to be done, it is consistent with both Figures 1 and 2.

   I now turn to the distributions of growth and increases in life-expectancy over countries. The

first panel of Table 1 shows the changes in life expectancy by decade, starting in 1960. Even if

we exclude China between 1960 and 1970, the rate of improvement of life-expectancy was

declining throughout the period. To some extent, this is a consequence of the population health

reversals during the last decade in subSaharan Africa and in Eastern Europe and the countries of

the former Soviet Union. But life-expectancy rose less rapidly in the 1990s than in the 1980s,

even though per capita growth rates were typically higher. In poor countries not affected by

HIV/AIDS, this slowdown comes from a virtually worldwide reduction in the rate of decline in

child mortality rates.

   The second panel presents the data on growth rates of GDP. World growth rates were higher

in the 1990s than in the 1980s, a result that is driven by Asia, by the Middle East and North

Africa, and by Latin America, which partially recovered from negative growth in the 1980s.

Notable exceptions to the pattern are subSaharan Africa and Eastern Europe. One simple way of

looking at both health and income together is to multiply income per capita by the number of

years which a newborn can expect to receive it, and growth rates of this product are presented in

the final panel. The behavior of this more comprehensive measure is similar to that of real


                                                 16
income. SubSaharan Africa does much better in the 1960s and 1970s, because there were

substantial reductions in child mortality in spite of weak or non-existent economic growth, and

much worse in the 1980s and 1990s, because of HIV/AIDS. In Asia, strong economic growth has

been accompanied by substantial reductions in mortality and the growth of the compound

measure has been consistently high.

   The relationship between income and health is further explored in Figures 3 and 4. As is

often the case with international comparisons, results depend on whether countries are treated as

single points, with each country treated as a unit, as is appropriate when we are looking at the

effects of policies of which there is one per country, or whether countries are weighted by

population, as is required for welfare calculations where we care about people, not countries.

Figure 3 shows that the improvement in life-expectancy between 1970 and 2000 was greater for

people living in countries with lower GDP in 1960, the weighted line, but was lower for

countries with lower GDP in 1960, the unweighted line. In Figure 4, we see that for both

countries and people, the gain in life-expectancy from 1970 to 2000 was greater for those whose

life-expectancy was lower in 1960. The countries in the bottom left of both figures which show a

fall in life-expectancy are mostly in subSaharan Africa, and without them and the effects of

HIV/AIDS, both relationships would have been stronger. I have drawn these graphs with 1960 on

the x-axis, in order to avoid a spurious negative slope from measurement error (or white noise) in

life-expectancy estimates. Another way to do the same thing is to regress the change in life

expectancy from 1970 to 2000 on life-expectancy in 1970, using life expectancy in 1960 as an

instrument. It is also possible to look at the joint effect of base ln(GDP) and life-expectancy

simultaneously, but both become individually (although not jointly) significant. The data cannot


                                                 17
support estimates of their separate effects.

   That the least healthy countries have seen the largest increases in life-expectancy does not

necessarily imply that international inequality in life-expectancy is decreasing. However, Table 2

shows that inequality has in fact fallen. Between 1960 and 2000, when the population weighted

average of life-expectancy at birth rose from 49 (heavily affected by China) to 67, the standard

deviation of life-expectancy across countries fell from 12.8 to 11.1 years in 1990, rising to 12.0

in 2000 in consequence of HIV/AIDS in Africa. Across people, the decline in inequality is even

more dramatic, from 12.9 to 8.1 in 1990, rising only to 8.7 years in 2000. Both sets of numbers

ignore the within-country component of dispersion in life-expectancy at birth, and the population

weighted numbers are heavily affected by India and China, and downplay the African experience.

As the next two columns show, the behavior of the cross-country dispersion of per capita GDP is

quite different from that of life-expectancy. Convergence, if it takes place at all, is much weaker.

With each country as a unit, the variance of logs of GDP has been increasing and there is no

convergence in GDP per capita, even in logarithms. This is the “increasing inequality between

countries” that is emphasized in the public health literature. By contrast, once we weight by

population, the standard deviation of log GDP declined from 1980 to 2000. Because I am

ignoring inequality within countries, which has been increasing in many countries, including

India and China, these figures overstate the decline in interpersonal inequality. But because the

between country component contributed more to overall inequality than does the within country

component, overall inequality in the world has been improving, see for example François

Bourguignon and Christian Morrisson (2002). As has been widely recognized, rapid progress in

India and China since 1980 is driving much of this result.


                                                 18
   In a recent paper, Gary Becker, Tomas Philipson, and Rodrigo Soares (2002) have argued

that changes in income should be combined with the changes in life-expectancy to give a more

comprehensive (“full income”) measure of well-being, and that once this is done, the divergence

in per capita incomes across countries turns into convergence in full income. Becker and

Philpson’s calculations use values of additional life years from Kip Viscusi and Joseph Aldy’s

(2003) international compendium of market based estimates, and also include a calculation of the

utility gain from the increased opportunities for intertemporal substitution associated with longer

life. A cruder (albeit simpler) calculation comes from ignoring the value of intertemporal

substitution and looking at the measure presented in the last panel of Table 1, the product of life-

expectancy and per capita GDP. The final columns of Table 1 show what has happened to the

dispersion of this approximation to full income. As is the case for income per capita, dispersion

in the logarithm of full income has been increasing, while dispersion over people has been

decreasing. Because the gain in life-expectancy adds more to the growth in full income in the

poorest countries, the reduction in dispersion over people of (log) full income is a good deal

more marked than that in per capita income.

   The increase in health and in full income in the poorest countries, in Latin America and

Africa in the 1970s and 1980s, and in Asia since 1960, represents a large increase in well-being.

And these gains followed even faster gains in many poor countries in the decade immediately

after the Second World War, Davidson Gwatkin (1980), an issue to which I shall return. While it

is unlikely that much of the health gains came from growth in income, let alone from

globalization induced growth in income, globalization in the broader sense has much to do with

them. A substantial fraction of health gains in poor countries are generated by the transfer of


                                                 19
knowledge from rich countries, about vaccines, about antibiotics, and ultimately about the germ

theory of disease, all of which was originally discovered or formulated in the (now) rich

countries. In this sense, the first world has been responsible for producing the global public

goods of medical and health-related research and development, from which everyone has

benefitted, in poor and now rich countries alike. Of course, not all of the gains are pure gifts from

North to South; many cannot be implemented without substantial investments in education and in

physical infrastructure, nor without a sometimes lengthy process by which new information and

ways of doing things are absorbed into the population as a whole.

   There is also a serious questions whether “full income” or life-expectancy does not overstate,

or at least seriously mismeasure the true welfare gains in poor countries. The estimates of the

value of life are computed from a conceptual experiment in which adults reveal their willingness

to pay for a reduction in the risk of dying. Even if we accept that such measures of the value of

risk reduction can be legitimately converted, using expected utility theory, into the value of

extending life, then it does not necessarily follow that we can use these measures to assess the

value of reductions in infant and child mortality which, until the advent of HIV/AIDS, was the

main force driving changes in life-expectancy in poor countries.

   To illustrate, suppose that in the initial situation, a half of all children die at, or immediately

after, birth, while those who do not die live until they are 60, so that life-expectancy is 30. We

then introduce immunization, oral rehydration therapy, and antibiotics, and clean up the water

supply, after which only one quarter of children die, so that life expectancy rises by 15 years to

45. By the Becker et al calculation, everyone gets an additional 15 years, each of which is valued

at per capita annual GDP. But this is hardly the end of the story. In the initial situation, women


                                                  20
had many children, knowing that many would die. In a healthier world, they will have fewer.

Suppose, after a possibly long transition, the total fertility rate is reduced from 6 to 4, so that each

woman has exactly the same number of children (3) who survive beyond birth. Once this new

equilibrium has been established, both the size and the age-structure of the population are exactly

the same as they were before the health innovations.

    It is clear that, in this situation, the increase in welfare is not correctly assessed by valuing the

additional life-expectancy at per capita GDP or any other income-based number. Indeed, given

that there are exactly the same number of people as before, enjoying (by assumption) the same

level of lifetime income, it would be tempting to conclude that welfare has not changed. But that

would miss the gain to the mothers, who now bear fewer children in order to have the same

number of surviving offspring, whose own health is improved, who have wider opportunities to

do other things, and who are (at least in part) spared the agony of watching their children die. But

there is no reason to suppose that these gains to the mothers are related to the increased life

expectancy at birth of their infants. (Although the mothers themselves are likely to live longer.)

What about the value of the lives of the children who are saved? One possibility is to count, as a

welfare gain, the 60 years of life for the quarter of children who would have died, but who now

survive. This would be one additional 60-year lifespan for each mother. But if we count these

lives, we must also subtract the value of the equal number of lives that would have been, but

which are now not lived, because their mothers choose not to give birth to those who would have

lived them, John Broome (2003). There are two babies per mother who would not have been

born, one of whom would have survived, and whose lost lifespan needs to be offset against that

of the born child who survives. Either way, we reach the same result, which is that the only gain,


                                                   21
and certainly the most important one, is the better lives lived by the mothers.



4. Globalization and the determinants of health

It is hard to think about the relationship between globalization and health without taking some

view of the determinants of the long term worldwide decline in mortality rates. If income is the

primary determinant of mortality decline, then the globalization and health question depends on

the familiar argument about the effects of globalization on income, on which I have nothing new

to say. But as I argued above, growth in income is not strongly predictive of declines in mortality,

and the finding here is consistent with other evidence, both econometric, Dean Jamison, Martin

Sandbu and Jia Wang (2001), and historical, Richard Easterlin (1996, 1999), Preston (1975,

1980, 1996), Joel Mokyr (2004), that the transmission of health knowledge and technology is at

least as important as changes in income.

   Another possible argument, following Richard Wilkinson, is that mortality in rich countries is

primarily determined not by income, but by income inequality, so that the effect of globalization

on rich country health depends on the effects of globalization on rich country income inequality.

Like the effects on income, the effects of globalization on income inequality are well-debated.

But even if we were to accept the argument that, at least in some rich countries, some of the

increase in income inequality has come from globalization, there is no good evidence that

national mortality rates are affected by national income inequality, see Deaton (2003). The

possible exception is infant mortality rates, where low income still has an effect, even in rich

countries so that, at a given level of income per head, more income inequality means more

poverty, and higher infant mortality, see also Kenneth Judge and Michaela Benzeval (1997).


                                                 22
   Perhaps the most promising line of enquiry is one that considers the effects of globalization

on the transmission of health knowledge and health technology. Lowering the costs of trade will

speed the rate at which new therapies are installed in one country, having been proved effective

in another, and this might be important for health for such items as neonatal intensive care units

(NICUs), kidney dialysis equipment, screening equipment, and cardiac units, for example, as

well as with earlier and lower technology interventions in poor countries, all of which have been

connected with declining mortality. Similarly, cheaper and more rapid transmission of

information, through international television transmission and the internet, will speed up the

transmission of ideas, for example about the health consequences of smoking, exercise, or the

use of salt, as well as inexpensive medical procedures, such as the use of beta-blockers or aspirin

in the treatment of heart attacks. While these ideas do not change health without being

incorporated into behavior, institutions, and access, processes that sometimes take time, there

remains a presumption that cheaper and faster information flows will enhance the speed at which

health knowledge is transmitted.

   These transmission effects, if they are important, will generate two effects that we can look

for in the data. First, international movements in health indicators, particularly mortality rates,

should be more closely coordinated than once was the case, particularly for causes of death where

health technology and knowledge are important. Second, as emphasized by Easterlin (1996),

there will be pressure for mortality rates to converge across countries. In the simplest case, a new

technique is introduced in one place so that the relevant mortality rate falls, followed by similar

falls elsewhere. If the transmission of delayed or prevented, mortality rates can diverge, and

initially similar mortality rates may become widely dispersed, at least for a while. And if there is


                                                  23
a stream of new therapies, with some places adopting more rapidly than others, there will be a

variable gap between leaders and followers, albeit with mortality rates falling everywhere.

Matters are complicated further if disease depends in part on cumulative exposure, as in the link

between smoking and cancer.

   That transmission of technology is important was previously argued in Deaton and Christina

Paxson (2004), who compared the time-series evidence on age-specific mortality rates for males

and females between the US and the UK. Although mortality rates are higher in the US until

about age 60, their evidence showed that changes in mortality trends for infants and for middle-

aged men and women tended to show up in the US about four years prior to similar appearance in

the UK. Although techniques are not necessarily invented in the US, the competitive and for-

profit healthcare system allows their speedier introduction than in the government-controlled and

less well-funded British system, see e.g. Henry Aaron and William Schwartz (1984). Hence, if

new technologies such as neonatal intensive care units, cardiac bypass grafts, beta-blockers, and

catheterization do actually save lives, we would observe this pattern of lags in mortality rates. Of

course, none of this rules out alternative explanations, such as the spread of infectious disease

(AIDS mortality shows a similar pattern of the US leading the UK in mortality increase), or

health-related behaviors, particularly smoking.

   Figure 5 refines the all-cause mortality plots in Deaton and Paxson (2004) by focusing on

cardiovascular disease for males and females aged 50 to 64 from 1950 to 2000 for the US and

Britain; this is the cause of death where technical progress has arguably had the greatest impact.

For males, the patterns are the same in both countries, with mortality relatively flat or rising in

the early years, and then declining thereafter, by a half or more in both countries. However, the


                                                  24
decline in mortality in the US starts around 1970, which appears to be before the new techniques

were available, but not until a decade later in Britain, a substantially longer lag than the four

years in all-cause mortality. The pattern for women, if it exists at all, is much less pronounced.

For both men and women, these mortality rates are essentially the same by te end of the century.

While the acceleration in mortality decline in Britain after 1980 is apparent, there is no obvious

sustained change in the US. Of course, there are other factors affecting mortality, of which likely

the most important is smoking. However, patterns of tobacco use were similar in the two

countries over the two periods. In the 1950s, both American and British men were much more

likely to be smokers than women, While the prevalence of smoking among men declined

throughout the period, that among women increased until the mid-1970s, achieving parity with

men in Britain, and close to it in the US. Thereafter, the prevalence of smoking declines in

parallel for both men and women. Smoking is a risk factor for heart disease though, unlike lung

cancer, the risk is thought to be reduced or eliminated immediately after quitting. In consequence,

these patterns of smoking do little to explain the differences in male-female mortality from CVD,

nor do they offer an alternative to the technology story for the increase in the rate of mortality

decline.

   Figure 6 shows all-cause mortality for the countries in the OECD. Once again, we see the

characteristic patterns of health transmission among males, but not among females. The patterns

of mortality decline are strongly correlated across countries, and beyond that, for males but not

females, there is increasing convergence of rates. In 1950, mortality rates for men in this age

group ranged from 1 percent to more than 2 percent. By 2000, and with the exception of late-

comer Korea, the rates cluster between 0.8 and 1.3 percent. Figure 7 shows the same plots, but


                                                  25
for mortality from cardiovascular disease alone. Because this is such a large share of total

mortality, it shows that much of the convergence in mortality rates is driven by what has been

happening to cardiovascular mortality. Unlike the case of all-cause mortality, there is evidence of

convergence and of some acceleration in the rate of mortality decline among women as well as

among men.

   These patterns can be reconciled with reference to international patterns of smoking. Figure

8, taken from the International Mortality and Smoking Statistics data base, Barbara Forey, John

Hamling, Peter Lee, and Nicholas Wald (2002), show survey based estimates of prevalence rates

of smoking (of manufactured cigarettes) for five year periods from 1951–55. These figures are

age-adjusted by applying five-year age-specific prevalence to a standard European population. It

is clear that different countries have responded very differently to the common knowledge about

the health risks of smoking. Almost everywhere at the beginning of the period, men were more

likely than women to smoke, and almost everywhere the differential narrowed between 1950 and

2000. In most OECD countries, although not all, there has been a consistent, long-term decline in

the prevalence of smoking among men. In some countries, particularly the English speaking

countries, the US, Canada, Britain, New Zealand, Australia, and Ireland, prevalence of cigarette

smoking was falling for both men and women well before the end of the century. However, for

much of the rest of Europe, the fraction of women smoking is still rising in the latest surveys, and

there are some countries, particularly in Eastern Europe, where prevalence continues to rise for

both men and women. Overall, smoking prevalence is generally declining for men, and there is

some international narrowing in the dispersion of rates. For women, by contrast, there is no

general decline in prevalence, and little convergence.


                                                26
    These smoking patterns have clear counterparts in international patterns of mortality from

lung-cancer, which are shown in Figure 9. For men, lung-cancer mortality rates rose for most of

the period, and international rates diverged, along with international smoking patterns, but by the

late 1980s, mortality rates were declining in many countries, and beginning to converge. Lung

cancer mortality among women, like prevalence of smoking among women, started from much

lower levels than for men, but is still rising and diverging in most countries, although the

beginnings of a decline can be seen in some. These lung-cancer mortality rates are only a fraction

of the mortality rates from cardiovascular disease, only a fifth for men and less for women, and

cigarettes are likely responsible for more deaths through heart than lung disease. But taking both

together, it is clear that, at least after the mid-1970s, therapeutic improvements have been

working together with changes in behavior for men, but largely against one another for women.

(Note that there has been little or no progress in the treatment of lung-cancer.) And because the

smoking behavior of women differs so much from country to country, and there is no

convergence, we do not see the convergence in mortality among women that is so clear among

men. Note too that an “all smoking” explanation is insufficient, if only because of the (albeit

limited) progress and convergence in female mortality, in spite of the lack of a general decline in

smoking and a divergence in the prevalence of smoking. Nor is there any sharp decline in the

prevalence of smoking among men around 1970–80, which would explain the marked

acceleration in the rate of mortality decline, in general, and for cardiovascular disease in

particular.




                                                 27
5. Summary and conclusions

The health of nations is as globally interdependent now as it has been in the past. In the first

wave of globalization, or rather colonization, the transmission of disease to populations with no

immunity played a central role, not only in the decimation of peoples, but in the conquest of the

New World by the Old. Later in the era of colonization, patterns of settlement and exploitation,

including who colonized whom, and what mode of colonization and exploitation resulted,

depended on the ability of potential settlers and colonizers to deal with the burden of local

disease. The movement of people propagated, and was conditioned by, the patterns of disease.

Today, the health of most people in the world, in rich as well as poor countries, depends on their

ability to adopt locally health knowledge and health technologies that have been discovered and

developed elsewhere.

   In the middle of the 20th Century, child mortality rates, and with them life-expectancy,

improved throughout poor countries. Gwatkin (1980) labels this as the third of three great waves

of mortality decline. The first, starting at the end of the 19th century, began in North and Western

Europe, and was quickly transmitted to the United States. The second wave, beginning in the

1920s, was in South and Eastern Europe, and the rate of gain of life-expectancy was even more

rapid than in the first, with some countries showing increases in life-expectancy of more than

half a year per year over a decade or more. Because this second wave had the experience and

knowledge of the first to draw on, it could be more rapid, and by the middle of the 20th Century,

life expectancies in the south and east of Europe were close to those in the north and west.

Gwatkin’s third great wave was in the poor countries, and began in earnest after the Second

World War, greatly aided by international public health efforts, particularly by the WHO and by


                                                 28
UNICEF. In some countries, the increase in life expectancy was greater than a year per year, and

in a few cases, such as Mauritius and Sri Lanka, faster than two years per year.

   Again, much of the progress came from applying the knowledge gained in the earlier waves.

As Preston (1960) writes: “With the exception of water and sewerage improvements and

smallpox vaccination, the techniques of preventative and curative healthcare that have been

widely deployed in LDCs are twentieth century products. Virtually all were facilitated by the

ultimate acceptance of the revelatory germ theory of disease at the turn of the century” (p 304).

Yet there were new tools too, and much of the most rapid progress in the 1940s and 1950s came

from vector control, particularly DDT spraying against malaria, and from the use of newly

developed antibiotics against tuberculosis. Although some of the progress was subsequently

reversed, new treatments became available, particularly oral rehydration therapy after 1979, and

there was continued in coverage of immunization. And while gains in income were undoubtedly

important, for improving nutrition, and for funding for better water and sanitation schemes, some

countries made progress in reducing child mortality even in the absence of economic growth,

recapitulating the history of health improvements in Europe 50 to 75 years before. This wave of

health improvement ultimately came from the globalization of knowledge, facilitated by local

political, economic, and educational conditions.

   More recently, mortality decline among the rich countries of the world has depended on

transmission of new knowledge and technology, and in particular, as I have tried to demonstrate

above, by the diffusion of knowledge about the risks of cigarette smoking, and by the diffusion of

new techniques for saving the lives of those with cardiovascular disease. The medical changes,

although in some cases expensive, diffuse more rapidly than do changes in behavior, which


                                                29
respond slowly and unevenly to changes in knowledge about risks. Indeed, there are important

parallels between the slow changes in cigarette habits and the slow adoption of the germ-theory

of disease into individual behavior almost a century earlier, Nancy Tomes (2000).

   Among countries that are not in the richest group, the convergence of health slowed towards

the end of the 20th century. When we look at the 50-64 year old group outside of the OECD, and

redraw the figures on all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates, the picture is very different.

Mortality rates in Eastern Europe and the countries of the former soviet union show mortality

increases and mortality divergence, not mortality decreases and mortality convergence. And in

Latin America and the Caribbean, the other area that is covered by the WHO mortality statistics,

the decline of mortality is much slower, and there is only very limited evidence of convergence.

There is clearly a long way to go before the habits and technology of the rich countries are fully

adopted even in middle-income countries.

   Among the poorest countries, the gifts of global health have been diminishing or otherwise

limited in the 1990s. Declines in child mortality have been less rapid in the 1990s than they were

in the 1980s, perhaps because the easy gains were made earlier. By 2000, the HIV/AIDS

epidemic had widened the gap in life-expectancy between Europe and North America on the one

hand and sub-Saharan Africa to more than its level in 1950. If we accept the argument that health

is largely determined by the transfer of technology and knowledge, the current state of mortality

from the epidemic in Africa is evidence of the failure of globalization to transfer effective anti-

retroviral drug-based technology and treatment from the rich countries to sub-Saharan Africa.

More broadly, there are 10.5 million child deaths each year that are preventable in the sense that

those children would not have died had they been born in rich countries, Lopez (2000). The


                                                 30
model in which global public health goods are produced by the rich countries and made available

to all has yet to work in this case.

    While AIDS is arguably unique, and indeed antiretrovirals are the only important case where

drugs listed as “essential medicines” by the WHO are still on patent, Amir Attaran (2004), it is

hardly an exception that can be ignored. There are between 25 to 28 million people in sub-

Saharan Africa who are infected with HIV/AIDS, of which 2.2 to 2.4 million are dying each year.

Many of these deaths are preventable and would be prevented with adequate resources. People

who live in rich countries have full access to the technology that prevents, or at least long

postpones, death from AIDS. People who live in poor countries do not. And it is this inequality

in outcomes, not only from AIDS, but also from measles, from diarrhea, and from pneumonia,

that fuels much of the anger that is so characteristic of the literature in health. As illustrated in

Section 3, the last half century has seen enormous advances in knowledge that have generated

unprecedented declines in mortality among the citizens of the rich countries. These advances will

eventually reach the poor of the world so that, in the long run, they too will benefit, but in the

meantime we are living with appalling inequalities, in which the poor of the world die of AIDS

and, more broadly, where poor people around the world die of diseases that are readily

preventable elsewhere, including in the first-world hospitals and clinics that serve the rich in

poor countries. What is required is not less globalization, but more, or at least more globalization

of a different kind. Deaths that can be prevented should be prevented, and they will be prevented

if we can find faster ways of diffusing first-world health technologies, including the creation of

the economic, educational, and political conditions that would permit their more rapid diffusion.

Notes: Life-Expectancy from World Development Indicators, (separately) population weighted for all countries available in 1960, 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000,
and changes calculated on a regional basis. GDP is real chain weighted gross domestic product per capita from the Penn World Table, and is also population
weighted. The last two panels are calculated only for those countries with non-missing values for both life-expectancy and PWT GDP. There are 106 such
countries in 1960, 110 in 1970, 115 in 1980, and 131 in 1990 and 2000. The life-expectancy data in the first panel use data from 161 countries in 1960, 162 in
1970, 173 in 1980, 188 in 1990, and 191 in 2000.
