                                      ABSTRACT



     This paper argues that a price wedge treatment of

agricultural surports can seriously misrepresent their welfare
and quantity effects.        We make our point by focusing on pre-1985
US wheat programs, but features of programs in many other

countries lead to comparable problems with the ad valorem

approach.    This line of argument raises questions over the

current approach in the multilateral trade negotiations of

negotiating on producer subsidy equivalents (PSEs)              or some other

subsidy-like measure.

I.      Introduction

        Numerical models of the effects of domestic agricultural support

programs usually treat them     as   subsidizing production, in effect introducing a

series of ad valorem distortions or price "wedges" between foreign and

domestic prices.2 The     purpose    of this paper is to argue that a price wedge

treatment of agricultural supports can seriously misrepresent their welfare

and quantity effects.     We make our point by focusing on pre—1985 US wheat

programs3, but features of programs in many other countries lead to comparable

problems with the ad valorem approach.4       This line of argument raises

questions over the current approach in the multilateral trade negotiations of

negotiating on producer subsidy equivalents (PSEs), or some other subsidy—like

measure.

        The essence of the argument in the US wheat case is that since cossnodity

programs are voluntary, producers who receive deficiency payments must also

comply with acreage limitations.       Farms who are already participating   in

support programs will increase output if price supports increase.       But at the

same   tine,   previouslynon—participating   farms will be encouraged to enter the

program if price supports increase, and they will set aside land which was

previously in use.      Thus, rather than simply subsidizing output, the program

as a whole nay have production incentive or disincentive effects, depending on

the relative strength of the price effects for farms already participating,

and the land set—aside effects for new program participants.

       It is, therefore, misleading to represent these programs as equivalent

to an ad valorem subsidy which unambiguously increases output, as is done in

price wedge models.     The welfare costs of support programs will be mismeasured

by an approach using an ad valorem treatment, since the resources idled as a
                                           2




result of the set—asides are not explicitly modelled.        Whet is needed to

capture the effects of programs on output and welfare is to explicitly model

the program participation   decision of fames.

      Generating unambiguous analytical results from models with set—asides

and endogenous participation     decisions is something that the existing

literature has been unable to do.     Coyle et al. (1985) calculate the costs of

set-asides, but use exogenoualy specified      o Jcipation   responaes.   De Coerter

(1986) also analyzes the effects of set—asides, demonstrating      that there are

no simple qualitative analytical results,      Nowhere, to our !mowledge. are the

marginal effects of these prograrmees and the iccplicacions for output and

welfare folly disoussed.

      We use a numerical general equilibrium model0 in which set—asides are

explicitly modelled,   along with endogenous participation decisions of farms.

We use data for 1981 to which we calibrate the model,      This allows ua to

analyze the joint impact of US price supports and set—aaidea on US wheat

output, and calculate the social coat of these programs.

      Our numerical results show, in contraat to what ia predicted by

conventional price wedge models, that removing price aupporta for wheat given

1981 program characteristics   reduces rather than increases output, because of

the impact on participation decisions and aasociated set aaidea.       Comparing

our welfare evaluations of the aociai cost of program supports to those

obtained using the same data in a traditional "price wedge" model, shows that

resuits are sharply different.

barley, and rye) in the US are largely provided through Commodity

deficiency payments.     These jointly have the effect of raising prices received

by farmers.

        Under the Commodity Loan rogra1n, the Commodity Credit Corporation

      6
(CCC)     makes non—recourse loans to farmers using commodities (wheat) as
                                                     warehouses.      These loans
security, stored either on the farm or in commercial

nature on demand, but on or before the loan's maturity date farmers have the
                                                       off the loan plus any
option of regaining possession of their crop by paying

accrued interest, or forfeiting    the farm or warehouse—stored   commodities to

the CCC as full payment of the loan.     This component of price supports

effectively operates through the setting of the loan rate.

          Deficiency payments are based on the difference between the target price

and the higher of the national average market price and the loan rate.       This

difference is multiplied by the established yield of each farmer's land to

determine his total deficiency payment.     Prior to 1985 established yields were

                                                         of preceding years
typically re—calculated using a five—year moving average

yields on a farm—by—farm basis.      Under this system, subject to a lag, higher

yields imply higher deficiency payments.      In effect, marginal output receives

the support (target) price.     One of the major changes in the 1985 Farm Bill is

the attempt to 'decouple' deficiency payments from

output by fixing established yields.
                                                                             as a
          Acreage set asides coexist with these two methods of price support

condition for any farm receiving support.      To receive deficiency payments on

                                                                          are

base acreage.

            The aim of these                              set—aside requirements        is   to reduce surpLus production

thought          to   be generated by the price supports!                                    However, the joint effect of

      Farms differ in a range of characteristics,    including the crop in which

farms have a comparative advantage,    land quality, and the ease with which land

and other inputs can be substituted.    Typically, for any given levels of

                                              it will pay some farms to
target and market prices and set—aside rates,

participate and others not.8

      If farms are ranked by th'ir relative profits from participating and

non—participating   and are indexed by the subscript i, the distribution of

participant and non—participant    farms is desribed by the relative profit

functions as represented by Figure 1.    changes in program parameters, such

    w
as P and X, will shift these relative profit functions, changing the number
    T

of participant farms.    This emphasizes the importance of capturing endogeneity

of program participation in any modelling of the impacts of agricultural

supports.

     The 1985 Farm Bill (which we do not analyze here) differs from the 1981

program in several ways.    The 1985 Farm Bill attempts to decouple production

decisions    from target price by fixing established yields at historical

values,     In this way, producers neither gain nor lose future deficiency

payments by changing current yields.     Since the acrea&e base for wheat is

frozen new producers cannot qualify for the program benefits.     And while in

previous programs, land set—aside had to be left fallow or be assi&ned to sane

other conservation use, some of the set-aside acrea&e can now be planted to

other crops.9

         To analyze the effects of price supports and set asides for wheat in the

 US, we use a numerical general equilibrium model of global trade in wheat

 which we have used elsewhere (see Trela, Whalley and Wigle (1987)).                           into this
model we embed           a richer treatment of both farm hehaviour               and   program supports
 in the   US,       We   first deaoribe           how US wheat
                                           scoduction, program supports, and
set asides are treated in this new version of the model, and then briefly
susmerize the rest of the model.

        me United         States wheat sector             is assured to   be made up of a nurber of
types of farms, producing a              distribution hoth of average yields, and
participating and              non'pertioipating farms in the model. As an analytical
convenience,        we assume that farms differ only in the elasticity of

substitution between land and non—land inputs in production.                           We thus abstract
from differences in lsnd quality across farms, location <and thus

transportation costs in shipping crops), and differences                        in comparative

advantage across crop types between farms.

        The production           technology for each farm type, i, is assumed to be

Wheat—producing                  land (L) and other inputs (Z) are assumed to be the sole

inputs in the production of wheat.

         Since acreage available to each farm,                                 L,   is fixed, producers face a

two—level optimization problem.                                 They must first compare their profit under

participation            in the commodity program (including any set-aside provisions),

to their profit outside the program.                                     Given their participation   decision, they

then optimize on non-land inputs and outputs.

optimal yields and input demands under participation       and non—participation.

This allows for a comparison of the two profit functions (3) and (4), and a

determination of the participation decision.        This, in turn, allows input

demands and outputs to be calculated.

     Whether farms choose to participate in any configuration of program

supports and set asides depen's on the level of program supports, the way

marginal cost functions change as land is idled to comply with set asides, and

the lump sum costs that set aside requirements cause.        We assume that the

elasticity of substitution between inputs across farms is uniformly

distributed over a pre—specified    interval.     Farms with higher elasticities of

substitution have higher average yields, and, given that land is a fixed

factor for each farm, these farms have more shallowly sloped marginal cost

functions.   The parameter values we use in the model along with the data to

which the model is calibrated, imply that low elasticity (high yield) farms

participate in program support, while high elasticity farms do not.

     The Remainder of the Model

     As indicated above, this treatment of the US wheat sector has been

introduced into a multi—country    general equilibrium structure of the global

grain market, used by Trela et al. (1987) to analyze the effects of global

policy interventions in grains.    This model uses the same ad valorem

equivalent approach which we criticize here, and our modification of the

earlier treatment of the US is aimed at highlighting the pitfalls of ad

valorem modelling that we discuss above.        Also, proceeding in this way allows

comparisons between the approach used here, and a more conventional "price

wedge" approach to be made for comparable data.

     Thirteen countries or blocs10 of countries are identified in this

earlier model, with wheat and other goods as the only produced consuodities.

Demands in each region are based on utility maximizing behaviour with a single
                                                                     10

country.      This consumer faces domestic consumer pricea in making

consumption decisions, but the country as a whole satisfies trade

balance at world prices, i.e.:

Distortions in the wheat sector in these countries are modelled in ad valorem

equivalent form, typically as ad valorem subsidies which produce a difference

between producer end consumer prices within the country.

separate treatment of price supports and set asides as modelled above also

enters the   model.
         Equilibrium   Solution cf   the   Model

         The equilibrium structure of this extended model involves three prices;

those for wheat, other goods, and non—land inputs into wheat production in the

US.    There are three associated market excess demand functions.              The first two

prices affect behaviour in all regions captured in the model, including the

US, the third price only affects behaviour in the US component of the model.

         In regions other than the US, the relative price of wheat in terms of

other goods, along with the ad valorem domestic subsidies or taxes allows

production and consumption of these two goods to be calculated using the first

order conditions for utility and profit maximizing behaviour.               (nowing

producer prices in the country (given by world prices gross of any distortions

at producer level), a tangency to the production frontier can be found.                The

country will then trade along a world price line, such that a tangency of an

indifference curve and a domestic price line is found on the world price line

through the production point,         Solving for production and consumption

behaviour in this way implies the net trades for each region in wheat and

other goods.

         In the case of the US, information on the prices of non—land inputs into

wheat and other goods allows outputs of these two goods in the US to be

determined from the first order conditions from profit maximization subject to

the CET    production   frontier.    The prices of wheat and non—land inputs also

allow for solution of program participation decisions for all the farm types
in the model, using equations (3) — (8). This allows both the use of non-land
inputs, and the returns to land for all farm types to be calculated. Enowing
the value of production of other goods and non-land inputs, and the return to

land for all farm types, allows aggregate income and hence US demands for

other goods and wheat, to be etermined.

        Aggregating across the US and all the other countries or regions in the

node! yields the market demands for wheat and other goods.       Summing production

across all countries yields total supply, and hence excess demand for wheat

and other goods.      The third excess demand is given by the difference between

the demand for non—land inputs into wheat summed across all farm types, and

output of
            Z     from the tangency to the CET production frontier in the US.

        The model thus generates a system of three excess demands involving

three prices.      Equilibrium occurs in the model when a zero is found for all

three excess demands.      The model is solved using a modified Newton method, for

which the experience has been that convergence is rapid.

IY.     Data,   Model Calibration,   and Elasticities

        We use the model for counterfactual equilibrium analysis, by calibrating

the model to a 1981 microconsistentequilibrium data set, and then computing

counterfactual     equilibria for a variety of policy changes.   The global

component   of the model has been calibrated to the 1981 data set using the

inverse function method outlined in Mansur and Whalley (1984).      This involves

solving for values of share and scale parameters in the CES and CET functions

so as to produce data on quantities demanded and produced as solutions to

optimising behaviour at 1981 equilibrium prices.
                                               14




        Prior to   implementing these procedures, values of substitution
elasticities in the     985 and CET functions need to be specified.             We use

estimates reported by Valdes and Zeits         (1985) for supply and demand elasticity

estimates     for wheat by country, and values of the elasticities            of substitution

are chosen to reproduce these,

        The main features of the micr000nsiatent        data used in this calibration

procedure are displayed in Table      1.    Th.ey   eo the large   net expcrt position

of the US in wheat in 1981, along with the significant wheat export position

of the EEC.      Price data reveal the significant affects cf           domes-tic   policy
interventions by     region, especially in    Japan.    US   producer    prices era thoce

paid   to non—participants, rather than target pricas.
        To use the inverse function    calibration method to determine parameters
for   the wheat production functions for the US component of the model it would

be necessary to know acreage, input use, yielda, and the elasticity of

substitution between inputs for ferns of all types.            There is no linked date

of this form available.

        We therefore iteratively search across combinations of the wheat

production function parameters, 6, 8, and the mean value of 8. until the

following     three conditions are met:

      (i)     The US produotion of wheat from farm optimising behaviour equals

              the value of production in the micr000nsistentdata set.

      (ii)    Non—land inputs used in the production of wheat as a result of

              optimising behaviour equal the value of inputs appearing in the

              microconsistent   data set.

      (iii)   The endogenously detennined participation rate aquaia the observed

              1981 rate of 42 percent.
                                                  15




        We thus determine values of these parameters such that optimising

behaviour     by farmers is consistentwith the observed data.

        We then assume that the substitution elasticities across fames,               R   are

spread over an internal           wzth a stepaize somewhat at CMoS,        This distribution

        An   issue of   some   controversy In the      agricultural econonica litarature2
has been the degree of 'slippage" in         cormuodity    programs, and   it ia worth
indicating how this was handled in the data and the model. Slippage indicates
the extent to which a 1 percent acreage reduction in the program due, say, to
participation in set asides, leads to a smaller than 1 percent reduction in
both   planting and yields.        Slippage reflects the response of farmers to a

number of substitution margins in response to set aside requirements.                 These

include more intensive use of remaining land, setting aside the least

productive of the land they have available for cuitivation, end planting all

land and then subsequently plowing under the least productive

 once the realized yields on the various parcels of land is known.            The

 "slippage" from farms altering their input use in response to land being idled

as a result of set asides is captured in the model, but these other effects

are not.   To the extent that increased cuitijacion of non-ioied iano is the

largest source of slippage, making no special modifications to the mcdal to

take account of these other factors seems to us a reasonabie way to

proceed

V-    Qprin Ad       Web rem   and   f   Pro rem   Mo4eiiiug of   US Wheat   Market
      Intervention
      In this secticn, we report results from the model on the effects whach

wouid follow from elimination of boch US price supports end set—mside

requirements for wheat using 1981 data       We contrast the results from our

model when programs are represented in 'full form' ,      that    is incorporating     the

endogenously determined participation de'ision as set out in the preceding

section, with those produced by a comparable rrodel in which their effects are

modelled in ad vaiorem equivalent form.      The differences between both

production and weifare effects of eliminating program supports and           et     asides

are large, emphasizing ti-ia point we make in the introduction to our paper,

that ad valorem equivalent modelling of the effects of these programs can be

highly misleading.   We also explore the sensitivity of model resuico to

elasticity values and other parameters.

      Secsuse of the sharp escalation of program supports in recent years, we

have chosen to dramatize our model results by using the escimates of ad

valorem equivalent for wheat support programs represented as the producer

subsidy equivalent (P5K), reported in recent USDA publication (1987) rather

than the actual levels of program supports for 1981 in our nicroconsistent
                                           18



equilibrium data set.      The PSE for wheat is defined by the USDA as "the

revenue required to compensate producers if existing governmentprograms were

eliminated", which the USDA estimates     for wheat to be in the range of 0.25 to

0.49 (ibid. p. 29).      This PSE estimate thus suggests that the value of US

programs   to   producers is between one—quarter and one—half of the gross

domestic value of production.      This includes deficiency payments, paid

diversion and the commodity loans program.

      We have used the minimum of this USDA range in modelling the effects of

US intervention in the wheat market, first treating these commodity programs

as equivalent to an ad valorem producer subsidy.      When modelled in this way,

these programs have am unambiguously     positive effect on production, even

though our earlier discussion suggests the net effect of commodity programs is

ambiguous.      This is because of the offsetting effects of set—aside

requirements,     and production incentives associated with program benefits.

      With the programs modelled explicitly, as in earlier sections, the

results could hardly be more different.      This is shown in Table 3.   When

modelled as ad valorem subsidies, eliminating the programs causes US output to

fall and the world price to rise.      When the policies are explicitlymodelled

to capture changing participation decisions and acreage set asides, the

opposite result occurs.     Our estimated PSE is low, and increasing it to the

middle of the range suggested by the USDA5 calculations would only serve to

increase the disparity in results between the two approaches.

      Under explicit program modelling, output rises when programs are

abolished because the increase in production     from the extra acreage planted

more than offsets the fall in production due to the decrease in prices

received by producers originally in the program.      In the ad valorem subsidy

case, the output of the US wheat sector must fall when the subsidy is

eliminated so long as the world price does not rise by more than the subsidy.

         Other implications follow from the results.          when support programs are

explicitlymodelled, budget expenditures of over one quarter billion have a

remarkably small impact on land         rents.    This is because the idled resources

implied by      acreage set—asides    act as   lump sum taxes on program participants.

Budget expenditures of $264 million are           initially associated with annual land
rents of $4,281 million,          Elimination of program supports reduces program

costs to     zero    but only reduces annualized returns to land by *75 million, or

less than 2 percent

         Also, the effects of program elimination are different across farms.

Farms    that   were previouslyparticipating experience a loss of program

benefits, plus a decrease in world price.             Farms who were not initially

participating       only experience the effects of the lower world price.       Land

values thus fall by 3.3 percent for        the most—likely—to—participate     class of

farms, but by      only   1.1 percent for the least—likely—to—participate.

        Furthermore,      the elimination of set—asides and paid diversion generates

a sizeable welfare gain for the US, and the world as a whole.             The world

welfare gain ($245 million> corresponds almost precisely to the value of the

land originally idled under the set—aside program ($253 million).            Results in
Table 3 suggest      that while   adverse terms of trade effects from abolition of US

programs do occur, they are not large enough to offset the welfare gains

associated      with eliminating the waste of domestic resources.
        In   all numerical modelling,    the implied effects of policy changes depend

on both the structure of and the underlyingparameter values used in the

model.    In the present case, we can be reasonably sure that the qualitative
                                           21




effects on output and welfare from. removing program supports when modelled as

ad valorem subsidy form will not be sensitive to model specification.

However, the qualitative effects when programs are explicitly modelled do

depend or. the parameter specification, since the output response will depend

on both the elasticities of substitution between Land and other inputs, and

the elasticity of transformation     between agricultural    nputs end

non—sgrlouitursl   goods

       Some sensitivity snsiyses of the    reLlts    reported in Table 3 are

presented   in Table 4.    Results under ad vsloram equIvalent    treatment are not

that sensitive to model respeciflcstion.        AlL of the signs of rhanges in

response to program elimination are preserved         Perhaps somewhat    surislngly,

when programs are explicitly modelled results are also not qualitatively

changed by using these alternative     re-specifications    of the modal.

      This seems to give more support to the hypothesis that, at

least In the pre-1985 period, the set-aside       features of commodity


programs in the US more than offset production incentives

associated with increases in target prices.

Vt,    Summary and Conclusions

       This paper stresses the pitfalls involved in modelling domestic

agricultural support programs in ad vaiorem equivalent form, illustrating how

in the use of US commodity programs for wheat, payments to producers who

participate in programs are linked to non—marginal reductions in total acreage

planted.    High support prices which might appear to subsidize production can

thus also increase participation in support programs cutting acreage planted,

and potentially reducing output.      Ad valorem modelling will miss these effects.

        A numerical general equilibriummodel built and calibrated to 1981 lata

suggests that, when tully modelled, US commodity program can have a positive

effect on produce incomes, and a negative effect on totel production, which

ia oppostte to the effects which would be portrayed by ad valorem
                                                                  equivalent

models     The model also serves to highlight the (perhaps obvious) wasterulneas

of   oormodity programs which involve uneoployment of    productive resources

(acreage   set--asides) as   a pre tonditon fur income support,   Thia is reflected
in   the relatively small reduction    n   lano rents brought about by aoolioon of
commodity programs in    the model "imulationa,

       Similar   features occur in oo'rdtodoty erograme in other countries,      as
the Japanese rice support program, and so the use or ad valorem equivalent
measures of the effects of agrcuitural programs obviously needs to be more
widely questioned. This same point also carriea over into the currant
international    trade negotiations in the Uruguay Round where much of the

technical work is focused on the conatruotion o5 ad vaiorem—lika measures

(producer subsidy equivalents,     or PSEs) as negotiable instruments.

ENDNOTES

1.   See, for example, Chishoim and      Tyers   (1985), Valdes and Zeitz (1980), and

     Frohberg    at al. (1987).

2.   We concentrate on pre—1985 programs, because of changes in support

     programs in the 1985 Farm Bill.        These weakened but, as we discuss below,

     by no means removed the features we stress here.

3.   These include the 'acreage quotas' used by the Canadian Wheat Board to

     limit grain deliveries       to wheat pools.   One can   argue   that the major

     constraint on grain production is the transportation         system, and   these
                                                                  Price supports to
     quotas merely ration access to shipment facilities.

     dairy farmers in the EEC have, since 1984, been accompanied by quotas.

     Again ad valorem equivalent modelling of the price support component

     alone will be misleading.        Also, rice producers in Japan must comply with

     acreage diversion requirements in order to qualify for high Support

     prices paid by the government (see Yasuo (1987) and Naraomi and Takamitsu

     (1987).     Another complex situation is the differential exchange rate

     facing farm exporters in Argentina (see the description in Clrio

     (1987)).

4.   See the exposition of applied general equilibrium modelling techniques in

     Shoven and Whalley (1988).

5.   This is a government—owned and operated corporation established in 1933

     to stabilize and    support    farm incomes and   prices.
6,   Farmers also receive diversion payments to cover part of the foregone

     earnings on idled land.        These apply to required diversions and to

     voluntary (extra) acreage diverted to approved conservation uses.            The

     sum   of   deficiency and   diversion payments   is capped at $50,000 per farm

     under the wheat and feed grain programs combined, although this is rarely

     a binding constraint for wheat producers since until recently there were

     no restrictions on subdividing acreage covered by the programs.
                                            25



7.    in periods when price supports (and loan rates) have been high, such as

      in the late 1970s, a sharp growth in stockpiles of wheat and feed grains

      has occurred.    Further policies beyond acreage reductions have then been

      used for stockpile management.      One such prograssne was the

      PeymentIn-Xind (fIX) progrszmse introduced in 1983.        Under this

      progreasse, fansers who agreed to reduce their acreage by between 10 end

      30 percent more then the amount required to be eligible for loans,

      purchases, and payments were compensated by the government, in—kind, i.e.

      by peyment of   oormsodities out of its own cossoodity reserves.

8.    Also, the more that yields very across the lend on any indivduai fans,

      the more attractive is the program, since the lowest yield land oem be

      Jiverted from production.

9.    subject to limitations that aim to avoid gluts.

10.   The assumption thst only    S.   (or equivalently o; isries by fans ciasa

      also generates a distribution     of yields across fans.

11.   To simplify the calculations we make with the model, we calculate

      solutions to fans optimization     problems for five eisstioity values, and

      interpolate over a range of elasticities of substitution between land and

      other inputs.
