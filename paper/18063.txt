                                                 ABSTRACT

Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (2003) warn that persistence in expected returns generates spurious regression
bias in predictive regressions of stock returns, even though stock returns are themselves only weakly
autocorrelated. Despite this fact a growing literature attempts to explain the performance of stock market
anomalies with highly persistent investor sentiment. The data suggest, however, that the potential misspecification
bias may be large. Predictive regressions of real returns on simulated regressors are too likely to reject
the null of independence, and it is far too easy to find real variables that have ‚Äúsignificant power‚Äù predicting
returns. Standard OLS predictive regressions find that the party of the U.S. President, cold weather
in Manhattan, global warming, the El Ni√±o phenomenon, atmospheric pressure in the Arctic, the conjunctions
of the planets, and sunspots, all have ‚Äúsignificant power‚Äù predicting the performance of anomalies.
These issues appear particularly acute for anomalies prominent in the sentiment literature, including
those formed on the basis of size, distress, asset growth, investment, profitability, and idiosyncratic
volatility.

1    Introduction

Investor sentiment is increasingly used as a variable to predict the performance of trading

strategies. Baker and Wurgler (2006), Lemmon and Portniaguina (2006), and Stambaugh,

Yu, and Yuan (2012) find that investor sentiment has significant power predicting the per-

formance of small, young, volatile and unprofitable stocks; momentum; firms that issue

large amounts of equity; and a host of earnings and investment related anomalies. Cooper,

Gutierrez and Hameed (2004) find that recent past market performance, an important de-

terminant of investor sentiment, predicts the profitability of momentum strategies. These

papers all test for a relation between the predictive variable (e.g., investor sentiment, or past

market performance) and the expected returns to some trading strategy (e.g., value, or mo-

mentum), and strongly reject the null that the strategy‚Äôs expected returns are independent

of the predictive variable. They conclude that the predictive variable has significant power

forecasting the the strategy‚Äôs performance.

    An alternative explanation is that the tests are simply misspecified. If a trading strat-

egy‚Äôs expected returns vary slowly over time, then OLS regressions confer spurious power

explaining returns on any slow moving ‚Äúpredictive variable.‚Äù Time variation in risk premia

introduces auto correlation in the returns data, though this is largely obscured by the high

variability of returns. Standard ‚Äúpredictive regressions,‚Äù which purport to test for a relation

between the performance of an anomaly and some explanatory variable, report more power

than they actually have to reject the null of independence. Persistence in expected returns

and the explanatory variable reduce the number of effective observations, and test statistics


                                               1
calculated ignoring this fact overstate the test‚Äôs power.

    Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (2003) show that the spurious regression bias of Granger

and Newbold (1974) can be severe when studying return predictability, despite the fact that

returns are first differences in prices and exhibit little persistence.1 Because returns exhibit

little persistence, the finance literature often ignores the potential bias towards rejecting

independence. Predictive regressions do not, however, test for a relation between the pre-

dictive variable and returns. They test for a relation between the predictive variable and

the expected returns (a level), which may be far more persistent. Ferson, Sarkissian and

Simin (2003) show in simulations that if returns are noisy realizations of an auto regres-

sive expected returns process, then independent autoregressive ‚Äúnews‚Äù processes, which

by construction contain absolutely no information about expected returns, frequently ap-

pear to have power in sample. Predictive regressions, which regress realized returns on the

independent news process, are too likely to reject the hypothesis of independence. This

spurious regression bias interacts with and intensifies the data mining concerns of Foster,

Smith, and Whaley (1997). Mining is more likely to uncover spurious, persistent regres-

sors, and the regressors used in the literature to predict stock market performance tend to

be persistent, suggesting that the power of some of these regressors is spurious.2

    Similar biases are observed when ‚Äúpredicting‚Äù the performance of real world anomalies

with simulated regressors. Predictive regressions are biased toward rejecting the indepen-
   1
     This problem is distinct from that solved by Stambaugh (1999). Stambaugh (1999) derives the small
sample properties of the OLS estimators for well specified regressions of returns on a slow moving predictor.

     Prominent persistent regressors used to predict market returns include short term interest rates (Fama
and Schwert 1977), credit spreads (Keim and Stambaugh 1986), the term structure slope (Campbell 1987),
stock volatility (French, Schwert and Stambaugh 1987), and the aggregate dividend yield (Fama and French
1988). More recently Baker and Wurgler (2000) find that the equity share of new issuance predicts market
performance, while Lettau and Lugvigson (2001) and Lamont and Stein (2004) find similar results using the
consumption-wealth-ratio and aggregate short interest.

dence of the performance of a wide variety of investment strategies and independently

generated noise with a persistent component. As a result it is much too easy to find ‚Äúpow-

erful‚Äù conditioning variables in the real world. The party of the U.S. President, the weather

in Manhattan (or pretty much anywhere), global warming, the El NinÃÉo phenomenon, at-

mospheric pressure in the Arctic, the conjunctions of the planets, and sunspots, all have

‚Äúsignificant power‚Äù predicting the performance of well known anomalies. The strategies

prominent in the sentiment literature, including those formed on the basis of size, distress,

asset growth, investment, profitability, and idiosyncratic volatility, appear particularly sus-

ceptible to the ‚Äúpredictive power‚Äù of obviously independent regressors.

    This is not to say that the economic explanations provided in earlier papers for the

observed correlations between sentiment, or past market performance, and the performance

of market anomalies are incorrect. Many of these papers provide additional evidence, by

investigating deeper implications of the proposed relation, such as asymmetries between

the power that the conditioning variable has to predict the performance of the long and

short side of the investment strategy. But all the tests employed in these papers, including

these additional tests, are likely misspecified, and thus overstate the power the tests have

to reject the null hypothesis that the predictive variable investigated is actually unrelated to

the performance of the strategies.




2    An Illustration

The potential biases that arise from misspecification can be seen most easily in simulations,

like those considered in Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (2003). If expected returns follow

                                               3
an AR(1), then predictive regressions of realized returns on AR(1) noise processes with

similar mean reversion rates are too likely to reject the null of independence. Suppose that

returns are noisy realizations of expected returns, and that the expected return (t ) and a

‚Äúnews‚Äù (xt ) follow independent AR(1) processes with the same persistence a1 ,

where the xi , i and ri are independent standard normal variables for each i. The return

process and the ‚Äúnews‚Äù process are, by construction, independent.

   Regressions of returns on lagged news, however, are too likely to reject the hypothesis

of independence. Figure 1 shows test statistics on the slope coefficient on the explanatory

variable from misspecified predictive regressions of returns on the lagged ‚Äúnews‚Äù process,

      The figure shows results from predictive regressions of returns, which are noisy realizations of an

      realized slope coefficient test statistics in each 0.01 interval, estimated in a million sets of 40 year

      that observed in the aggregate stock market, roughly 10%. The figure shows the realized

      test statistics, in bins of width of 0.01. The distribution is basically normal with a SD of

      2.29, implying the precision with which the slopes are estimated is overstated by more

      than a factor of two. The predictive regression is far too likely to reject the null that the

      ‚Äúnews‚Äù process is unrelated to returns, despite the fact that the two processes are indepen-

      dent by construction. The misspecified OLS regressions reject the hypothesis that returns



                                                                 5
are unrelated to AR(1) noise at the 5% level 39% of the time.

   The standard deviation of test statistics in the misspecified regressions depends on

the persistence of the shocks (i.e., the mean reversion speed of expected returns), and

the relative magnitudes of the shocks to the expected return process and the returns pro-

cess. More persistence in the expected return process, or a higher signal-to-noise ratio

( = ), increase the autocorrelation in returns, magnifying the extent to which the preci-

sion of the slope coefficient in the predictive regression is over estimated. For example, if

 = D 0:25, four times as high as that used in the simulations of Figure 1, then the stan-

dard deviation of the distribution of test statistics is more than twice as high, 5.73. With

this parameterization the misspecified OLS regressions reject the hypothesis that returns

are unrelated to AR(1) noise at the 5% level 73% of the time.

   Figure 2 shows the standard deviation of the distribution of test statistics from predic-

tive regressions like those employed to generate Figure 1, as a function of the monthly

persistence in expected returns. The figure shows auto correlation coefficients of a1 2

≈í0:9; 0:995¬ç, implying half-lives of shocks to the expected return process of six months

to 11.5 years, and depicts results for three different signal-to-noise ratios (= 2 f0:05;

0:1; 0:2g). Over the entire parameter space the misspecified tests are biased toward rejecting

the null that the processes are unrelated, and this bias can be substantial. This conclusion

is perhaps not surprising. The persistence in the expected return process introduces serial

correlation in returns. This reduces the number of effective observations, and the predic-

tive regressions, which treat the observations as independent, overstate the test‚Äôs statistical

power.

3                                          Predicting real strategy performance with noise

Predictive regressions also tend to over-reject the null of independence for real anomaly

returns. We can guarantee independence between anomaly strategy returns and a predic-

tive variable by again simulating the predictive variable completely independently. Figure

3 shows results of regressions similar to those presented in the last section, which regress

the returns to real market anomalies on simulated AR(1) noise. The dependent variables



                                                                                 7
employed in the regressions are the returns to well known anomalies: a value strategy, an

investment strategy, the asset growth strategy of Cooper, Gulen and Schill (2008), and the

12-month strategy of Heston and Sadka (2008). The strategies are constructed by sort-

ing on book-to-market, investment (the change in property, plant and equipment plus the

change in inventories)-to-assets, assets-to-lagged assets, and average stock performance in

the same calendar month over the previous five years. All four strategies are long/short ex-

treme deciles of a sort on the corresponding sorting variable, using NYSE breaks. Returns

are value weighted. The value, investment, and asset growth portfolios are rebalanced at

the end of July, while those based on seasonality are rebalanced monthly. The sample cov-

ers July 1973 to December 2010. The figure shows that predictive regressions are biased

toward rejecting the hypothesis of independence for all four strategies.

   These results are not specific to the AR(1) assumption on the predictive noise process.

Figure 4 repeats the exercise using AR(2) noise as the predictive variable. Each predictive

series is generated using

The figure shows the standard deviation of test statistics from predictive regressions of 1) the returns
to strategies sorted on size, long run past performance, and the distress measures of Campbell et.
al (2008) and Ohlson (1980), onto independent AR(2) noise with an annual periodicity, and 2) the
returns to the Fama-French market and momentum factors (MTK and UMD) and strategies sorted on
net stock issuance and return-on-equity, onto independent AR(2) noise with a biannual periodicity.

distribution is estimated from 100,000 noise series. The sample covers July 1973 to December 2010.

deciles of a sort on the corresponding sorting variable, using NYSE breaks. The size port-

folios are rebalanced at the end of July, while the strategies based on long run past per-

formance, failure probability, and Ohlson‚Äôs O-score are rebalanced monthly. The sample

covers July 1973 to December 2010. Again, predictive regressions are too likely to reject

the hypothesis of independence.

    The bottom panel shows similar results for the returns to the market, UMD (the ‚Äúup-

minus-down‚Äù momentum factor maintained by Ken French), and strategies based on net

stock issuance and return-on-equity (ROE), employing AR(2) noise with a periodicity of

two years as the predictive variables. The ROE and issuance strategies are constructed

by sorting on income before extraordinary items divided by market equity, and net stock

issuance to market equity, respectively, and are again long/short extreme value weighted

deciles sorted using NYSE breaks. The issuance portfolios are rebalanced at the end of

July, while the ROE strategy is rebalanced monthly. The sample covers July 1973 to De-

cember 2010. The predictive regressions again overstate the power they have to reject the

hypothesis of independence.




4    Spurious correlations in the data

This section takes the exercise one step further, predicting the returns to real strategies using

real ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù variables. The results suggest that it is far too easy to find variables that

have ‚Äúsignificant power‚Äù in standard OLS predictive regressions. The party of the sitting

U.S. President, cold weather in Manhattan, global warming, the El NinÃÉo phenomenon,

atmospheric pressure in the Arctic, the conjunctions of the planets, and sunspots, all have

‚Äúsignificant power‚Äù predicting the performance of a wide array of well known anomalies.



4.1 Predicting anomaly performance with political parties

Figure 5 shows the ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù variables used in the first set of regressions, a dummy

for whether the sitting U.S. President is a Democrat. The sample covers January 1961

(Kennedy‚Äôs inauguration) to December 2010.

      Table 1 shows that since Kennedy took the presidency on January 20, 1961, essentially

all of the equity premium, as well as all of the small cap stocks‚Äô outperformance of large

caps, can be ‚Äúexplained‚Äù by the party of the sitting president. Over these 50 years the

market has only outperformed T-Bills by an insignificant ten basis points per month in

by a highly significant 89 basis points per month in months that started with a Democratic

Commander-in-Chief. This 79 basis points per month difference is significant at the 5%

    Over the same period the smallest decile of stocks (NYSE breaks) has outperformed

the largest decile, on a value weighted basis, by 35 basis points per month. This outperfor-

mance has, however, come unevenly through time. Small stocks have beaten large stocks

by almost a percent per month with Democratic presidents, but actually underperformed

large stocks by 10 basis points per month during Republican administrations. The 104

   One explanation for these facts is that Republicans favor big business, and that this is

bad for the economy as a whole, but if one accepts this explanation, one must then confront

contradictory evidence presented by profitable stocks and stocks with low correlations with

the market. Strategies based on return-on-equity (ROE) and Betting-Against-Beta (BAB)

perform significantly better under Republican presidents. The ROE strategy is formed on

the basis of firms‚Äô most recent quarterly earnings relative to their market capitalizations,

and is available from July 1973 to December 2010, dates determined by the availability of

quarterly earnings data. The ROE strategy yields 1.33% per month under the GOP, four

times as much as it does under Democratic presidents. The difference, nearly a percent

per month, is significant at the 5% level. Frazzini and Pedersen‚Äôs (2012) BAB strategy,

which buys low beta assets and sells high beta assets, while attempting to stay market-

neutral by running each side at a beta of one, has generated 88 basis points per month

since Kennedy‚Äôs inauguration, generating an astounding 165 basis points a month during

Republican administrations, but losing 11 basis points a month under Democrats. The

difference, 1.76% per month, is significant at the 1% level.

   These results are all robust to controlling for sentiment. Including the Baker-Wurgler

Index as an explanatory variable has essentially no impact on the coefficient estimates on

the presidential dummy in the predictive regressions.

4.2 Predicting anomaly performance with the weather

While it is not entirely impossible that the sitting president can significantly impact mar-

ket performance, it seems less likely that the weather can do so. Nevertheless, in standard

predictive regressions weather-related variables are powerful predictors of anomaly perfor-

mance.

   Figure 6 shows the ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù variable used in the next set of regressions, the number

of days each month in which the high temperature, as measured at the Central Park weather

station, failed to exceed freezing. The weather data come from The National Climatic Data

Center (NCDC), and can be downloaded from http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/search.

The data cover July 1973 to December 2010, dates determined by the availability of the

quarterly CompuStat data used in the construction of many of the test strategies.

   Table 2 shows that cold weather has power predicting the performance of many of the

same anomalies as investor sentiment. Cold weather predicts abnormally good performance

for small cap strategies, value strategies, strategies based on asset growth and investment,

and strategies based on long run reversals. It has significant power predicting abnormally

poor performance for many earnings related anomalies, including those based on industry

adjusted gross profitability, return on assets, return on equity, gross margins, and earnings

momentum, as well as those based on the default measures of Campbell et. al. (2008) and

Ohlson (1980).

   These results may occur because the weather impacts the ‚Äúanimal spirits‚Äù of traders,

who predominately live in the New York Metropolitan area. But the weather in Bozeman,

Montana, or Hawaii, has about as much power as the weather in New York predicting

returns. Taken together these results suggest a seasonality in the performance of many

anomaly strategies. A sine wave with an annual periodicity that takes its extremum on

the equinox ‚Äúpredicts‚Äù the performance of many of the weather related anomalies about as

well as cold days in New York. The appendix shows that these results are largely due to

a strong January effect, like that documented by Keim (1983) and Reinganum (1983) for

small stocks, which is present in many of the anomalies considered here. Table 6, in the

Appendix, shows results of regressions of anomaly returns on a January dummy. In general

strategies that tend to be long small caps (e.g., those based on book-to-market, asset growth

or long run past performance) outperform on average in January, while those that tend to be

short small caps (e.g., momentum strategies, those based on any measure of profitability,

and those that sell distressed firms) underperform on average in January. While these results

are interesting in and of themselves, their relevance here stems from their implications

for the predictive regressions. Predictive regressions that ignore the seasonality in these

anomalies are misspecified, and biased toward rejecting the irrelevance of any ‚Äúpredictive‚Äù

variable that has a seasonable component.



4.3 Other climatic predictors

While variables with a seasonal component are powerful predictors of anomaly perfor-

mance, non-seasonal climatic variables are also have significant power predicting anomaly

performance. Figure 7 shows the evolution of our next set of predictive variables, the

global temperature anomaly (‚Äúglobal warming‚Äù), the quasiperiodic Pacific temperature

anomaly known as El NinÃÉo, and the non-seasonal atmospheric pressure anomaly known

as the Arctic Oscillation. Panel A shows monthly global average land temperature rela-

tive to the 1951-1980 base period. Panel B shows monthly deviations of the Pacific Ocean

surface temperature, measured between 0ƒ± -10ƒ± South and 90ƒ± -80ƒ± West, from the average

measured over a 1971-2000 base period. Panel C shows monthly deviations of north-

ern atmospheric pressure from the average measured over a 1971-2000 base period. The

global temperature anomaly data come from NASA‚Äôs Goddard Institute for Space Studies

(http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/), while the El NinÃÉo and Arctic Oscillation data come

from the NOAA (http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/data/indices/).

   Table 3 shows the power these variables have predicting anomaly performance, includ-

ing again many of the anomalies previously prominent in the sentiment literature. Panel A

shows that global warming is bad for value strategies, both those based on book-to-market

and earnings-to-price, even after controlling for sentiment. A 12-month moving average

of the global temperature anomaly, which takes out its seasonal component, also predicts

poor stock price performance for firms that invest a lot, but good performance for firms

with market power, though the power of the variable to predict the performance of this last

strategy appears to come form its common variation with sentiment.

   Panel B shows that warm ocean temperatures in the East Pacific are a significant predic-

tor of good performance for Sloan‚Äôs (1999) accrual based strategies. A 60-month moving

average, which smoothes the temperatures over the basic five year periodicity of the phe-

nomena, predicts strong performance for many of the same anomalies Stambaugh, Yu and

Yuan (2012) relate to the Baker-Wurgler Index: those based on profitability, net stock is-

suance, and the failure and default probability measures of Campbell et. al. (2008) and

Ohlson (1980), as well as strategies based on market power.

   Regressions that control for both the five year moving average of the East Pacific tem-

perature anomaly and the level of investment sentiment, as measured by the Baker-Wurgler

Index, suggest that El NinÃÉo‚Äôs power to predict the performance of the distress anomalies

derives from its correlation with investor sentiment, but that sentiment‚Äôs power to predict

the performance of the net stock issuance strategy derives from its correlation with El NinÃÉo.

Including BWI as an explanatory variable dramatically reduces the coefficient on El NinÃÉo

in the regressions explaining the returns to the distress anomalies, while leaving the co-

efficient on BWI largely unchanged from its univariate estimate, while including El NinÃÉo

as an explanatory variable dramatically reduces the coefficient on sentiment when explain-



                                             21
ing the returns to the issuance anomalies, while leaving the coefficient on El NinÃÉo largely

unchanged from its univariate estimate.

   Panel C shows that a 60-month moving average of the Arctic atmospheric pressure

anomaly predicts strong performance for the 12-month strategy of Heston and Sadka (2008),

but poor performance for the strategy based on net stock issuance. Its 120-month moving

average predicts poor performance for value, but strong performance for the strategy based

on market power.



4.4 Celestial predictors of anomaly performance

The planets and stars are also powerful predictors of anomaly performance. Both the plane-

tary aspects (i.e., the apparent proximity of two planets in the heavens to an earth observer)

and sunspot activity are powerful predictors of anomaly performance. These anomalies

again include many of those prominent in the sentiment literature.

   The aspects of Mercury and Venus with the outer planets appear to be particularly

important in the data for the performance of anomalies, predicting the performance of

strategies based on market cap, book-to-market, momentum, gross profitability, return-on-

assets, market power, earnings surprises, failure probability, default probability, idiosyn-

cratic volatility, asset growth, and long run reversals. The aspects of the inner planets with

the outer planets have periodicities of roughly a year, however, so it is difficult to distin-

guish if these variables have power in their own right, or if their power simply derives from

their correlation with the weather. I will consequently focus on the aspects of Saturn, and in

particular with its celestial relations to Mars and Jupiter. These relations are shown in Pan-

Figure 8. Celestial phenomena
This figure shows the levels of the celestial predictive variables. Panel A shows the aspect of Mars
and Saturn (i.e., the angle between the planets to an earth observer), Panel B shows the aspect of
Jupiter and Saturn, and Panel C shows the number of sunspots observed each month. The data cover
July 1973 to December 2010.

els A and B of Figure 8. The major periodicity of the aspects are determined by the product

of the orbital periods of the two outer planets in the triangle (two extra-terrestrial planets

and earth), divided by the difference in these orbital periods. The orbital periods of Mars,

Jupiter and Saturn are 1.881, 11.86 and 29.46 years, implying major periodicities of the

conjunction of Saturn with Mars and Jupiter of just over two years and just under 20 years,

respectively. Planetary aspects are derived from the Keplerian equations, available from

NASA‚Äôs Jet Propulsion Laboratory (http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?planet pos). The figure also

shows the level of sunspot activity (Panel C). The periodicity of the solar cycle is roughly

ten and a half years. Sunspot data are compiled by the Solar Influences Data Analysis

Center and are available there (http://solarscience.msfc.nasa.gov/greenwch/spot num.txt).

    Panel A of Table 4 shows that the aspect of Mars and Saturn is a powerful predictor

of the anomaly performance. The market performs better when Mars and Saturn are in

conjunction (i.e., when they appear in close proximity to an earth observer). Small cap

strategies and long run reversals also perform better when Mars and Saturn‚Äôs energies are

strongly blended. Strategies based on return-on-assets, return-on-equity, and the failure

probability measure of Campbell et. al. (2008) perform better when Mars and Saturn are

opposed, perhaps reflecting difficulties that distressed and unprofitable stocks experience

when these planets‚Äô energies are polarized. The aspect of Mars and Saturn is essentially

orthogonal to sentiment, and controlling for sentiment consequently has no impact on these

results.

    Panel B shows that strategies based on market cap, net stock issuance, asset growth, and

investment all perform better when Jupiter and Saturn are opposed. These data suggest that

polarization between Jupiter and Saturn may portend difficulties with growth, and should

perhaps be taken as a sign to delay plans for rapid expansion. The aspect of Jupiter and

Saturn also explains more than ten percent of the variation in the Baker-Wurgler Index,

but this seems largely unrelated to the power that either series has predicting anomaly

performance. Regressions that employ both variables in all cases yield slope estimates that

are similar to their univariate estimates.

   Panel C shows that sunspots are a significant predictor of the performance of strategies

based on both price and earnings momentum. High levels of solar activity seem to increase

investors‚Äô propensity to underreact, slowing down the rate at which news gets incorporated

into prices. Strategies that trade on recent past performance and earnings surprises conse-

quently have returns that are significantly positively correlated with the number of sunspots

observed in the previous month. These results are again robust to controlling for sentiment.

   The total number of sunspots observed over the preceding solar cycle (125-months)

also has significant power predicting anomaly performance. This number, which measures

the amplitude of the last solar cycle, as opposed to where one is in the cycle, predicts the

performance strategies based on market capitalization, Ohlson‚Äôs O-score, and seasonalities

in stock performance. Unusually intense solar cycles seem to predict poor performance

for small caps, but strong performance for strategies that bet on stocks that performed well

in the same calendar month in preceding years, or against high default probability stocks.

These results cannot be explained by investor sentiment, while much of investor sentiment‚Äôs

power to explain the performance of small cap strategies appears to be explained by its

correlation with the intensity of the preceding solar cycle.



                                             26
5    Alternative Tests

While the preceding sections clearly illustrate the potential for spurious regression bias

even when working with returns, they provide no guidance to the researcher interested in

running predictive regressions. Plosser and Schwert (1978) suggest that comparisons be-

tween regressions run in levels and differences provide a crude test of model specification.

First differences in realized returns provide a noisy proxy for changes is expected returns,

which are much less persistent than their level, alleviating spurious regression bias con-

cerns. First-differencing greatly reduces the variation in the predictive variable, however,

without reducing the variation in realized returns, lowering the signal to noise ratio and

yielding less powerful tests. While regressions run in first differences are more likely to be

well specified, realistic samples are not large enough to allow regressions run in differences

to identify significant return relations. Similar limitations apply to other standard methods

for handling persistent regressors. Ferson, Sarkissian and Simin (2008) find that available

return series are too short to admit sufficient lags to correct the spurious regression bias

using the Newey-West procedure, and lagged returns are a poor instrument for the persis-

tence in excess returns. The extensive literature on small-sample distributions offers no

solutions, because the problem is ultimately one of potential misspecification.

    Without an obvious methodological correction for potential misspecification bias, the

econometrician estimating predictive regressions should at least report results from sim-

ulations using similarly persistent regressors. If one admits the possibility that expected

returns are persistent, but vary over time for reasons potentially unrelated to the predic-

tive variable, then inferring significance directly from standard test-statistics is impossible.


                                              27
Results cannot be considered significant if the test-statistic observed on the predictive vari-

able is not unusual among similarly persistent predictors. Statistical significance requires

that the observed test-statistic is extreme in the empirical distribution of test-statistics from

predictive regressions using random regressors with autocorrelation structures similar to

that observed in the candidate predictive variable. Note that this is only a necessary con-

dition, not sufficient condition, for true significance. Reporting these results does not fully

address concerns regarding spurious regression bias, as it is always possible that the auto-

correlation structure chosen for the random regressors misses an important dimension of

the persistence in the expected returns. Researchers looking to find predictive variables are

more likely to find spurious regressors with the right structure.

   The next set of tests consider the power of investor sentiment and past market per-

formance predicting the performance of anomalies relative to similarly persistent randem

regressors. Figure 9 shows autocorrelations for the Baker-Wurgler Index over our sam-

ple, July 1973 to December 2010, for monthly lags out to 20 years. It also shows the

autocorrelations for a pseudo-periodic AR(2) process with a periodicity of 187 months
                           p
(a2 D 0:981 and a1 D           a2 cos.2=187/), which roughly matches the autocorrelation

structure observed in investor sentiment. The AR(2) is too smooth, and consequently has

autocorrelations that are too high at short horizons, features that could be addressed by

adding transitory noise.

   Table 5 shows results of predictive regressions employing the Baker-Wurgler Index

(BWI) and the cumulative five year market excess return (MKT60;1 ) as the predictive vari-

ables. The table reports both OLS test-statistics, and test-statistics scaled by the standard

and earnings related anomalies (i.e., those formed on the basis of industry adjusted gross

profitability, return-on-assets, failure probability, and default probability), its power to pre-

dict the performance of strategies based on size, net stock issuance, market power, and

seasonality is unremarkable among similarly persistent random regressors. Similar results

hold using past market performance as the predictive variable. Past market performance

additionally appears to have more power than a 60-month moving average of white noise

predicting the performance of both price and earnings momentum, but its power to predict

the performance of value is unremarkable among similarly persistent random regressors.

The table also shows that the power BWI has predicting the performance of the earnings

related anomalies, including those formed on the basis of failure and default probabilities,

is largely explained by its correlation with past market performance.




6    Conclusion

When expected returns are persistent, then misspecified predictive regressions are biased

toward rejecting the independence of returns and any persistent variable. The data suggest

that these concerns are more than theoretical. Predictive regressions of real anomaly returns

on persistent variables frequently find a significant relation, even when the two series are

clearly unrelated.

    Running predictive regressions in first difference is much safer. These regressions have

less power, and are consequently less attractive to those seeking to find significant pre-

dictive variables, but have the enormous advantage of yielding meaningful answers. The

misspecified regression bias is ultimately just an issue of power. Persistence in expected

                                               31
returns reduces the number of effective observations, and ignoring this fact results in test

that overstate the significance of their results. It is simply harder to find variables that truly

have power to predict anomaly performance than it is to find variables that appear to have

power in misspecified OLS regressions.

Table 6. January effect in anomaly strategy performance
This table reports the average excess returns (E≈ír e ¬ç) in percent per month, and results of predictive regressions
of the strategies returns on the predictive variable (PV), a January dummy, controlling for investor sentiment
as measured by the Baker-Wurgler Index (BWI). Explanatory variables are demeaned. The sample covers July
1973 through December 2010, dates determined by the availability of quarterly accounting data employed in
many of the strategies‚Äô construction.
