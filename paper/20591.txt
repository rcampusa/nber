Understanding Defensive Equity

                                            ABSTRACT

High volatility and high beta stocks tilt strongly to small, unprofitable, and growth firms. These tilts
explain the poor absolute performance of the most aggressive stocks. In conjunction with the well
documented inability of the Fama and French three-factor model to price small growth stocks, especially
unprofitable small growth stocks, these tilts also drive the abnormal performance of defensive equity
(i.e., low volatility and/or low beta strategies). While defensive strategy performance is explained
by controlling for size, profitability, and relative valuations, the converse is false—the performance
of value and profitability strategies cannot by explained using defensive equity performance.

1    Introduction
Defensive equity strategies have seen explosive growth over the last five years. These strate-
gies overweight “safe” or “defensive” stocks, and under-weight “risky” or “aggressive”
stocks, where these are typically defined by a stock’s volatility or market beta. Their popular-
ity has been encouraged by the convergence of two factors: an equity market that delivered
two severe bear markets and negative nominal returns over the first decade of the twenty-first
century, and a growing academic literature documenting a weak or negative relation between
equities’ risks and returns.
    Low beta strategies were first suggested by Fischer Black (1972), who unsuccessfully
lobbied Wells Fargo to establish a levered low beta fund in the early 1970s. A more recent
surge in academic interest was spurred by Ang et. al.’s (2006) finding of a negative relation
between idiosyncratic volatility and subsequent stock returns, the so-called “idiosyncratic
volatility puzzle.” The most influential of the subsequent work includes Blitz and Van Vliet
(2007), which considered the performance of portfolios sorted on total volatility; Baker,
Bradley, and Wurgler (2011), which documents the modern performance of strategies based
on both low volatility and low market beta; and Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), which intro-
duces “betting-against-beta,” a sophisticated dynamic version of Black’s beta-arbitrage.
    Low volatility and low beta strategies are popular with institutional investors, pension
funds, and insurance companies. Retail defensive equity funds have also seen robust in-
flows, and compete with “quality” strategies and managed futures as the new strategies most
favored by active managers. The interest defensive strategies have received in both academia
and on Wall Street have led some to call for raising them into the canon of the most impor-
tant market anomalies. Frazzini and Pedersen (2014) claim, for example, that the return to
their betting-against-beta strategy “rivals those of all the standard asset pricing factors (e.g.,
value, momentum, and size) in terms of economic magnitude, statistical significance, and
robustness.” Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2011) go even further, opining that “among the
many candidates for the greatest anomaly in finance, a particularly compelling one is the
long-term success of low-volatility and low-beta stock portfolios.”



                                                1
   This paper takes a more skeptical view. While reaffirming the poor absolute performance
of the most aggressive stocks, it nevertheless shows that the performance of defensive eq-
uity strategies is explained by known drivers of cross-sectional variation in returns. This is
somewhat surprising, as previous work, including Blitz and Van Vliet (2007) and Asness,
Frazzini, and Pedersen (2014), explicitly reject the hypothesis that defensive strategy perfor-
mance is driven by size and value effects. This earlier work fails to account for profitability,
however, which is an essential ingredient for understanding defensive strategy performance.
   High profitability is, next to large market capitalization, the single best predictor of low
volatility. Defensive strategies consequently tilt strongly towards profitability. This also
tends to obscure the true extent to which defensive strategies tilt toward value. Because
profitability and value tend to be strongly negatively correlated, the large profitability load-
ings on defensive strategies reduce the defensive strategies’ loadings on value strategies in
tests that fail to control for profitability. Accounting for profitability, and the true extent
to which defensive strategies tilt toward value, are crucial for explaining defensive strategy
performance.
   Small growth stocks also play a critical role in defensive equity. Defensive strategies
overweight large value stocks and underweight small growth stocks, which contributes di-
rectly to defensive strategy performance. Small growth additionally drives defensive strategy
performance through a second, indirect channel: within style universes, defensive strategy
performance is strongly concentrated in the small growth segment. In fact, defensive stocks
only outperform aggressive stocks in the small growth segment; aggressive stocks actually
significantly outperform defensive stocks in large value.
   The success of defensive strategies among small growth firms is consistent with prof-
itability and value driving their performance. The small growth sector is also where volatil-
ity is most strongly associated with valuations and profitability—low volatility stocks in the
small growth sector have only moderately high valuations and are quite profitable, while
high volatility stocks in this sector on average have both negative book equity and nega-
tive earnings. Because of the large variation in valuations and profitability between high
and low volatility small growth stocks, the performance of defensive strategies constructed


                                               2
in the small growth universe far exceeds the performance of defensive strategies formed in
the broad market. The performance of these small growth defensive strategies nevertheless
lags the performance of strategies constructed in the small growth segment that exploit di-
rect variation in valuations and profitability. More generally, accounting for size, relative
valuations, and profitability, completely explains the performance of defensive strategies.
        This is not to say that an individual would not have benefited from following a defensive
strategy. Investors certainly would have profited from avoiding unprofitable small cap growth
firms. Defensive strategies are, however, an inefficient way to exploit these premia, which are
better accessed directly. The backdoor route defensive strategies provide to an unprofitable
small growth exclusion is also transactionally inefficient, entailing significant rebalancing
and high transaction costs (Li, Sullivan, Garcia-Feijóo, 2014).
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes the performance of
portfolios formed on the basis of volatility and estimated market beta, and looks at the style
tilts in these portfolios. Section 3 shows that the performance of defensive strategies is
explained by controlling for size, value, and profitability. Section 4 investigates the critical
role small cap growth stocks play in defensive style performance. Section 5 shows that these
results are robust to controlling for time variation in style tilts, by analyzing the performance
of defensive strategies dynamically hedged of factor exposures. Section 6 concludes.

Figure 1 shows the performance of quintile portfolios formed on the basis of estimated
volatilities (Panel A) and market betas (Panel B). Volatilities and betas are estimated each
month using one year of daily data. Quintiles are formed each month using NYSE break-
points.1 Portfolio returns are value-weighted, and ignore transaction costs. Following Baker,
Bradley, and Wurgler (2008), the sample begins in January 1968. This start date basically
    1
     I use NYSE breaks, instead of the CRSP breaks employed in Baker, Bradley, and Wurgler (2008), because
of strong size biases in the volatility portfolios. Using CRSP breaks yields extreme tilts, with an end of the
sample average market cap in the high volatility quintile of only $33 million, and the entire quintile making
up on average less than 1.2% of total market capitalization. See Bali and Cakici (2008) for a more detailed
analysis of the differences in volatility strategy performance using CRSP and NYSE breaks.

coincides with the date at which high volatility stocks began underperforming low volatility
stocks, and thus bias the results toward finding impressive defensive strategy performance
(see Appendix A for pre-1968 performance).
   The figure shows that the most aggressive stocks, i.e. those in the high volatility or
high market beta quintile, have dramatically underperformed the rest of the market. This
underperformance is especially pronounced for the high volatility portfolio. In both panels
the figure shows little variation in performance between the other four portfolios, which all
closely track the market.
   Figure 2 shows Morningstar-type style boxes for the aggressive and defensive portfolios,
defined using both volatility (Panel A) and market beta (Panel B). Formally the figure shows
log-likelihood ratios that a stock picked at random from one of the defensive or aggressive
volatility or beta portfolios is in particular size and value quintiles (defined using NYSE
breaks), relative to the likelihood that a stock picked at random from the entire universe is
in the same size and value quintiles. That is, the log-likelihood ratio LLRij k that a stock in
risk quintile k is in size quintile i and value quintile j is given by
                                                                     

Rkt are market equity quintile i, book-to-market quintile j , and risk quintile k, respectively,
all at time-t. The data underlying the figure are reported in Table 8, in the appendix.
   The figure shows strong size and value tilts to the defensive and aggressive portfolios.
These are especially pronounced in the portfolios formed on the basis of volatility. The
left half of Panel A shows a growth tilt, and an extreme tilt toward small caps, for the high
volatility portfolio. The right half shows a strong value tilt, and an extreme tilt toward large
caps, for the low volatility portfolio. Panel B shows a growth tilt to the high beta portfolios,
and small cap and value tilts to the low beta portfolios, though these tilts are less extreme
than those observed on the volatility portfolios.

are provided in Table 8 in the appendix.



                                                                6
   The tilts observed in Figure 2 can also be seen in Tables 1 and 2, which formally ana-
lyze the performance of the volatility and beta portfolios shown in Figure 1. Panel A gives
volatility portfolio characteristics. It does not show significant variation in the time-series
average valuations of the low and high volatility portfolios, but shows enormous variation
in firm size across portfolios. The low volatility stocks are on average more than 25 times
as large as the high volatility stocks at the end of the sample. As a result the high volatil-
ity portfolio on average holds less than nine percent of the market by capitalization, despite
holding almost half of stocks by name. Panel B shows that the average returns across volatil-
ity portfolios are basically flat, or even slightly increasing with volatility, with the exception
of the extremely low returns to the most aggressive stocks. Panel C shows the typical Black,
Jensen, and Scholes (1972) failure of the CAPM, with a significant negative alpha for the
high volatility/high beta portfolio, and a significant positive alpha for the low volatility/low
beta portfolio. Panel D shows results of Fama and French (1993) three-factor regressions us-
ing the volatility portfolio returns, and provides further evidence of the size and value tilts in
the defensive strategies. The long/short strategy has a large value tilt (HML loading of 0.42),
and an enormous large cap tilt (SMB loading of -1.12). Despite the highly significant factor
loadings, the three-factor model is unable to price the defensive strategy, which generates
three-factor abnormal returns of 68 basis points per month (t-stat of 4.29). Five-sixths of this
alpha (57 out of 68 bps/month) is delivered, however, by the aggressive stocks on the short
side of the strategy, with only one-sixth, or eleven basis points per month, coming from the
actual defensive stocks.
   Table 2 shows similar, though less challenging, results for the portfolios sorted on esti-
mated market betas. The table provides evidence of larger value tilts, though smaller size
tilts, to the beta portfolios. It also shows that while the anti-beta strategy generates a sig-
nificant CAPM alpha, it does not deliver significant abnormal returns after controlling for
exposures to the size and value factors. Because the volatility strategies present a challenge
to the standard three-factor model while the beta strategies do not, the remainder of the paper
focuses on the former, relegating test results for beta strategies to the appendix.

2.1 Defensive strategy style drivers

Table 3 shows results of Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions of volatility onto variables
known to predict cross-sectional variation in returns (similar results using the other domi-
nant defensive indicator, estimated market beta, as the dependent variable are shown in the
Appendix, in Table 9). It also shows results using leverage as the explanatory variable, be-
cause low leverage is frequently employed in industry as an additional defensive signal. The
results of the table help explain the style tilts observed in Figure 1 and 2, and provides further
insights into the underlying nature of defensive equity.
    Specification (1) shows the highly significant negative correlation between volatility and
size, and explains why stocks picked on the basis of low volatility tend to be large. Speci-
fication (2) shows that there is not a significant univariate correlation between volatility and
valuations.
    Specification (3) shows that defensive strategies tilt toward high profitability. Enterprise-
level operating profitability, defined as revenues minus costs of goods sold minus selling,
general and administrative expenses, all scaled by assets, is an even more significant neg-
ative predictor of volatility than size. Novy-Marx’s (2013) gross profitability, Fama and
French’s (2014) book-level operating profitability, Ball et. al.’s (2014) R&D adjusted asset-
level operating profitability, and even simple net income-to-book equity (ROE), are all highly
significant negative predictors of volatility. I employ enterprise-level operating profitability
here, and for all further discussions of profitability, for the simple expediency that it is this
measure that empirically has the most power explaining volatility. The power profitability
has forecasting expected returns is robust across profitability specification, and the mea-
sure employed here has similar power explaining cross-sectional variation in returns to gross
profitability. For more on the performance of portfolios sorted on enterprise level operating
profitability, and for tests employing alternative measures of profitability to predict volatility,
see Appendix Tables 10 and 11.
    Specification (4) shows that leverage, at least as a univariate predictor, also has power ex-
plaining volatility—higher levels of leverage are significantly associated with higher volatil-
ities.

   Specification (5) shows results of regressions that employ all four explanatory variables.
Its most interesting feature is that valuations, after controlling for size and profitability, be-
come highly significant correlates of volatility. Highly volatile stocks tend to be not only
small, but also unprofitable, and to carry high valuations. The insignificant coefficient on val-
uations in specification (3), and the relatively modest HML loading on the defensive strategy
in Table 1, result from failing to control for profitability, together with the significant negative
correlation between profitability and valuations. That is, while value stocks are on average
less volatile, holding all else equal, value stocks also tend to be smaller and less profitable,
and smaller and less profitable stocks tend to be more volatile. These size and profitability
tilts tend to obscure the true magnitude of the role value plays in defensive strategies. Spec-
ification (5) also shows that there is no significant role played by leverage after accounting
for size, valuations, and profitability.
   Because defensive stocks tend to be more profitable, and because they also tilt more to
value than one would think after controlling for profitability, controlling for these effects is
crucial for understanding the performance of defensive strategies.

3        Defensive strategy performance controlling for size
Controlling for size is critical when analyzing strategies based on volatility, because the size
biases observed in the unconditional sorts on volatility (Table 1) are particularly extreme.
The size bias also interacts with value, which has experienced much stronger performance
among small cap stocks. Table 4 controls for size by constructing defensive strategies within
size universes.2
        At the start of each month firms are assigned to size portfolios, defined by NYSE market
cap deciles (size portfolios characteristics provided in Panel A of Table 4). Within each size
decile a defensive-minus-aggressive (DMA) strategy is formed, by buying (selling) the 30%
of stocks with the lowest (highest) estimated volatility. Returns are again value-weighted,
and ignore transaction costs.3 Panel B of Table 4 shows that the average monthly excess
returns to the ten DMA strategies was almost 50 basis points per month. While this per-
formance was somewhat concentrated in the lowest three size deciles, which make up on
average just 5.4 percent of the market by capitalization, performance was positive in every
size decile, and a Gibbons, Ross, and Shanken (GRS, 1989) test rejects the null that the
excess returns are jointly zero at the one percent level. Panel C shows that the strategies
on average have loadings of -0.84 on the market, leading to all ten strategies having highly
significant CAPM alphas, which average 90 basis points per month.
        Panel D shows that the Fama and French model explains much more of the strategies’
return variation than the CAPM, an average of 61.4% compared to 36.1%, but explains less
than a third of the strategies’ average returns. The three factor model has some success
pricing the defensive strategies in the three largest size deciles, which make up on average
80% of the market by capitalization, but even among these large cap stocks the defensive
strategies deliver positive, though insignificant, abnormal returns.
    2
      Controlling for size is equally important when analyzing strategies based on market beta. For example, the
signal weighting procedure employed by Frazzini and Pedersen (2014), which overweights small stocks even
more than an equal-weighting scheme, is a crucial driver of the performance of their beta-based BAB factor.
Results of tests similar to those presented in Table 4, using defensive strategies constructed within size deciles
on the basis of estimated market beta instead of volatility, are provide in the Appendix in Table 12.
    3
      I use the top and bottom 30% when constructing these strategies inside the size portfolios. The largest size
deciles contain only about 200 names at the end of the sample, and even fewer in the early sample. A more
extreme second sort consequence yields poorly diversified strategies.


                                                       12
     Table 4. Volatility portfolio performance by size deciles
     The table reports the performance of defensive-minus-aggressive (DMA) strategies, constructed within each NYSE size decile by buying (selling)
     the 30% of stocks with the lowest (highest) estimated volatility. It also reports performance of the strategies relative to the CAPM, the Fama and
     French three-factor model, and relative to the market and similarly constructed profitability and value strategies (profitable-minus-unprofitable
     [PMU] and value-minus-growth [VMG], formed on the basis of profitability ([GP-SGA]/A) and valuations (B/M), respectively). All portfolios
     are rebalanced monthly, and returns are value-weighted and ignore transaction costs. The sample covers January 1986 to December 2013.

   Panel E compares the performance of the defensive strategies constructed within size
deciles to the performance of similarly constructed profitability and value strategies. These
profitable-minus-unprofitable (PMU) and value-minus-growth (VMG) strategies are formed
using the same methodology as the defensive strategies, but the positions in each strategy are
selected on the basis of profitability ([GP-SGA]/A) or valuations (B/M) instead of volatil-
ity. None of the defensive strategies yield significant abnormal returns relative to similarly
constructed profitability and value strategies, even after accounting for the hedge they pro-
vide for the market. All of the defensive strategies have highly significant positive loadings
on profitability, and accounting for profitability increases the strategies’ loadings on value.
As a result of these large profitability and value loadings, none of the defensive strategies
generates significant abnormal returns, despite having market betas averaging -0.50. A GRS
test fails to reject that the three-factor residual returns to the ten strategies are jointly zero
(p-value of 34.2%).
   While the returns of the ten defensive strategies constructed within size deciles are not
abnormal relative to similarly constructed profitability and value strategies, the performance
of profitability and value strategies cannot be similarly explained using defensive strategies.
Table 5 shows that the profitability (value) strategies have abnormal returns, relative to a
model that accounts for the market, value (profitability) strategies, and defensive strategies,
that average twice as large as the abnormal returns observed on the defensive strategies in
Panel E of Table 4. GRS tests in both cases also strongly reject that the three-factor residual
returns to the ten strategies are jointly zero, implying that value and profitability are both
outside of the span of defensive strategies, the market, and each other.

4         Role of small cap growth
The previous section showed that size, value, and profitability all contribute to defensive
strategy performance, because volatile stocks tend to be small, unprofitable growth stocks.
This is illustrated simply in Figure 3, which gives the performance of the same five volatility
portfolios shown in Figure 1, together with the performance of the market, and the portfo-
lio of those stocks with below NYSE median market capitalization, below NYSE median
profitability, and below NYSE median book-to-markets. The figure again shows the poor
performance of the most aggressive stocks, but shows that this performance was comparable
to that of unprofitable small cap growth stocks. This figure also shows that the performance
of the other four portfolios was similar to that of the broad market.
     While defensive strategy performance is partially driven by its tendency to exclude small

cap growth stocks, small cap growth plays an important additional, indirect role in the per-
formance of defensive strategies. While the previous section shows defensive performance
is stronger among smaller stocks, this section shows that defensive performance is, after
controlling for style, wholly concentrated in the small cap growth sector.
   Figure 4 shows the performance of defensive strategies constructed within four broad
style universes: small growth, small value, large growth, and large value, where large (small)
is defined as above (below) NYSE median market capitalization, and value (growth) is de-
fined by above (below) NYSE median book-to-market. These defensive strategies buy (sell)

through December 2013.

the 20% of stocks with the lowest (highest) estimated volatility in each style universe. Port-
folios are rebalanced monthly. Returns are value-weighted and ignore transaction costs. The
sample again covers January 1968 to December 2013.
   The figure shows that $1 invested in the beginning of 1968 in the defensive strategy con-
structed within small cap growth, a segment that accounts for on average 38.0% of names but
only 5.4% of the market by capitalization, would have grown to $429, ignoring transaction
costs, by the end of 2013. That same dollar invested in defensive strategies constructed in
the small cap value or large cap growth universes would have grown to only $1.22 or $1.34,
respectively, a period over which a dollar invested in T-bills grew to $10.30. That same dollar
invested into a defensive strategy constructed using large cap value stocks would have left
the investor with only $0.18 by the end of 2013, an 82% loss of capital over the sample.
   In order to understand why the small growth defensive strategy performed so well, it is
useful to look at the characteristics of the volatility portfolios within the small growth sector.
Time-series average characteristics for these portfolios are reported in Table 6. The table
shows extreme valuations and profitabilities for the most volatile small growth stocks. These
volatile stocks are on average less than a third as large as the typical small growth stock. The
entire portfolio also has negative book equity, negative earnings, and operating profitability
less than one fifth that of the next highest volatility portfolio. The large differences in returns
between the most and least volatile small growth stocks results from this extreme variation

The table reports time-series average characteristics of quintile portfolios sorted on volatility, restricted to
stocks with below average NYSE median market capitalizations and book-to-markets. The sample covers

in valuations and profitabilities. In the other sectors, where defensive stocks do not signifi-
cantly outperform aggressive stocks, sorting on volatility yields little variation in operating
profitability, and in the value sectors the defensive strategies actually tilt to growth, not value.
   The extreme variation in valuations and profitabilities that result from sorting small
growth stocks on the basis of volatility can only arise, however, because of the extreme vari-
ation in these characteristics that exists in this segment, and this variation can just as easily
be exploited directly. In fact, Table 7 shows that the small growth defensive strategies’ im-
pressive performance was completely unremarkable after controlling for the strategy’s value
and profitability tilts. The first specification shows that the small growth defensive strategy
generated excess returns of more than 1.5% per month. The second and third specifications
show even larger CAPM and Fama and French three-factor alphas, both significant with t-
stats of six. The fourth specification shows that the small growth defensive strategy’s returns
are completely explained by the market and small growth profitability and value factors.
The fifth specification shows similar results using a two-factor model employing the market
and the returns to a strategy that buys (sells) small growth stocks with above (below) both
segment median operating profitability and book-to-market.
   Figure 5 shows the performance of the small growth defensive strategy, together with the
performance of the three-and two-factor replicating portfolios from specifications (4) and
(5) of the previous table. The three-factor replicating portfolio holds $1.29 of T-bills, and
$0.73 and $0.87 of the small growth stocks with the highest operating profitabilities and
book-to-markets, respectively, while shorting $0.29 of the market and $0.73 and $0.87 of the
small growth stocks with the lowest operating profitabilities and book-to-markets, respec-
tively. The two-factor replicating portfolio holds $1.32 of T-bills and $1.46 of small growth
stocks with both above segment median operating profitabilities and book-to-markets, while
shorting $0.32 of the market and $1.46 of small growth stocks with both below segment
median operating profitabilities and book-to-markets. The figure shows that over the 46 year
sample $1 invested in the small growth defensive strategy instead of the three- or two-factor
replicating portfolios would have grown less ($429, vs. $560 and $1,015), and subjected the
investor to more volatility (28.8%, vs. 24.3% and 24.7%).

  Figure 5. Performance of the small growth defensive strategy, and replicating portfolios based
  on profitability and value
  Growth of $1 invested in the small growth defensive strategy, and replicating strategies that buy
  (sell) small growth stocks with relatively high (low) profitabilities and book-to-markets. Large
  (small) is defined as above (below) NYSE median market capitalization, and value (growth) is
  defined by above (below) NYSE median book-to-market. The small growth defensive strategy buys
  (sells) the 20% of stocks with the lowest (highest) estimated volatility in the small growth segment.
  The three-factor replicating portfolio uses the market, a factor that buys (sells) the 20% of stocks
  with the highest (lowest) operating profitabilities in the small growth segment, and a factor that buys
  (sells) the 20% of stocks with the highest (lowest) book-to-markets in the small growth segment.
  The two-factor replicating portfolio uses the market and factor that buys (sells) small growth stocks
  with above (below) both segment median operating profitability book-to-market. All portfolios are
  rebalanced monthly. Returns are value-weighted and ignore transaction costs. The sample covers
  January 1968 through December 2013.

5    Dynamic hedging
Some of the best known defensive strategies, such as Frazzini and Pedersen’s (2014) betting-
against-beta strategy, are actively managed in order to keep the strategies close to beta-
neutral. This suggests the possibility that time-variation in factor exposures, and proper
timing to exploit these factors’ associated premia, could be important for defensive strategy
performance.
    Figure 6 shows that defensive (low volatility) and aggressive (high volatility) stocks do
have important time-variation in their exposures to the Fama and French factors. Panel A
shows the large average spread between aggressive and defensive stocks’ market loadings,
but shows that this spread was more variable later in the sample. Panel B shows the extreme
average spread between aggressive and defensive stocks’ SMB loadings, but also shows
sharp contractions in this spread around the bear markets of the early 1980’s, the early 2000’s,
and especially during the more recent great recession, when the spread actually briefly turned
negative. Panel C shows the defensive stocks’ higher average HML loadings, but shows
much more variation in the spread between defensive and aggressive stocks than for the other
factor loadings. In fact, for much of the pre-1968 sample defensive strategies tilted strongly
to growth, not value, which helps explain why defensive stocks have only provided higher
returns than aggressive stocks in the post-1967 sample (for pre-1968 defensive strategy factor
loadings see Figure 9, in the Appendix). The extreme defensive strategy growth tilt observed
around 2010 is mostly due to a sharp concurrent widening of the volatility spread between the
most and least profitable stocks. At this time the high volatility portfolio became increasingly
dominated by less profitable stocks, which on average have lower valuations. The defensive
strategy’s peak HML loading is cut 55% by accounting for its large negative profitability
tilt (i.e., in four-factor rolling regressions, which additionally include a profitable-minus-
unprofitable factor, constructed in the same manner as HML on the basis of operating profits-
to-assets instead of book-to-market).

The figure shows the defensive strategy’s estimated loadings on the three Fama and French factors
over time. Estimates are made using one year of daily data. The defensive strategy holds (shorts)
the least (most) volatile quintile of stocks. Quintiles are determined using NYSE breaks, and the
defensive strategy is rebalanced monthly. The sample covers January 1968 through December 2013.

Figure 7. Hedged performance of the volatility portfolios and unprofitable small growth
Growth of $1 invested in hedged volatility portfolios, and a hedged portfolio of unprofitable small
growth stocks. Volatility portfolios are determined using NSYE quintile break points. The portfolio
of unprofitable small growth stocks includes those with below NYSE median market capitalization,
above NYSE median profitability, and above NYSE median book-to-markets. All portfolios are
hedged of their exposures to the three Fama and French factors, where these exposures are estimated
using the preceding year of daily returns. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly. Returns are value-
weighted, and ignore transaction costs. T-bill return is provided for comparison. The sample covers
January 1968 through December 2013.


   Figure 7 shows that while their is significant time variation in defensive strategies’ factor
loadings, this variation is basically irrelevant for defensive strategy performance. It shows
the performance of the five volatility quintile portfolios, and a portfolio of small unprofitable
growth stocks (defined as those stocks that have below NYSE median market capitalization,
book-to-market, and operating profitability), all hedged for their exposures to the three Fama
and French factors. Dynamic hedging does not improve performance. In fact, outside of
the most aggressive stocks dynamically hedging the portfolios yields strategies that perform
similarly to T-bills, which is equivalent to saying that the unhedged strategies perform sim-
ilarly to their dynamically rebalanced three-factor replicating portfolios. The most volatile

                                                   26
stocks, hedged of their exposure to the three Fama and French factors, significantly under-
perform T-bills, but do not perform as poorly as the hedged portfolio of small unprofitable
growth stocks that they most closely resemble.


6    Conclusion
Over the last 45 years defensive stocks have delivered higher returns than the most aggressive
stocks, and defensive strategies, at least those based on volatility, have delivered significant
Fama and French three-factor alphas. This performance is not at all anomalous, however, af-
ter properly controlling for size, relative valuations, and, most critically, profitability. While
investors would have benefited from a defensive tilt over the period, these benefits derive ef-
fectively from an unprofitable small growth exclusion, which could have been implemented
more efficiently, and at lower cost, directly.

The table reports Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions of volatility onto various profitability measures
(Panel A), and onto the components of the primary profitability measure employed in this paper (Panel B). GP
is gross profitability, defined as revenues (REV) minus cost of goods sold (COGS); SGA is selling, general,
and administrative costs; IE is total interest expense; R&D is research and development expenditures; NI
is net income; and A and BE are book assets and book equity, respectively. Because of the persistence in
the variables Newey and West t-statistics are reported, calculated using 60 monthly lags. The sample covers

     The table reports the performance of defensive-minus-aggressive (DMA) strategies, constructed within each NYSE size decile by buying (selling)
     the 30% of stocks with the lowest (highest) estimated market betas. It also reports performance of the strategies relative to the CAPM, the Fama
     and French three-factor model, and relative to the market and similarly constructed profitability and value strategies (profitable-minus-unprofitable
     [PMU] and value-minus-growth [VMG], formed on the basis of profitability ([GP-SGA]/A) and valuations (B/M), respectively). All portfolios
     are rebalanced monthly, and returns are value-weighted and ignore transaction costs. The sample covers January 1986 to December 2013.

     Table 13. Spanning tests of value, profitability, and market beta-based defensive strategies, constructed within size deciles
     The table reports the performance of value-minus-growth (VMG) and profitable-minus-unprofitable (PMU) strategies, constructed within each
     NYSE size decile by buying (selling) the 30% of stocks with the lowest (highest) valuations (B/M) and profitability ([GP-SGA]/A), respectively.
     It also reports performance of both sets of strategies relative to the market, each other, and similarly constructed defensive strategies (defensive-
     minus-aggressive [DFA], defined using estimated market beta). All portfolios are rebalanced monthly, and returns are value-weighted and ignore
     transaction costs. The sample covers January 1986 to December 2013.

Figure 9. Defensive strategy Fama and French factor loadings, before 1968
The figure shows the defensive strategy’s estimated loadings on the three Fama and French factors
over time. Estimates are made using one year of daily data. The defensive strategy holds (shorts)
the least (most) volatile quintile of stocks. Quintiles are determined using NYSE breaks, and the
defensive strategy is rebalanced monthly. The sample covers January 1932 through December 1967.
