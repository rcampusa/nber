Do external imbalances increase the risk of financial crises? In this paper, we study the experience
of 14 developed countries over 140 years (1870-2008). We exploit our long-run dataset in a number
of different ways. First, we apply new statistical tools to describe the temporal and spatial patterns
of crises and identify five episodes of global financial instability in the past 140 years. Second, we
study the macroeconomic dynamics before crises and show that credit growth tends to be elevated
and natural interest rates depressed in the run-up to global financial crises. Third, we show that recessions
associated with crises lead to deeper recessions and stronger turnarounds in imbalances than during
normal recessions. Finally, we ask if external imbalances help predict financial crises. Our overall
result is that credit growth emerges as the single best predictor of financial instability, but the correlation
between lending booms and current account imbalances has grown much tighter in recent decades.

1     Introduction

It is a great irony that crises are orphans right up to their inception, at which point they become

the scions of new economic orthodoxies and a few fortune tellers. In the 2007/08 crisis some have

taken issue with the Federal Reserve and a policy that kept interest rates too low in the wake of the

2001 recession (J. B. Taylor 2007, 2009).1 Also potentially critical flaws in the reigning doctrine

of inflation targeting have been pointed out with reference to its nonessential role for money and

its neglect of distortions and instabilities arising from bank (or nonbank) credit channels (Borio

and White 2003; Goodhart 2007; Borio, 2008; Christiano et al. 2010). Yet an influential school of

thought, popular among policy makers, puts the blame less on short-term interest rates controlled

by central banks, and more on international imbalances (Economic Report of the President 2009).

Among others, Ben Bernanke (2009) and Mervyn King (2010) have linked the crisis to capital

flows from developing into developed economies, mainly in the form of reserve accumulation by

emerging markets. These reverse capital flows, the argument goes, opened up a Pandora’s box of

financial distortions. As foreign savings were predominantly channeled through government (or

central bank) hands into Treasuries, private investors turned elsewhere to look for higher yields,

which contributed to the global mis-pricing of financial risks. In the words of King (2010):


          The massive flows of capital from the new entrants into western financial markets

      pushed down interest rates and encouraged risk-taking on an extraordinary scale. . . Capital

      flows provided the fuel which the developed world’s inadequately designed and regu-

      lated financial system then ignited to produce a firestorm that engulfed us all.


    An intermediate position stresses that global imbalances and financial crises are the product

of “common causes.” These authors argue that the interaction of domestic and external factors

prepared the ground for the boom that went bust in 2007–2009. Lax monetary policy, low real

interest rates, financial innovation, and credit market distortions created a dangerous cocktail,

but international factors such as exchange rates and other economic policies pursued in emerg-

ing markets also played a critical role (Obstfeld and Rogoff 2009; Obstfeld 2010; Ferguson and

Schularick 2010).
   1 Also limits to liability and a short-term bonus culture have been cited as a reason for excessive risk taking

(Alessandrini and Haldane 2009; Hume and Sentence 2010). Others have pointed to political incentives for excessive
risk taking as part of a mistaken social policy agenda, see Calomiris (2010).




                                                        1
   Proposals to limit imbalances feature prominently on the post-crisis policy agenda. With an eye

on limiting financial fragility, Goodhart and Tsomocos (2010) have proposed taxes on capital flows

to keep risky imbalances in check; others have suggested reciprocal capital account restrictions

to deal with excessive reserve accumulation (Gros 2010). And as this paper was completed, the

G20 announced a proposal for a system to monitor and limit current account imbalances with the

support of the IMF. Yet, when it comes to the issue of financial instability, to date there is little

empirical research that sheds light on the role of the global imbalances—as compared to other

factors—in credit boom-bust episodes in advanced economies.2

   In this paper we reach back to the economic history of the past 140 years to study the linkage

between the international economy and financial instability. Building on a long-run cross-country

dataset covering 14 advanced countries, we assess the role of external factors in financial crises. Our

broad historical purview is motivated by the fact that disruptive events like economic depressions

and financial crises are “rare events”, at least in developed economies. Thus, sample sizes are

small, and providing a detailed quantitative rendition requires that we expand our dataset across

both time and space. As in recent work by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009), Barro (2009), and Almunia

et al. (2009), the purpose of this paper is to go back to comparative economic history as a way to

more robustly explore the link between financial crises and external imbalances.

   Our empirical analysis proceeds in four steps. In the first part, we set the stage by applying

new nonparametric methods to study the temporal and spatial coherence of financial crises across

countries in the past 140 years. To our knowledge, this represents the first detailed attempt at

analyzing these correlation patterns of financial crises in the Western world in the past century.

The goal of this section is to see what, if any, empirical regularities can be detected in the frequency

and distribution of financial crises across countries in the past 140 years. Our results are by

and large negative. While we can identify four big synchronized global crises when a significant

number of countries in our sample experienced financial crises—in 1890, 1907, 1921, 1930/31, and

2007/08—about half of all crises occur in one country only. However, it is striking from the data

that no financial crises happened during the Bretton Woods years of tight financial regulation and

capital controls the the years from WW2 until the mid 1970s.
  2 There is a longer and stronger literature examining these factors in emerging markers. See, for example,

Kaminsky and Reinhart (1999).




                                                     2
   In the second part, we provide descriptive statistical evidence on the behaviour of key economic

and financial variables in the years leading up to national and global financial crises. The aim is

to identify in what sense synchronized crises across many countries (‘global crises’) are different

from national (‘isolated’) crises. Our results indicate that boom and bust dynamics have been

more pronounced in the ‘global’ crises as measured by growth and investment dynamics. Tellingly,

although both credit and money growth are strongly elevated before both types of financial crises,

we find historical evidence that global crises typically occurred in an environment of particularly

depressed natural interest rates. Crises are also typically preceded by somewhat larger current

account deficits relative to the country’s own history—a fact that we exploit later in the paper

when we explore how to improve crisis prediction tools. At this stage of the paper there is in

hand prima facie evidence that both domestic credit and external imbalances could play a role in

financial crises.

   In the third part, we focus on the economic effects of financial crises. A key contribution

of this paper is that we differentiate between recessions that are preceded by a financial crises

and ‘normal’ recessions. In other words, we ask whether financial busts lead to meaningfully

different performance compared with ‘normal’ recessions—i.e., not compared with normal times.

We also differentiate between national and global financial crises. For this more detailed analysis

a consistent business cycle dating method was needed for 14 countries over 140 years. We detail

our methodology in the appendix. Our key results are the following: deflationary tendencies are

considerably more pronounced in crisis recessions than in normal business cycle downturns. Crisis

recessions also display a strongly negative impact on loan growth, which slows down considerably

more than in normal recessions. Unlike in the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, current

accounts generally show a general tendency to improve in postwar recessions, but even more so in

those associated with a financial crisis.

   In the fourth and last empirical part, we ask whether external imbalances help predict the

occurrence of financial instability in advanced economies. More specifically, we add long-run

current account data as an additional ‘early warning signal’ into a crisis prediction framework

developed in Schularick and A. M. Taylor (2009). While we find that credit trends, not external

imbalances remain the best predictor of financial instability, the predictive ability of the model

increases slightly if external factors are added to the regressions. In particular, in the post Bretton-

Woods era the role of international capital flows (as measured by current account balances) has


                                                   3
increased considerably and the interaction of external imbalances and credit growth gains in

importance. We conclude that there is some evidence that in an era of high capital mobility

elastic current accounts add to financial stability risks, but the primary warning indicator is still

credit growth.



2     Preliminaries

In this section we discuss the new dataset and new methods that we will put to use.


2.1    Our Data

Our dataset covers 14 countries over the years 1870–2008. The countries included are the United

States, Canada, Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,

Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. At the core of the dataset are yearly

data for outstanding bank loans (domestic bank credit), complemented with a narrow (M1) and

broad (typically M2 or M3) monetary aggregates as well as data on nominal and real output,

inflation and investment. For most variables we could rely on the dataset from Schularick and A.

M. Taylor (2009). We extended this dataset using annual data on current account position and

trade balances from various sources that are documented in the data appendix. With two minor

exceptions (Switzerland before 1921 and Spain in the 1920s), we were able to compile long-run

current account series matching the credit and real economic data series. The main sources for

the current account and trade data were Jones and Obstfeld (1997), A. M. Taylor (2002), the

various volumes compiled by Mitchell (2007a, b, c), as well as the IMF’s International Financial

Statistics (2010). We amended these using national sources wherever necessary and possible. We

are grateful to a number of colleagues who shared their data or directed us to the appropriate

sources.3 Table 1 briefly summarizes our dataset.

    With regard to the coding of financial crisis episodes we follow the description in Schularick

and A. M. Taylor (2009), which itself relies heavily on Bordo et al. (2001) as well as Reinhart

and Rogoff (2009) for the pre WWII years. For the post-1960 period detailed crisis histories

can found in the databases compiled by Laeven and Valencia (2008), as well as in the evidence

described by Cecchetti et al. (2009). A table showing the crisis events by country-year can be

found in the appendix. In line with the previous studies, we define systemic financial crises as

events during which a country’s banking sector experiences bank runs, sharp increases in default

rates accompanied by large losses of capital that result in public intervention, bankruptcy, or the

forced merger of major financial institutions (Laeven and Valencia 2008).


2.2     Our Classification Methods

Financial crises, clinical depression and spam e-mail share common features that require specialized

statistical methods. They can be characterized as binary events (one is in a financial crisis or not,

one is depressed or not, an e-mail is spam or not) whose outcome may be difficult to verify even

ex-post—was it a financial crisis or a simple recession, clinical depression or bipolar disorder, spam

e-mail or a commercial e-mail about a product we own?

   In all cases, it is desirable to have a means to predict the binary outcome but here one may

not be concerned as much with a precise probability estimate about the likelihood of an outcome,

as much as taking some action in response to that prediction and its quality. It is perhaps this

last feature that differentiates some of the tools that we employ in this paper from the traditional

discussion of binary dependent variables common in the econometrics literature. Thus some brief

discussion of our techniques is called for.

   Crises are events, often observed infrequently, that by nature deviate from the norm in a

sizeable manner. Handling such a problem therefore requires methods that are specially flexible


                                                     5
and for this reason the statistical design necessarily relies heavily on nonparametric methods. Let

the state variable St ∈ {0, 1} be a binary indicator that is one when there is a crisis in period t,

and zero otherwise. In this paper we investigate several features associated with such a variable.

       A natural place to start is by asking whether one can detect such events in advance using

information from variables dated prior to the onset of the crisis. For this purpose, there exist well

known parametric models for binary dependent variables. Instead, we begin by thinking about

the decision problem faced by the policymaker. Suppose ybt ∈ (−∞, ∞) is a scoring classifier such

that for a given threshold c, then ybt > c is a signal taken to predict that St = 1 and ybt ≤ c

corresponds to St = 0 instead. Notice that ybt could be a probability prediction from a typical

binary model (such as a probit, logit, etc.); a linear probability model; a factor model; etc. For

the time being, it is not important to be specific as the framework we discuss is quite general.

There are four outcomes facing the policy maker, summarized in the following table:

                                           Prediction

                                          Negative                             Positive

 Outcome         Negative        T N (c) = P (b
                                              yt < c|St = 0)       F P (c) = P (b
                                                                                yt > c|St = 0)

                 Positive        F N (c) = P (b
                                              yt < c|St = 1)       T P (c) = P (b
                                                                                yt > c|St = 1)

where T N (c) and T P (c) refer to the correct classification rates of non-crisis (“negatives”) and

crisis (“positives”) respectively; F N (c) and F P (c) refer to the incorrect classification rates of

negatives and positives respectively; and clearly T N (c) + F P (c) = 1 and F N (c) + T P (c) = 1.4

       A policymaker’s actions will be determined by balancing the costs and benefits associated

with his decisions and by the accuracy of the scoring classifier. Consider the first of these two

considerations. If π denotes the unconditional probability of a crisis and Uij for i ∈ {n, p} and

j ∈ {N, P } is the utility associated with each of the four states defined by the (classifier, outcome)

pair, then the utility of classification


                         U (c)    = UpP T P (c)π + UnP (1 − T P (c))π +                                            (1)

                                      UpN (1 − T N (c))(1 − π) + UnN T N (c)(1 − π)


is clearly seen to depend on c.
   4 Customarily, T P (c), the true positive rate, is called sensitivity and T N (c), the true negative rate, is called
specificity.

   Varying c will naturally change the true and false positive rates of classification (and, hence,

utility). For example, if c is very large, then T P (c) → 1 but F N (c) → 1 as well. On the other

hand, if c is very low, then T N (c) → 1 but F P (c) → 1. For economists, a natural way to summarize

the classification ability of ybt and these trade-offs is to construct a production possibilities frontier

that plots the maximal combinations of T P (c) and T N (c) for different values of c ∈ (−∞, ∞).

Jordà and A. M. Taylor (2010) call this curve the correct classification frontier (CCF), a concept

closely related to the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve in statistics.

   The CCF lives in the unit square [0, 1] × [0, 1], where a perfect classifier is one for which

T P (c) = 1 for any T N (c) and corresponds to the north and east sides of the unit square (see

Figure 1). An uninformative classifier on the other hand, is one where T P (c) = 1 − T N (c) ∀c

and corresponds to the north-west/south-east “coin-toss” diagonal. Therefore the closer the CCF

is to the north-east corner, the better the scoring classifier ybt . Jordà and A. M. Taylor (2010)

also show how to construct a utility-weighted variant of the correct classification frontier, denoted

CCF? (and to conduct inference on that object) in a manner consistent with equation (1).

   The next step is to find the optimal operating point, which is determined by the tangent of the

policymaker’s utility function (1) with the CCF. However, in general policy trade-offs are unknown

to the econometrician and thus it is necessary to construct summary measures of classification

accuracy that, as much as possible, accommodate a wide range of scenarios.

    Traditionally, one such measure is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic defined as:

                                                                           

which is based on the distance between the maximum of the average correct classification rates

attainable and 1/2, the average correct classification rate for a coin-toss. Notice that KS ∈ [0, 1],

with 0 meaning no classification ability and 1 meaning perfect classification ability. Inference on
                                                                                               5
KS is relatively simple, although it involves some nonstandard distributions.

    However, the KS statistic refers to a specific value of c that may or may not be relevant for

the decisions encapsulated by expression (1). This is especially true when the payoffs Uij are not

symmetric and/or the distribution of outcomes is particularly skewed, both likely features in our

data. In response to these difficulties, another commonly used statistic is the area under the CCF

or AUC. It is easy to see that for a coin-toss the AUC = 0.5 (the area under the north-west/south-

east diagonal in the unit-square) whereas for a perfect classifier, AUC = 1, most applications in

practice falling somewhere in-between. Inference on AUC is very simple, since its distribution is

this statistic particularly convenient since hypothesis tests can be constructed using the Wald principle.

3     Summary Measures of Spatial and Temporal Dependence:

      Are Crises Random Events?

A central question for a policymaker is to determine whether crises are random events that are

no more predictable than the outcome of a coin toss. Under this null, there is little that the

policymaker can do. Under the alternative, the onus is on the policymaker to come up with

“early warning systems,” and state-contingent responses; and this in turn creates a need for

the development of macroeconomic models whose dynamics could explain the formation of such

extreme events, how best to avoid them, and how best to respond to their onset.

    In this section we consider several nonparametric methods to assess some aspects of this null.

One area of immediate interest is whether there is any serial correlation or temporal dependence

in the binary crisis data. Another is whether there is any systematic spatial dependence. To

foreshadow out results in this section, we find no evidence of serial correlation in the crisis data

pattern, but we do find moderately strong evidence of some spatial dependence. Thus, in the

case of the big global crises, if other countries are having a crisis there is a good chance that your

country is having, or is about to have, a crisis too.


3.1    Duration Analysis

In the simplest of views we can think of crises as a Bernoulli trial with probability p. Under this

null, the duration between crisis events is distributed as a Geometric random variable. Under the

alternative, crises come in clusters, meaning that we are likely to observe a high proportion of

small durations relative to the theoretical quantiles implied by the Geometric distribution, thus

generating overdispersion. If one further assumes that the arrival of crises is independent across

countries, then, under the null, it is valid to pool observations across countries into a single sample.

    We begin by constructing the series of spells or durations between crisis events for each country

and consolidating these observations across countries to generate one long series. During this

process, we drop left- and right-censored durations that occur at the beginning and end of each

individual country’s sample. This resulted in 58 complete spells and the histogram and kernel

density estimate for these data are displayed in Figure 2, with a mean duration between crises of

28 years and a standard deviation of 24. We remark that during the period 1940–1973 no country

experienced a crisis and therefore it is natural to consider whether this oasis of calm represents a

 Figure 2: Empirical distribution of the duration between crises across all countries, 1870–2008




Notes: mean duration is 28 years, standard deviation is 24 years. Left-censored observations at the begin-
ning of each countryÕs sample are deleted, leaving 58 complete durations. Right censored observations at
the end of each countryÕs sample are also deleted (but since most countries experienced a crisis in either
2007 or 2008, these coincide with the end of the sample in any event).


break in the stochastic process describing our data. Omitting this period, the sample is reduced

further to 44 completed spells with the average duration between crises dropping to 15 years with

a standard deviation of 8. However, the histogram and kernel density estimates have the same

overall shape and are not reported for brevity.

   Hamilton and Jordà (2002) construct a dynamic model for just such discrete-duration data, the

autoregressive conditional hazard (or ACH) model and propose using simple autocorrelation and

partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF, respectively) to diagnose the serial correlation

properties of the data. This is done in Figure 3, which reveals no evidence of serial correlation

in the data. Ljung-Box statistics fail to reject the null that the data are serially uncorrelated at

any lag between 1 and 10. Furthermore, omitting the 1940–1973 period does not change these

results in the least, which at first blush may seem surprising. Part of the explanation is that the

truncation results in dropping the longest spell for each country (14 in total so that we go from

58 to 44 observations) but these observations are not influential in explaining the dynamics of the

data.

   Another possible manifestation of clustering over time would result in an empirical distribution

of the data that is overdispersed (see Hamilton and Jordà, 2002 for an explanation of this phe-

nomenon). Therefore, an alternative first-pass nonparametric diagnostic of temporal clustering of

crisis events is a Q-Q plot.

   Specifically, let n denote the 14 countries in our sample, each a time series with T observations.

Let Sit ∈ {0, 1} be a binary crisis variable for i = 1, ..., 14 and t = 1, ..., T. Then the maximum

likelihood estimate of p, the parameter of the Bernoulli/Geometric null distribution, is simply:

                                                Pn     PT
                                                 i=1      t=1   Sit
                                         pb =
                                                       nT

If the data are well represented by the Bernoulli/Geometric assumption, then a plot of the theoret-

ical quantiles for this distribution against the empirical quantiles of the duration distribution (the

Q-Q plot) will generate a graph that traces the 450 line. However, if there is any sort of cluster-

ing, across time, then, specially in the lower quantiles, there will be easily identifiable differences

between both distributions.

   The Q-Q plot is displayed in Figure 4 and shows that the data do not exhibit over-dispersion

with respect to the null of a Geometric distribution. A similar plot is obtained when omitting the

1940-1973 period. Thus far, the evidence points strongly against there being duration dependence

in the data that could be exploited to improve forecasting ability of crisis events. The next section

refines this analysis further with some recently introduced tools and examines whether crises tend

to come in country clusters.


3.2    Autoclassification and Cross-Classification Analysis

Even before examining the classification ability of any candidate explanatory variable (e.g., macroe-

conomic time series), perhaps the simplest scoring classifier one could consider are the lagged

values of the crisis indicator variable Sit . In a typical time series, the autocorrelation function is

a simple statistic that visually displays the serial correlation patterns of a variable with its past

values and where a white noise is the natural null model. Berge and Jordà (2010) introduce an

equivalent concept for classification problems that they dub the autoclassification function (ACF)

based on the area under the CCF. The results of the previous section do not suggest that there

is duration dependence but here dependence is assessed differently and in a manner that exploits

             The ACF displays the AUC values when ybit = St−k for k = 1, ..., q. Evidently, for k = 0 we get

         perfect classification and the AUC is trivially seen to equal 1. On the other hand, if the arrival

         of a crisis at time t − k has no impact on the likelihood of a crisis at time t, then its AUC = 0.5

         (rather than 0, as would be the case when computing a traditional autocorrelation). Together with

         the large-sample results in expression (3), the ACF provides a formal nonparametric method to

         examine whether the arrival of crises over time is random. The plot of the ACF for the combined

         sample of 14 countries in our sample is provided in Figure 5 and shows that even by this metric,

         there is still no evidence of time-dependence in the arrival of crises. The reported AUC values are

         statistically indistinguishable from the null value of AUC = 0.5.7
            7 Moreover, unlike the duration analysis of the previous section, the ACF can be computed on a country by

         country basis (Jordà and A. M. Taylor, 2010 discuss why, unlike other statistics, the AUC statistic is robust to
         situations where the unconditional probability of observing an event is low, such as in our application). The results
         of the per-country ACFs mirror that of the combined ACF displayed in Figure 5 and are not reported here for
         brevity.

           However, policymakers also worry about possible contagion from crises occurring in other

   countries—is there a similarly convenient, nonparametric statistic that could evaluate such a

   feature? We provide an answer to this question by blending the classification tools introduced

   above, with tools from network analysis (see, e.g. Watts and Strogatz, 1998). In particular, we

   consider two standard measures of network connectivity. The simplest one computes the incidence
                                                              Pn
   rate of crises across countries at time t, that is, rt = n1 i=1 Sit . However, it is also common to

   assess a network’s connectivity by measuring the wiring-ratio. The wiring ratio is similar in flavor

   to a “majority voting rule,” a tool commonly used in pattern recognition problems (see, e.g.

   Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman, 2009), and has increasing marginal effects as the network’s

   connectivity increases, as we shall see. Specifically, the wiring ratio, wt , can be computed as the

   number of connected pairs (i.e., country pairs simultaneously experiencing a crisis) out of all the

   possible pair-wise connections of a fully connected network.8
       8That is, if n is the number of nodes in the network (the number of countries in our case), there are n(n − 1)/2
   possible pair-wise connections (with 14 countries this number is 91). Suppose that at time t, 7 out of the 14
   countries experience a crisis. In that case there would be 7(7 − 1)/2 = 21 pair-wise connections for a wiring
   ratio wt = 21/91 = 0.24. Compare this number to rt = 0.5 and then it becomes clear that, whereas the relation
   between rt and the number of countries experiencing a crisis simultaneously is linear, the relation with respect to
   wt is concave so that the marginal effect of an additional country experiencing a crisis is low when only one other
   country is experiencing a crisis, but it becomes very high when many countries experience a crisis at the same time.




                                                                       14
   These two network connectivity measures, rt and wt , and their leads and lags can be used to

construct what we will call, a cross-classification function, a parallel concept to a cross-correlation

function. Specifically, for country i with crisis indicator Sit , compute the AUC based on setting

ybt = rt−k and ybt = wt−k for k = 0, ±1, ±2, ..., ±q. The top panels of Figures 6 (for rt ) and 7 (for

wt ) display the cross-classification patterns for each country in the sample whereas the bottom

panels of the figures display the time series for rt and wt , respectively.

   The top panels of Figures 6 and 7 put these features in more formal context. When a crisis

occurs in several other countries, the likelihood that another country will also experience a crisis

is high, as shown by the high and statistically significant AUC value at k = 0. But how about

the power of a cluster of countries experiencing a crisis for the purposes of predicting whether a

crisis will occur in later another country? This is evaluated using the AUC values displayed to

the right-hand side of k = 0, and they indicate that there is some classification ability when such

a cluster is observed the previous year, but probably not thereafter: the AUC values under either

measure are statistically different from 0.5 for the first lag k = 1, but not by a wide margin. In

the opposite direction, that is looking at classification ability of past events, there is not much

evidence of a relation between countries experiencing crises simultaneously. There results survive

largely unchanged if one were to drop the period 1945 to 1973.

   We begin by remarking on the differences between the latter: the incidence rate and wiring

ratio measures. Notice that when only one country experiences a crisis, the incidence rate is 1/14

but the wiring ratio is 0 so that the wiring ratio is a better measure for the purposes of computing

cross classification ability since it avoids some of the self-referential nature of the incidence rate.

Moreover, even when the wiring ratio is non-zero, its value will be relatively low when only a few

countries experience a crisis simultaneously, thus highlighting those episodes when many countries

experienced a crisis at the same time. In fact, our sample contains only five episodes in which four

or more countries experienced a crisis in the same year: 1890(5), 1907 (5), 1921 (4), 1931 (6) and

2008 (7). The bottom panel of Figure 7 helps visualize the oasis of calm between 1945 to 1973.

   The lessons from the analysis in this section can be summarized as follows: (a) the likelihood

of a crisis does not seem to be influenced by the time elapsed since the last crisis experienced; (b)

about half of the crises in our sample (31 out of 71) occurred in only one country, nine episodes

involved two countries, and there were four episodes involving four, five, six and seven countries,

that is about one third of the crises (22) was experienced simultaneously in a cluster of countries

involving four or more economies. Therefore, serial correlation is not a concern, but spatial

dependence might be. Finally, these results remain largely unchanged to whether one includes or

excludes the seemingly long period of calm between 1945 to 1973. Building on these results, the

next section explores whether information about the macroeconomic outlook of countries can be

used to detect a crisis in the future.



4     Pre-Crisis Dynamics: Isolated vs. Common Crises

We begin our empirical analysis informally by compiling a number of stylized facts regarding

the international dimensions of financial crises. We start by looking more closely at the pre-

crisis dynamics, differentiating between ‘isolated’ financial crises and clustered financial crises.

Subsequently, we will also turn to the macroeconomic effects of financial crises. In 140 years

of modern macroeconomic history, we identify five episodes in which a significant portion of

countries simultaneously experienced a crisis: the Baring-related panic of 1890, the U.S.-centered

international crisis of 1907 that led to the establishment of the Federal Reserve; the European

post-war crises in 1921; the banking panics at the beginning of the Great Depression in 1930/31;

and the global financial crisis associated with the Great Recession of 2007/08. The remaining

events are mostly single country crises (almost half the sample) with a few episodes that involved

two or three countries at most. For this reason, we break down the analysis into a global crisis

sample (which includes the international crisis episodes of 1890, 1907, 1921, 1930/1 and 2007/08)

and an national crisis sample, which includes the remaining isolated, contry-specific crises. We

use the terms “global crisis” and “national crisis” to refer to these partitions of the crisis episodes.

    We summarize the behavior of key macroeconomic variables for the four years leading into a

crisis and the crisis itself. Unfortunately, we cannot perform this analysis for the 1921 crisis as the

preceding years coincide with the final years of World War One and its aftermath, a period heavily

distorted by the effects of disarmament and the return to a peacetime economy. We focus initially

on the prologue to financial crises. This is partly motivated by the fact that the aftermath of the

Great Recession is still unfolding and so the data are not in yet. We are also concerned that a

thorough analysis of the aftermath of financial crises necessitates distinguishing between normal

recessions and recessions that coincide with financial crises—which makes for a more complex

analysis. We return to this point below. On the more practical side, we adjust our data for


                                                  18
country-specific level and trend effects, to provide a common basis over which to aggregate the

experiences of countries with diverse economic systems and histories. Therefore, our transformed

data are best interpreted as deviations from a steady-state (so, e.g., a negative datum for inflation

refers to a demeaned/detrended level and does not necessarily indicate outright deflation).

   We investigate three specific aspects of economic performance preceding a financial crisis: the

macroeconomic basics including output growth and inflation; the role of financial factors such

as interest rates and credit growth; and the external environment captured by trends in current

account balances. Figures 8–11 display the behavior of GDP and inflation, followed by interest

rates, financial and external variables. In all figures, for comparison purposes, the left panel shows

the average behavior (detrended and relative to country averages) of the variables in the prologue

to national financial crises, while the right panel is for the four global crises (1890, 1907, 1930/31,

2007/08) in our long-run sample.

   Growth and inflation dynamics reveal some interesting insights. With regard to growth, we see

that national financial crises are typically not preceded by a period of higher growth. Questions

about the net real effects of financial boom and bust as discussed, for example, in Ranciere et

al. (2008), do not seem to arise for our sample as economic activity hardly accelerates before

crises. There is little evidence that growth is significantly faster in the run-up to national financial

crises. However, things are slightly different in the prologue to global financial crises. Here we

find that growth rates are elevated before the crisis and collapse stronger in the year of financial

turmoil (although the latter finding is likely to be driven by the 1930/31 collapse). Interesting

differences are also evident with regard to price dynamics. For our (predominantly developed)

country sample, there is scant evidence that normal financial crises are preceded by higher inflation.

But in international crises, inflation undershoots significantly relative to country averages. There

is nothing in our data that suggests that inflation trends help detect growing financial vulnerability.

   The behavior of interest rates is perhaps the most interesting of all the variables under con-

sideration here. Looking at both the ‘natural’ rate (short-term market interest rates less real

economic growth) and (ex post) real interest rates (adjusted for current inflation) we find that in

the prelude to the big international crises the natural rate was considerably lower than its trend

for an extended period. No such conspicuous behavior is apparent in the case of real interest

rates. If anything, in the run-up to international financial crises, CPI-adjusted nominal rates were

slightly higher than during normal times. In other words, the global crises of 1890, 1907, 1930/31

and 2007/08 were different in the sense that they were preceded by periods in which interest rates

were unusually low relative to the real growth rate of the economy. It is not impossible that central

banks could have misread the absence of inflationary pressures and kept short-term interest rates

too low, akin to the model discussed in Christiano et al. (2010).

   The next two figures complete our description of financial variables. The first figure shows

broad money over GDP, the second panel bank credit over GDP. We have also run a comparable

analysis using proxies for banks’ funding leverage (loans over money) with similar results. Both

national and global crises are preceded by an expansion in money and credit. But the expansion

of bank loans is more pronounced, suggesting that credit, not money is the key variable.

   What about external imbalances? The behavior of these is summarized in the next figure,

with the top panel displaying the current account to GDP ratio in levels and the bottom panel

displaying the change of the current account to GDP ratio. Both crisis types are clearly associated

with some deterioration of current account balances in the run-up to the crisis. But beyond that

we find little evidence that big international crises such as the one we recently went through can

be identified by glaringly abnormal current account trends.

   Table 2 summarizes the historical evidence by looking at the cumulative effects before financial

crises by comparing the global and national crisis samples in the years leading to the financial

instability episode. Several results deserve comment. First, boom and bust dynamics seem to

be more pronounced in big international crises as measured by growth and investment dynamics.

Second, both credit and money growth are strongly elevated before national and global finan-

cial crises. Third, national crises are preceded by larger current account deficits relative to the

country’s own history. Lastly, we find historical evidence that the global crises occurred in an

environment of depressed natural rates (i.e. when measured by the difference between nominal

short term rates and real growth). In other words, international crises have tended to happen

after non-inflationary real booms. However, no such misalignment is apparent if real interest

rates are calculated using current inflation real interest rates. Prices were relatively static in the

run-up to normal and common crises. In light of the evidence from 140 years of modern economic

history, the big international crises are different in that they combine strong credit growth with

an environment of low real interest rate (relative to real growth) and tame inflation. External

imbalances could play an additional role, but at a first glance they appear secondary to the role

played by credit growth and interest rates.

5      Post-Crisis Dynamics

Turning to the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the aftermath of financial crises, we

are interested in the question of how disruptions in financial intermediation lead to real economic

outcomes that are different from the normal behavior of these variables over the business cycle.

Financial crises often go hand in hand with recessions. But it would be clearly wrong to attribute

all of the output decline in recessions to the financial crisis. During ‘normal’ recessions, output also

declines and inflation rates fall. In order to isolate a ‘true’ real economic effect we therefore should

not compare the aftermath of financial crises with normal business cycle expansions. Rather, we

should compare apples with apples and test whether recessions that occur in the wake of financial

crises are deeper than ‘normal’ recessions. As an additional question, we can ask whether recessions



                                                    25
that are associated with the big-4 international financial crises show different dynamics.

   While conceptually clear, the empirical implementation is difficult. First, a consistent business

cycle chronology is needed for all the 14 countries in our sample. This will enable us to identify

recessions that coincide with financial crises and normal recessions. Second, the exercise is further

complicated by the uncertainty surrounding the timing of financial crises for individual countries.

One could for instance argue that the crisis of 2007/08 commenced in 2007 in the US and the UK,

but reached other countries only in 2008. Such timing issues make it difficult to align crisis dates

and recession dates. We therefore opted for an intermediate strategy. In a first step, we compiled a

consistent business cycle history for the 14 countries in our sample by relying on the data provided

in Barro and Ursua (2008). We coded a business cycle peak whenever GDP per capita in any given

year was lower than in the preceding year. In a second step we made some manual adjustments

(documented in the appendix) to the resulting series. Manual adjustments were only made when

GDP recovered somewhat after a recession but failed to recover to the prerecession level and fell

again the following year. We treated such short-term rebounds as part of the same recessionary

episode and not as independent business cycles. Table 3 shows the resulting business cycle peak

dates for the countries in our sample. The third step was to align the business cycle chronology

with the financial crisis chronology.

   Our aim is to examine the difference between recessions that coincide with financial crises and

normal recessions. We therefore aligned all variables of interest on the business cycle peak year. In

other words, whenever a financial crisis occurred in the year of, before, or after the business cycle

peak, we code this observation as a ‘crisis recession’, and all others as ‘normal recessions’ (including

instances when a financial crisis happened late in the course of the recession). Additionally, we

also differentiate between isolated financial crises and international financial crises. This results

in three different groups across which we compare the behavior of key macroeconomic variables

in recessions:

   (a) normal recessions;

   (b) recessions cum national (isolated) financial crises;

   (c) recessions cum global (common) financial crises.

   However, there is only one global crisis in the post-1945 period—that of 2007/08. The after-

math of this crisis is still unfolding, so we cannot study the post-crisis dynamics (yet). We are thus

   In the following charts, we contrast the behavior of key macroeconomic variables in the years

T + 1 to T + 4 after the business cycle peak with the three final years of the expansion, i.e.

T − 3 to T , where the peak is in year t. Looking at the mean change in normal recessions,

crisis recessions, and international crisis recessions, we aim to quantify the effects of disruptions in

financial intermediation. As before, we focus the analysis on three key areas: growth and inflation;

credit growth; external balances.

   Starting with growth and inflation, we obtain a relatively clear picture that is in line with

previous research (Schularick and A. M. Taylor 2009). Recessions that align with financial crises

are about 1/3 more costly than normal ones. But this result only holds after WWII, not before.



                                                     27
Recessions accompanied by global crises stand out as the most costly ones, but this (prewar) result

is strongly influenced by the Great Depression. Price trends display a similar pattern postwar.

Inflation slows down in recessions, but more so in downswings that happen after financial crises.

   We next turn to the behavior of credit growth in recessions. Both the pre- and postwar data

show a clear slowdown in loan growth in recessions (but relative to GDP it remains positive

pre-WWII). This reversal of loan growth, however, is considerably more pronounced in crisis

recessions. Loan growth was about 4 times weaker in crisis recessions than in normal recessions

after 1945. Before WWII, the slowdown in bank lending was only about twice as pronounced as in

normal downturns. This finding is confirmed when we look at the growth rate of loans over GDP.

In normal recessions, both pre-1945 and post-1945, the growth rate of loans over GDP hardly

slowed down at all relative to the pre-peak trend. However, in financial crisis recessions pre and

postwar, but in particular in recent decades, the growth rate of bank loans over GDP contracts

meaningfully.

   Last but not least, we ask how external balances fare in the various recession categories. The

first insight we uncover is that the pre-WWII fixed exchange rate dynamics differ markedly from

the post Bretton Woods experience. In gold standard times, the current account level tended to

deteriorate both in normal recessions and crisis recessions. Only for the three global crises we find

that the current account improved in the recession. However, in the postwar era recessions were

consistently associated with improving current account positions. The same dichotomy applies

to normal v. crisis recessions in the two eras. Since the end of the Bretton Woods regime, crisis

recessions are associated with current account reversals even more strongly than normal recessions.

Before 1945 no such trend is apparent.

   Summing up, we find conspicuously different post crisis dynamics before and after WWII. The

growth slowdown is more pronounced in the past decades. Inflation, however, slows down less

than pre-WWII possibly reflecting more active central bank policies to avoid deflation. Yet we

find little evidence that these policies have also succeeded in reducing output costs. Deflationary

tendencies are much more pronounced in crisis recessions than in normal business cycle downturns.

Crisis recessions also display a strongly negative impact on loan growth, possibly accounting for

the slower growth experience than in normal recessions. Unlike in the 19th and the first half of

the 20th century, current accounts generally have a tendency to improve in postwar recessions,

even more so in those associated with financial crisis.

6     Crisis Prediction: Do Current Account Imbalances Help

      Predict Financial Crises?

Are external imbalances an important causal factor of financial crises? The idea is certainly

attractive. The global financial turmoil of 2007/08 occurred after a period of major imbalances

in the global economy, marked by large deficits in a number of countries, first and foremost in the

US. These countries at the recipient end of global capital flows also witnessed major asset price

booms and were the home of the financial turmoil that engulfed the global economy. Prominent

commentators have linked the recent crisis to external imbalance. To some extent, these issues

are open to empirical investigation. This is what we attempt to do in the last part of our analysis.

A large literature exists on boom and bust cycles in capital flows to emerging economies which

are thought to increase macroeconomic vulnerabilities (Kaminsky et al. 2004). Similar studies for

industrial countries are harder to come by. In the following, we ask whether the current account,

alongside other economic fundamentals, contains information about the likelihood of a future

financial crisis. We build on the crisis prediction framework presented in Schularick and A. M.

Taylor (2009) who stressed the role of credit growth in generating financial instability on a country

level. For this study, we have collected accompanying long run series for current account balances

for the 1870-2008 period. This allows us to answer a number of pertinent questions: Does the

historical record show that widening imbalances play a role in financial crisis? Should widening

imbalances raise concerns for policy makers? And finally, what is the interaction of capital flows

and credit growth in the origins of financial disruptions?

    Using our long-run annual dataset for 14 countries, we start from a probabilistic model of

a financial crisis event occurring in country i, in year t, as a function of lagged macroeconomic

fundamentals, including current account imbalances, in year t,


                                  logit(pit ) = b0i + b1 (L)Xit + eit                            (4)


where logit(p) = ln(p/(1 − p)) is the log of the odds ratio and L is the lag operator. We are sum-

marizing the information about lagged trends in macroeconomics using a 5-year moving average

term which allows us to introduce interaction terms between imbalances and credit trends in the

course of the analysis. The error term eit is assumed to be well behaved. We also subject this

  specification to several perturbations that take the form of including additional control variables

  in the vector X as described above.

     Table 4 shows the results of our baseline estimations. We start by replicating the results from

  Schularick and A. M. Taylor (2009) using a logit model with country fixed effects and introducing

  the change in credit over GDP as the sole explanatory variable. Our key finding is again that

  a high rate of credit extension over the previous five years is indicative of an increasing risk of

  a financial crisis. Credit growth over GDP is highly significant, and the AUC test for predictive

  ability of the model yields a solid (in-sample) number of 0.68, outperforming a simple coin toss

  (AUC = 0.5) by a good margin. In regression 2, we let the change in the current account balance

  over GDP enter the horserace. Widening imbalances are also a significant predictor of financial

  crises, albeit the significance level is slightly lower and the fit much poorer. Equally important, the

  predictive ability of the current account model is somewhat worse than that of the credit model.

  The AUC falls to about 0.6. Note that we restricted the analysis to an identical sample of 1593

  common observations for credit and current account data.

   In a next step, we include both variables to see if additional predictive power results from

credit and current account trends. The result is by an large negative. The credit variable remains

highly significant and while the current account remains marginally significant, the AUC of the

combined model is only a small notch higher than in the pure credit model. From this perspective,

credit emerges as the variable to watch for the policy maker, not the external balance. A similar

insight emerges from regression 4 in which we additionally interact credit growth and changes in

the current account. Predictive ability rises only marginally indicating that credit booms fueled by

capital flows are not much different from normal credit booms. The CCF comparison is graphically

shown in the following figure. It can be easily seen that the predictive ability of a pure current

account model is significantly weaker than that of the credit model. Including the current account

and the interaction term (model 4) leads only to very small gains in forecasting performance.

   Regressions 5, 6 and 7 add, additional economic control variables. First, a five year moving

average of real GDP growth; second, real investment growth; third, we add inflation trends. None

of these additions leads to meaningfully different results: credit dominates as the single most

important factor and a more complex model improves predictive ability only slightly. Overall, we

find only limited evidence that current account deficits have played a major role in generating

financial crises in the past 140 years. In the quest for financial stability, the historical evidence

would suggest that mechanism to restrict credit growth have better chances of success.

    However, an objection to these findings could be that the global capital flow regime has changed

substantially in the past 35 years rendering long-term comparisons problematic. The transition

to floating exchange rates and capital mobility after the demise of the Bretton Woods system has

brought about a new ‘elasticity’ of current account balances. It is possible that the dynamics of

credit, capital flows and crises have changed accordingly. Taking this hypothesis seriously, we look

closer at the post-1945 and post-1975 subsamples. Have the relationships meaningfully changed

in the past decades?

    At first sight, table 5 displays the familiar picture of credit growth dominated crisis histories.

Significance, fit and predictive ability are far superior. Yet under the surface a slight change can

be discerned. In the post-1975 period, the interaction term between credit growth and current

account approaches statistical significance. Also the coefficient is much bigger than for the sample

as a whole. There are also signs of a growing collinearity between credit growth and current

account trends: the correlation between credit growth and current account changes was low and

insignificant before 1975. But it has picked up strongly in the past decades, both in magnitude

and significance. The correlation of current account changes and loan growth is -0.15 and highly

significant after 1975, suggesting that higher loan growth went increasingly hand in hand with

widening imbalances.

    Summing up, our analysis provides only limited support for the idea that widening imbal-

ances have historically been a key factor in financial crises. Simply put, in the past 140 years

financial crises, driven by excessive loan growth, occurred by and large independent of current

account imbalances. In the past three decades, the interaction between credit growth and exter-

nal imbalances has grown. We find that the correlation between credit growth - in the light of

our regressions the key indicator to watch from a financial stability perspective—and widening

external deficits has picked up considerably in recent decades. This points to a potential shift in

the crises dynamics and an increasingly complex picture where domestic credit growth and capital

flows are much closer to being two sides of the same coin than before. But it is too early to draw

policy conclusion with great confidence. The current global economic order, combining floating

7      Conclusion

140 years of lessons regarding financial crises and external imbalances are not easily summarized.

The picture we have encountered is a complex one. Our analysis of the historical relationship

between financial crises and external imbalances has proceeded in four steps. First, we have

applied a number of new statistical tools to analyse the temporal and spatial patterns of financial

crises in the past 140 years. Our key finding here was that such patterns are not easily identified.

Looking only at the incidence of crises across space and time, we cannot reject the notion that

crises occur by and large randomly. Yet four (five, if the European postwar crises of 1921 are

included) cluster of big international crises are discernible: 1890, 1907, 1930/31 and 2007/08.

    In the second part, we looked in greater detail at the pre-crisis dynamics of various macroeco-

nomic indicators. Three findings stand out. Loan growth is clearly elevated both before national

(‘isolated’) and also before global crises. The current account deteriorates in the run-up to nor-

mal crises, but the evidence is inconclusive in global crises, possibly because both surplus and

deficit countries get embroiled in the crisis. A key finding is that the natural interest rate was

strongly suppressed in the run-up to the four global crises in the sample while real interest rates

and inflation did not exhibit a meaningful deviation from trend.

    In the third part, we studied post-crisis macroeconomic dynamics with greater granularity



                                                            36
than before. We distinguished between recessions with and without financial crisis, and recessions

following global economic crises. We find that recessions that are associated with financial crises

are more costly than normal recessions, while recessions after global crises are particularly hard.

While the Great Depression experience has a strong impact on this result, taken together these

results add further evidence to the expectation that the recovery from the Great Recession will

be sluggish. Regarding current account dynamics, we find that current accounts tend to improve

more strongly in crisis recessions than in normal recession in the post-1945 world economy.

    The final prediction part of this paper addressed the question whether widening external imbal-

ances are a signal for policy makers that financial instability risks are building. Our overall result

is that, from a policy-maker’s perspective, credit growth—not the current account—generates

the best predictive signals of impeding financial instability. However, the relation between credit

growth and current accounts has grown much tighter in recent decades. In a globalized economy

with free capital mobility credit cycles and capital flows have the potential to reinforce each other

more strongly then before. The historical data clearly suggest that high rates of credit growth

coupled with widening imbalances pose stability risks that policy makers should not ignore.

9     Appendix 2: Business Cycle Dating

We identify business cycle peaks using real GDP per capita. If output per capita growth was negative in
any given year, we coded the preceding year as the business cycle peak. We then adjusted the resulting
series for short term rebounds within recessions. These are cases when output rebounded but failed to
recover the pre-recession level and fell again in the following year. We treated such short-term rebounds
as part of the same recessionary episode and not as independent business cycles. Some minor adjustments
were also made when country histories and other data sources suggested a slightly different chronology.
For example, some differences may arise when accepted chronologies are built on higher-frequency (quar-
terly/monthly) data, in contrast to our annual data. In such cases, we moved the peak year by a maximum
of one year to align our chronology with the accepted country histories.
