                                              ABSTRACT

We explore what happened when the state of Utah moved away from its traditional defined benefit
pension. In its place, it offered new hires a choice between a conventional defined contribution plan
and a hybrid plan option, where the latter has both a guaranteed benefit component and a defined contribution
plan where employees bear investment risk. We show that around 60 percent of new hires failed to
make any active choice and, as a result, were automatically defaulted into the hybrid plan. Slightly
more than half of those who made an active choice elected the hybrid plan. Post-reform, employees
who failed to actively elect a primary retirement plan were also far less likely to enroll in a supplemental
retirement account, compared to new hires who actively selected a plan. We also find that employees
hired following the reform were more likely to leave public employment, resulting in higher separation
rates. This could reflect a reduction in the desirability of public employment under the new pension
design and an improving economic climate in the state. Our results imply that public pension reformers
must consider employee responses in addition to potential cost savings, when developing and enacting
major pension plan changes.

                               Lessons for Public Pensions
                           from Utah’s Move to Pension Choice
                      Robert L. Clark, Emma Hanson, and Olivia S. Mitchell



        The financial crisis of 2008-09 took a major toll on U.S. public pension plan investments,

and the ensuing Great Recession deepened the challenges facing these plans. As a consequence,

many public employers were forced to restructure their retirement schemes, and a recent survey

found that since 2011, almost all states changed public pension benefit and contribution formulas

to rein in costs (NASRA, 2014a). Moreover, several states have taken a further step,

significantly modifying their plan designs so as to transfer risk from plan sponsors to employees.

In particular, several states have offered employees the option to choose which retirement plan

they want, with options including defined benefit, defined contribution, and hybrid plans.

        This paper explores the restructuring of Utah’s statewide public employee pension

system in 2011, in response to the financial challenges described above. Previously, the Utah

Retirement System (URS) provided public employees with a traditional defined benefit (DB)

plan. Before the 2008-09 financial downturn, Utah’s pension system was one of the best-funded

statewide pension plans in the country, with an average funded ratio of 95 percent. With the

downturn, however, investments losses led to in a substantial decline in URS’s funded ratio

which dropped to 83 percent by 2010.1 Consequently, the system’s actuaries forecasted that large

increases in annual required contributions would be needed to cover the losses. To avoid

imposing additional financial strain on taxpayers, the Utah legislature responded by proposing


1
 URS’s funded ratio as of January 1, 2013 was 77.1 percent. This includes the recognition of the final 20
percent of the 2008 investment loss.

major changes to pension offerings provided to new employees. 2 Public employees protested

these pension reforms and urged lawmakers to “proceed with caution” (Dallof 2010). The

legislator sponsoring the reform, Dan Liljenquist, explained that the goals of the “reform were

two-fold: one, to make sure that we could meet every penny of the commitment that we had

already made to current employees and retirees, and two, to reduce and eventually eliminate the

pension-related bankruptcy risk to the state” (cited in McGuinn 2015: 9).3

       Legislation authorizing the pension reform passed in March 2010 and went into effect

in July 2011, officially closing the defined benefit (DB) plans to new employees and

establishing the two-option replacement plan.4 The two new pension options were expected to

be less generous than the former DB plans and could, therefore, be anticipated to reduce the

state’s future pension liabilities. Post-reform, new hires could choose one of two new options:

a defined contribution (DC) plan, or a hybrid pension plan that incorporated both DB and DC

elements (about which we say more below). New hires who failed to make an active choice

between plans were automatically enrolled in the hybrid plan after one year of employment.

       Using administrative data provided by URS, we examine how new hires’ plan choices

differed according to individual and job characteristics. Additionally, we evaluate how the

pension reform changed two employee behaviors: contributions to supplemental plans, and

turnover patterns. Prior literature has not examined these behavioral responses to public

  A simulation analysis by Evans and Phillips (2014) estimated that the pre-reform Utah retirement
system had a 50 percent chance of exhausting its pension fund by 2028.

  This legislation passed the Senate 19-9 and the House 46-26. Amendments made in the House increased
the employer cost and the generosity of the new plan. The bill’s history and related documents are
available at http://le.utah.gov/~2010/bills/static/SB0063.html.

pension changes, focusing instead on differences in funding, contributions, and benefits.5 By

contrast, our analysis provides evidence from Utah suggesting that it is important not to

neglect the effects of retirement plan restructuring on other public employee behavior. Indeed,

such outcomes could undermine state governments’ ability to deliver services promised to their

citizens.

        We summarize our findings in Figure 1. First, most new hires failed to make an active

choice between the available pension plan options, so the default plan assignment mattered.

Second, one might have anticipated that the less generous retirement plan would have

encouraged new hires to save more through supplemental plans, but this did not occur.

Interestingly, those who did actively elect their primary account were also likely to participate

in supplemental retirement plans. Third, post-reform, public employee two-year separation

rates rose 30 percent, from 13 to 17 percentage points, although this increase might have been

a response to the improving economy.

Figure 1 here

        In what follows, we begin by reviewing key aspects of Utah’s traditional DB plan and

compare it to the two new plans adopted in 2011. Using administrative records provided by

URS, we then estimate models of plan choice to evaluate who elected which plan and who

defaulted. Inasmuch as both of the new plans are likely to pay less generous retirement benefits

than the prior DB pension, we also inquire whether new hires saved more voluntarily to bolster

  Plan sponsors generally are aware of the balancing act between two competing goals of providing
adequate retirement income to members and ensuring the long-term financial stability of the plan. In the
2013 Summary Report to Members, Daniel Andersen, the executive director of URS wrote: “while
conditions for retirement benefits have changed over the past few years, our primary purpose was to
provide retirement       security and      professional  service to members and retirees.”
(http://www.urs.org/mango/pdf/urs/SummaryReport/2013/summaryReport.pdf.)

their retirement incomes. Additionally we compare turnover rates for both pre- and post-reform

new hires, to assess the impact of retirement plan type on employee retention rates. In a final

section, we draw lessons from the Utah reform relevant to other states and municipalities looking

to restructure their pension offerings.



Relevant Prior Studies

        While we lack the space to review the large literature on pensions and their effect on

employee behavior, we call attention here to a few recent accounts of how public pensions have

sought to deal with pressing fiscal challenges. Media reports by Walsh (2011), Lyman and Walsh

(2014), and Greenhouse (2011), among others, have reported on changes in public pension

benefit and contribution parameters in the wake of the financial and economic crisis. In the

academic literature, Chingos and West (2013), Lachance, Mitchell, and Smetters (2003), and

Milevsky, Promislow, and David (2004) examined specific state pension reforms and their

impacts on funding and costs.6 More recently, Novy-Marx and Rauh (2015) have suggested that

linking public pension payouts to investment performance could alleviate the critical funding

shortfalls many states now face.

        Particularly pertinent to the present paper is prior research on how pension reforms alter

employee behavior. To date, however, most empirical studies have focused on private-sector

firms and employees, as shown in two reviews by Gustman and Mitchell (1992), and Gustman,

Mitchell, and Steinmeier (1994), and case studies of corporate plan conversions are discussed by

Clark and Munzenmaier (2001). Yet relatively few private sector firms give employees the

opportunity to choose among alternative types of pension plans.7 For this reason, prior studies

have mainly focused on how pensions affect worker turnover patterns, and they have provided

two main findings. First, employees of firms offering pension plans tend to separate less

frequently than employees at other firms (Allen, Clark, and McDermed, 1993). Whether this is

causal or simply correlational has been difficult to confirm. Second, there appear to be no major

differences in turnover rates between employees offered DB versus DC plans (Gustman and

Steinmeier, 1995). This is contrary to what might be expected, since DB plans tend to be more

“back-loaded” - meaning that employees with long tenures receive more valuable retirement

benefits than short-tenure employees. By contrast, hybrid and DC plans provide more balanced

benefits, rewarding employees more equitably with additional years of service. Moreover,

retirement wealth accumulated in DC plans is more portable than that accumulated in traditional

DB pensions, meaning that DC plans provide greater value than do DB plans to short-term

workers who may wish to move to a new employer prior to retirement.

       In the public sector, it is somewhat more common to give participants a choice between

two or more retirement plans, particularly at public universities. For instance, NASRA (2010)

noted that nearly half of all state universities offered faculty choice between a DB and a DC plan.

Clark and Hanson (2011) reported that five statewide retirement systems covering general public

employees or teachers offered a DB/DC choice, two offered a choice between a DB and a hybrid,

and one offered a choice between all three plans types. According to Munnell, Aubry, and

Cafarelli (2014), states launching optional DC plans before the financial crisis did so because

these gave workers the opportunity to manage their own money, particularly in rising equity

  Some non-profit firms do allow employees some choice concerning their retirement plan, including the
firm examined by Mitchell, Utkus, and Yang (2007).

markets. Post-financial crisis, Utah along with Michigan (2010), Rhode Island (2011), and

Virginia (2012) have established statewide systems which include hybrid plans.8

       In the last two decades, many researchers have explored the impact of public sector plan

choices on aspects of employee behavior. For instance, Clark, Ghent, and McDermed (2006)

studied public university faculty members’ pension plan choices in North Carolina. 9 As

expected, they found that older individuals were more likely to select the DB option, whereas

younger and, potentially, more mobile workers were more likely to select the DC plan. In their

study of Oregon’s Public Employees Retirement System, Chalmers, Johnston, and Reuter (2008)

evaluated how different plan types influenced older individuals’ retirement patterns, and they

concluded that a substantial minority of employees did not adequately understand the plans’

complex incentives. Goldhaber and Grout (2013) studied the pension plan preferences of

Washington State public school teachers, and they found that, with the exception of age,

observable teacher and job characteristics were not significant predictors of new hires’ plan

choices. Brown and Weisbenner (2014) examined employees’ DB versus DC plan choices in the

Illinois State University system, using an administrative dataset linked to a participant survey on

plan and worker attributes. They concluded that those preferring the DC plan were

predominately men, who also were less risk averse and more financially literate than employees

electing other plan options.

       Though prior studies have explored which types of workers elected different retirement

plans when given a choice, they have not illuminated worker responses along other dimensions.

Accordingly, in what follows, we investigate the determinants of plan choice by public sector

employees in Utah, along with associations between plan choice and measures of two important

behavioral outcomes: post-reform contributions to supplemental plans, and post-reform

employment turnover rates.



Public Retirement Plans in Utah

        Utah’s public employee pension plans date to the first half of the 20th century with

retirement plans introduced for school teachers and firefighters. A statewide teachers’ retirement

system was established in 1937, followed by the adoption of a plan for state officers and

employees in 1947. After a series of modifications, these plans were consolidated in 1963 into

the Utah Retirement Systems. 10 Today, URS provides retirement benefits for more than 450

public employers including the State of Utah, local governments, school districts, and some

employees in higher educational institutions. (Faculty and other exempt higher education

employees are not members of URS.) Most public employees in Utah are also covered by Social

Security.11

        In this section, we describe the various retirement plans offered to public employees in

Utah. We first discuss the pre-reform defined benefit plan that covered full time employees prior

to 2011. Next we review the post-reform hybrid and defined contribution plans offered to new

hires following these reforms and compare the generosity of the pre and post-reform pension

plans. Finally, we describe URS supplemental retirement savings plans available to employees

both pre and post-reform.

   A brief overview of the plans currently offered to Utah public employees appears in Appendix Table 1.

The Traditional Defined Benefit Plan (Tier I). Employees hired prior to July 1, 2011, were

automatically enrolled into URS Tier I System, a traditional DB plan. The Tier I Retirement

System was composed of six different plans: a Public Employees’ Contributory Retirement Plan,

a Noncontributory Retirement System, a Public Safety Retirement System, a Firefighters’

System, a Governors’ and Legislators’ Retirement Plan, and a Judges’ Retirement System.12

       More than 85 percent of Tier I members belonged to the Public Employees’

Noncontributory Retirement System, 13 where the employer covered the entire cost of the

benefits. At retirement, a worker’s benefit amount under this DB plan was derived by calculating

two percent of his average monthly earnings from his three highest years of earnings, multiplied

by his years of service. Thus a 30-year career worker would have earned a lifetime income

stream equal to 60 percent of his highest three years of earnings. After retirement, benefits were

indexed by up to a 4 percent annual cost of living adjustment (NASRA 2014b). Retirement ages

were defined by a combination of age and service: normal retirement benefits were payable at

age 65 with 4 years of service, or 30 years of service at any age. Early retirees could begin

benefits at age 60 with 20 years of service, age 62 with 10 years of service, or at any age with 25

years of service; the early retirement payments were reduced by seven percent per year under age

60, and three percent per year from 60 to 65. Retirees could choose from six annuity options as

well as a partial lump-sum option.

The New Plan Options (Tier II). Employees hired after July 1, 2011, were required to choose

between a DC plan and a hybrid plan; the election had to be declared prior to the end of their first

year of employment; and the choice was final and irrevocable. Plan elections are made online,

and employees failing to elect a plan prior by the end of their first year have been automatically

enrolled into the default hybrid plan. During their first year of employment, employees are

presented with a screen asking them to choose their retirement option each time they log into

their retirement account. This screen includes links to educational materials about the plan

choices. In order to proceed to view their account, employees must either select a plan or “I am

not ready to my election at this time.” The date when the plan choice becomes final, or when

they are automatically enrolled in the hybrid, is prominently displayed on this page.

       URS communication materials for new hires seek to present a balanced assessment of the

two plan options, stating that “both plans have advantages and disadvantages. The plan that’s

better for you will depend on your situation.” The webpage for new members outlines various

aspects of each plan in detail and directs new employees to additional resources, including a

“decision guide” and several online pension benefit estimate calculators.

       An employee electing the DC plan receives an annual employer contribution of 10

percent of his annual earnings into the 401(k) account,14 and these employer contributions vest

after four years of eligible employment. Employees may also make additional contributions to

their accounts on a voluntary basis. Distributions are allowed after retirement, separation from of

employment, or age 59 ½, and the funds may be withdrawn various ways, at the retiree’s

discretion. No cost of living adjustments are provided to DC participants.15

       The hybrid plan is less generous than the old DB plan along several dimensions. First, the

new retirement benefit is determined by multiplying the employee’s years of service by 1.5

14
   Similar to other state plans, the URS Public Safety and Firefighters’ plans are somewhat more
generous, with a state contribution of 12 percent of salary, compared to general state employee plans.

                                                                                               10


percent times the monthly average of his highest-five earnings years. Compared to the old DB

plan, the new longer earnings averaging period is likely to lower the benefit. Second, the hybrid

plan also requires participants to work for 35 years to qualify for a normal retirement benefit at

any age, five years longer than under the old DB plan; participants may also take an unreduced

retirement benefit at age 65 with four years of service. Retirees can take a reduced benefit

beginning at age 62 with 10 years of service, or age 60 with 20 years of service; early retirement

reduces benefits by about seven percent per year between age 60-63, and approximately nine

percent per year for age 64-65. Third, the hybrid plan only permits up to a 2.5 percent cost of

living benefit adjustment each year, depending on the change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI),

versus a 4 percent rate under the old plan. Retirees may receive their maximum retirement

benefits based on the formula, or they can select from several joint and survivorship options.

Employees may also contribute to several voluntary retirement saving plans (to be described

below).

       The hybrid also has another key feature differentiating it from the old model: their

contribution rates are variable. That is, the plan’s Board of Trustees must set a certified

contribution rate each year for the defined benefit portion of the hybrid plan, based on the

preceding year’s actuarial valuation. As long as the employer-certified rate remains below 10

percent of compensation, employees are not required to make any additional plan contributions.

If the rate exceeds 10 percent, hybrid plan participants must contribute the entire amount needed.

Conversely, if the employer’s certified DB contribution rate were to fall below 10 percent, the

employer then must contribute the difference between 10 percent of compensation and the

certified rate into participants’ 401(k) accounts. For example, in 2014-15, the employer’s

certified contribution rate was 8.22 percent of payroll; therefore, the employer contributed 1.78
                                                                                                        11


percent of payroll into employees’ 401(k) accounts that year. 16 Pension and employer

contributions to the 401(k) account vest after four years of service.

Comparing the Tier I and Tier II Systems. Generally speaking, the new Tier II arrangement is

anticipated to pay lower benefits, compared to the old Tier I DB plan. 17 We illustrate the

expected difference in retirement benefits assuming the relevant benefit formulas and various

age/service thresholds for an unreduced benefit. Depending on the plan type (DB versus hybrid)

and years of service, the outcomes may be compared as follows:

The hybrid plan also requires more years of service for normal retirement benefits at any age, 35

years compared to the 30 years for the Tier I benefit, and the early retirement reductions are

larger in the hybrid plan. In addition, prior to 2011, state and education employees who were in

the Tier I DB plan received a 1.5 percent employer contribution to the 401(k) plan. In other

words, the generosity of the Tier II hybrid plan is substantially below that of the old Tier I

scheme.
16
   The total employer contribution rate for both the DC plan and the hybrid plan includes an amount for
amortization of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability in the Tier I System. This amount differs by
employer group. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2015, the Tier I unfunded liability rates that are paid
by employers on behalf of members of the Tier II Public Employees System ranged from 6.61 percent to
9.94 percent.

   Retiree health provisions did not change for new hires during the time period of our analysis.

        While participants in the new Tier II DC and hybrid might conceivably generate higher

retirement benefits if their DC returns proved to be much in excess of what the old DB would

have paid, 18 this seems unlikely. Moreover, the new structure clearly shifts risk from the

employer to the employees. In the DC plan, participants bear all investment risk directly. The

hybrid option also poses risk to participants for two reasons. First, if the cost of the DB portion

of the plan exceeds 10 percent of payroll, workers will need to cover the excess. 19 Second,

employees also bear the potential cost of mismatched assets and liabilities in the hybrid plan,

while not having any control over that plan’s asset mix. While the educational materials given to

employees plainly state that they will be responsible for contributing to the plan if the

contribution rate ever exceeds 10 percent, there is no mention of the mechanisms affecting this

extra contribution. Also, it is unclear whether this potential moral hazard on the part of the plan’s

investment managers is widely appreciated.20

Supplemental Plans. Public employees also have the option of contributing to several

supplemental retirement saving plans, though state agencies offer no employer match to

employee contributions for general state employees.21 Currently URS offers a 401(k) plan, a 457


18
   Assuming that DC plan investments earn 6.5 percent compounded steadily for 30 years and the balance
is annuitized for 25 years, NASRA (2014c) suggests that the payouts could be higher from Utah’s hybrid
plan than the traditional DB. This computation did not consider investment risk, longevity risk, or the 1.5
percent employer 401(k) contribution provided to state and education employees before the reform.
19
   There is also an interesting generational cross-subsidy element in the new plan, in that workers but not
retirees will be required to cover excess costs over 10 percent of pay. In the event that longevity rose or
investment earnings fell more than expected, active employees would be required to subsidize retirees.
Whether participants understand this generational redistribution feature is unclear.
20
   For arguments against holding stock in DB plans, see for instance Bader and Gold (2007) and Black
(1989).
21
   Participants in the Tier 1 Public Employees Noncontributory Retirement System still receive an
additional employer contribution of 1.5 percent of their compensation in the 401(k) plan. All other
employers also have the option of contributing to URS 401(k) and/or 457 Plans on behalf of their
employees.

plan, and a traditional as well as a Roth IRA. All URS members are eligible to participate in the

IRA. With the introduction of Tier II, all employers are required to participate in the 401(k) plan

and many also participate in the 457 plan. These supplemental plans provide eight core

investment options along with target date funds. In addition, a self-directed brokerage account

for pre-tax contributions is available through a private money manager. 22 All employee

contributions are immediately vested and thus may be cashed out when employment ends.


Multivariate Determinants of Public Plan Choice

       New hires in the Tier II system must choose between enrolling in the hybrid plan or in

the DC plan within one year after their initial employment. As noted above, employees who fail

to make an active choice of primary plan option are automatically enrolled into the default

hybrid plan. To examine who defaulted, and who chose which plan conditional on making an

active choice, we analyze URS administrative records on all individuals who first entered

employment with a URS-covered employer between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2013.

These records include information on employee age, sex, employment dates, and retirement plan

choice, along with annual earnings, employee contributions to voluntary URS-administered

retirement savings plans, service credit, and job classification for the period from January 1,

2006 to October 31, 2014. Because plan choice decisions in the Tier II system do not become

final and irrevocable until the end of the first year of employment, we restrict our attention to

employees who did not separate from service in their first year on the job. After removing

observations where age, gender, or earnings were missing, the resulting sample includes a “pre-

reform” group of 38,220 employees hired before July 1, 2011, and a “post-reform” group of

16,095 individuals hired on or after July 1, 2011.23

        Table 1 reports the plan choices of individuals hired post-reform along with the total

number of new hires throughout the 2006-2014 period. Almost 60 percent of Utah’s new hires

after the reform took place failed to make an active choice between the two plan options and

were therefore defaulted into the hybrid plan. This level of default is consistent with findings

from other states that have offered workers a choice of primary retirement plans. 24 One

explanation for why so many people may have defaulted is behavioral inertia (Madrian and Shea

2001; Choi et al. 2004; Yang 2005). Another explanation might be that employees actually

preferred the hybrid plan over the DC option. That is, some workers may have favored the hybrid

plan and simply avoided the transaction cost of making an active choice producing the same

outcome as doing nothing.

        In Washington State where public sector workers were given a choice between a

traditional DB versus a hybrid plan, Olleman (2009) found that close to 70 percent of employees

rejected the hybrid plan default, instead actively selecting the traditional DB plan. Brown,

Farrell, and Weisbenner (2015) examined pension plan defaults by members of the Illinois State

Universities Retirement System, where they found that only 27 percent of their survey

respondents reported being defaulted. Nevertheless, their defaulters were more likely to wish

they had chosen an alternative plan compared to those that made an active decision. As the

24
   In states that offer their workers choice of DB or DC plans, Olleman (2009) reports that 39 percent of
Colorado new hires are defaulted into the DB plan, 55 percent in Florida, 82 percent of Ohio PERS and
72 percent of Ohio teachers.

traditional DB plan was no longer offered in Utah, it seems likely that some URS participants

defaulted to the hybrid plan because they favored it, while others’ choice was likely to have been

due to inertia.

Table 1 here

        Of the approximately 40 percent of URS new hires who actively elected a retirement

plan, slightly over half selected the hybrid plan, and slightly fewer (48 percent) chose the DC.

We also see that the proportion of individuals actively selecting the hybrid plan increased over

time, and the ratio of people defaulting shrank somewhat. This contrasts with the case of Illinois,

where Brown and Weisbenner (2014) found that the proportion of individuals selecting the

default grew over time.

        To elucidate some of the demographic and other factors associated with workers’

tendency to make an active choice of retirement plan options rather default into a plan, Table 2

presents descriptive statistics for new hires between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2013.

The table first reports characteristics of all sample individuals, and then it highlights a number of

subgroups including pre-reform workers, post-reform workers, workers who made an active

choice, workers who made a passive choice, and all workers who chose each plan option. For

each of these subgroups, we report classifications by employer type and pension system. The

largest group is public school employees who comprise 47 percent of the URS population.

Higher education staffers comprise 11 percent of the sample; university faculty are excluded

from this system. Local governmental employees account for almost a quarter of the sample, and

state employees constitute 18 percent of the sample. The majority of the sample is covered by the

Public Employees’ Retirement System, and an additional 7 percent are members of the more

generous Public Safety and Firefighters’ System.     Most new hires are women (62 percent), and
                                                                                                    16


the average salary earned in the second calendar year of employment (the “plan choice year”)

was around $32,000 in 2014 dollars. The average entry age across all workers in our sample is

33.3, although individuals hired after the reform were slightly younger than those hired before

the reform.

Table 2 here

       Separation rates during the second year of employment were 4 percentage points higher

for the post-reform group, at about 17 percent, versus around 13 percent for the pre-reform

group.25 Almost 35 percent of pre-reform new hires made voluntary contributions to one of the

supplemental retirement plans offered by URS during the plan choice year, but only 18 percent

of the post-reform sample contributed to these plans. The average amount contributed by

supplemental plan participants was 4.4 percent of salary and did not differ between the pre-

reform and post-reform groups.

       Table 3 categorizes workers by individual and job characteristics, and it also shows the

percentage of new hires in each subgroup electing each plan option. A higher proportion of men

made an active choice. Women were more likely to opt for the DC plan, among those making an

active plan choice. Employees with higher initial salaries were also more likely to make an active

choice. Employees working at educational institutions were more likely to default into the

hybrid, while general government employees were more likely to make an active choice.

Educational employees who made an active choice were more likely to choose the DC plan,

while general government employees who made an active choice were more likely to choose the

hybrid plan. In summary, defaulters differed from the active choosers in a number of ways. On

average, defaulters were two years younger, made $6,000 less per year, were much less likely to

be employed in state government, and were more likely to be in public education.

Table 3 here

       We explore these patterns further using multivariate regression analysis, with results

provided in Table 4. Six linear probability models are presented,26 with two specifications for

each of three dependent variables: (i) enrolled in hybrid plan whether by default or active choice,

(ii) made an active choice, and (iii) chose the DC given that an active choice was made. The first

specification for each dependent variable includes a vector of individual and job characteristics,

while the second specification also controls on two actions taken after the plan choice: whether

the new hire separated from employment, and whether the new hire contributed to a

supplemental retirement savings plan.

Table 4 here

       The first column presents results for models of whether new hires enrolled in the hybrid

plan, either by default or by active choice. Here we see that state government employees (the

reference category in this equation) were 5-7 percentage points less likely to participate in the

hybrid plan than were local government, public education, or higher education employees.

Members of the Public Safety & Firefighters’ system were also more likely to enroll in the

hybrid, as were men and the lower-paid.

       Column 3 of Table 4 reports on which newly hired employees made an active election of

their retirement plan; the model posits that defaulters differ from participants who made an active

choice. Results indicate that new hires age 45+ over were more likely, and those younger than 25

two procedures are similar in sign and magnitude.
                                                                                                18


less likely, to make an active choice compared to those age 25-29. Men tended not to make an

active selection, while state government employees were significantly more likely to make an

active choice compared to those in higher education, local government, or public education.

Interestingly, in each succeeding year, new hires were increasingly likely to make an active

election, perhaps reflecting growing knowledge about the two plans and their differences.

       Column 5 of Table 4 shows which persons making an active selection chose the DC plan.

Among these employees, older persons were more likely to select the hybrid plan, perhaps

because they expected to be less likely to change jobs in the future. Conditional on making an

active choice, men chose the hybrid plan more often, while the higher paid elected the DC plan.

Higher education staffers were nine percentage points less likely to elect the hybrid plan, perhaps

indicating their greater anticipated career mobility. Over time, a larger percentage of new hires

who made an active choice selected the hybrid plan.

       Two additional variables are included in Columns 2, 4, and 6 of Table 4, in an effort to

control for factors indicative of additional difficult-to-observe information about new hires.

Specifically, we examined whether each participant subsequently contributed to a URS

supplemental retirement plan, and whether each separated from employment in the second year

on the job. Interestingly, participants who did save in the supplemental plans were also more

likely to have made an active pension choice in their first year. In other words, these individuals

appear to have been more attentive than average to retirement plan features. By contrast, workers

leaving employment in their second year were less likely to have made an active plan choice, and

when they did, they chose the DC plan more often. Thus, the defaulters are also more likely to

anticipate that they will leave public employment.

Did the Reform Boost Supplemental Retirement Saving?

      If new hires understand that the post-reform retirement plans are likely to be less generous

than the old DB plan, they may make an effort to save more in the supplemental retirement plans

to accumulate sufficient retirement resources.27 To test for this, we have calculated participation

and contribution patterns in supplemental retirement plan for pre- and post-reform new hires.

These are based on employee contributions to URS supplemental plans and do not include

employer contributions to the 401(k) plan associated with the hybrid or DC plan.

       Figure 2 and Table 5 reveal the time path of supplemental plan participation over the

period. Of note is the long-term decline in supplemental plan participation throughout the period,

most likely attributable to the recession and collapse of the equity markets. Prior to the reform,

the proportion of new hires enrolling in supplemental plans fell from over 40 percent (2006-08)

to only about 25 percent for those hired 2009-11. Post-reform, the proportion of new hires

contributing to a supplemental plan continued to fall, to below 20 percent. The average

contribution rate remained relatively stable over the period, at around 4.4 percent.

       Figure 2 also shows that employees who defaulted into the hybrid plan post-reform were

far less likely to contribute to supplemental accounts, compared to new hires making an active

plan choice. Table 5 also shows that defaulters who did make voluntary contributions, saved less

on average than did active choosers. Participation rates for those making an active election were

actually higher than pre-reform (33 percent compared to about 25 percent) while those who

defaulted into the hybrid plan were much less likely to save additional amounts (7 percent).

Finally, those who elected the hybrid plan were somewhat more likely to enroll in one of the

   Indeed the NASRA (2014c) report states that “public employees will need to take advantage of
supplemental savings vehicles to maintain similar salary replacement rates in retirement, pre and post
reform” (p.14).

supplemental saving plans, compared to those choosing the DC, but they contributed less as a

percentage of pay, on average, than participants who chose the DC.

Figure 2 and Table 5 here

        A multivariate linear probability analysis of the time pattern shows that some, but far

from all, new hires with the less generous Tier II pensions responded by voluntarily contributing

to a retirement saving plan; see Table 6.28 As one might expect, more highly paid new hires were

more likely to contribute to the supplemental plan, as were older employees.29 Nevertheless, age

is not significant for state employees. The key finding, however, is that participants making an

active election of primary plan were about 22 percentage points more likely to also participate in

a supplemental plan, holding other factors constant (Column 1). Some individuals in our sample

might be participating in other supplemental plans offered by their employers,30 and we have

data only on contributions to URS Savings Plans. Accordingly, Column 2 breaks out state

employees for whom we observe all participation in employer-provided supplemental retirement

plans. Results show even greater differences: those actively choosing their primary plan were 41

percentage points more likely to make supplementary contributions, versus those defaulted into

the hybrid plan.

Table 6 here

        Columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 expand on this analysis by focusing on contribution rates for

supplemental plan participants. Contribution rates were positively associated with age and salary,

and men contribute less than women. For state employees, however, salary was not significant.

Participants in the DC primary plan contributed more than participants in the hybrid plan.


How the Reform Affected Patterns of Separation from Public Employment

        One concern sometimes expressed by public sector employers who alter their retirement

plans is that such changes will influence employee separation rates. 31 We can evaluate this

hypothesis in the URS case, since the dataset includes separations reported prior to November 1,

2014 for individuals who remained employed for at least one year. Our pre-reform series begins

with new hires during the final six months of fiscal year 2006, extends through the recession

years, and ends with fiscal year 2011. The post-reform data includes employees hired during

fiscal year 2012 and the first three months of fiscal year 2013. Inasmuch as there is a 30-60 day

lag in reporting, we restrict the sample for this analysis to individuals hired prior to September

30, 2012. 32 We cannot determine whether separations were employee-initiated quits or

employer-initiated terminations.

        Figure 3 reports the proportion of pre- and post-reform new hires who remained

employed for at least two years; that is, the second-year retention rate conditional on remaining

on the job at least one year. Table 7 shows that more than 87 percent of those hired prior to the

reform were still employed two years later, while fewer than 83 percent of those hired after the

reform remained at the two-year mark. In other words there was a considerable increase in

separation rates after the reform was enacted, of 30 percent (from 13 to 17 percentage points). It

is also interesting that new hires not making an active choice of a pension plan post-reform had

31
   In fact, this research project began with a conversation with Richard Ellis, Treasurer of the State of
Utah in which he indicated his concern that turnover rates had risen since the implementation of the
pension reforms.
32
   Additionally, we removed 43 individuals who separated from employment due to death or disability.
                                                                                                    22


considerably higher separation rates, compared to the new hires who elected either the DC or the

hybrid plan. That is, people who elected the DC plan had slightly higher separation rates

compared to those in the hybrid plan.

Figure 3 and Table 7 here

       In Table 8, we report estimated coefficients of a model of the factors determining

whether an employee remained on the job after one year of employment. Three groups are of

interest: post-reform hires, the full sample, and individuals hired within one year before and after

the reform. 33 Once again, we see that people who defaulted into the hybrid plan behave

differently, compared to those making an active choice. Employees who actively elected the

hybrid plan were eight percentage points more likely to remain on the job compared to the

defaulters, and new hires electing the DC plan were two percentage points more likely to remain

on the job versus the defaulters. Moreover, the separation rate post-reform was about four

percentage points higher than in pre-reform years. Older employees were less likely to leave

public employment, as were men and those with higher annual salaries.

Table 8 here

       While these results are suggestive, it is still difficult to prove that the Utah pension

reform drove the increase in the two-year separation from public employment. As noted earlier,

the pension reform reduced expected retirement benefits for public employees, which would be

consistent with this conclusion. Moreover, if public employment became less desirable, new

hires many have been lower-quality workers; in response, job evaluations could have fallen and

employer-initiated terminations may have risen. Yet separations could also have risen due to the


33
  Appendix Table 5 presents similar results from a series of Probit models. The marginal effects in the
two procedures are similar in sign and magnitude.
                                                                                                 23


recovering economy. From January 2009 to July 2011, the unemployment rate in Utah ranged

between 6.3 and 8.0 percent. As the national economy recovered, Utah’s unemployment rate

dropped rapidly, to 3.7 percent in 2014, the final year of our sample. A corresponding rise in

employment was also observed in the state: comparing the pre-reform with the post-reform

period employment rose about 10 percent.34 Accordingly, the state’s rapidly-improving economy

could have induced more public employees to leave their state and local jobs.

       While we cannot precisely estimate the relative importance of these effects, it seems

likely that the pension reform was not the only factor in increased public sector employee

separation rates. It is clear; however, that separations increased while the retention rate declined

around the time of the pension reform. To more narrowly focus the analysis around the time of

the reform, Figure 4 plots retention rates by quarters before and after the reform became

effective. There is a clear change in the level of retention and a steeper drop after the

implementation of the reform.


Conclusion and Discussion

       State and local governmental pension managers across the United States confront

important financial challenges due to low pension funding ratios and rapidly rising contributions

required to maintain these plans. In response to this financial challenge, many public sector

employers have modified their retirement plans to reduce both their current annual pension costs

and future pension liabilities. A few states have implemented more systematic changes, freezing

their traditional DB plans and instead offering employees a choice of alternatives that shift

investment risk away from employers and onto employees. Utah is a prime example of a state

that has fundamentally altered its retirement plan for newly hired workers, by replacing its

traditional DB plan with the choice of a hybrid plan or a DC. Our analysis contributes to the

relatively limited literature by examining the impact of public retirement plan reform on Utah’s

public sector workforce.

       Similar to other studies, we find that a majority (about 60 percent) of the URS new hires

defaulted into the hybrid plan. Among those who did make an active choice, slightly more than

half selected the hybrid plan, and the remainder chose the DC plan. Our analysis goes further in

evaluating the impact of public pension reform by examining employee behavior post-reform.

Since the new plan options are anticipated to yield less generous benefits than the old DB plan,

we evaluate whether new hires saved more, compared to pre-reform employees, and whether the

new plan led to higher turnover rates. Our analysis of participation in supplemental saving plans

spans the Great Recession, so it is difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions. Nevertheless, we

find that, post-reform, fewer new hires enrolled in supplemental retirement plans compared to

pre-reform, so they did not respond to lower expected retirement incomes by increasing their

retirement saving. Interestingly, however, new hires who did make an active plan choice were

also more likely to enroll in the supplemental plan than pre-reform new hires: 33 percent of

individuals making an active choice enrolled in a supplemental plan during the post-reform

period, compared to around 25 percent in the three years before the reform was enacted. By

contrast, those defaulting into the hybrid plan had lower enrollment rates in supplemental plans.

In other words, this analysis suggests that people who are defaulters in one dimension – failing to

make a choice of their primary plan – also fail to make an active choice in other areas, like

enrolling in a supplemental plan.
                                                                                              25


       We also evaluated whether the less generous retirement system is associated with higher

separation rates among new hires, and here we found that 4 percent more new hires left public

employment in Utah post-reform, compared to beforehand. We must caveat this conclusion by

noting that post-reform turnover could also reflect a recovering labor market compared to the

years prior to the plan change. In other words, if job opportunities improved post reform, newly-

hired public employees may have had other employment options to consider.

       It is also likely that many workers’ failure to make active retirement plan choices could

spur plan administrators to provide financial education programs and opportunities to learn about

the retirement benefits offered. This could enhance their old age provisions, and might also

reduce turnover among new hires. As yet we cannot determine precisely how these reforms will

influence public employees’ retirement patterns, nor do we estimate cost savings to the state or

taxpayers associated with the reform in this paper. But we do believe that defaults in pension

reforms shape public workers’ employment, saving, and turnover behaviors. Consequently,

public sector pension managers and policymakers may wish to consider these effects when

evaluating future pension reforms.

Employees who first entered employment with a Utah Retirement Systems-covered employer between
January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2013 and did not separate from employment during the first 12
months are included. The pre-reform group includes individuals hired before July 1, 2011 who were
automatically enrolled in a traditional defined benefit (DB) plan. The post-reform group includes
individuals hired on or after July 1, 2011 who were given the choice between a defined contribution (DC)
plan and a hybrid plan. Plan choice elections become final at the end of the first year of employment.
Individuals in the post-reform group who did not make an active election during the first year were
defaulted into the hybrid plan. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2006 includes only individuals hired
during the six-month period beginning January 1, 2006. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2014 includes
only individuals hired during the three-month period ending September 30, 2013.

Note: The table shows the percentage of employees in each group who contributed to one of the Utah Retirement Systems (URS) supplemental
retirement savings plans in the calendar year following the year of hire. The average total contribution to all Utah Retirement Systems (URS)
supplemental retirement savings plans in the calendar year following the year of hire as a percentage of annual salary for participants is shown in
italics. Participants who were reported to have contributed more than the maximum amount allowed by the Internal Revenue based on their age
and salary are excluded (n=55). The pre-reform group includes individuals hired before July 1, 2011 who were automatically enrolled in a
traditional defined benefit plan. The post-reform group includes individuals hired on or after July 1, 2011 who were given the choice between a
defined contribution (DC) plan and a hybrid plan. Plan choice elections become final at the end of the first year of employment. Individuals in the
post-reform group who did not make an active election during the first year were defaulted into the hybrid plan. The fiscal year ending June 30,
2006 only includes individuals hired during the six-month period beginning January 1, 2006. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2014 only includes
individuals hired during the three-month period ending September 30, 2013

Note: The table shows the percentage of employees in each group who remained employed by Utah
Retirement System covered employer for at least two years. Employees who first entered employment
with a Utah Retirement System covered employer between January 1, 2006 and September 30, 2012 and
did not separate from employment during the first 12 months are included. Therefore, this table reflects
retention rates during the second year of employment, given that an individual remained employed
through the first year. For example, an individual hired February 1, 2012 is not included in the table
unless he or she remained employed through February 1, 2013, and is not counted as remaining for at
least two years if he or she separated from employment prior to February 1, 2014. Individuals who
terminated employment due to death or disability are not included (n=43).

The pre-reform group includes individuals hired before July 1, 2011 who were automatically enrolled in a
traditional defined benefit plan. The post-reform group includes individuals hired on or after July 1, 2011
who were given the choice between a defined contribution (DC) plan and a hybrid plan. Plan choice
elections become final at the end of the first year of employment. Individuals in the post-reform group
who did not make an active election during the first year were defaulted into the hybrid plan. The fiscal
year ending June 30, 2006 only includes individuals hired during the six-month period beginning January
1, 2006. The fiscal year ending June 30, 2013 only includes individuals hired during the three-month
period ending September 30, 2012.

        eligible position by a Utah Retirement System covered employer
Plan choice year: The first calendar year after the entry year in which the individual earned at
        least .0417 years of service credit. For individuals hired after July 1, 2011, this is the

        immediately following that year, if they first hired near the end of the year.
Entry age: Approximate age of employee when they first became a member of one of the plans
        administered by the Utah Retirement System.
Salary in plan choice year: Employee earning in the plan choice year in 2014 dollars. If less than
        one year of service was reported, earnings are annualized by dividing total salary by total
        reported service.
Employer: The classification of the employer where the individual worked most during the
        calendar year in which plan choice became final. State Government includes quasi-state
        agencies and independent agencies.
System: The pension system in which the individual earned the most service credit during the
        calendar year in which plan choice became final.
Separated in second year: Indicator for an individual separating from employment within the first
        24 months, based on separations reported before November 1, 2014.
Contributed to SRP in plan choice year: Indicator for an individual making a contribution of any
amount to at least one of the four Supplemental Retirement Plans (SRPs) offered by URS.
