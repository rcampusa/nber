Interstate Migration Has Fallen Less Than You Think: Consequences of Hot Deck Imputation
in the Current Population Survey

                                              ABSTRACT

We show that much of the recent reported decrease in interstate migration is a statistical artifact. Before
2006, the Census Bureau's imputation procedure for dealing with missing data inflated the estimated
interstate migration rate. An undocumented change in the procedure corrected the problem starting
in 2006, thus reducing the estimated migration rate. The change in imputation procedures explains
90 percent of the reported decrease in interstate migration between 2005 and 2006, and 42 percent
of the decrease between 2000 (the recent high-water mark) and 2010. After we remove the effect of
the change in procedures, we find that the annual interstate migration rate follows a smooth downward
trend from 1996 to 2010. Contrary to popular belief, the 2007{ 2009 recession is not associated with
any additional decrease in interstate migration relative to trend.

1. Introduction
       The low rate of migration between U.S. states has attracted much recent attention from
demographers, policymakers, and the news media. Observers have often emphasized that, in
addition to the long-run downward trend in interstate migration over the past half century,
the migration rate fell sharply in 2006 from a relatively high plateau between 1999 and 2005.
Figure 1(a) shows the annual interstate migration rate for the past decade, as calculated by
the U.S. Census Bureau and published on its web page.1 Taking note of these data, a front-
page article in the Washington Post laments that “labor mobility has nearly ground to a halt
in the past two years” and reports that “the recent sharp downturn” in interstate migration
is making economists, including Assistant Treasury Secretary Alan B. Krueger, worry that
low mobility will harm the nation’s recovery from the recession (Fletcher, 2010). Frey (2009),
analyzing the Census Bureau data, calls the decline in interstate migration “dramatic” and
notes that “the 1.6 percent interstate migration rate for the past two years was half the value
exhibited in 1999–2000” (p. 4). And a recent International Monetary Fund report on the
U.S. economy argues that “slower inter-state migration, likely related to the housing crash,”
is raising unemployment (Batini et al., 2010, pp. 5–6).
       Implicit in these discussions is the hypothesis that a decline in interstate migration
reduces the economy’s ability to respond to adverse shocks. Whether that hypothesis is cor-
rect, and what government policies might constitute an appropriate response, are important
research questions. However, before such questions can be addressed, a crucial first step is to
obtain accurate data on what is actually happening to migration rates.
       In this paper, we show that interstate mobility has not fallen dramatically in recent
years. The migration rate has merely followed its long-term downward trend. Analyses that
have found a sharp drop relative to trend have been based on the Census Bureau’s published
rate, which the bureau calculates from the Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC)
to the Current Population Survey (CPS). In 2006, the Census Bureau made a seemingly
minor change in its procedures for imputing missing data in the ASEC. This change in
imputation procedures — not any actual change in migration patterns — is responsible for

much of the decline in reported ASEC migration rates. The change explains 90 percent of
the reported decrease in interstate migration between 2005 and 2006, and 42 percent of the
decrease between 2000 (the recent high-water mark) and 2010.
                                        Figure 1(b) illustrates the problem. The figure shows the interstate migration rate for
all ASEC respondents, and for those with original and imputed data separately. From 1996
to 1998 and from 2006 to 2010, the rate for respondents with imputed data is only slightly
higher than the rate for respondents with original data, and the rate for all respondents is
likewise very close to the rate for respondents with original data. But from 1999 to 2005, the
interstate migration rate for respondents with imputed data is three to five times the rate
for respondents with nonimputed data. Including the imputed data drives up the rate for all
respondents, which is the rate that the Census Bureau publishes and that recent research,
policy, and media reports have discussed.2

   After we noticed the discrepancy between imputed and nonimputed data, we corresponded with Census
Bureau staff. They told us that the imputation procedure was changed in 2006 in such a way as to reduce

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 explains how the imputation procedures
changed. Section 3 documents the effect of the change on migration rates estimated from the
ASEC. Section 4 argues that the nonimputed data provide the most accurate guide to recent
trends in interstate migration and uses independent datasets and an alternative imputation
procedure to check the robustness of our results. Section 5 discusses how our findings relate
to the policy discussion on migration in the current recession and suggests some avenues for
further research.

2. Imputation procedures for migration data in the ASEC
        The ASEC, informally known as the March CPS because most of the data are collected
in March, has been used to construct published annual migration data since 1948. It is thus
the longest-running migration data series available for the United States. Unlike decennial
census data, ASEC data can reveal short-run changes in migration patterns. Unlike the
American Community Survey (ACS), which collects data year round, the ASEC collects
data at a relatively precise point in time.3 Unlike data on tax return mobility from the
Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the ASEC mobility data are part of a dataset with many
covariates, allowing researchers to study the individual and household characteristics that
influence mobility. And unlike panel data, ASEC data are not confounded by the difficulty of
finding respondents when they move.4 Hence, the ASEC is a unique and invaluable resource
for research on internal migration in the United States.
        But as valuable as it is, the ASEC — like all surveys — must be analyzed with caution.
In this case, the caution relates to missing data. The ASEC suffers from a significant amount
of item nonresponse: cases where respondents answer some questions but not others. The
Census Bureau can sometimes infer the correct answer from the answers of other household

the interstate migration rate. In response to this paper, and after its circulation, the Census Bureau added
a note on its web site (http://www.census.gov/population/www/socdemo/CPSnote.pdf) that explains the
change in imputation procedure and cautions users about its effects on measured migration rates. The change
is also mentioned in a footnote in an unpublished Census Bureau working paper that compares the ASEC to
the American Community Survey (Koerber, 2007, p. 14).
    3
      The 2009 ASEC tells us the fraction of Americans who moved between February–April 2008 and February–
April 2009, while the 2009 ACS provides only an average of one-year migration rates for intervals from January
2008–January 2009 to December 2008–December 2009.
    4
      The ASEC measures mobility with retrospective questions: “Did this person live in this house or apart-
ment 1 year ago?” and “Where did (reference person’s name/you) live one year ago?”



                                                      3
members. But often there is no information about the correct answer. In recent years, migra-
tion information was missing and could not be inferred from household members’ answers for
10 to 12 percent of ASEC respondents. It would be inappropriate to calculate migration rates
using only the data from people who answer the questions, because those who do not answer
may differ along both observable and unobservable dimensions from those who do answer. In
principle, one could calculate bounds on the migration rate by assuming alternatively that all
nonrespondents are migrants or that none are.5 However, because nonresponse is so common,
the bounds would be so wide as to be almost useless.
         To account for differences between respondents and nonrespondents along observable
dimensions, the Census Bureau uses an imputation procedure known as hot deck allocation.
The technical documentation for the Current Population Survey (U.S. Census Bureau, 2006,
chap. 9) describes the method in detail. Hot deck allocation works by defining a set of
cells based on observable characteristics, X. Missing values are filled in one respondent
at a time. If a respondent did not answer a question, an imputed answer is generated by
copying the answer of the most recently processed respondent who falls in the same X cell
and who did answer the question. The person whose missing answer is filled in is known as
a recipient; the person whose answer is used is known as a donor. If, conditional on X, there
are no differences between nonrespondents and respondents in unobservable characteristics
that affect the variable being imputed, then this method will generate unbiased estimates of
the mean of the variable that is being imputed. The reason is that once X is conditioned on,
no selection on unobservables implies that responses are missing at random. However, this
imputation procedure will still lead to biased estimates if unobservable differences between
respondents and nonrespondents remain after conditioning on X.
         Which characteristics are included in X depends on what variable is being imputed.
According to Koerber (2007), for imputing mobility variables the 2004 ASEC used cells based
on X = {census division of current residence, race, housing tenure, age, armed forces status}.
Imputed migration rates will differ from nonimputed rates only if the distribution of these
characteristics differs among respondents and nonrespondents. Thus, if the characteristics
included in X are changed, the resulting imputations will change. The change in processing

order that we describe below implicitly changed the effective set X used by the Census
Bureau, which in turn led to a change in imputed migration rates.
       For migration data, the imputation procedure substitutes donors’ answers for missing
answers to two questions: whether the respondent lived in the same home one year ago and,
if not, where the respondent lived one year ago. Once these variables are filled, additional
variables are calculated that categorize movers as having moved within a county, between
counties in the same state, between states, or from abroad, based on the distance between
the respondent’s current location and her (possibly imputed) location one year ago.
       Using the most recently processed respondent as the donor to impute missing answers
means that the order of processing can affect the results. Since 2006, respondents have been
processed in geographic order. This ordering means that the donor usually lives near the
recipient. Because long-distance migration is rare, the donor’s location one year ago is also
usually close to the recipient’s current location. Thus, if the procedure imputes that the
recipient moved, it usually imputes a local move. Before 2006, the order of processing was
geographic but within particular samples.6 (The ASEC consists of several samples, not one;
see U.S. Census Bureau, 2006, chapter 11.) Therefore, on average, donors lived farther from
recipients; donors’ locations one year ago were also on average farther from recipients’ current
locations; and recipients were more likely to have imputed interstate moves.
       In sum, the switch to geographic sorting in 2006 reduced the reported interstate mi-
gration rate by imputing fewer interstate moves and more local moves. For example, suppose
a person in Philadelphia fails to answer the migration questions and is matched with a donor
who moved, so that the nonrespondent is coded as a mover. If imputations are done in geo-
graphic order, the donor will probably also come from Philadelphia, and the donor’s location
one year ago was also probably near Philadelphia. The geographic procedure will thus usually
impute that the nonrespondent made a local move. However, if imputations are not done
in geographic order, the donor may come from farther away — Minneapolis, say — and the
donor’s location one year ago was probably near Minneapolis, not Philadelphia. The pre-2006
nongeographic procedure will thus impute that the nonrespondent made an interstate move,

not because the nonrespondent is similar to a respondent who moved a long distance, but
rather because the nonrespondent is similar to a respondent who moved a short distance in
Minnesota.
       In formal terms, the change in sort order changed the effective amount of geographic
information included in the conditioning variables X. The new sort order is likely to result in
better imputations because it makes the missing-at-random assumption more likely to hold:
Since current location is a good predictor of previous location, the more information about
current location that is included in X, the less selection on unobservables in previous location
there will be. However, our concern here is with measuring migration trends over time, and for
that purpose it is important to hold constant the amount of selection on unobservables over
time. Any change from year to year in the sort order or conditioning variables — regardless
of which sort order or conditioning set is better — will change the imputed data, but such a
change should not be confused with a change in actual migration behavior.
       One unresolved puzzle remains: why the imputed interstate migration rate for non-
respondents jumped sharply in 1999 and again in 2000, while the migration rate among
respondents did not. Figure 1(b) shows an increase of more than 6 percentage points over
this two-year period in the imputed data. Despite our best attempts, including a close exam-
ination of the technical documentation for the CPS (U.S. Census Bureau, 2000, 2002, 2006),
we have not been able to uncover the reasons for this increase. Census Bureau staff told us
that the only change to the imputation procedure in 1999 was a change in the computer lan-
guage in which the programs are written, from Fortran to SAS. However, Census Bureau staff
told us that the change in computer languages should not have affected the results, and we do
not have any other information that could reveal whether and how the change in languages
may have mattered. Another possibility that arose in correspondence with the Census Bu-
reau is that the expansion of the ASEC under the State Children’s Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) may have led to the divergence between imputed and nonimputed data, because
this expansion added samples to the ASEC and the inflated interstate migration rates are as-
sociated with sorting respondents geographically within samples rather than in the ASEC as
a whole. However, since the divergence occurs in 1999 and 2000, while the SCHIP expansion
took place only in 2001, we do not think the SCHIP expansion can account for the puzzle.

Nor can the change in CPS weights associated with the 2000 population census account for
the puzzle: The weights changed in 2001, not 1999 or 2000. Without access to nonpublic
elements of the data and the Census Bureau’s imputation programs, it may be impossible
for outside researchers to determine what happened in 1999 and 2000. We therefore urge the
Census Bureau to investigate this issue further.

3. The effect of imputed data on estimated migration rates
       We analyze migration rates in the 1996 to 2010 ASEC survey years. Data from the 1995
survey are not comparable because migration questions were asked in a different way, and in
earlier years, the public-use data files either do not contain flags for imputed migration data
or show that virtually no migration observations were imputed. We do not report standard
errors or confidence intervals because the ASEC sample is so large — more than 200,000
individuals in recent years — that the standard errors for aggregate statistics are minuscule.7
       We consider a respondent to have imputed data only if the data came from hot deck

   7
    In the 2010 ASEC, the standard error of the interstate migration rate, calculated using the replicate
weights that accompany the public-use data file, is 0.05 percentage point for the full sample and for ob-
servations with original migration data, and 0.18 percentage point for observations with imputed migration
data.



                                                                                  7

from household members’ survey responses.8 Figure 2 shows the percentage of respondents
who have imputed migration data in each survey year. The rate of imputed data is stable but
quite high relative to the migration rate, illustrating the need to account for nonrespondents
in some way.
        In figure 1(b), we demonstrated that imputed data show a much higher interstate
migration rate than nonimputed data from 1999 to 2005. We now examine how imputa-
tions affect the rate of moving within counties and the total migration rate for moves of all
distances.9 Figure 3(a) shows that the change in imputation procedures had the opposite ef-
fect on within-county migration data compared with the effect on interstate migration data:
From 1999 to 2005, the within-county migration rate was depressed among respondents with
imputed data. Thus, the pre-2006 imputation procedure spuriously imputed long-distance
moves that should have been local moves. Figure 3(b) shows that the change in imputa-
tion procedures had little effect on the total migration rate, because the decrease in imputed
interstate moves in 2006 cancels out an increase in imputed within-county moves.
        The comparisons of migration rates in imputed and nonimputed data do not, of course,
prove that the pre-2006 imputation procedure led to an artificially inflated interstate migra-
tion rate and a reduced within-county rate. Ideally, we would show the effect of the change
in imputation procedures by redoing the pre-2006 imputations using the sort order in effect
since 2006. Although even the new procedure does not necessarily generate accurate levels of

   8
      Specifically, we categorize a respondent as having imputed migration data if migration status (whether
the respondent lived in the same home one year ago) was hot deck allocated; if migration status was not
allocated but the person is coded as a migrant and state of residence one year ago was hot deck allocated;
if migration status was not allocated, the person is coded as a within-state or within-county migrant, and
the county of residence one year ago was hot deck allocated; or if the person’s migration data were inferred
from a householder, parent or spouse whose migration data in turn were hot deck allocated or inferred
from yet another respondent whose data were hot deck allocated. For 1.6 percent of weighted observations,
the imputation flags show that the migration data were inferred from another respondent, but this other
respondent does not exist. This problem mainly occurs when an unmarried person has an imputation flag
indicating “assigned from spouse.” We treat these unlinkable observations as having nonimputed data since
there is no information on the data file to indicate that their data came from hot deck allocation. However,
the migration rates in the unlinkable observations follow the same pattern as the rates in imputed data,
so some researchers may prefer to treat the unlinkable observations as imputed. Classifying the unlinkable
observations as hot deck allocated does not significantly change our findings; these results are available on
request.
    9
      The change in imputation procedures had little effect on rates of migration from abroad and between
counties in the same state. These results are available on request.

migration rates, since there could be selection on unobservables conditional on the variables
used to define imputation cells, holding the imputation procedure constant would highlight
the effect on the migration trend of the implicit change in the conditioning variables induced
by the change in sort order. Provided that the degree of selection on unobservables is not
changing over time, a time-invariant imputation procedure would produce an accurate esti-
mate of the migration trend. However, this calculation would require access to geographic
and other data that the Census Bureau does not make public.
                                           We nonetheless think there is a very strong case that the change in imputation pro-
cedures explains why the interstate migration rate was higher before 2006. First, this is the
explanation Census Bureau staff gave when we brought the issue to their attention. Second,
mechanically, the geographic sort in place since 2006 must lead to at least some reduction
in imputed interstate moves. Finally, Koerber (2007) indicates that the pre-2006 sort order
raised the interstate migration rate relative to a geographic sort used in the ACS.




                                                                                                  9
4. What is the true trend in interstate migration?
       We agree with the Census Bureau that the geographic sort that is currently in use is
likely to produce the most reliable imputations of migration rates. Any other sort order will
impute too many long-distance moves simply because some recipients will live far from their
donors. (Alternatively, as we illustrate below, one could reduce the sort order’s impact on the
results by imputing the type of move instead of inferring the type of move from an imputed
location one year ago.) The pre-2006 data likely overstate the rate of interstate migration
and understate the rate of local migration.
       The change in imputation procedures in 2006 means that comparisons of pre-2006 and
post-2006 data do not accurately measure trends in interstate migration. However, because
there may have been good reasons for using different sort orders to obtain better imputations
of other variables in past surveys, we do not think it would necessarily be desirable for
the Census Bureau to recalculate the pre-2006 imputations using the current procedure.10
Fortunately, there is a simple way to obtain accurate estimates of the trend in interstate
migration rates over the last decade. Since 2006, the interstate migration rate including
imputed data has been virtually identical to the rate using only nonimputed data. Figure
4 illustrates this point by reproducing figure 1(b) without the imputed-data migration rate,
to show only the contrast between overall and nonimputed rates. Because the interstate
migration rates using nonimputed data and using all data have been virtually identical for
the past five years, we think that the rate using nonimputed data is a reliable guide before
2006 as well. Analysts interested in trends in the overall interstate migration rate can focus
on the rate in nonimputed data, and doing so will remove the fluctuations induced by changes
in the imputation procedure.
       Figure 4 shows that, once we remove the effect of changes in the imputation procedure,
the interstate migration rate has hewed closely to a smooth downward trend for the past 15
years. With imputations included, the rate peaked at 3.12 percent in the 2000 survey, fell to
2.59 percent by the 2005 survey, plummeted to 1.96 percent in the 2006 survey, and is now
down to 1.44 percent. Without imputations, the rate was 2.35 percent in the 2000 survey,

  10
    The same sort order must be used for imputing all variables because some imputations are functions of
other imputations.

1.93 percent in the 2005 survey, 1.87 percent in the 2006 survey, and 1.38 percent in the
2010 survey. Thus, the change in imputation procedures explains nine-tenths of the 0.63
percentage point drop from 2005 to 2006 and four-tenths of the 1.68 percentage point drop
        We can carry out a partial check on how much the missing data matter for the trend
in interstate migration by constructing our own imputations using a procedure that does
not vary over time. We call this a partial check because, although our procedure corrects
for observable differences between nonrespondents and respondents, it — like all imputation
methods — does not correct for selection on unobservables. But this partial check is valuable
because it illustrates what the trend in estimated interstate migration rates might have been
if the Census Bureau had kept its imputation procedures constant from year to year.
        We follow the Census Bureau in dividing people into cells based on census division of
current residence, race, housing tenure, age, and armed forces status.11 However, instead of

  11
     To ensure that each cell containing nonrespondents also contains at least one respondent, we must use
cells that combine a range of ages and, in some cases, other characteristics. We define the cells as follows.
For black and white civilians ages 65 and under, the cells are defined by census division of current residence,
five-year age groups, whether the individual is white or black, and whether the individual is a homeowner or
not. For ages 66 and over, we do not distinguish between homeowners and nonowners. For ages 71 and over,
we use 10-year age groups. For races other than black and white, we use census region rather than division,
and we do not distinguish among these races. For armed forces members, the cells are defined by whether
the individual is white or not, whether the individual is a homeowner or not, and which of the following


                                                                                   11
imputing migration status and location of previous residence and then calculating how far the
nonrespondent moved, we directly impute an indicator variable for whether the nonrespondent
moved between states. In particular, for each nonrespondent in a particular cell, we randomly
designate that nonrespondent as an interstate migrant with probability equal to the weighted
fraction of respondents in the cell who are interstate migrants, and as not an interstate migrant
with probability equal to the weighted fraction of respondents in the cell who are not interstate
migrants.12 We use multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987) to account for uncertainty in the
imputed results due to uncertainty in the estimation of cell migration rates and randomness
in the migration outcome imputed to each nonrespondent.13
        Our imputation procedure is equivalent to hot deck imputation if people are sorted
in random rather than geographic order and if the interstate migration indicator is imputed
directly instead of calculated as a function of imputed previous location. An advantage of
our procedure is that because it does not sort respondents geographically, it does not require
detailed address information that the Census Bureau withholds from public-use data files.
We can avoid geographic sorting because although location of current residence is highly
informative about location of previous residence, it is less informative about migration status
per se, and we are only imputing migration status, not location of previous residence.
        Table 1 shows the results from our imputations. The interstate migration rate we
calculate using the completed data — the actual data of respondents and the imputed data
of nonrespondents — is virtually identical to the migration rate using only nonimputed data
in each year from 1996 to 2010, supporting our argument that the nonimputed data provide
a good guide to the trend in interstate migration. The Census Bureau’s published rate
including imputed data is slightly higher than our rate. We conjecture that this difference

age groups the individual falls in: under 26, 26–30, 31–35, 36–40, 41–45, or over 45. Of course, other cell
definitions would also be possible and might be desirable in other contexts. Our purpose here is only to
illustrate one reasonable method of imputing the missing data.
   12
      This procedure is the hot-deck-adjusted normal linear regression imputation method of Rubin (1987,
example 5.2), with the regressors consisting of indicator variables for the cells.
   13
      In particular, we construct M = 100 separate imputations. Let pj be the interstate migration rate among
respondents in cell j. For each imputation m = 1, . . . , M , we (1) draw p̂j,m from the posterior distribution
of pj and then (2) randomly assign nonrespondents in cell j as interstate migrants with probability p̂j . We
then estimate the interstate migration rate using the completed data set for each of the M imputations
and combine the M estimates to produce an overall estimated interstate migration rate and standard errors
according to the formulas of Rubin (1987, pp. 76–77).

may arise because the Census Bureau’s two-step method of imputing location last year and
then calculating the distance of the move can impute some spurious interstate moves, although
these should be rare when the data are sorted geographically.
          The close correspondence between our imputations and the nonimputed data reflects
the fact that there are few large differences between respondents and nonrespondents in
the conditioning variables X on which we (and the Census Bureau) base the imputations,
and what differences there are largely cancel out. Table 2 summarizes the conditioning
variables for respondents and nonrespondents in 1996 and 2010.14 Nonrespondents are, on
average, several years older than respondents, several percentage points less likely to be
white and several percentage points less likely to be homeowners. Imputation corrects for
all of these observable differences between respondents and nonrespondents. However, the
imputed interstate migration rate ultimately differs little from the rate among respondents

because the corrections have offsetting effects: Among respondents — whose data are used
to construct the imputation — older people and nonwhites have lower migration rates, while
nonhomeowners have higher migration rates.
        We can also check how much the interstate migration rate has fallen in recent years
by comparing the ASEC results with data from the ACS and the IRS. Neither the ACS
nor the IRS data are exactly comparable to the ASEC data. The ACS tends to smooth
out fluctuations in the migration rate because ACS data are collected year round rather
than mainly in March. In addition, Koerber (2007) notes that the ACS tends to find more
migrants than the ASEC because of differences in survey procedures.15 Meanwhile, the IRS
data cover only people who file income-tax returns, which means low-income people are
underrepresented; track tax return mailing addresses rather than residence addresses; and do
not measure migration at a precise date because tax returns enter the calculations if they are
filed at any time from January through September (Internal Revenue Service, 2008). These
differences mean that we do not expect the ACS, IRS and ASEC migration rates to match
in any given year, but the change in migration rates over periods of several years should be
comparable in the three datasets.
        Figure 5 shows the interstate migration rates in the ASEC, the IRS data, and the
ACS starting in 2005, the year that the ACS began to collect data from the entire United
States.16 The ACS data are from the summary tables that the Census Bureau publishes on
its American FactFinder web site17 and include both imputed and nonimputed data.18 The
IRS rate is calculated from the migration tables on the IRS web site.19
        The interstate migration rates in the IRS and ACS data actually rose between 2005

  15
     The ACS spends up to three months attempting to collect data from a given address, while the ASEC
collects data only in a specific week, so if the address is vacant in a certain week but occupied in any of the
next 12 weeks, the ACS will find a migrant where the ASEC would find a vacancy. The ACS and ASEC
survey universes also differ in some ways.
  16
     Before 2005, the Census Bureau’s source and accuracy statements for the ACS say the survey is designed
to represent only the counties where data were collected.

  18
     In the public-use data for the ACS, we have found that dropping imputed data has little effect on the
estimated migration rate; however, results from the public-use file do not exactly match the summary tables
because the public-use file includes only a subset of all ACS respondents.

CPS and ACS rates are weighted percentages of respondents at least one year old who lived in a different
state one year ago. IRS migration rate is the percentage of tax returns that were filed in a different state the
previous year, weighted by the number of exemptions claimed on the return, with previous year’s location
defined by the filing location of the primary taxpayer on the return, and with new tax filers excluded from
the calculation. Source: Authors’ calculations from CPS ASEC and IRS Statistics of Income data; ACS rates

and 2006, contrary to the result in the ASEC. However, one-year fluctuations in the IRS
and ACS data are difficult to interpret because of the imprecise timing of these datasets.20
Long-run changes are more instructive. From 2005 to 2009, the migration rate in the ACS
fell 0.2 percentage point, from 2.48 percent to 2.28 percent. The IRS results almost exactly
match the ACS for 2005 through 2008, the last year for which the IRS data are available. By
contrast, in the ASEC the rate fell 1.02 percentage point from 2005 to 2009 when including
imputed data, and 0.37 percentage point when we use only nonimputed data. The decline
in interstate migration in the ACS and IRS data is thus even smaller than the decline in
the ASEC and lends support to our argument that interstate migration has not decreased
dramatically in recent years.

   20
      The rise in the ACS data may also be due to the addition of group-quarters residents to the ACS sample
starting in 2006. To exclude group-quarters residents, we would have to analyze the public-use micro data
sample, but as we indicate in footnote 18, the public-use file contains a subset of respondents and results
from the public-use file do not exactly match the published totals.




                                                                               16
5. Policy and research implications
       The precise timing of the ASEC makes it the most appropriate dataset for investigating
how migration changed during the December 2007–June 2009 recession. Despite the media
reports and concern among policymakers, there is no sign that interstate migration deviated
meaningfully from its long-run trend. Recall that data for the 2007 survey year refer to
migration between February–April 2006 and February–April 2007. Thus, the data points
corresponding to the recession are those for the 2008, 2009, and 2010 survey years. Figure 4
shows that, in the nonimputed data that we view as most accurate, migration fell faster than
trend in the 2007 survey year, before the recession.
       As we have discussed, throwing out observations with missing or imputed data is not in
general a good method. It happens to be a reasonable choice when estimating the interstate
migration rate because the observable differences between respondents and nonrespondents
have little net effect on interstate migration: Both the Census Bureau’s current imputation
procedure and an alternative procedure that we implement in this paper produce virtually
identical rates for imputed and nonimputed data. The correspondence is not quite as close
for some other rates, such as the rate of migration between counties in a state. There also
is no guarantee that either dropping nonrespondents or using imputed data would produce
reliable results in an analysis of the relationship between migration and other variables.21 In
this paper, we have illustrated a time-invariant method for imputing missing migration data
that does not introduce spurious changes over time in imputed migration rates and can be
implemented using only the publicly available data, without access to the detailed geography
and other variables in the Census Bureau’s internal files. Researchers analyzing migration
trends in the ASEC may wish to use our or another imputation method in lieu of dropping
nonrespondents entirely. However, the choice of an appropriate imputation method depends
on the research context, so users should evaluate any imputation method to ensure that it
is suitable for their particular purposes. In addition, further research is needed on whether
unobservable differences between respondents and nonrespondents may bias estimates of mi-
gration rates — a problem that imputation cannot correct.

  21
    See, e.g., Hirsch and Schumacher (2004) and Bollinger and Hirsch (2006) for analyses of how imputed
values in a dependent variable from the CPS can bias estimated regression coefficients.


                                                  17
       Understanding the causes of the long-run downward trend in migration rates is also an
important topic for further research. Many factors may contribute to an individual’s decision
about whether to migrate. These include the direct costs associated with moving houses,
the loss of contact with family and friends, the benefits of access to a different labor market,
and geographic differences in the availability of local amenities. Which of these factors is
primarily responsible for the observed decline in migration will determine the appropriate
policy response. For example, if migration is falling because the costs associated with moving
are rising, then it may be difficult for workers to respond to economic shocks by moving
to places with more productive opportunities. There might then be a need for government
policies to, in the words of Assistant Treasury Secretary Krueger, “move the jobs — and create
new jobs — in areas where the people are” (Fletcher, 2010, p. A1). On the other hand, high
migration rates have often been associated with large economic differences between regions
of the country, as in the case of the Great Migration of African Americans from the rural
South to urban centers in the North and West (Curtis White et al., 2005; Hamilton, 1964).
If migration rates are falling because the U.S. economy is becoming more homogeneous, the
case for government intervention is less strong: Migration is low because it is unneeded,
not because it is costly. Untangling the potential explanations for the long-run decline in
migration is thus a valuable goal for future research. Our hope is that the correction for time-
varying imputation procedures that we describe in this paper will help make such research
possible, by allowing researchers to draw accurate inferences about interstate migration rates.
