                Unempolyment, Disequilibrium, and

                     An Econometric Approach

     The paper specifies a disequilibrium model for the aggregate
labor market consisting of demand and supply functions for labor,
an adjustment equation for wages as well as for prices, a
transactions equation and, finally, an equation that relates
measured unemployment to vacancies and to excess demand. The
model has a more sophisticated treatment of dynamics than earlier
disequilibrium models) and uses measured unemployment as an
endogenous variable. Two of the error terms are assumed to be
serially correlated and the coefficients are estimated by maximum
likelihood. The parameter estimates and the goodness-of-fit are
satisfactory and the model's implications for the behavior of
several important variables are sensible. Excess demand
estimates computed in various ways are reasonable. The model is
used to estimate the natural rate of unemployment as well as a
short run Phillips curve. Finally, the stability properties of
the model are analyzed by considering the eigenvalues of the
system; they are found to have moduli less than one.

                             1. Introduction


     Two major approaches to the study of unemployment have been

followed. The equilibrium model assumes that real wage rates instan-

taneously adjust so as to bring the supply and demand of labor into

equality. Unemployment is a consequence of erroneous expectations,

and/or intertemjoral labor supply substitution, and/or government pol-

icies such as unemployment insurance.' In contrast, the disequilibrium

model allows for the possibility that the real wage may fail to equate

the supply and demand of labor. Unemployment occurs when the quantity

of labor supplied exceeds the quantity demanded at the going real wage.

Typically, in these models it is assumed that the observed quantity of

labor during any given period is the minimum of the quantity demanded

and the quantity supplied.

     In the United States, most empirical work has followed the

equilibrium paradigm. Part of the reason may be ideological——failure of

markets to clear is generally viewed as concomitant with the failure of

some agents to optimize, a notion that is heretical according to the

neoclassical religion. Certainly, the inability to articulate a com-

pelling choice—theoretic explanation for real wage stickness is a

problem for disequilibrium advocates.2 Moreover, disequilibrium models

are much more difficult to deal with computationally. Standard econo-

metric software packages generally cannot be used, and difficult non-

linear estimation problems often emerge. As a consequence,

disequilibrium models that are quite simple from an economic standpoint

are quite complicated computationally. Hence, compared to their

equilibrium counterparts, disequilibrium models appear rather
                                 —2—


unsophisticated.

     Proponents of disequilibrium models are apt to point out that

despite difficulties in explaining precisely why the labor market does

not clear at every moment in time, the real world does seem to be like

that, and this fact should be reflected in economic analysis. As Rees

[1970, p. 234] observes,

          "Although we know very little about the exact
          nature of the costs of making wage changes,
          we can infer that they exist. Wages are, next
          to house rents, the stickiest general class of
          prices in the economy, seldom adjusted more
          frequently than once a year. This stickiness
          may be reinforced by unionism and collective
          bargaining, but it was present long before
          unions arrived."

In this paper we do not attempt to settle the equilibrium versus

disequilibrium controversy.3 Our goal is rather to put the two types of

models on a more equal standing by estimating an economically richer

disequilibrium model than has hitherto been studied.

     The model, which is presented in Section 2, relates measured

unemployment rates to the "true" excess supply of labor, has relatively

sophisticated nominal wage and price dynamics, and allows estimation of

the short run inflation—employment trade—off. Estimation issues are

discussed in Section 3. Among the econometric features of the analysis

are the presence of corrections for autocorrelation and the inclusion of

non—linearities in the variables. Both of these are difficult to deal

with in a disequilibrium context. The model is estimated with annual

U.S. data for the period 1929—1979, and the results are analyzed in

Section 4. Section 5 concludes with a summary and suggestions for

future research.

                              2. The Model


       We consider a system of six equations, one each for the marginal

productivity of labor, the supply of labor, the observed quantity of

labor, nominal wages, the price level, and the vacancy—unemployment rate

relationship. The deterministic version of each equation is discussed

in turn. We defer until Section 3 the matter of stochastic specifi-

cation.

       Marginal productivity of labor. Profit maximizing behavior by

firms conditional on output leads to a demand function for labor of the

form

                          D (w/P,         t)



where        is quantity demanded in year t, (W/P) is the real wage,

    is real output, and t is a time trend.         is the notional

demand in the sense that it is the amount of labor that firms desire to

employ at wage (W/P) —— not necessarily the quantity they will end up

hiring.

       For purposes of estimation, a log—linear approximation (except for

t) is employed:


                ln Dt = a0 + a1 (W/P) + a29.nQ + cz3t .              (2.1)

Formulation (2.1) (or a minor variant) is a common starting point for

studying labor markets (see, for example, Lucas and Rapping {l970],

Rosen and Quandt [1978], Romer, [1981], Smyth [undated], and

Hajivassiliou [1983]). Nevertheless, ideally one would want to study a
                                 —4—


multi—market model in which output was treated econometrically as an

endogenous variable. This task is beyond the scope of the current

study, and for tractability it will be assumed that output is exogenous.

    Note that equation (2.1) assumes that notional demand in a period

depends only on other variables during the same period. Given that our

data are annual, this does not strike us as unreasonable. Nevertheless,

we estimated a variant of the model which included lagged output. As

noted below, the coefficient on lagged output was marginally significant

statistically, and its inclusion had only a trivial impact on the other

coefficients.

     Supply of labor. The total number of manhours supplied in year t

depends upon the real net wage, (W/P) , and the potential labor

force, Ht , which is essentially a scale variable to. capture the effect

of population growth. Again assuming a log—linear specification:


                ln S =     +
                               lnt''t ÷ 2't                        (2.2)


where S denotes notional supply.4 Tne basic theory of labor supply

suggests that non—labor income belongs in equation (2.2). However,

Romer [1981] points out that unearned income is endogenous in a life—

cycle model of labor supply determination, and shows that more sensible

results can be obtained when it is omitted. Equation (2.2) is very

simple in that it ignores the possible role of intertemporal labor

supply substitution. Dealing with this problem rigorously requires

careful modelling of future wage expectations, a task that is beyond our

scope. (See Altonji [1982].) However, some simple expectational models
                                    —5—


imply that the lagged wage as well as its current value appear in the

supply equation. Such a formulation is discussed below.

     Observed quantity of labor. in an equilibrium model, the observed

quantity of labor is determined by the intersection of the supply and

demand curves. In a disequilibrium model, this is not the case. In

conformity with most of the work in disequilibrium theory, we assume

that the quantity observed is the minimum of the quantities supplied and

demanded at the current wage:


                   £nLt =   mm
                                 (2.nS, £nD) .                  (2.3)

Clearly, eq. (2.3) does not describe completely what is presumably a

very complicated rationing story, in which some submarkets have excess

demand and some have excess supply. (See Hajivass!liou [1983].)

However, the simple "mm condition" helps keep the problem tractable,

and we think that it is a reasonable approximation.5

     Taken together, eqs. (2.1), (2.2), and (2.3) form the bare bones

disequilibrium model. Such equations have been estimated by several

investigators, often with the addition of a wage adjustment equation

which makes the change in real wages some function of excess demand.

(See, for example, Rosen and Quandt [1978].) These studies have

demonstrated the computational feasibility of disequilibrium estimation,

and indicated the promise that such models have for explaining the time

series data.

     Still, these models suffer from several deficiencies: (1) They do

not show how official unemployment rates and the history of wage and
                                    —6—


price changes might affect current nominal wage rates. (2) They assume

that product prices are exogenous. In particular, past changes in norni—

nal wages exert no impact on the current price level.          (3) They ignore

information in official unemployment rates that might be exploited to

help estimate the excess demand for labor. The remaining equations of

the model remedy these problems.

     Nominal wage adjustment. We assume that this year's nominal wage

rate depends upon the last two yearst nominal wages, upon this year's

official unemployment rate (Ut) , and upon recent changes in prices;


             nWt =      + _.linwt_l +      + r3(LnP—znP1)

                        +   Y4
                                             +
                                                 nW2                     (2.4)


Lagged wages are included because of the possibility that adjustment to

new wage levels is sluggish. The presence of the official unemployment

rate reflects the possibility that when the labor market is slack (high

U) , then nominal wages will be lower, ceteris paribus, and vice versa.
Now, it is well known that unemployment as measured in the official sta—

tistical series does not correspond well to the theoretical notion of

unemployment as the inability to find work at the going wage. Why            not,
then, include excess demand, (Zn1 —       £nS)   ,   rather   than   ? The

choice of        reflects the fact that workers and employers do not know

      —   £nS)   ; they have to rely on their perceptions of the labor

market situation, and these are well—measured by U

     Lagged prices are included because of the expectation that workers'
                                      —7--.




nominal wage requests will depend on the extent of recent price changes.

Ceteris paribus, higher prices will result in high nominal wages.

(Indeed, in much of the union sector, indexing is formally built into

wage contracts.) The particular lag structure embodied in (2.4) was

selected after some experimentation with other formulations. As usual,

theory does not give much guidance with respect to the pattern of lags,

and eq. (2.4) was superior to several alternatives in the sense of

leading to the best fit to the data.

      Price adjustment. The price level this period depends upon the

lagged price level and the recent history of nominal wage changes:


               + 5iLnP   i
                             + s2(LnW_tnW1) + 3(LnW1_2.nW2) (2.5)

The logic here is very similar to that of (2.4). The lagged price term

reflects sluggishness in the price adjustment process. Lagged nominal

wages are included because producers take factor costs into account when

setting their prices. (Such behavior is consistent with, for example,

simple mark—up models of pricing behavior.) Note that because we do not

attempt to model disequilibrium in the goods market, excess demand does

not appear in (2.5).

      Vacancy—unemployment relationship. Let V be the vacancy rate in

year t and        be the official unemployment rate, both measured as

fractions. Ignore for the moment that               does not measure correctly

the discrepancy between the amount of labor supplied and the amount

workers desire to supply at the prevailing wage. Then by definition,

D =   L(l+V)   and S =       L(l+U)   ,   which   imply

If Vt and U            are fairly small, then a Taylors approximation gives

us

Unfortunately,       U.S. annual data for the vacancy rate do not exist for

our sample period. Pencavel [1974] suggests that the vacancy rate is a

stable function of the unemployment rate which can be approximated by

the hyperbolic relationship6


                         V = A/Ut     ,                               (2.7)

where A     is a parameter. Substituting into (2.6) gives us


                         n D —   Lo       S         —                 (2.8)
                                                        Ut

Eq. (2.8) gives the relationship between the official unemployment rate

and the excess demand for labor. It does not hold as an identity

because:    (a) U measures the "true" unemployment rate with error, and

(b) Eq. (2.7) holds only as an approximation.


                               3. Estimation Issues


     In this section we discuss the data and outline the estimation pro-

cedure. For purposes of reference we restate the model:

All the equations (except (3.3)) differ from their counterparts above by

the additidn of the error terms u1, ...,u5 , whose joint distribu-

tion is specified below. Appending an error term to the "mm                               condition"
is possible in theory, but it leads to a substantial increase in com-

putational costs.

     It is routine to establish that the system (minus eq. (3.3)) satis-

fies the necessary and sufficient conditions for identifiability in a

non—linear system. (See Fisher [1966].)

     Data. We describe here briefly the definitions of the variables.

The sources and methods of construction are detailed in Appendix 3.

     The data are annual observations on the U.S. economy for the years

1929 through 1979. Lt is total private hours worked per year expressed

in billions. The nominal gross hourly wage measured in dollars, W
is formed by dividing total civilian compensation by Lt          is gross

national product measured in billions of 1972 dollars.        is the con-

sumer price index, scaled so that the value in 1967 is
                                                                 Ht     ,   the
potential labor force measured in billions, is constructed by taking the

number of people between the ages of 16 and 65, and multiplying by the

average number of hours worked per person. The implicit assumption here

is that in any given year, those absent from the labor force can poten-

tially contribute an annual number of hours equal to the average of

those in the labor force.

     The marginal net wage W ,    is   the product of the gross wage

and a factor (i—er) , where       is the average marginal federal income

tax rate as computed by Barro and Sahasakul {i983]. Finally, U is

the official unemployment rate as a fraction of the civilian labor

force.

     Stochastic specification and estimation procedure. We assume that

the error terms u. (i1,...,5) are distributed normally with mean

zero and diagonal covariance matrix with element         (i1,...,5) on

the main diagonal. For our first set of estimates (Model 1), we assume

that E(ujtuT) =   0   for il,...,5 and all t not equal to t.           In
Model 2 this assumption is relaxed and the error terms in equations

(3.4) and (3.5) are permitted to have first order serial correlation.

Typically, serial correlation is ignored in disequilibrium models

because its presence in equations involving latent variables tends to

render the likelihood function intractable. (For special exceptions,

see Laffont and Monfort [1979], Quandt [1982]). For our case, serial
                                     —U—

correlation is introduced in the two equations not involving latent

variables, which makes the likelihood complicated but not intractable.

To our knowledge, such a generalization has not been attempted before.

     For all cases estimation is by maximum likelihood; the relevant

derivations arein Appendix 1.      The likelihood functions were maximized

numerically, using a variety of optimization algorithms9 and numeri-

cally evaluated derivatives were employed.


                                  4. Results


     Parameter Estimates. The maximum likelihood estimates of the

system (3.1) —   (3.6)   are presented in Table 1. Two models are

presented: Model 1 is exactly the model given by (3.1) —       (3.6);   Model 2

is the same with the further assumption that the    error   terms in (3.4)

and (3.5) are serially correlated according to first order Markov pro-

cesses with coefficients p4 and p3 respectively. The second column

for each model reports 't—values', i.e., the coefficients divided by

their asymptotic standard errors.

     Consider first the demand equation. There is very little variation

in the estimates across models. The value of            implies that the

demand elasticity with respect to the real wage is —0.64 to —0.67,

estimates within the range reported by Hamernsh [l984 in his survey of

labor demand equations. Similarly, the output elasticity of about 0.78

is quite reasonable. The coefficient on t , a3      ,   ranges from 0.0025
to 0.0033, suggesting a very mild positive trend in the demand for

labor. All three coefficients are statistically significant at conven—

tional levels.

        The supply parameters also show substantial stability across

models. The elasticity of labot supply with respect to the after—tax

wage,        ,   is   about 0.12. Analyses of time series data have con-

sistently fourd labor supply elasticities that are small in absolute

value. The elasticity of labor supply with respect to the potential

number of hours, 2 is 0.56, which is lower than one would expect.

Even given the fact that the demographic composition of the labor force

has changed considerably over time, one still expects that at least

roughly, a one percent increase in the potential work force should lead

to a one percent increase in labor supply. The reason for the observed

result probably lies in the strong collinearity between Ht and W

The simple correlation between the two variables is 0*998.10 An ordi-

nary least squares regression of hours worked on Ht alone gives a

coefficient on Rt of 0.923 with a standard error of 0.154.

        The parameters of the nominal wage adjustment equation are quite

sensitive to whether autocorrelation coefficients are being estimated or

not.11 The coefficient on lagged nominal wages,            ,   is   in the reaso-

nable range from 0.64 to 0.93. In both models, the coefficient of

        is negative, indicating that a higher official unemployment rate is

associated with lower nominal wages and conversely. However, with the

autocorrelation correction, the absolute value increases substantially

(from 0.45 to 1.66), and becomes more significant as well. The positive

coefficient 13 indicates that increases in prices become translated

into higher current nominal wage. This effect is again larger and more
                                         —13—


significant in Model 2, although it fails to be significant at the 0.05

level. The coefficients of the lagged price change,               , and   of the

twice lagged wage,      ,   are relatively small and insignificant in Model
1, and are both significant in Model 2 at conventional levels.

     In the price adjustment equation, lagged price has a coefficient of

1.03 in both models.'2 The values of                and     are positive in both

models (and both statistically significant in Model 2), which suggests

that lagged changes in nominal wages have a positive effect on this

period's prices.

     Finally, we turn to the vacancies—unemployment relationship. The

only parameter to be estimated here is X , whose value is 0.0014. The

positive value is expected: When unemployment increases, the vacancy

rate decreases. We discuss below whether the magnitude of the estimated

A is sensible.

     Comparing Models 1 and 2, it is clear that the standard asymptotic

likelihood ratio test rejects Model 1 in favor of Model 2.            Hence, in

discussing goodness of fit and other issues below, we concentrate on

Model 2.

     Variations on the Basic Model. To assess the robustness of our

results, a number of alternative models were estimated. Some of these

alternatives are obtained from Model 2 by omitting certain parameters,

others by adding some variables and parameters. The alternatives are as

follows:


    Model 3:     Omit                             from Model 2.

   Model 7:   Add to the supply equation in Model 2 the term
              3 UBl , where IThl is defined as 2..n [(Unemployment
              benefits)/CPI + 0.001]. This is responsive to the
              recent finding by Smyth [undated] that the magnitude of
              unemployment benefits has a negative impact on labor
              supply. The term 0.001 is arbitrary and is used to
              account for the fact that unemployment benefits were zero
              prior to 1935.

   Model 8:   Add to the supply equation in Model 2 the term 3 UB1
              when unemployment benefits are positive and otherwise add
              the term       , where      is an additional parameter.
              This is just a slightly different way of introducing the
              unemployment benefits variable.

   Model 9:   Add to the demand equation in Model 2 the term a4lnQi

    The likelihood values for the various models are reported in Table

Table 2. The conclusion is that Model 2 strongly rejects Models 3, 4

and 5; in turn, Models 6, 7 and 8 are unable to reject Model 2. In par-

ticular, the sign of         is positive in Model 7, negative in Model 8

and has a t—value of less than 0.61 in both cases. There appears to be

no support for the contention that unemployment benefits influence

supply negatively.

    With respect to models 9, and 10, it appears that on the basis

of standard chi—squared tests, the data are consistent with the presence

of lagged right hand side variables in the demand and supply equations.

Importantly, however, in none of the cases in Table 2 do the parameter

estimates differ substantially from those reported in Table 1.

Moreover, the qualitative behavior of the system does not change

substantially as a result of those minor parameter changes which do

occur. This is very comforting in light of the fact that highly non-

linear systems often generate unstable results. For the sake of simpli-

city, then, we will continue to base our discussion on the parameters in

Table 1.

     Another concern relating to the robustness of our estimates is the

possibility that they are driven by the Great Depression, which occurred

in the early years of the sample. To investigate this issue we re—

estimated the model starting with the year 1938 instead of 1929. The

parameters estimates for the 1939—1979 period (which are available upon

request to the authors) are substantially the same as those for the

1929—1979 period.

     Goodness of Fit. How well does Model 2 "explain" the time series

data? To explore this question, we computed for each period the model's

prediction for quantity of labor (LnL) ,   price level (nP) , nominal
wage (LnW) , and official unemployment rate (Us) •13 For every
                                       —16—


variable, we regressed the actual on the predicted value each period,

and then computed the R2 .      The results are recorded in Table 3.    For

all variables, the R2s are high. Of course, this observation does not

prove that the model is "right." After all, the current values of £nL

and         depend on their lagged values, and given the high amount of

autocorrelation in the data, any macroeconomic model with lagged depen-

dent variables is likely to perform well by this criterion. On the

other hand, £nL and           are not functions of their past values, yet
                                14
the fit is still pretty good.          In short, without making too much of

it, we find it comforting that the       R2s are reasonably high.

      Excess Demand for Labor and Unerployment Predictions. One of the

main reasons for estimating a disequilibrium model of the labor market

is to produce estimates of excess demand. The strength of excess demand

can be measured in several ways:

      (1)          — £nS).    The model produces estimates of the

logarithms of the notional demand and supply for labor each period.

Their difference, the percentage excess demand for labor, provides a

measure of unemployment that, in theory, is superior to the official

measure. For each period we computed the model's reduced form predic—
                                   —17—


tion of excess demand by substituting the appropriate values of the exo-

genous and lagged endogenous variables into equations (3.1) —     (3.6),
solving the entire system for the jointly dependent variables, and com-

puting £nD — LnS
                                     —
     (ii) Simulated Average (nDt                  In non—linear systems, the
                                         £nSt).
predictions obtained simply by substituting exogenous and pre—determined

variables may be misleading. Therefore, we performed some stochastic

siiailations. (See Portes, Quandt, Winter and Yeo [1983].) The      simula-
tion strategy was to solve for the jointly determined variables after we

added to each structural equation a normal deviate with the same

variance as was estimated for that equation. Repeating this procedure

100 times for each time period, we could obtain the average excess

demand for each period over the 100 replications.

     (iii) Pr(D > St L). In some sense, measures (i) and (ii) are

point estimates of excess demand. It may be of some interest to know

the probability that there was excess demand at all. We therefore com-

pute for each year the probability of excess demand (conditional on the

amount of labor.)16

     (iv) Simulated Fraction of Times that Dt > S. As in (ii) above,

we simulated the model 100 times each period, and found the fraction of

times that demand exceeded supply.

     In Table 4 we display the four measures for each year, as well as

the actual official unemployment rate. As expected, the values of all

the indicators in 1932—1940 indicate very substantial excess supplies.

More generally, all series tell a very similar story qualitatively.

Both   the estimated excess demand and the average excess demand in the

simulations are negative in all years except 1942—45, 1952—53, 1979,

(and 1978 just for (mD—inS)). The somewhat suspect notion of excess

demand in 1979 is confirmed by the simulation experiments, which indi-

cate that the probability of excess demand in 1979 is 0.51. A possible

additional reason for preferring model 10 of Table 2 is that its simu-

lated fraction of excess demands for that year drops to 0.07, a more

plausible magnitude.

       The probabilities of excess demand by the two measures show fairly

substantial agreement with the patterns of excess demand and fair

agreement with one another. On the whole, the two excess demand

measures and the simulated fraction of times that D > St agree better

with one another than any of these agrees with Pr{Dt >
                                                                     S   L}. A pro-
bable reason for this discrepancy is that the latter measure is con-

ditional   on the observed L whereas the former three are not.
       Dynamics and Stability. A question of some interest is whether
prices   and wages in the model are locally stable. Doubts about the sta-

bility of the system might be created by the observation that in the

price equation, the coefficient on lagged price,                ,    exceeds one.

(See Table 1.) Of course, with a system of difference equations greater

than order one, all parameters must be examined simultaneously.

       To begin, since equation (3.6) is nonlinear in U , we expand in

Taylor series about an arbitrary value U0 ,          yielding

                 £nD —
                    t

                                         U0

Solving for U ,     substituting        for Dt and S from the demand and

supply equations, and then substituting the resulting expression in
                                      —19—


equations (3.4) and (3.5), respectively, yields

Stability requires that the roots of the characteristic polynomial for

the system (4.1), (4.2) lie within the unit circle. As we show in

Appendix 2, this condition is satisfied for most plausible values of

U0
      Vacancies. Recall equation (2.7), the relationship between the

unobserved vacancy rate (Vt) ,    the   observed official unemployment rate

(TJ) , and   the parameter A : V A/Ut .         Another indicator of the

plausibility of our model is whether the magnitudes of the implied

values of the vacancy rate are reasonable. To investigate this issue,

note from equation (3.6) that vacancies are equal to excess demand plus

the official unemployment rate. We can therefore substitute our
                                                                   17
estimates of          St and     into (3.6) to calculate Vt             Given

the simple inverse relationship posited between            and V , we know
that V will be relatively low during the depression, high during

World War II, etc. What is reassuring about the results is that the

absolute magnitudes seem quite reasonable, something that is not

guaranteed by the mere fact that A > 0 .        Specifically,    from 1932 to
                                          —20—



1940 the estimated vacancy rate is less than 1 percent, during 1943—45
it rises as high as 20 percent and varies between 2 and 6 percent

thereafter.

      "Natural Rate of Unemployment". Another important feature of any

aggregative model of the labor market is its implications for the

"natural rate of unemployment" —— the official rate of unemployment that

is compatible with constant growth of prices and nominal wages. We im-

pose a constant rate of inflation by requiring P —1 W — W_1 =                         C


in equations (3.4) and (3.5), where G is a constant. Some tedious

but straightforward algebra reveals that the official rate of

unemployment compatible with these conditions, U ,                is   the positive

root of the equation AU +       BU    +   C   = 0, where


      A =
              1i5   +   ;        =
                                      121(11115)
      B =
              lB1)2l)       +        - z2 *2 ITh         + (3+y4—y1—215)JG/(1—11—y5)
              =    + (231)G11(l1)                 ;
                                                                            (4.3)
      C=X
and         and z2 are defined as in Appendix 1.

      In soxi macroeconomic models, U             is   required to be independent of

the value of G . That requirement is not imposed here, so we compute
     for several values of C . Substituting 1979 magnitudes for the
variables into (4.3) and values of G equal to 0.0, 0.03 and 0.05,
yields values of U of 7.6,           4.3, and    2.3   percent,   respectively. It
also turns out that the natural rate declines almost monotonically from

the 1930's to the present, suggesting that the unavoidable unemployment
                                              —21—


cost of price and wage stability is declining. We conjecture that this

result is driven by the very high rates of unemployment during the

1930's.

     A related question is what level of official unemployment would be

associated with "true" zero excess demand in the labor market ——

     —        = 0       To compute this figure, we simply note from equation
(D       S)         .


(3.6) that when Dt =           S   ,        — Ut     0 ,   and find the U   that

satisfies this relationship. According to this calculation, when offi-

cial unemployment is about 3.7 percent, the labor market is actually in

equilibrium.

         "Phillips Curve". What does our model imply about the short run

trade—off between official unemployment and wage inflation? Of course,

these two variables are jointly determined, so it does not make sense

simply to plug in the value of one and find the implied value of the

other. Instead, we consider how both would move under alternative

aggregate demand policies. Specifically, the exogenous values of the

model except output                    are set equal to their 1979 values. We then

substitute a number of hypothetical values for Q1979 into the system,

some higher than the actual value in 1979, and some lower. For every

value of Q1979 ,         the   model is solved to find the associated values of


U1979
            and (in W1979 —        in   W1978) .     The results represent an almost

linear relationship characterized by the equation (W/W) = — 2.06U + 0.19

To attain a nominal wage growth of only 3.7 percent could require an

official unemployment rate of 7.4 percent. Alternatively, if the offi-

cial unemployment rate were 3.4 percent, one would expect nominal wage
                                   —22—


growth of 12.0 percent. The (approximate) equations for the Phillips

curve for other years in the 1970's are very similar.

    The conceptual experiment behind these calculations concerns the

short run trade—off between U and (W/W). It is now widely agreed

that in the long run, the rate of unemployment is independent of the

inflation rate. Although we considered imposthg this constraint on the

model, we ultimately decided that a better strategy would be to let the

data determine the coefficients, and to refrain from giving these esti-

mates a long run interpretation.


                            5. Conclusions


     We have specified and estimated an aggregate disequilibrium model

of the labor market which allows determination of nominal wages, prices,

labor demand and supply, and the official unemployment rate. The para-

meter estimates are quite reasonable; the system provides a good fit to

the data; and its implications for the behavior of several important

variables are sensible. Of course, more remains to be done. Two of the

more vexing problems in the current model are the exogeneity of output

and the absence of any important role for expectations. Work is

currently under way to remedy these problems.

     This research also demonstrates that despite the fact that the com-

putational burden of estimating disequilibrium models is high, such

models can successfully be estimated at reasonable cost. This is true

even for systems that go beyond the "bare bones" approach of earlier

papers. We hope that this knowledge will encourage other investigators.

The   roots of (A.ll)         depend on the assumed value U0 about which the
expansion is taken. They were computed for U0 = 0.01,                                  ...,       0.20. For
all of these cases there is one positive root, one negative root and a

pair of complex conjugates. The maximal modulus declines monotonically

from 0.8797 for U0                 0.01 to 0.4585 for U0 = 0.20               .        The system is

thus locally stable for most plausible unemployment rates. It requires

an unemployment rate U0 = 0.002                     to produce a maximal modulus of

1.0028.

                            Appendix 3. Data




     This appendix describes the sources and methods of construction of

the variables in the model. Throughout, we abbreviate "National Income

and Product Accounts of the United States" as "N.I.P.A.".

     Lt total civilian hours worked per year expressed in billions, is

total hours minus hours worked in the military. For 1948—79, the

following procedure is used. To find hours worked in the military, corn—

pute the ratio of the number of military workers to the total number of

government workers (N.I.P.A. 1929—19 76, pp. 267—69 and N.I.P.A.

1976—1979, p. 55) and multiply by the number of hours worked by govern-

ment enployees (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976, p. 271 and N.I.P.A. 1976—1979,

p. 56). This gives hours worked in the military, which is then

subtracted from total hours (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976, p. 271, N.I.P.A.

1976—1979, p. 55).

     For 1929—42, comparable data do not exist. Using slightly dif-

ferent methods, Rosen and Quandt (1978) constructed a series on civilian

hours extending back to 1929. To splice the two series together, for

the period 1948 to 1973 we estimated a regression of the logarithm of

civilian hours as calculated above on a time trend and on the logarithm

of the Rosen—Quandt measure. The R2 was 0.992. We then substituted

values of the Rosen—Quandt measure for 1929 to 1947 into the regression

equation, and used the fitted values.

     W, gross hourly nominal wage measured in dollars, is the ratio of
                                        —30—


total civilian compensation to civilian hours worked. Total civilian

compensation in total compensation of employees (N.I.P.A. 1929—1976,

pp. 238—42 and N.I.P.A. 1976—1979, p. 52) minus compensation of military

employees (Historical Statistics of the United States, p. 235; N.I.P.A.

1929—1976, p. 240—42; N.I.P.A. 1976—1979, p. 52). The computation of

civilian hours worked is described above.

               gross national product in 1972 prices, is from the Economic

Report of the President 1982, p. 234, for 1941 through 1979. For pre-

vious years, the figures are from Historical Statistics of the United

States, p. 224. The figures in Historical Statistics were converted

from 1958 dollars to 1972 dollars by using the implicit GNP deflator.

              the consumer price index, is from Historical Statistics of the

United    States, pp. 210—11    for years prior to 1970; and from Economic

Report    of the President 1982, p. 291, for years after 1970.

              the potential labor force in billions of hours, is the number

of civilians between the ages of 16 and 65 multiplied by the average

number of hours worked per person. The number of civilians in this age

group is calculated by taking the total population between 16 and 65

(Economic Report of the President 1981, p. 263) and subtracting mem-

bership in      the armed forces (Ibid., p. 264).

       'See, for example, Lucas and Rapping [1970].

       2There have been a number of attempts along these lines. See,

e.g., Stiglitz [1984].

       3One reason for the difficulty in settling the question statisti-

cally is that sophisticated versions of either model may not be con-

veniently nested within each other. Rosen and Quandt [1978] examine

very simple equilibrium and disequilibrium models, and find that the

latter does a better job of explaining the data.

       4We also estimated some versions of (2.2) which include as a

variable the unemployment insurance replacement rate.                (See Smyth

[undated] .) As noted below, this had no effect on our substantive

results.

       5An alternative notion of disequilibrium has been suggested by Chow

[1977] and implemented by Sarantis [1981]. Here disequilibrium is

modelled not by a "mm condition', but as a situation in which both

prices and quantities adjust slowly each period to their long run values.

There is no point in engaging in a semantic discussion of which is the

 real" disequilibrium model. Suffice it to say that very different

maintained hypotheses are used.

       6We experimented with the more general formulation

Vt =   X2I(U_X,) +     X3   ,   and found that it did not significantly increase

the explanatory power of the model.

     7hajivassiliou [1983, p. 20] argues that in the demand for labor

equation, the wage should be deflated by the producers' price index.

However, he finds that the choice has virtually no effect on the para-

meter estimates.
     8
         We also examined a specification in which       was simply the

number of people between the ages of 16 and 65; no major differences

resul ted.

     9Algorithms DFP, GRADX and PATERN in the optimization package

GQOPT3 were employed.

    10However, caution must be exercised, because the diagnosis and con-

sequences of multicollinearity in nonlinear models are not obvious.

    1Note that when      u3t is serially correlated, the constant term in

the differenced form of the equation is y0(l—p3) =      0.028.
    l2The fact that        > 1 does not necessarily imply that the model

is unstable. To determine this, the whole system must be analyzed, as

is done below.

    13This was done by substituting the appropriate values of the

exogenous and predetermined variables into (3.1) —      (3.6),   and solving

for the endogenous variables. The value of Lt was the minimum of the

S and Dt so generated. To solve for U we:               (i) solve for Dt, S,

W, P in terms of Ut;          (ii) substitute the results for Dt and St

in the unemployment vacancies relation, and then (iii) solve the

resulting quadratic for TJ.

           simple second order autoregression explains U slightly worse

than the disequilibrium model (R2 =     0.8996),   while a second order
                                   —35—


autoregression explains Lt slightly better       (R2 = 0.9528).

   150ne may also compute E(ZnDt — ZnS         £r1L) .    This is likely to

be more efficient than using simply (2..nDt — £.n S) (Goldfeld and

Quandt (1981)), but is somewhat complicated to compute in the present

model and will not be pursued here.

                           is computed as the ratio G4t cs1(2t G3t +
    16p   tD > St I   L)
            where the G's are defined in Appendix 1. One can also com-
G4t Gs) ,
pute unconditional probability that        exceeds S. This can be

obtained from the reduced form as follows. Let            =
                                                              Hi +
                  where                depend only on parameters and
S H2 + v2 ,                Hit , H2t

                                are reduced form errors. Then the
coefficients and v1 '      v2
required probability is PrfHit — H2t > v2 —      v1t}     which can be com-

puted once the estimated parameter values are substituted. However, in

some applications these probabilities have been found to be very close

to the conditional probabilities. (See Burkett [1981].)
    1 When we substitute actual rather than estimated values of the


official unemployment rate, qualitatively similar results emerge.
    l8Note that under this assumption, it follows from equation (2.4)

that U will generally depend on both the level of the real wage and

the rate of inflation. However, if         +    = 1   ,   then U depends

only on G , a much more plausible result. Note from Table 1 that the

sum does appear to be quite close to unity. Indeed, when we imposed the

constraint 11 + '(5    1 in model 2, the loglikelihood was 455.25, indi-

cating that the data are compatible with the constraint.
