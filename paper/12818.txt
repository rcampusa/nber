                                            ABSTRACT

Traditional explanations for indirect trade through an entrepot have focused on savings in transport
costs and on the role of specialized agents in processing and distribution. We provide an alternative
perspective based on the possibility that entrepots may facilitate tariff evasion. Using data on direct
exports to mainland China and indirect exports via Hong Kong SAR, we find that the indirect export
rate rises with the Chinese tariff rate, even though there is no legal tax advantage to sending goods
via Hong Kong SAR. We undertake a number of extensions to rule out plausible alternative hypotheses
based on existing explanations for entrepot trade.

1. Introduction


       Indirect trade through an entrepôt is a common phenomenon in world commerce. For
example, for every $100 that the United States exports to mainland China, approximately $23 goes
through Hong Kong SAR. Globally, indirect trade as a share of the total trade is estimated to be
around 17 percent (Andriamananjara, Arce, and Ferrantino, 2004). There are thirty-some countries
that are involved in a significant amount of indirect trade. Macao, Cyprus, Fiji, Senegal, Jordan,
Armenia, Seychelles, Honduras, Benin, Montserrat, St. Lucia, and Singapore are some of the other
prominent entrepôts through which indirect trade takes place.
       Explanations in the literature for this high volume of indirect trade have focused on the
presence of specialized agents that match buyers and sellers across markets (Feenstra and Hanson,
2004) and the economization of transport costs, which has a similar rationale to the hub-and-spoke
pattern in airline traffic (Andriamananjara, Arce, and Ferrantino, 2004). These factors are
undoubtedly responsible at least in part for the high rates of indirect trade. However, we propose
an alternative, previously undocumented explanation in this paper: the use of entrepôt economies
to facilitate tariff evasion. As in the traditional argument for indirect trade, the evasion-based
explanation also posits a role for specialized agents that are better positioned to transport goods to
their final destinations: In our explanation, the agents’ advantage is in transporting goods without
paying the required tariffs. We suspect that the evasion-motivated indirect trade is likely to be
particularly important for exports to countries with high tariffs and weak public governance.
       This explanation has been made casually in the policy arena; most recently, the UNCTAD
Trade and Development Report (2005) speculates that tariff evasion may be responsible for the
rise in entrepôt trade. Further, there are also anecdotal accounts of this role of trade intermediaries.
For example, a report from the United States Department of Agriculture, describes the “unofficial
channels” that are used to export food products to China: “Using unofficial channels, to bring in a
40 foot container of imported fresh fruit from Hong Kong to one of the cities in the Pearl River
Delta costs approximately $4,000 to $6,000…This amount is usually much less than the price paid
when using official channels.” (USDA, 1997). However, there exists no systematic evidence on
the use of entrepôt trade for tariff evasion purposes.
       We provide a quantitative examination of this hypothesis in the context of the Hong Kong
SAR, the world’s largest entrepôt economy, where trade was 259 percent of GDP in 1998
                                                            3

(Feenstra and Hanson, 2004), and a common stopping point for goods both entering and leaving
from mainland China. Since Hong Kong is legally a separate customs area, China applied exactly
the same tariff schedule on imports from Hong Kong as those from any other economy in the
world during our sample period. In other words, there is no legal tax advantage of sending goods to
China via Hong Kong.1
         Over the last ten years, Chinese tariff rates have been declining steadily, from an average
rate of 23.6 percent in 1996 to 15.8 percent by 2001. During the same period, the average fraction
of the rest of the world’s exports to China that goes through Hong Kong SAR has also been on the
decline, from 26 percent in 1996 to 20 percent in 2001 (see Table 1 for details). These aggregated
statistics are consistent with the tariff evasion explanation for the indirect trade, though many other
explanations are also consistent with this aggregate picture.
         This paper builds a case for the evasion hypothesis using disaggregated data on indirect
exports to China via Hong Kong SAR. Tariff evasion, by its very nature, is not directly observable.
We are thus required to take an indirect approach in testing any hypothesis related to evasion. The
methodology we use in this paper is straightforward. On a product by product basis, we compute
indirect trade intensity – the ratio of indirect exports to China going through Hong Kong SAR to
total exports to China – and examine if it has any systematic relationship with product-level tariff
rates. The benefit of indirect trade for the purposes of evading tariffs is increasing in the value of
tariffs evaded, and hence the tariff rate2. As there is no preferential tariff treatment for indirect
trade via Hong Kong SAR (or elsewhere), this forms the basis for our test of our ‘outsourcing
evasion’ hypothesis. With disaggregated data (at HS 6-digit level) for the years 1996-2001, we
find a clear positive association between tariff rate and intensity of indirect trade. This is consistent
with the hypothesis that part of the role of the middlemen is to help evade tariff payments.
         The use of indirect trade may be correlated with a good’s need to be intermediated (for
example, products with lower demand elasticities may be more likely to be transshipped). This is
problematic if the latter is correlated with the tariff structure, leading to a spurious correlation
between indirect trade intensity and tariff level. We therefore extend the analysis by adding 6-digit
HS fixed effects and also by differencing the data. This effectively deals with any characteristics

1
  Since January 1, 2004 (outside our sample), China has reduced tariff rates to zero on many direct imports from Hong
Kong. MFN rates continue to apply to indirect imports from other countries passing through Hong Kong.
2
  If we assume that the potential punishment does not increase linearly (see, for example, Slemrod and Yitzhaki, 2002),
we expect the rate of transshipping (relative to direct shipment) to be increasing in the tariff rate – there is a greater
incentive to evade tariffs on high tariff goods.
                                                    4

of imports that are not time-varying. We find that the results remain statistically significant at the
one percent level, though the point estimates are somewhat reduced.
        We provide several additional robustness tests of our results. First, we look at sectors for
which most importers receive legal tariff exemptions. Since there is little evasion-related
motivation reason to undertake indirect trade in such industries, we do not expect to observe any
correlation between tariffs and indirect export intensity; this is borne out by the data, as we do not
find any tariff-indirect trade correlation for this set of products in our data.
        We provide two additional tests that specifically address alternative explanations based on
the two traditional rationales for indirect trade. To examine whether specialized knowledge may
be responsible for our results, we examine trade in homogeneous and differentiated products
separately based on the Rauch (1999) classification. This is based on the idea that there may be
economic rationales, unrelated to evasion, for trade in differentiated products to go through an
entrepôt , as a middleman’s specialized knowledge on a differentiated product could help to
mediate the trade. Indeed, Feenstra and Hanson (2004) suggest that Hong Kong may play an
important intermediary role for differentiated products, since such products may require greater
quality sorting. In contrast, there may be less specialized product-specific knowledge involved for
trade in homogenous products. We find a positive correlation between tariff rate and indirect trade
intensity for both homogenous and differentiated products. This further bolsters our interpretation
that tariff evasion is a significant motivation for the observed indirect trade. Second, to assess the
credibility of explanations based on transport costs, we include a control for total trade volume (a
loose proxy for shipment size). This also does not affect our basic results.
        We provide an illustrative calculation to get a sense of quantitative importance of evasion-
induced indirect trade. According to one specification that we present below, a ten percent increase
in tariff rate would lead to an increase in the indirect trade rate by 2.9 percentage points. Thus, an
increase in the tariff rate from zero to 19 percent (the average statutory tariff rate in China in 2001)
would lead to an indirect export rate of about 5.5 percent, suggesting that about a quarter of the
indirect exports through Hong Kong may be accounted for by evasion motivations.
        It is important to note that the paper does not call into question the integrity of the Hong
Kong customs nor the reliability of Hong Kong statistics. In fact, the paper relies on the accuracy
of the Hong Kong customs’ statistics to make the analysis meaningful.
                                                   5

       In addition to bringing new insight to the literature on indirect trade, we also contribute to
the growing empirical literature on tax evasion and smuggling. Relevant theoretic work and earlier
empirical research are discussed in Slemrod and Yitzhaki (2000). A recent paper by Fisman and
Wei (2004) provided an estimate of the responsiveness of tax evasion at the Chinese borders to
Chinese tariff rates. The current paper differs from Fisman and Wei (2004) in several important
ways. Fist, while the earlier paper addresses a public finance question- the elasticity of evasion to
tax rates, the current paper investigates a trade question – whether the prevalent entrepôt trade
phenomenon in the world commerce could be explained by tariff evasion. Second, the earlier paper
does not automatically imply the result in this paper: It is logically possible that entrepôt trade is
unrelated to evasion even if there is evasion at the Chinese border. The earlier paper, however, is a
necessary condition: the Chinese border has to be corruptible for Hong Kong to serve as an
intermediate step to evade tariffs.
       The rest of this paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 provides a conceptual framework.
Section 3 describes the datasets brought together for this research. Section 4 presents our
estimation strategy and results. Section 5 concludes.


2. Empirical Framework


       For expositional purposes, we assume in this section that tariffs may only be evaded by
routing goods through Hong Kong and that traders are risk-neutral. For simplicity, we assume
every trader exports a fixed amount, V. We describe the cost-benefit trade-off associated with
evasion for a typical trader k in industry i as being given by:


Benefitik = τiV
Costik = C + γ τiV + ηik


       Here, τi is the tariff rate for industry i. The cost includes a fixed, a variable and a random
component: C is the fixed cost; γ < 1 describes the variable cost; ηik represents the random
component, which is realized before the trade makes the decision. A representative trader (of good
i) would choose to evade if and only if the benefit of doing so exceeds the cost, or
                                                          6

ηik ≤ (1-γ) τiV - C


        Assuming that ηik is i.i.d. across all traders and has a cumulative distribution function F,
then the fraction of exports in industry i that may be re-routed to Hong Kong to evade tariffs is
given by:


    (1) (Indirect Export Rate)i = F( (1-γ) τiV - C )


        If we further assume that F has a uniform distribution, we may express this as a linear
regression:


    (2) (Indirect Export Rate)i = α + β*τi + εi, where β > 0


Intuitively, if it is relatively inexpensive to evade tariffs by using Hong Kong as an entrepôt, a
larger fraction of trade will be routed through Hong Kong if the tariff rate is higher.3
        If the random cost, ηik, does not follow a uniform distribution, or if the cost of evasion is
non-linear in the tariff rate, then the indirect trade rate may be a non-linear function of the tariff
rate.


3. Data


        Three pieces of data are crucial for our empirical tests: (a) Chinese tariffs, (b) direct exports
to China at a product level, and (c) indirect exports to China via Hong Kong at a product level.4
        The data on Chinese tariffs are taken from the World Bank's World Integrated Trade
Solution (WITS) database, derived from the UNCTAD TRAINS (Trade Analysis and Information
System) database, which gives tariff rates at the 8-digit HS level. Since our import/export data are

3
  This paper has not formally examined the issue of possible endogeneity of the tariff rate. If the government were to
set the tariff rates with revenue maximization in mind, it may set relatively high rates on products that are somehow
physically more difficult to evade tariff, then the true effect of tariff on indirect trade would be even bigger than
documented here.
4
  It is these data requirements that preclude the expansion of our analyses to a broader set of countries. First, the
UNCTAD TRAINS database described below has significant gaps for many countries. Second, we require data on re-
exports as reported by the entrepôt country itself, since data on re-exports generally do not list the intermediate
country.
                                                            7

at the 6-digit level, we need to aggregate tariff rates up to the 6-digit level. As there is relatively
little variation in tax rates at the 8-digit level within a 6-digit category, we are able to restrict
ourselves to the sample for which there are uniform rates at this level of aggregation.
         The earliest year for which we have detailed data on tariffs is 1996, and our data reflect
year-end tariff rates. Since the import and export data are cumulated for the entire year, matching
imports with the appropriate tax rates is complicated by mid-year changes in the tariff structure.
There were no tariff changes in 1996. In 1997, tariffs were changed on October 1st for this year,
we take a weighted average of year-end 1996 and 1997 tariffs as our measure of the 1997 tariff
rate. Since the tariff changes of 1998-2001 were all implemented on January 1, the tariff rate is
uniform throughout those years. We define Tariffit as the tariff rate on incoming goods in industry
i in year t.
         To calculate our indirect export rate, we require countries’ own reports of direct exports to
China, as well as Hong Kong’s reports of indirect exports. The direct export data come from
WITS, which in turn gets its export statistics from the United Nations' Comtrade database. These
data are collected by the United Nations Statistical Division from individual countries' trade
records, and include information on imports and exports for each country, recorded according to
the 6-digit Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS). For most of our
regressions, we focus on countries where export data are available for the entire period, and further
omit Africa and the Middle East because of very low export rates. This yields a final set of the 29
countries listed in appendix Table A1. We define Direct_exportsict as the value in US dollars of
direct exports in industry i from country c to China in year t.
         Our indirect export data come from Smartal Solutions, the official provider of Hong Kong
export statistics. These data provide Hong Kong’s reported indirect exports to China, by country
of origin, at the 6-digit HS level for 1996-2001. Since tariff rates vary only at the industry-year
level, we generate an aggregate indirect export rate, derived by summing up exports over all
countries for a given industry-year:5


Indirect_export_rateit =                    Σc Indirect_exportsict
                                Σ(Indirect_exports
                                 c                ict+ Direct_Exportsict)


5
  This is to avoid complications associated with clustering of standard errors across two types of groups, as suggested
by Bertrand, et al (2004). We obtain virtually identical results if the regressions are done at the exporter-year-product
level of aggregation.
                                                               8



where Indirect_exportsict are indirect exports from country c in industry i and year t.
           Our robustness checks will require several additional datasets; for clarity of presentation,
we will describe these additional data items when we discuss these tests.
           In the first two columns of Table 1 we list the Hong Kong indirect export rates and tariff
rates, by year, for 1996-2001. Note that there is a high rate of indirect exports on average: 22
percent for the full sample. The average tariff rate, while 18 percent for the full sample, declined
throughout the sample period, from approximately 23 percent in 1996 to 15 percent in 2001.
           In Figure 1A we show the basic relationship between tariffs and indirect export rates for
1998, where the indirect export rate shown is the average for each integer tariff rate, conditional on
having at least 10 observations per tariff rate. The correlation is 0.53, and the graph shows this
positive correlation. In Figure 1B, we show the relation between the change in tariff rate during
1996-2001 and the change in indirect export rate over the same period. We see a similar pattern in
this differenced relation – industries with the largest tariff declines also experienced the largest
drops in indirect export rate. We now turn to the results section to examine these relations in a
regression framework.


4. Results


Benchmark Estimate
       Our basic specification is based on equation (2) above, with a year fixed effect, δt, included:


       (3) Indirect_export_rateit = α + β*Tariffit + δt + εit


The results for specification (3) appear in Table 2. In column (1) we present the basic
specification (with year fixed effects, but no industry fixed effects), and find a point estimate on
Tariff of approximately 0.25. In specification (2), we add industry-year fixed effects, with the
industry defined at the 3-digit HS level.6 The slope estimate is now 0.29. This implies that a one
percentage point increase in the tariff rate leads to a 0.29 percentage point increase in the indirect
export rate. We regard this as our benchmark estimate.

6
    Similar results are obtained with 2- or 4-digit HS level industry-year fixed effects.
                                                        9

          In terms of the economic significance of this effect, an increase in the tariff rate from zero
to 19 percent (the mean tariff rate in the entire sample as reported in Table 1) leads to an increase
in the indirect export rate by 19*0.29 = 5.5 percent, all else equal. The average indirect export rate
in our sample is 0.23 (Table 1). Evasion-motivated entrepôt trade thus explains almost a quarter of
total indirect trade.


Six-digit fixed effects and long differencing
          As a robustness check, we also define an industry fixed effect at the 6-digit level (the most
disaggregated level for this data set), a total of approximately 3600 fixed effects. This absorbs all
between product variation in tariffs, so that any relation between tariffs and indirect export rates is
being identified entirely from within-good variation in tariffs. Further, given the fact that tariffs
were sometimes changed mid-year, generating identification from the year-to-year correlation
between tariffs and indirect export rates may add a lot of noise. The result is reported in Column 3
of Table 2. The point estimate on tariffs declines to 0.11, but is still significant at the one percent
level..
          Finally, in column (4), we consider a differenced version of specification (2), given by:


    (4) (Indirect_export_ratei2001 – Indirect_export_ratei1996) = α + β*(Tariffi2001 – Tariffi1996) + δt + εit


We emphasize that, relative to the fixed-effects approach, this long-differenced approach is less
likely to be affected by noise resulting from the timing of tariffs and sluggish responses to tariff
changes, while still absorbing all between industry variation. The point estimate is 0.17, and is
statistically significantly different zero at the one percent level.


Non-linear effects
          As noted in Section 2 above, either a non-linear cost of evasion or a non-uniform
distribution of firms’ costs of evasion will generate a non-linear relationship between tax rates and
the extent of indirect trade through Hong Kong. In Table 2, column (5) we include a quadratic
term, Tariff 2, that allows for a non-linear relationship between tariffs and indirect trade. We find
                                                             10

that Tariff 2 is highly significant and negative, implying a diminishing effect of increasing tariffs
on indirect trade.7


Aggregation
         Unfortunately, because of noise the fit of the regressions may be considered poor. A
common method of dealing with noisy data is aggregation. We follow this approach, using as the
outcome variable the mean value of the indirect trade rate for each tax rate. There are 53 distinct
tax rates, thereby yielding a total of 53 observations per year. The result is reported in column (1)
of Table 3, which shows that the positive relationship between tariff level and indirect export rate
remains, with an increase in the adjusted R2 to 0.26. In column (2), we report regression results
where observations are weighted by the number of observations per tax bracket. As a final
robustness check, in columns (3) and (4), we use the median (rather than mean) indirect export rate
for each tariff rate as the dependent variable. These additional regressions generate results that are
very similar to those reported in column 1 of Table 3.


Omitted product characteristics
         One possible concern with the above results is that there may be a correlation between the
goods for which middlemen have a comparative advantage in legal intermediation and the Chinese
government’s choice of tariff structure. It is not immediately clear whether this would lead to an
overestimate or underestimate of the effect – traditional explanations of optimal tax setting focus
on demand elasticities, and it is not obvious that goods routed through Hong Kong would
necessarily be low demand elasticity goods. Further, one might consider demand elasticities as
part of the product fixed effects. Our results above are robust to the inclusion of 6-digit fixed
effects and to differencing, which implies that the results may be identified from time variation in
tariff rates; this allows us to effectively net out any product characteristics that are not time-
varying.



7
  We obtain qualitatively very similar results using a spline regression by quartiles. Aside from a non-linear cost
function of evasion, and a non-uniform distribution of the evasion cost across firms, our finding can also be explained
by the possibility that at the higher end of the tariff schedule, a greater fraction of tariff evasion may take the form of
outright smuggling, which is not recorded in our data. This could generate the pattern that legally recorded indirect
trade as a share of total trade does not rise as fast as the tariff rate at very high tariff rates. We thank Martin Feldstein
for suggesting this possibility.
                                                             11

           We present a number of additional robustness checks below that try to further rule out the
primary alternative explanations.


Legal exemptions of tariffs
           We consider the fraction of goods that enter China with tariff exemptions. One explanation
for the observed relationship between tariffs and indirect export rates that does not involve any
illicit behavior is that it is easier to obtain tariff exemptions by routing goods through Hong Kong,
and the incentive to obtain exemptions is increasing in the tariff rate. This would then be a case of
using Hong Kong middlemen to acquire legal tariff avoidance rather than illegal tariff evasion.
However, if this were the case, then we would expect to see very little effect of the tariff rate on
the indirect export rate for industries where very few exemptions are allowed. We use imports
broken down by exemption classification taken from Chinese Customs Statistics 1998 (Economic
Information Agency, 2001).8 These data are at the 8-digit HS level, which we aggregate to the 6-
digit level; we then calculate a measure of exemption intensity given by the ratio of the value of
imports that enter China tariff-free to the total value of imports for each 6-digit category
(Exemption).
           In the first column of Table 4 we report a specification that includes the interaction of
Exemption and Tariff. The coefficient on the interaction term is negative and significant at the 5
percent level, implying a lower sensitivity of indirect trade to tariff rates for high exemption
industries.
           As an alternative, we examine a subset of the sample with relatively few legal exemptions
and another subset with a lot of legal exemptions. Specifically, regressions in columns (2) and (3)
correspond to the sample of products below the 10th percentile of exemption ratio (less than 16%)
and above the 90th percentile (greater than or equal to 99.6%) respectively.9 It is clear from these
results that industries with low exemption rates are driving our results: Tariff is positive and highly
significant for the sample of products below the 10th percentile of exemption ratio, while the
coefficient on Tariff is negative and insignificant for products above the 90th percentile.

    Unfortunately, due to the very high cost of obtaining these data, we have purchased only a single year of data.

    We obtain very similar results using the 5th and 95th percentiles as cutoffs.

Differentiated versus homogeneous products
           Finally, we run tests that try to directly address specific alternative explanations based on
the two traditional rationales for entrepôt trade. First, as a test of the imperfect information/
quality sorting explanation, we examine whether there is a differential correlation between tariffs
and indirect trade rates for differentiated versus non-differentiated products, as classified by Rauch
(1999). Feenstra and Hanson (2004) suggest that Hong Kong may play an important intermediary
role for differentiated products, since such products may require quality sorting. This may be of
concern if differentiated products have higher tariff rates. Note that our fixed effects and
differenced models deal with this to a large extent, since product differentiation is not time-
varying. To bolster our case, we further examine whether the basic cross-sectional correlation
differs according to whether the incoming good is differentiated.
           Rauch’s classification is at the 4-digit SITC level, which we match based on the
concordance in Feenstra (1996);10 we also cluster at the 4-digit SITC level to account for the
coarser industry classification. In Table 5 we present results with the sample split by Rauch’s
classification. It turns out that the positive correlation holds for both differentiated and non-
differentiated products11. The point estimate of the slope is somewhat smaller for the homogenous
products, consistent with the view that some of the indirect trade for differentiated products are not
related to tariff evasion. However, if we pool the sample and include an interaction between tariff
rates and a dummy variable for differentiated products, this interaction term is not significant.


Adding trade volume
           Our results are unlikely explained by a motivation to save on transport costs. To see this,
we note that such an explanation would require a number of steps. First, shipment size, and hence
the benefits from transshipment, is positively correlated with the indirect trade ratio. Second, in
order to account for the results that we report, there must be correlation between tariff rates and
shipment size. One possible channel is that larger shipments are correlated with higher overall
rates of trade, which in turn may be correlated with tariffs due to political economy considerations.
This explanation strikes us as requiring a big stretch of imagination. Still, to try to control for this
possibility, we include the fraction of the total value of trade in year y accounted for by industry i

     The concordance is available at http://data.econ.ucdavis.edu/international/usixd/wp5515d.html.
11
     The sample is smaller because the classifications for some products are ambiguous and therefore excluded.

(FRACTION) in column 4 of Table 5. Trade volume is indeed correlated with the indirect trade
ratio: the coefficient FRACTION is significant at the one percent level. However, the coefficient
on tariff rates is completely unchanged; this is not surprising, since trade volume is uncorrelated
with tariff rates.


5. Conclusion


        This paper documents that tariff evasion is an important motivation for the widely observed
phenomenon of indirect trade in world commerce by studying indirect exports to China via Hong
Kong. To build a case for this interpretation, the paper computes a measure of indirect trade
intensity product by product (at the HS 6-digit level) – the ratio of indirect trade to total trade – and
examines whether it is systematically related to product-level tariff rates. We find clear evidence of
a positive, statistically significant relationship, both in levels and differences.
        A number of robustness checks and extensions of the basic analysis help to further bolster
our interpretation. For example, were it not for tariff evasion, specialized knowledge by
middlemen should be much less valuable for homogenous than for differentiated products. Yet we
find a similar positive correlation between indirect trade and tariff rates for the two groups of
products. Also, for the subset of products for which tariff exemptions are widely granted (and
therefore illegal tariff evasion at the border is less profitable), there is no correlation between tariff
and indirect trade intensity.
        Our paper makes both conceptual and methodological contributions. We highlight the
possibility that the desire to circumvent high barriers to cross-border commerce can generate a role
for middlemen in international trade. Our approach could be applied to a variety of other contexts.
While data on direct trade and tariffs are available for many countries, good-quality data on
disaggregated indirect trade are hard to come by. Replicating the specification in this paper for
other countries when relevant data become available is interesting extension for future work. This
would allow for an evaluation of whether the evasion-motivated indirect trade that we document
here is particularly prevalent in high-tariff, weak-governance economies. In addition, it may
ultimately be possible to evaluate, for example, the extent to which different source countries are
prone to tariff evasion, by comparing how the relationship between tariffs and indirect trade varies
across exporting countries. We leave these topics for future research.
