    Though the male—female earnings gap hae been declining in recent

yeare, it remains quite substantial. Because regressions taking into

account a wide vsriety of variables have failed to explain all of this

gap, women's lower earnings are often in part ascribed to discrimins—

tion. Alternatively, it hss been suggested that because women do not

intend to work continuously, they choose jobs requiring smaller invest-

ments in human capitsl, and hence with flatter lifetime earnings pro—

files. Previous research on this issue has not been conclusive, in

part because it has generally been based on data describing outcomes,

when evidence on plans and expectations is needed. A unique data set

on college business school seniors, collected for this purpose,

remedies this deficiency.

    This psper begins with s brief review of explanations of the earn-

ings gsp. The next section describes the data collection and the

informstion obtainsd for this study, followed by sn examination of

some of the interesting charsctsristics of the men and women in this

sample. Finally, the evidence is snalyzed and discussed and some

conclusions snd policy recommendations are offered.


             Explanations of the Male—Female Earnings Cap

    The humsn capital explanation for the earnings gap emphasizes

women's weaker labor force sttschment aa the major reason why they

earn less thsn men (e.g. ,   Mincer   and Polachek, 1974; Polachek, 1975,
1981).1 Its basic argument is as follows: It is assumed that women,

unlike men, tend to work for pay intermittently because of household

responsibilities, and the extent to which this is the case ia largely
                                 —2—


exogenously determined.2 Hence, aseuming that women and men have the

same characteristics, each will, nonetheless, chooae different joba

requiting differeni human capital inveatmenta. It ia expected that

the joba selected by women will offer lower retutna to experience, but

also catty amaller penalties for labor force interruptiona. Because

women intend to apend aubatantial amounta of time out of the labor

market, they are willing to accept lower rewarda for experience in

return for lower depreciation ratea during perioda of work interrup-

tion. Conaequently, the model predicta that women'a earninga profiles

will be flatter than those of men. Thus, all else equal, women are

expected to have higher starting salaries, but after some minimal

time, earnings will be higher for males thsn for females with the same

level of experience.3 While the notion of "job" in this model is

often equated with "occupation," it could equally well be applied to

career trajectories within occupations.

    Additionally, it is often argued thst women are at s dissdvsntsge

in career advancement because they do not have the same priorities.

Due to the traditional division of labor in the family, women are

believed to seek jobs requiring less effort (Becker, l98S) and are

thought to be less concerned with professional progress and intellec-

tual challenges, more with comfort, flexible hours and a pleasant work

environment (e.g. , Applebsum and Koppel, 1978; Dsymont and Andriseni,

1988; Filer, 1985). These supply—side arguments complement the human

capital model presented above.

    A number of critics have taken issue with this model (e.g.

Corcorsn, Duncan end Ponzs, 1984; England, 1982), mainly on the ground
                                 —3—


that rates of depreciation and wage growth for women are similar in

male and female occupations, and that women with more continuous labor

force attachment do not tend to choose different jobs than other

women. Such findings raiee serious doubts about an explanation of

the earnings gap which relies so heavily on these differences in

depreciation of wage rates during work interruptions and related

differences in rewards for experience.5 At the same time, this evi-

dence is not conclusive.

    As Groneu (1988, p. 280) points out, "Economic theory discusses

the effect of planned (or future) csreer interruptions on current

wages. Most empirical studies, however, examine the effect of past

interruptions."6 Clearly, these are frequently not the same.7 Hence

some women are likely to end up in jobs ill—suited to maximizing their

lifetime earnings, thus reducing the chances of finding the rela-

tionship predicted by the human capital model. These difficulties can

be avoided by examining planned labor force participstion end antici-

pated earnings. For it is expectations, whether or not they prove to

be correct, that determine a person's choices. In order to obtain

this information we conducted a survey of a group of young people who

are likely to be very career oriented and hence have probably given

more thought to job—related issues than most of their contemporaries.

    The chief alternative explanation of women's lower earnings is

that they sre discriminated against (Becker, 1957). We offer no

direct evidence on this point. However, lower anticipated earnings

for equally qualified women, regardless of their csuse, are likely to

introduce feedback effects (e.g., Blau and Ferber, 1986; Weiss and
                                 —4—


Gronau, 1981). Thus women may plan to spend less time in the labor

market, at least in part, because they expect lower rewards. This in

turn further depresses their earnings. Our data enable us ro test

this hypothesis by examining the effect of expected earnings on labor

force participation plans.


                Data Collection and Sample Description

    Questionnaires were sent to all 722 members of the 1987—88 senior

class in the College of Commerce and Buaineaa Administration (CBA) of

the Univeraity of Illinois, Urbana—Champaign. This group is par-

ticularly suitable for our purposes. Though they are not representa-

tive of the entire population, or even of all college atudenrs, the

women in our sample are of interest because they are likely to be

representative of trends among recent cohorts who are spending

increasingly more time in the labor market. Further, this is even

more true of the college educated who are also increasingly moving

into previoualy male occupations. Another major advantage of this

sample is that we have excellent controls for quality and type of edu-

cation.

    After two follow—up waves, responaea were received from 227 of the

389 women, and 161 of the 333 men, not all of them entirely complete.
                                                             8
Background information for the sample is shown in Table 1.       Though

the response rate was higher for women than for men, 58 percent as

compared to 48 percent, for both sexes the respondents are reasonably

representative of the whole class with respect to distribution by

department and grade point average (CPA) (see Table A—l).
                                    —5—


    Average gradea are virtually the same for male and female respon-

dents. There is, however, s substantial difference in their repre-

sentation by department. Students in the College of Business Admin—

istrstion may major in Accountancy, Business Administration, Finance,

or Economics. The vast majority opt for the first three.9 Among

thoee, men are considerably lees likely to be in Business A.dminiatra—

tion than women while the oppoaite is true of Finance and, to a leaser

extent, Accountancy. The family backgrounda of the male and female

studenta are in eome respects quite similar. The parente of both

groupa are diaproportionately in executive and profeaaional occupa-

tions. However, women atudents are more likely than men to have

mothers who are currently executives and profeaaionala, and less

likely to have mothera who are currently full—time homemakers. Their

mothers had also spent a somewhat higher proportion of prior years in

the labor force. This auggeeta that employed mothers, and especially

those who pursue careers, provide the kind of role model that motiva-

tes daughtera to go to college and choose career—oriented majors.

    With respect to their own family plans, the vast majority of men

and women plan to marry, however men intended to have somewhat more

children than women. The expected number of children for young women

in this sample (2.4) is quite similar to that reported by the Bureau

of the Census (1988) for recent college graduates (2.2) and young

managers and professionals (2.1).

    This information provides some insights about the sample we are

dealing with. The remainder of the questionnaire focuses on career

plans and expectations. Table 2 shows some of the results. First, as
is assumed by proponents of the human capital explanation, men plan to

work more years full—time and fewer years part—time, and are less

likely to anticipate dropping out of the labor force before retire—

menr, though these differences sre not as grear as has actually been

the case, even in relatively recent years. According to the Bureau of

the Census (1987) employed women college graduates between ages 45 and

64 had spent, on average, 23 percent of potential work years away from

work, compared to only 1 percent for men. The planned proportions for

our sample are 14 percent for women and 4 percent for men, including

part—time employment)0 It is also interesting that women in our

sample plan to retire no earlier than men.

    These differences may reflect the nature of our aample, college

students in career—oriented fields, and/or general increases in labor

force attachment of women in younger cohorts (Smith and Ward, 1984).

There is, in addition, a question as to whether women are actually

likely to work as much as they plan to. Some evidence on this issue

is provided by Shaw and Shapiro (1987). Ueing data from the National

Longitudinal Study they found that young women who were between ages

14 and 24 in 1968 initially substantially underestimated their future

labor force participation ar age 35, while their plans became more

nearly realistic as they approached that nge. There was no evidence

of a tendency of young women to overestimate their future participation.

    As would be expected on the basis of their majors, women and men

selected somewhat different first choicea from among 10 occupationa

which, according to the CEA Placement Office, comprise the great

majority of those atudenta from this College actually take upon
graduation.1 A larger proportion of aen opted for financial/credit

analyst, and a somewhat larger proportion of women selected personnel/

labor relations specialist and marketing analyst. The differences

otherwise are more modest, with slightly more men choosing accoun—

tsncy, and an almost equal proportion of men and women choosing

systems analyst, commercial loan officer, and management trainee, by

far the moat popular job.

    Expected salaries by sex are shown in the bottom of Table 2.

Becauae of our interest in the determinants of expected earnings pro-

files for jobs and in the effect of these profiles on labor force par-

ticipation plans, we asked the atudenta how much they would expect to

earn initially and after 10 and 20 yeara if they were to be con-

tinuously employed in their preferred occupation after leaving school.

As may be seen in the table, men and women in the sample anticipate

receiving very similar salaries upon graduation——the female—male ratio

is 97 percent. The differential in expected salaries, however,

increases over time, with the ratio falling to 79 percent after 10

years and to 72 percent after 20 years. Thus women do anticipate

flatter earnings profiles.

    Table 3 presents female—male earnings ratios within occupations

based on expected salaries in each student's top three choicea of

occupations.12 With the exception of personnel and labor relations

specialists and systems analyats, the fanning out of male and female

expected salaries observed on the basia of overall averages occurs

within each occupation as well, although not always to the eame

extent. Anticipated salary differentials are particularly large for
                                 —8—


the managerial and financial/credit analyst occupations which were the

first choice of 47.2 percent of the men and 41.5 percent of the women

in our sample. The expected differentials are, however, in most cases

somewhat smaller than actual differentials projected on the basis of

1980 age—earnings data for men and women. Thus, under the assumption

of continuous employment, women in the sample do expect to do rela-

tively better than women did in the past when many worksd intsrmit—

tently. Nonetheless, these rather sizable anticipated differentials

for continuous employment within occupations would superficially

appear to contradict the human capital explanation for gender dif-

ferences based on ths notion that women choose occupations with

flatter profiles. It msy be, however, that women and msn aslect dif-

ferent detailed occupations or different career trajectories within

these categories which require different levels of human capital

inveatmenta. This issue is investigated more systematically in

regression analyses presented below which examine the impact of labor

force participation plans on expected earnings profiles.

    Last, we asked the students to choose the 3 most important and the

3 least important smong 15 job characteristics listed. The results

are shown in Table 4. In general, there are striking similarities

between the priorities of women snd men, as well as some differences.

The same three characteristics are rated highest by both groups, and

receive very few rstings ss lowest from either group: salary, oppor-

tunity for advancement, and intellectusl challenge,13 though men do

opt more often for the first two, women for the third.14 Also, there

are no differences by gender in the five characteristics that receive
                                  —9—


the lowest retings: earning acclaim, fringe benefits, not too

demanding, opportunity to travel, and flexible hours. Women, however

give more low rankings to earning acclaim; men more to opportunity to

travel.

    Certain aspects of these findings provide modest support fdr some

aspects of traditional views of women's and men's preferences. The

greater importance men atiach to salary, opportunity, advancement and

job security, as well as women's greater emphasis on work environment

and, to a lesser extent, on pleasant co—workers, sre in line with

genersily sccepted perceptions of gender differences. On the other

hand, women's greater concern with hsving a chsllenging job, but not

with being close to family, pleasant geographic locstion, or flexible

hours is contrary to them. The substantial similsrities between the

women and men in this ssmple sre less surprising when it is kept in

mind thst they chose s relatively exacting snd nontrsditionsl csreer

path, snd thst esrlier studies (e.g. ,   Diploy,   1981; Ferber end Green,

1989) slso found that women and men among successful msnsgers differed

considersbly less then smong other workers.

    These descriptive dste tell us a good desl about the background,

plans, end expectstions of the members of the sample. In the next

section we turn to the central issue of this psper, en exsminstion of

the relationship between planned lsbor force participation and

expected esrnings, in order to shed further light on explanstioos of

the male—female earnings gap.

                           Testing the Hypotheses

       Given our dsts on plsns snd expectations, we are able to test the

human capital hypothesis of women's lower earnings. We also examine

whether there are feedback effects of expectations of lower earnings

on women's work plans. Again, we focus upon the salaries which stu-

dents expect to earn in their preferred occupation if they were to

work continuously after leaving school. The dependent variables are

the natural logs of expected salaries at the beginning of the career,

and 10 and 20 years later. The models are estimated for the total

sample and for women and men separately in order to investigate the

extent of gender differences in coefficients.

       To test the human capital hypothesia that planned labor force par-

ticipation will influence expected earnings profilea, number of years

the respondents planned to work full—time is entered in the regres-

sion.15 All else equal, it is expected that individuals who antici-

pate shorter work livea will aelect jobs with flatter earnings

profiles. Thus, yeara of planned full—time work are expected to be

inversely related to beginning salaries and positively related to

salaries 10 and 20 years later. Priorities given to various groupings

of job characteristics are also introduced, in order to determine

whether differences in tastes have any effect on earnings.'6 These

itema are added to the more usual variables of college major, GPA and
       17
sex.

       The results of the three regressions are seen in Table 5.   (Means

and atandard deviations of the variables for the regreaaion aampla are

shown in Appendix Table A—2). Overall, we find no significant gandar
                                 —11—


differences in expected starting salaries, ceteris paribus. These

results are similar to those shown in Table 2, where other variables

were not accounted for, and in Table 3, where expected salaries were

shown for each of nine occupations. However, as is the case for the

unadjusted gender differentials, men expect considerably higher

salaries in later years. Sex is significant at the 1 percent level in

these regressions, with men expecting approximately 18 percent higher

salaries than women 10 years after graduation and 26 percent higher

salaries 20 years later, all else equal. These differencea are large

relative to the unadjusted gender differentials in the log of earnings

of .236 and .322, respectively. Thus, the steeper earnings profiles

which men anticipate for continuous employment do not appear to be

explained to any great extent by gender differences in expected labor

market experience, work priorities, or the other variables included in

the regression.

    Contrary to the predictions of huoan capital theory, expected

labor force participation has no significant effect on expected earn-

ings in any of the regressions. We do not find expected beginning

salaries to be higher for those who plan to spend less time in the

labor force. Nor does greater planned labor force attachment have a

significant positive effect on expected salaries in later yeara.

Varying priorities for different job attributea also have little or no

effect for either men or women. Placing a high priority on salary

doea appear to have a significant poaitive effect on expected begin-

ning ealarlea. Also, placing importance on the job being not too

demanding significantly reduces expected beginning salaries as well as
                                 —12—


those 20 years later. However, it may be recalled that this job

characteristic is regarded as just about equally unimportant by women

and men. Hence we conclude that at least in this admittedly selected

sample of young people such differences in tastes as do exist do not

help to explain why men expect higher earninga than women in later

years.

    An examination of the separate regreaaions for women and men

points toward higher expected returns for CPA in later years giving

men the advantage, and suggests that they have greater confidence in

obtaining raises, and presumably promotions, in return for better

performance.18 The crucial question, which our data do not enable us

to answer, is to what extent these different expectations are real-

istic.

    In view of the possibility that men's steeper earnings profiles

may be related to different occupationa selected or to further

schooling, we also ran regressions with these variables added. The

coefficients for them were not significant, and the explanatory power

of the regressions remained essentially the same. Hence there is no

evidence here that these variables influence earnings, after con-

trolling for college major and the other variables.

    One problem with the approach used so far is the implicit assump-

tion that labor force participation plans are exogenous, although a

more general theory would suggest that they are likely to be made

simultaneously with other career decisions. Even though the bias of

the OLE regression is likely to overestimate rather than to understate

the effect of work plana, we therefore eetimate a two—equation model
                                 —13—


using two—stage least squares, which takes into sccount the inter-

dependence of planned labor force participation and earnings expects—
       19
tions.

    Virtually all the men anticipate working continuously until retire-

ment (except for withdrawals for full—time schooling). Therefore,

these relationships are examined only for the women. We focus on

salary 20 years after graduation, because that is where the largest

difference in expected earnings between women and men is obtained.

The determinants of number of years of planned full—time work include,

in addition to expected salary 20 years after graduation, the number

of children the woman expects to have as a measure of the anticipated

value of home time; grade point average as a proxy for ability, and

three background variables, father's and mother's occupation, and the

proportion of years the respondent's mother spent in the labor market,

as determinants of the daughter's career—orientation and taste for

market work.2°

    The results are shown in Table 6. Note that the sample size is

reduced for these estimates due to missing values on the additional

variables included in the model as determinants of planned work

experience. (Means and standard deviations of the variables are

shown in Appendix Table A—3.) The results again give little support

to the human capital explanation of the earnings gap in that number of

years of expected full—time employment does not influence expected

earnIngs. On the other hand, the results also do not lend support to

the proposition that women's lower earnings produce feedback effects

causing them to reduce their labor force participation in that
                                   —14—


expected salary does not significantly affect planned full—time work.

They do, however, provide some evidence on the other determinants of

labor force participation plans.

    Predictably, children have a negative effect. Each additional

child reduces women'a planned full—time work by 1.82 years. Thus, at

the mean expected number of children, 2.4, full—time work ia reduced

by 4.37 years. Also of interest is the influence of parents' occupa-

tional statue, and of the amount of time the mother wee employed,

clearly suggesting that the labor force participation plane of theee

women are, at least in part, determined by family background. Beyond

that, the relevance of mother's statue has important implications

about the effect of current changes in women's labor force particips—

tion on future developments: Women'e rapidly changing occupational

and employment etetue may be expected to provide continued impetue for

their daughters to move further in the same direction. It may seem

surprising that a high occupational etatue of the father has a nega-

tive effect on women'e work plane, all else equal. However, since

hueband's earnings are inversely related to women's labor force par-

ticipation, this finding may plausibly be interpreted as indicating

that these young women anticipate marrying a man with eimilar earninge

prospects to their father.


                              Conclusion

    Because young people make decisions about jobs and careers on the

baais of expectations, information based on outcomes is suggestive but

not conclusive for testing hypotheses about the way labor force par-

ticipation influences earnings, or about the way earnings influence
                                 —15—


labor force participation. Therefore, we collected data on work plane

and anticipated earninga of college businesa school aeniors that

enable ua to avoid thia difficulty. They were choaen because they are

likely to be relatively knowledgeable and career oriented and hence

would be likely to have made plans and formulated expectations. Fur-

ther, the women in this group represent a cohort that is particularly

important because they are among the vanguard who are forging ahead in

the labor market in a way that increasingly more women want to emu-

late.

    We found that, all else equal, women expect to earn about as much

as men at the beginning of their careers, but not later on. Although

women did anticipate shorter work lives than men, we found no effsct

of planned labor force participation on expected earnings profiles.

This does not mean actual earnings would not be influenced by actual

interruptions. It does, however, show that expected returns to

experience for continuous employment are not significantly different

in jobs chosen by those who jg to spend different amounts of time in

paid work. Thus, we still have no adequate explanation for the full

extent of women's lower expected earnings in later years for this

group of young women.

    At the same time, these findings are consistent with the interpre-

tation that while these women do not expect to be discriminated

against at the time they look for their first job, they anticipate

that they will do less well in terms of promotions. Such a perception

may be based on the fact that the male—female earnings gap actually

incresses with age, and on the belief of the respondents thst this is
                                 —16—


the case even when there are no differences in qualifications and

testes. This study does not shed any light on the question of whether

this belief is justified or whether these lower expectations may cause

woaen to settle for lower salaries without striving as herd as would

men who have higher expectations. Such speculations receive some sup-

port from a recent etudy of college students by Subich et al. (1989)

which found clear evidence that men were more willing to take risks,

as well as more equivocal evidence that they were more confident. Our

study does, however, provide evidence that it is not lower expected

earnings that cause women to spend less time in the labor market, and,

to that extent, militatee ageinat the importance of such feedback

effects for this group.

    The results of this study clearly have potential policy implica-

tions. On the one hand, to the extent the expectations of these stu-

dents are realistic, they provide no reason to be complacent about

equal opportunity having been achieved by women, not even young, well—

educated career—oriented women. They no longer expect to encounter

difficulties in getting in the door, but that does not mean that the

same is true for the portals to the executive suite. Continued

efforts on the part of government, business, and individuals to

ensure equal rewards for equal qualifications would therefore still be

desirable. On the other hand, our findings suggest that increaaing

the earnings of these women further may not have much influence on

their allocation of time between household and employment.

    Parenting is by far the dominant reason why many of these women

plan to reduce their labor force participation. It is, of course,
                                 —17—


entirely possible that other factors, not considered in this study,

such as social preasures and the availability of high—quality and con-

venient child care, are also iaportant. If so, government action,

which can, to a greater or lesser degree, set the tone and establish

standards, both through its own actions and by influencing employer

policies could make a difference. gven in the absence of such poli-

cies, however, our findings suggest that the greater labor force par-

ticipation of women whose daughters are now reaching adulthood set the

stage for the further changes in labor force attachment of the next

generation, which in turn may be expected to reduce resistance to pro-

moting women to positions of responsibility.

    'A good deal of the emphssis in this work is on explsining oocups—
tional segregstion, but our investigation touches on this subject only
tangentially.

    2lt is generally simply sssumed thst women, but not men, hsve
household responsibilities. Becker (1981) attributes this division of
lsbor to compsrstive sdvsntsge. But thst, in turn, rsiaes the ques-
tion of why women would hsve s relstive sdvsntsge in homemsking.
These issues ste clesrly beyond the scope of this psper. We merely
want to point out that they sre fundsmentsl to soy hypothesis thst
begins with differences in male sod femsle labor force sttschment.

    3Humso cspitsl theory also suggests thst a person who does not
plsn to work continuously has less incentive to invest in formal human
cspitsl, ssy by acquiring schooling, because there would be fewer
years to collect the additional returns. Since the members of our
sample, to be described later, all have the same amount of education,
we are in no position to address this issue.

        empirical study by Bielby and Bielby (1985) does not support
the Becker view. They find that women actually put aore effort into
paid work than do men, though their conclusion is based on self—
reported data.

    5Sandell and Shapiro (1980) and Shaw and Shapiro (1987), using NLS
panel data give partial support to the human capital explanation.
Both studies find that planning to work yielded a aubatantial wage
advantage, but Shaw and Shapiro showed no evidence of greater returna
to work experience. Their data, in any case, have some shortcomings
for this purpose. Among their limitations is the fact that the
respondents are only asked whether they expect to be working at age
35, not how many years they pian to be in the labor force.

    6Gronau (1988) usea expectations data in his recent research. Re
emphasizes the importance of skill requirements as an explanation of
earnings differentials. Not only is the skill intensity in men's jobs
high, but it is strongly related to their labor force experience,
while it is far lower in women's jobs, independent of their work
plans, and only slightly related to experience. Gronau concludes that
his findings lend support to the existence of wage discrimination
through occupational segregation, and that women face restrictions on
their job choice.

    7Shaw and Shapiro (1987), found that young women tended to
underestimate the extent to which they would be employed at age 35.
We ahall return to this point later.

    8We did not ask for information about race and ethnicity because
only about 5 percent of the students in CBA are blacks or other
minoriries.

    9At this University students have the option of being Economics
majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, as well as in the
College of Business Administration, and substantial numbers of Liberal
Arts students select this major.

    10Anticipsted years of full—time schooling accounr for mosr of the
time men plan to be out of the work force, while time spent in full—
time parenting accounts for the bulk of women's expected time out of
the labor market.

    UAn open—ended question asked about the job respondents hoped to
get upon graduation. We found that of the 217 women and t56 men who
answered that question t82 and 113 respectively named the one they
gave first preference among the 10 options listed. Of the others, 17
women and 21 men planned to become attorneys.

    12Data comparing students' expected salaries to actual salaries
are presented in Appendix B. We find that both men and women tended
to overestimate salaries as compared to prevalent ones. Similar find-
ings sre reported for Americsn college students by Subich et. al.
(1989). On the other hand, a British study (Williams and Gordon,
1981) found that student's expectations were accurate.

   13Lest there be concern thar these choices were influenced by the
presentation of the questions, it should be noted that they were not
grouped in the questionnaire.

   '4knderson and Anderson (1988) similarly found that women as com-
pared to men are more interested in a "feeling of accomplishment," and
in "interesting work," and less concerned with "money."

   15Using total number of years students expected to be in the labor
force instead did not change the outcome. When number of years stu-
dents expected to work part—time was entered separately, the coef-
ficient was not aignifiesnr.

   16freferences for particular characteristics of the job were grouped
as shown in Table 4, except that those in the 'other" category ware
omitted. Using them did not add to the explanatory power of the re-
gressions. The ones included were expressed as an index:    3 — any
ranked first; 2   any ranked second; 1    any ranked third; —1 — any
ranked thirteenth; —2 = any ranked fourteenth; —3 = any ranked fif-
teenth. Specifying these variables as dummies produced similar
results regarding their impact on gender differencea in earnings.

   17Unlike Gronau (1988), we have no information on skill require-
ments for jobs, which he found to be very important in determining
wages. He also found, however, that there were no significant dif-
ferences in this respect berween female and male professionsl snd
technical workers, which covers all rhe occupations used in this study
except management trainees.

   18Twenry years after graduation, when the earnings differential is
largest, the difference in returns to GPA evaluated at the overall
sample mean (which is virtually the came for men and women) is 0.596.
This is more than sufficient to account for the gross gender dif-
ference in expected earnings of 0.322. (Differences in the constant
term actually favor women.) These findings are reminiscent of those
in Ferber and Green (1989) which showed that the reward structure of a
sample of individuals self—identified as "top management" provided
virtually no evidence that differences in human capital charac-
teristics had any effect on women's earnings, though they influenced
those of men.

   191n view of the crucial role atrophy plays in human capital theory
(Polachek, 1981), we also ran a aet of two stage regressions using
that variable instead of expected salary, but found that we were
singularly unsuccessful in explaining atrophy, and that it added
nothing to the explanation of work plans. The atrophy rate was -calcu-
lated by finding how much less these students expected to earn 10
years after leaving school, if they were to drop out of the labor
market for years 5—9, as compared to working continuously during the
whole period.

    20The instruments in the first—stage regressiona included all the
exogenous variables in both the planned full—time work and expected
salary equations. Since number of children may be viewed as, at least
in part, endogennus, we also ran the same model excluding thia variable
from both the first— and second—stage regressions. The     waa somewhat
lower for years worked, and somewhat higher for salary, but the aame
variables remained significant.

    Information on salaries students expect to earn in the jobs thst

are among their top three choices if they were to work continuously

after leaving school is offered in Table 8—1, together with actual

salaries offered to 1987 graduates for beginning earnings, snd esti-

mated salaries for 10 and 20 years later based on 1980 census data on

earnings of workers 35—44 years and 45—55 years of age compared to

workers 25—34 years old. This estimate is likely to understate

women's earnings in eubeequent years, since it assumes that con-

tinuously employed women will fare no better in terms of wage growth

than women actually did in the past when many of them worked only

intermittently. Nonetheless, it gives us a rough eetimate against

which to compare women's salary expectstiona.

    These data suggest that both men and women are rsther optimistic

about future earnings, but it must be noted that our projections

implicitly assume no overall increases in labor productivity. This

seems realistic in view of the virtual absence of changes in real

earnings in recent years, but it is also possible that the upward

trend of earlier years will resume to a greater or lesser degree.

Miller (1965), for instance, found that between t949 and 1959 produc-

tivity rose by about 51 percent for workers aged 35—44, and t4 percent

for workers 45 to 54. Were we to return to this upward trend, the

unweighted mean of earnings for men in the eight occupations would be

$49,294 ten years after graduation and $63,200 twenty years later, as

compared to $32,645 and $36,714, aa we projected. These figures are
                         Appendix 8 (cont'd.)


not as far below the $55,625 and $99,783 men expect to earn. It may

be too that students who are likely to be aware of raises in dollar

terms tend to underestimate the extent to which they reflect inflation

rather than merit raises. Further, these students with a degree from

a highly—regarded business school may be correct in expecting to earn

more than the average college graduate. Finally, it is worth noting

that expected salary ratios by gender are roughly in line with esti-

mates based on projections of actual salaries (Table 3). The antici-

pated ratios are generally somewhat higher which is to be expected

given the assumption of continuous employment.
