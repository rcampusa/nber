                       Who Does R&D and Who Patents?


      This paper describes the construction of a large panel data set
 covering about 2600 firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector for up to
 twenty years which contains annual data on financial variables, employ-
ment, research and development expenditures, and aggregate patent
 applications. This data set is to be used in a larger study of R&D,
 inventive output, and technological change. In the present paper we
present preliminary results on the R&D and patenting behavior of the
1976 cross section of these firms. We find an elasticity of R&D with
respect to sales of close to unity, with both very small and very large
firms being slightly more R&D intensive than average. Because only
sixty percent of the firms report R&D expenditures, we attempt to correct
for selectivity bias and find that although the correction is small, it
increases the estimated complementarity between capital intensity and
R&D intensity. In exploring the relationship of the patenting activity
of these firms to their contemporaneous R&D expenditures, we look with
some care at the choice of econometric specification since the discrete
nature of the patents variable for our smaller firms may cause difficulties
with the conventional log linear model. The choice of specification
does indeed make a difference, and the negative binomial model, which
is a Poisson—type model with a disturbance, is preferred. Substantively,
we find a much larger output of patents per R&D dollar for the small
firms, with a decreasing propensity to patent with size of R&D programs
throughout the sample. However, this conclusion is highly tentative both
because of its sensitivity to specification and choice of sample and
also because we expect that the errors in variables bias due to our
focus on R&D and patent applications in a single year is far worse for
the small firms.

I.   Introduction

          As part of an on—going study of R&D, inventive output, and

productivity change, the authors are assembling a large data set for

a panel of U.S. firms with annual data from 1972 (or earlier) through

1978. This file will include financial variables, research and development

expenditures and data on patents. The goal is to have as complete a

cross section as possible of U.S. firms in the manufacturing sector

which existed in 1976, with time series information on the, same firms

for the years before and after 1976. This paper presents a preliminary

analysis of these data in the cross sectional dimension, to lay some ground

work for the future by exploring the characteristics of this sample and

describing the R&D and patenting behavior of the firms in it. It follows

on previous work on a smaller sample of 157 firms (see Pakes and Griliches

(1980) and Pakes (1981)).

     In what follows we describe first the construction of our sample

from the several data sources available to us. Then we discuss the

reporting of our key variable,
                                —2—




Research and Development expenditures, and relate this variable to

firm characteristics such as industry, size, and capital intensity.

An important issue here is whether the fact that many firms do not

report R&D expenditures will bias results based only on firms which do.

We attempt to correct for this bias using the well-known Heckman

(1976) procedure.

     Section IV of the paper describes the patenting behavior of the

same large sample of firms. We attempt to quantify the relationship

between patenting, R&D spending, and firm size, and explore the

interindustry differences in patenting in a preliminary way. Due to the

many small firms in this data set, we pay considerable attention to the

problem of estimatibn when our dependent variable, patents, takes on

small integer values. The paper concludes with some suggestions for

future work using this large and fairly rich data set.

 II. Sample Description

          The basic universe of the sample is the set of firms in the

U.S. manufacturing sector which existed in 1976 on Standard and Poor's

Compustat Annual Industrial Files. The source of data for these tapes is

company reports to the S.E.C., primarily the 10—K report, supplemented

by market data from such sources as NASDAQ and occasionally personal

communication with the company involved. The manufacturing sector is

defined to be firms in the Compustat SIC groups 2000—3999 and conglomerates

(SIC 9997)1

     Company data was taken from four Compustat tapes. The Industrial

File includes the Standard and Poor 400 companies, plus all other companies

traded on the New York and American Stock Exchanges. The Over The Counter

(OTC) tape includes companies traded over the counter that command significant

investor interest. The Research Tape includes companies deleted from

other files because of acquisition, merger, bankruptcy, etc.   Finally,

the Full Coverage tape includes other companies which file 10—K's,

including companies traded on regional exchanges, wholly owned subsidiaries

and privately held companies. From these tapes we obtained data on the

capital stock, balance sheets, income statements including such expense

items.as Research and Development expenditures, stock valuation and

dividends, and a few miscellaneous variables such as employment.

    Unfortunately, our patent data does not come in a form which can

be matched easily at the firm level. Owing to the computerization
                                 —4—




 of the U.S. Patent Office in the late 1960's, we are able to obtain a file

 with data on each individual patent granted by the Patent Office from 1969

 through 1979. For each such patent we have the year it was applied for,

 the Patent Office number of the organization to which it was granted,

 an assignment code telling whether the organization is foreign or domestic,

 corporate or individual, and some information on the product field and SIC

 of the patent. We also have a file of correspondences between Patent

Office organization numbers and the names of these organizations. The

difficulty is that these patenting organizations,
                                                    although frequently
corporations in our sample, may also be subsidiaries of our firms, or have

a slightly different name from that given on the Compus tat files ("Co."

instead of "Inc." or "Incorporated", and other such changes or abbreviations).2

Thus, the matching of the Patent Office file with the Compustat data is

a majpr task in our sample creation.

     To do the matching, we proceeded as follows: all firms in the final

sample (about 2700) were looked up in the Dictionary of Corporate

Affiliations (1976) and their names as well as the names of their

subsidiaries were entered in a data file to be matched by a computer

program to the names on the Patent Office organization file. This

program had various techniques, for accommodating differences in spelling

and abbreviations. The matched list of names which it produced was

checked for incorrect matches manually and a final file was produced which related

the Compustat identifying CUSIP number of our firms to one or more
                                 —5—

 (in some cases, none) Patent Office organization numbers.    Using this

 file, we aggregated the file with individual patent records to the

 firm level. At the time of the writing of this paper we are engaged in

 a reverse check of the matching process which involves looking at the

 large patenting organizations which are recorded as domestic U.S.

 corporations, but which our matching program missed. The results of

 this check may further increase some of our patent totals.

      In assembling this data set we have attempted to confine the sample

 to domestic corporations, since the focus of our research program is

the interaction between Research and Development, technological innovation,

and productivity growth within the United States. Inspection of the

Compustat files reveals that at least a few large foreign firms, mostly

Japanese, are traded on the New York Stock Exchange, consequently file

10—K's with the S.E.C., and would be included in our sample, although

their R&D is presumably primarily done abroad and their U.S. patents are

recorded as foreign—owned. In order to clean our sample of these firms,

we did several things: first, we were able to identify and delete all

firms which Compustat records as traded on the Canadian Stock Exchange.

Then we formed a ratio of foreign—held U.S. patents to total number of U.S.

patents for each firm in our sample. For most of our sample, this ratio

is less than fifteen percent; the list of firms for which it is larger

includes most of the American Deposit Receipts (ADR) firms on the New

York Stock Exchange and several other firms clearly identifiable as

foreign. After deleting these firms from the sample, as a final check

we printed a list of the remaining firms with 'ADR' or 'LTD' in their

names. There were 18 such firms remaining, which we deleted from the

sample.
                                —6—



     The firms which were left still had a few foreign—owned patents

(about two percent of the total number of patents in 1976), due to joint

ventures or foreign subsidiairies. Since their Compustat data is

consolidated and includes R&D done by these subsidiaries in the R&D

figure, we added those patents to the domestic patents to produce a

total successful patent application figure for the firm.

      Our final 1976 cross section consists of data on sales, employment,

book value in various forms, pre—tax income, market value, R&D expenditures,

and patents applied for in 1976 for approximately 2600 firms in the

manufacturing sector. The selection of these firms is summarized in Table

1. Except for a few cases, firms without reported gross plant In 1976 are

firms which did not exist in 1976. Seventy—seven firms were deleted

because they were wholly owned subsidiaries of another company In our

sample, or duplicates among the Compustat files; another 31 had zero or

missing Sales or Cross plant. The final sample consists of 2595 firms,

of which 1492 reported positive R&D in 1976. In the next section of this

paper, we present some results on the R&D characteristics of these firms.

III.    The Reporting of Research and Development Expenditures

             In 1972, the SEC issued new requirements for the reporting

of R&D expenditures on Form 10—K. These requirements may be summarized

as mandating the disclosure of the estimated amount of R&D expenditures

when a) it was "material", b)      it exceeded one percent of sales, gj

c) a policy of deferral or amortization of R&D expenses was pursued.

Acting on these new requirements, the Financial Accounting Standards

Board issued a new standard for the reporting of R&D expenditures in

June of 1974. UntIl this time, accepted accounting practices appear to

have allowed the amortizing of 1&D expenditures over a short time

period as an alternative to simple expensin but the new standard allows

only expensing (San Miguel and Ansari (1975)). Accordingly, we have reason to

believe that by 1976 most of our firms are reporting R&D expense

when it is "material" and that the expense reported has been incurred

that year.

        For the purpose of this paper, we make no distinction among firms

whose   R&D is reported by Compustat as "not available", "zero", or
"not significant".3 All such firms are treated as not reporting positive
R&D.    This is because of the nature of the SEC reporting requirements

for R&D, and the way Compustat handles company responses. As noted above,

companies are supposed to report "material" R&D expenditures. If the
                                —9—




company and their accountants conclude that R&D expenditures were "not

material" (possibly zero but not necessarily so) they sometimes say so

in the 10—K report, in which case Compustat records "zero".4 Alternatively,

the company may say nothing about R&D, in which case Compustat records

"not available". It is also likely that companies reported "not

available" include some which are "randomly" missing, i.e., the company

performs "material" R&D but for some reason Compustat could not get

•the number for that year.5

     Another source of data on aggregate spending on R&D by U.S. industry

is the National Science Foundation, which reports total R&D spending in

the United States every year broken down into approximately 30 industry

groupings.   These data are obtained from a comprehensive survey of U.S.

enterprises by the Industry Division of the Bureau of the Census, which

covers larger firms completely and samples the smaller firms. Although

there are several important differences between these data and that reported

by Compustat, it is of interest to compare the aggregate figures, which

we show in Table 2. The company R&D figures are the most directly comparable

to our Compustat numbers, but we show the figures for total R&D also since

NSF does not provide a breakdown between company—sponsored and

federal—sponsored R&D expenditures for many of the industries (to avoid

disclosing individual company data). There are several reasons for the

discrepancies between the Compustat and NSF total&. First, the industry

assignment of a company is not necessarily the same across the two sets

of data: the most striking difference is in the communications industry,

which includes AT&T in the NSF/Census sample, while AT&T is assigned to SIC

4800 on the Compustat files and is therefore not in our sample. Adding the 1976

R&D for AT&T and its subsidiary, Western Electric, to the Compustat communications

total would raise it to about one billion, not enough to account for the difference

     There are also definitional differences between the Form 10-K R&D

and that in the Census survey. The 10—K includes international and

contracted—out R&D, while these are entered on a separate line of the

Census survey.6 The total amount involved is about 1.7 billion dollars

in 1976. This is likely to explain why our Industrial Chemicais figure is

•too high, for example. Some firms include engineering or product—testing

on one survey but exclude it on the other, apparently because the Census

survey is quite explicit about the definition of Research and Development,

while the 10—K allows considerably more flexibility. Finally, the coverage

of firms in the U.S. manufacturing sector by Compustat is less complete

than by Census for two reasons: privately held firms are not required

to file Form 10—K, and there are some large firms which do file a 10—K,

but record their R&D as not "material", even though a positive figure is reported

to the Bureau of the Census.   In spite of all these caveats the Compustat and

NSF numbers do seem to match fairly well across industries and the total is

within 15 percent after correcting for AT&T and the international and

contracted—out R&D.

     Table 3 presents some summary statistics for the firms in the

sample, broken down into 21 industry categories. The categories are

based approximately on the NSF applied R&D categories shown in Table 2,

with some aggregation, and the separation of the lumber, wood and paper and

consumer goods categories from miscellaneous manufacturing. The exact

industry category assignment scheme which we used throughout this paper,

based on SIC codes, is presented in Appendix A. A few firms with exceptionally

large or small R&D to sales ratios have been 'utrimmed'1 from the sample

in this table (see below for an exact definition of the criterion used).

As the table shows, the population of the industry categories and the

fraction of firms reporting R&D varies greatly, from 20 percent for the

miscellaneous category to above 80 percent for drugs and computers.

     Table 4 shows the size distribution of firms in the sample. A large

number of small firms are included; there are about 70 firms with less

than a million dollars in sales, and over 600 with less than 10 million.

These firms, however, account for less than 1% of total sales of firms

in the sample. As might be expected, larger firms tend to report R&D

more often even though they do about the same amount as a fraction

of sales. This is shown graphically in Figure 1. Up until about

100 million in Sales, only about half the companies report R&D,

but above 10 billion almost 90% do. Previous workers have suggested

that this may be because big companies are able to do their accounting

more carefully (San Miguel and Ansari (1975), but it is surprising

how big a company must be before it has a 75% probability of reporting

R&D.

       As we indicated above, the nature of SEC reporting rules results

in ambiguity in the interpretation of firms' reporting zero R&D or not

reporting R&D. This ambiguity has implications for the analysis of

the subsample of firms that do report R&D ("the R&D sample"). Although

we do not believe that the non—R&D sample firms all do zero R&D, it is

likely that they do less than the firms that report it. It is also

possible that they do less R&D than would be expected, given their

other characteristics such as industry, size and capital intensity.

If so, then their exclusion from regressions of R&D on firm characteris-

tics will result in biased estimates of the association of these charac-

teristics with the firms' propensity to do R&D.

       To shed light on this problem, the distribution of reported R&D

was examined in several ways. First, if firms consider R&D expenditures

to be immaterial if they fall below some absolute amount, then the

distribution of R&D would be truncated from below. We find no evidence

of such truncation in the the R&D distribution. It is also possible that

R&D is considered immaterial if it is small relative to firm size.

This seems particularly likely because, in addition to the requirement

to report material R&D expenditures in Item l(b)(6) of the 10—K, the

SEC requires firms to report all expense categories that exceed one per
                                  —17—




 cent of sales. Figure 2 is a histogram of R&D as percent of sales;

 once again, no truncation is apparent. In fact, the mode of the

 distribution occurs at about .3% of sales.

      Although no obvious truncation was visible, either in absolute

 magnitude or as a percent of sales, we cannot rule out the likely

 possibility that a combination of cutoffs, both absolute and relative

 (as interpreted by the firm's accountants) are in effect, implying

 an indeterminate bias in the relationship of observed R&D to the firm's

 characteristics. Therefore, we attempt to quantify the reporting—not

 reporting of R&D with a Probit equation after presenting results for

 the firms which do retort R&D.

      In Figure 3 we show a plot of log R&D versus log Sales for

 the R&D sample, which summarizes the basic relationship between R&D

and firm size in our data. It is apparent from this plot that the slope

and degree of curvature of this relationship are likely to be influenced

strongly by a few outlying points; some very small firms do large amounts

of R&D, and a few firms in the intermediate size range do very little R&D.

To test for the sensitivity of the results to these few points, the sample

was trimmed by eliminating 7 firms (.5%) with lowest R&D/Sales ratio,

and 7 firms with the highest. The firms removed are those outside the diagonal

lines drawn on the plot. This reduces the mean ratio of R&D to sales

from 4.1% to 2.7%,, and the standard deviation from 35% to 3.8%. The effects

on the log—distribution are much less dramatic. The sirallest ratio

that was deleted from the upper tail was .716; the largest from the

lower was .0002.   These are beyond 3 standard deviations of even

the untrimmed distribution, whether it is viewed as normal or

 (more plausibly) log—normal. Since the results with trimmed data

were not strikingly different from those with untrinmied data, we

present only one set of results for our regressions, using the trimmed data

throughout.

      The first question we investigated in this sample was the nature of

industry variation in R&D performanee and the R&D—firm size relationship.

Equations of the form:




(1)       logR           a+SlogS + c

where R is R&D and S is Sales, were estimated separately for the

21 industries in Table 3.      Except for the textile industry and miscellaneous

manufacturing, the estimated 13s were not statistically significantly different

from one another and the R—squares were above .65. The remainder of

the analysis was performed using uniform slope coefficients, while allowing

for different industry intercepts by using industry dummies. This was done

primarily for convenience, but it is not inconsistent with the individual

industry results. While such aggregation is in fact rejected by a

conventional F—test for the simple regression of log R&D on log Sales

(F(20,1437) =   3.34),   given the size of our sample, one should really use a

much higher critical value (about 8), in which case, one need not reject it.7
                                      —21—




        After accepting the hypothesis of equality of the slope coefficients,

we estimated equations of the form:



 (2)         log R
                           S1   logs + 2 logA+ 53(logS)2 +y +   c



where R, and S are as previously defined: A =          Gross Plant,

and y. are a set of industry intercepts. Simple statistics

on the regression variables are shown in Table 5 and basic regression

results in Table 6.

        The first column in Table 6 gives the results of the simplest

regression. Although we know that this story is incomplete, this equation

indicates that there is almost no fall in R&D intensity with incrEasing firm

size.    An analysis of variance using this equation and restrictions on it

is also interesting. Log Sales explains 73% of the total variance in

log R&D and 79%      of   the variance remaining after we control for the variations

in   industry means. Looked at the other way, the industry dummies explain
10% of the total variance and 30% of the variance remaining after we

control for log Sales.

       The second column shows the effect of capital intensity on R&D intensity.

If we interpret this equation in terms of the equivalent regression of

log R&D on log Sales and log of the capital—sales ratio, we find it

implies a sales coefficient of .95, almost identical to that of the first

column, and a complementarity between capital intensity and R&D intensity

(coefficient of .24 for log (Gross Plant/Sales)). While this effect is

highly significant, its additional contribution to the fit is small.

All regressions include 21 industry dummies, except that for small
firms, in which the Primary Metals and Conglomerate dummies
were dropped due to lack of firms.

There are 319 small firms (less than ten million dollars in sales) and
1160 large firms.
                               —24—




      The third and fourth columns in Table 6 indicate that there is significant

 nonlinearity in the relationship between log R&D and log Sales. These

 estimates imply that the elasticity of R&D with respect to sales varies

 from .7 at sales of one million to 1.2 at sales of one billion. This

nonlinearity is also apparent in the scatter plot of log R&D and log Sales

presented in Figure 3. While a fairly linear relationship may exist

for large firms, it clearly breaks down for smaller firms. This may be

due at least in part to the selection bias discussed above; more will

be said below.

     In the last two rows of Table 6 we present the results for the

fourth regression estimated separately for small firms (up to $10 million

in sales) and large firms (all others). The fit is improved slightly;

the F ratio for aggregation of the two subsamples is 3.29 (22,1433).

Allowing for differences in the slopes of log Sales and log Cross Plant

together diminishes the significance of the log Sales squared term,

particularly for the small firms.

     Our measurement of the contemporary relationship between R&D and

sales may be a biased estimate of the true long—run relationship because

of the transitory component and measurement error in this year's sales,

particularly if we are interpreting sales as a measure of firm size.

To correct for this errors in variables bias, we obtained instrumental

variable estimates of a regression of log R&D on log Sales, log Sales

squared, and the industry dummies using log Cross Plant and its square

as instruments for the sales variables. The estimated coefficients were

.755 (.042) and .028 (.005) for log Sales and its square implying an

elasticity of R&D with respect to sales of .985 at the sample mean. This

compares to an elasticity of .972 for equation 3 in Table 6 and suggests

that the errors in variables bias, although probably present, is not

very lar2e in magnitude.
                                            —25—




        As a first step in our attempts to correct for possible bias due

to non—reporting of R&D, we estimated a Probit equation whose dependent

variable was one when R&D was reported and zero otherwise. The model

underlying this equation is the following: the true regression model for

R&D is




 (3)         log R1 =



where      is a vector of firm characteristics such

as industry and size and c.1 is a disturbance. We observe R when it is

larger than some (noisy) threshold value C., different for each firm.

This model is a variation of the generalized Tobit model, described by

many authors; this particular version is in Nelson (1974) and is equivalent to

a model described by Griliches, Hall, and Hausman (1978). C1 contains the

one percent of sales rule and anything else the firm uses to decide whether

R&D is "material", plus a stochastic piece, C2, which describes our

inability to predict exactly when a firm will report;

(4)         C. =

                            + .


       In this framework, the probability of observing R&D may be expressed

as Prob (E —                > Z.6 —   X.BjZ.,X.).

jointly as multivariate normal, we get the standard Probit model

where C is the variance of C1 —       and F(.) is the cumulative normal

probability function. Since the Probit model is only identified up to a

scale factor, we can only estimate ó/c and /o. Deriving the model in

this way also sheds some light on what it is we are estimating when we

run a Probit on this data: presumably 1 and X. include many, if not

all, of the same variables. For example if the Z. were only log Sales and

the one per cent rule was being followed, the coefficient 6 would be unity

and if the true elasticity of R&D with respect to sales were also unity, the

Probit equation would yield a sales coefficient of zero. However, if

reporting depended only on the absolute amount of R&D performed, then

C. would be a constant and predicting large R&D would be equivalent to

predicting high reporting probability; this hypothesis implies that

the coefficients in the probit should be the same as those in the R&D

regression (up to a scale factor). Finally, if reporting depends in a

more complex way on industry and size of the firm, then there need be

no obvious relationship between the coefficients of the Probit model

and those of the regression.

        The results of the Probit estimation are presented in Column 1

of Table 7. The coefficient on log sales is .016 (.05) compared to .52

(.05) in the comparable OLS equation for log R&D. At the mean of log sales

for the whole sample, the coefficient is .077. The coefficient

on log gross plant is reduced somewhat from OLS estimates. These results

suggest that the first of our two hypotheses above is closer to the truth:

R&D reporting depends primarily on R&D intensity and not on the absolute

level of R&D spending, with perhaps also a smaller effect due to firm

size.

       These are the maximum likelihood estimates of the coefficients

observations and 1479 report R&D. The X2 for the three variables besides
the industry dummies is 233.

      If it is true that the non—reporting firms are characterized

only by lower than average R&D as percent of sales, the OLS estimates

of "elasticities" presented earlier are not necessarily biased,

although the constant term and industry dummy coefficients could be.

Since it is also true, however, that the non—reporting firms are

smaller on average,8 the OLS elasticity estimates may be biased

downwards. This possibility was investigated using the procedure

popularized by I-leckman. For each observation with R&D reported, the

"inverse Mills ratio" was calculated as:



(7)
              F(u)


where u is the argument of the Probit equation (Z.o —           evaluated
                                                        X)/c1
at this observation's data and the estimated Probit coefficients and

f(•) and F(•) are the standard normal density and cumulative distribution

functions respectively. When H is added to the OLS estimations, it

"corrects" for selectivity bias.
                                 —29—



     A regression including the Mills ratio variable is presented in

column 3 of Table 7, together with the "uncorrected' estimates for

comparison. The coefficients on the Mills ratio is positive and significant

indicating the presence of selectivity bias. There is only a slight rise

in the sales coefficients, however, and the npnlinearity is about

the same. The largest increase is in the log Cross Plant coefficient,

which was also the best predictor of R&D reporting. Thus we would

underestimate the complementarity of capital intensity and R&D intensity

if we did not take into account the fact that non—capital—intensive firms

also tend to be those which do not report R&D expenditures.



     It should be emphasized that in this application of the 1-]eckman

technique the Mills ratios are a nonlinear function of all the other

independent variables in the equation. This is because we have no variables

that predict reporting but not quantity of R&D. For this reason, the

incremental explanatory power of the M variable is due solely to the

nonlinearity of its relationship to the other variables in the model.

We know, however, that the dependence of R&D on these variables is likely

to be nonlinear to begin with. In the absence of a reporting predictor

that is excluded from the quantity equation, it is impossible to distinguish

selectivity bias and "true" nonlinearity in the R&D—size relationship.

This makes it impossible to draw a definitive conclusion regarding the

possibility of bias in the OLS estimates.

 IV. Patenting

          The matching project described in the first section of this

 paper yielded 4,553 patenting entities which were matched to the companies

 in our sample. 1754 of our 2582 companies were granted at least one patent

 during the 1965—79 period, but only about sixty percent of that number

 applied for a patent in 1976. Firms with R&D programs are far more

 likely to apply for patents: about twenty percent of the firms with zero

or missing R&D have at least one patent in 1976, but this fraction rises

rapidly with size of R&D program until well over ninety percent of firms

with R&D larger than ten million dollars have patents in 1976.

     If we look at the size of the finn rather than the R&D program,

twenty—eight percent of the small firms (less than ten million in sales)

applied for a patent in contrast to the fifty—three percent which reported

R&D, but this difference is due primarily to the integer nature of the

patents data: when we consider all years rather than just 1976, the

percentage who patent rises to sixty. These same small firms account for

4.3% of sales, 3.8% of R&D, but 5.7% of patents in our sample. However,

the latter number may be an overestimate since we know that approximately

one—third of all domestic corporate patents remain unmatched in 1976

in our sample, and it is likely that some of these belong to subsidiaries

of our larger companies which we have overlooked. Further checking

of these patents is being done.

     In Table 3 we show the mean number of patents and number of firms

which have one or more patents for each of our 21 industry classes.

As we expect, patenting is higher in the science—based or technological
                                       —31—




 industries, both in terms of the fraction of firms which patent and the

average number of patents taken out by the patenting firms. The industries

with more than twenty—five patents per firm are chemicals, drugs,

petroleum, electrical equipment, engines, computers, motor vehicles,

and conglomerates.        Presumably petroleum, motor vehicles,

and conglomerates appear on this list partly because of the average size

of the firms in those industries. On the other hand, the scientific

instrument and the machinery industries have a large number of patents

per R&D dollar but are composed of relatively small firms.

     Earlier studies by Fakes and Criliches (1980) on a sample of 157

large U.S. manufacturing firms showed a strong contemporaneous relationship

between patent applications and R&D expenditures across firms in several

industries, and they suggested that patents are a fairly good indicator

of the investive output of the research department of a firm. We consider

the relationship again in Figure 4. Because of the large size range

of our firms, the patents R&D relationship will be obscured by the

simple correlation between number of patents and size of firm. Therefore,

we plot the log of patents normalized by gross plant versus the log of

R&D normalized by the same quantity for the firms which both do R&D

and patent. The number of firms shown is 831, about one—third of our

sample. The plot shows a strong correlation between patenting and R&D

for these firms with a slope slightly greater than one and a hint of

nonlinearity in   the   relationship      (increasing slope for higher

R&D). There is considerable variance: the range of patents per million

dollars of R&D for the firms which patent is from about one—seventh of

a patent to ninety patents. The typical firm has a ratio of about two,

that is, half a million dollars of R&D per patent.9

     This picture is slightly misleading, however, since it covers only

one—third of our sample. Accordingly, when we turn to modelling the

relationship, we want to include the zero observations on both patents

and R&D in our estimation. We attempt to solve this problem in two ways:

first we set log patents to zero for all zero patent observations and allow

those firms to have a separate intercept (PATDU}1) in our regressions,

as suggested by Pakes and Griliches. It should be emphasized that there

are about 1700 such observtions, which suggests that the significance

level of our estimates needs to be interpreted with caution. The

estimates we obtain imply that the observations with no patents have an

expected value of about one—half of a patent. Secondly, we model the

patents properly as a counts (Poisson) variable, taking on values 0, 1, 2,

etc., as suggested by Hausrnan, Hall, and Griliches (1981). In this case,

with the many small and few very large observations which we have, the

Poisson model turns out to give quite different results from the logarithmic

OLS model.

     The first column of Table 8 displays the results of a regression of

log patents on log R&D expenditures, dummies for zero or missing R&D and

patents, and our 21 industry dummies. The estimate of the log R&D coefficient

is considerably lower than the comparable estimates by Pakes and Griliches

(1980), .61 (.08), or by 1-lausman, Hall, and Griliches (1981), .81 (.02).

The difference could be attributed to the size range of firms in our sample

which is far greater than in the earlier work and also to the large number

of zeroes in our variables. For comparison, the coefficient of log R&D is

.59 (.02) when we use only firms with nonzero patents and R&D. The overlap

of this last sample of firms with the Pakes and Griliches sample is

about 100 firms out of 831 and it consists primarily of the larger firms

from the complete sample. We will return to the question of how to handle

the enormous size range of our complete sample after we discuss the

Poisson and negative binomial results for this model.

     The industry dummies from the regression in the first column of

Table 8 are a measure of the average propensity to patent in the particular

industry, holding R&D expenditures constant. Relative to the overall

mean, the industries with significantly higher than average patenting

propensity are chemicals, drugs, petroleum, engines, farm and construction

machinery, electrical equipment, aircraft, and the conglomerates.

Several industries which are highly technology—based such as

communications equipment and computers do not seem to patent any more

than the average: in fact, a finn in the computer industry has eighty—five

percent of the patents of an average firm doing the same amount of R&D.

     To allow for possible nonlinearity in the patenting—R&D relationship

we add the log of R&D expenditures squared to the regression in column 2

of Table 8. This coefficient is highly significant and implies a

substantially higher propensity to patent for firms with larger R&D

programs, with an elasticity of .25 at R&D of half a million rising

to over unity at R&D expenditures of one hundred million dollars.

The F—test for the industry dummies is now F(20,2557)   3.5, implying

that there is very little difference in the average propensity to patent

across industries once we allow R&D to have a variable coefficient.
                                 —36—




 This is a bit surprising and probably reflects the nonhomogeneity of

 the firms in our industry classes and the problems associated with

 assigning each firm to one and only one industry. The industries

 which have coefficients significantly different from the average are the

 petroleum industry (patenting 30% higher on average), engines, farm and

 construction machinery (28%), conglomerates (767.), and computers

 (20% less on average). We reestirnated the equation with no industry

 dummies (column 3 of Table 8) and found that the slopes hardly changed;

 this result held true for several different specifications of the model,


 including one with only the log of R&D in the equation!° Although

we believe that there are significant differences in the
                                                           relationship
of R&D and patenting at the detailed industry level from inspection of

the distribution of the two variables by industry, these differences

do not affect the basic results of this aggregate study and we have

therefore omitted the industry dummies for the sake of simplicity in what

follows.

     In the fourth column of Table 8 we add the log of the gross value

of the firm's plant to the regression to control for firm size

independently of R&D expenditures. Larger firms may patent more often

simply because they are bigger and employ patent lawyers and other personnel

solely for this purpose. The coefficient estimate for log gross plant lends

some support to this hypothesis, however, one should be careful in

interpreting the estimated size (assets) effects. To a significant extent

they may be just compensating for transitory and timing errors in our

R&D measure. The equation estimated assumes that this' year's patents applied

for depends only on this year's R&D expenditures. We know that this     is
                                —37—

 not exactly correct (see Pakes and Griliches, this volume). Some of the

 patents applied for are the result of R&D
                                             expenditures in years past while
 not all of the R&D expenditures in this year will result in patents, even in

 subsequent years. In this sense, the R&D variable is subject to significant

error which will be exacerbated once we control for size reducing thereby

the signal to noise ratio. This may explain both the reduction of the R&D

coefficient when assets are introduced
                                         as a separate variable and the rather
large estimated pure size effect. We cannot do much about this in this paper,

but we shall return to this topic when we turn to the panel aspects of this

data set in later work.

     We now turn to the Poisson formulation of the patents model.

This model treats the patents for each firm as arising from a Poisson

distribution whose underlying mean is given by exp(Xe) where XB is a

regression function of the independent variables in our model.

Coefficients estimated for this model are directly comparable to

those from a log patents regression; we have merely taken account of

the fact that the dependent variable is non—negative counts rather

than continuous. Bowever, for our data, we might expect the Poisson

formulation of the model to give quite different answers from a simple

log patents regression for two reasons: first, over half of our observation

on patents are zero and many are quite small, and second, the Poisson

objective function tends to give the largest observations more weight

than least squares on log patents and therefore these observations will

have more influence on the results. This is what we find in our results,

which are shown in column 2 of Table 9, together with the OLS estimates

for comparison. The ordinary least squares estimates imply an

elasticity of patenting with respect to R&D which rises

from zero at $100,000 of R&D to well above one at a billion dollars

 of R&D. For the Poisson model on the other hand, the elasticity is one

at four million dollars of R&D and falls to one half at one billion dollars.

 This is because the very largest firms do less patenting per R&D dollar

 than would be predicted by a linear regression of log patents on log

 R&D and they are having more influence' on the Poisson estimates than the

 OLS. We show this graphically in Figure 5: what is plotted is the

predicted logarithm of patents versus the logarithm of R&D expenditures,

superimposed on the actual data. Clearly the differences in fit of the

models is most pronounced in the tails of the distribution.


     As was pointed out by 1-lousman, Hall, and Griliches, the Poisson

model is highly restrictive, since it imposes a distribution on the data

whose mean is equal to its variance. This property arises from the

independence assumed for the Poisson arrival of "events" (patent applications)

and is unlikely to be true, even approximately, of our data. One way

out of this problem is the negative binomial model in which the Poisson

parameter is drawn from a gamma distribution with parameters exp(XB) and

6. We estimated such a model in the third column of Table 9 and found

that the results, although qualitatively closer to the ordinary least

squares estimates than to the Poisson, produce quite different predictions

over the range of the data and imply a lower and less varying elasticity

of patenting with respect to R&D. The range of elasticities is now

.55 at $100,000 in R&D to .66 at one billion dollars. A typical firm with

zero or missing R&D is predicted to have applied for 1.3 patents in 1976,

as opposed to 2.4 under the OLS model.

      A defect of the negative binomial model is that it imposes a specific

 distribution, namely gamma, on the multiplicative disturbance. Unlike

 the least squares case, if this distribution is wrongly specified,

 the resulting maximum likelihood estimates nay be inconsistent. For this

 reason and because of the large swings in our estimates under the models

 we tried, we also estimated our model with nonlinear least squares using patents

 as the dependent variable, which was proved     by Gourieroux, Montfort,

 and Trognon (1982) to be consistent for a wide class of Poisson—type models.

 This produced the result shown in the last column of Table 9. The discrepancies

 between these estimates and those of the Poisson model are a kind of

 "specification" test, since both are consistent estimates of a large class


 of count models with additive or
                                    multiplicative disturbances. Our data,
however, have one feature which violates the assumptions of most of these

models: not only is the residual variance of patents larger than the mean,

but the ratio increases as the magnitude of the exogenous variables

(R&D) increases (see Hausman, Hall, and Griliches (1981)). This implies a

correlation between the X's in the model and the disturbance which can

lead to inconsistent estimates of the
                                        slope parameters. Figure 5,
which displays the nonzero portion of the data distribution with the

predictions for our various specifications superimposed, reveals that

in trying to impose a quadratic on our data to look for scale effects

we may mislead ourselves seriously because of the very -large range of the

data and the peculiar distribution of the dependent variable. It appears

that the form we choose for the error distribution of the patents variable

will have a considerable effect on the results. It should be emphasized

that this result does not depend only on the large number of zero observations

in the data: we obtained qualitatively the same results when we reestirnated

including only those firms with both nonzero patents and R&D. -

        For both these reasons, increasing variance with R&D and the difficulty

of choosing a proper functional form for both tails of the distribution

simultaneously, we chose to look at the interesting questions in this

data, which are the existence of a patenting threshold and the measurement

of returns to scale at the upper end of the R&D distribution, by dividing

the sample into two parts, using R&D as a the selection variable. To do

this, we first plotted the patents—R&D ratio for firms with both patents

and R&D grouped by R&D size class as shown in Figure 6. This plot is

consistent with a patenting elasticity of considerably less than one up

to about one or two million dollars of R&D and an elasticity of about

one after that, with a hint of downturn at the upper end (above 100 million).

Accordingly, we divided our sample into two groups: those with R&D

greater than two million and those with R&D less than two million or

missing.

        The coefficients of interest from estimates on the two groups of

firms   are shown in Table 10 and the differences between them are
striking. The small firms show both the features we might have expected:
the Poisson—type models all are quite different from OLS on log patents,
since   most of these firms have less than five patents, and the estimates are

all much closer to each other, since the problem of inconsistency arising

from the increasing variance of patents is considerably mitigated. Substantively,

there is no real evidence of curvature in the relationship of R&D and

patents at this end of the distribution and the elasticity of patenting

with respect to R&D is close to the earlier estimates for large firms,

albeit not very well determined!1

     Turning to the larger firms, as we might expect since the range of R&D

is about ten times that of the smaller firms, there is considerably more

variation in the estimates. The log patents regression estimates are

much closer to the others, since the integer nature of the patents data is

not much of a problem here. However, there does seem to be some evidence

of a decrease in the elasticity of patenting with respect to R&D for the

largest firms. The Poisson and nonlinear least squares estimates exhibit

increasing returns up to about 20—40 million dollars of R&D and then

start declining whereas the OLS and negative binomial estimates show

decreasing returns with a slightly higher elasticity than the smaller

firms throughout. It is clear, however that we have not really solved

the specification problem for these large firms. The predicted values

from these estimates exhibit nearly the same sensitivity to exactly how we

weight the observations as did those from the whole sample. Our tentative

conclusion is that there is nearly constant returns to scale in

patenting throughout the range of R&D above two million dollars,

with decreasing returns setting in some place above 100 million

dollars.

VI.   Conclusion

           We began this paper with a question to which we can now

provide at least a partial answer. We have seen that research and

development is done across all manufacturing industries with much

higher intensities in such technologically progressive industries as

chemicals, drugs, computing equipment, communication equipment, and

professional and scientific instruments. We have found an elasticity

of R&D with respect to sales of close to unity, but we also found

significant non—linearity in the relationship, implying that both very

small and very large firms are more R&D intensive than average size

firms.1' This effect remained after an attempt to account for the

(possibly) non—random selection of the dependent variable, although the

lack of an exclusion restriction in this procedure casts some doubt

on the completeness of this correction. We also found evidence of

complementarity between capital intensity and R&D intensity, which

was increased when we corrected for the selectivity of R&D.

      These results are contrary to the preponderance of previous work

on the size—R&D intensity relationship.12 Ramberg (1964) and Comanor (1967)

found a weakly decreasing relationship between R&D intensity and firm size.

Scherer (l965a) found that R&D intensity increased with firm size up to an

intermediate level, and then decreased, except in the chemical and petroleum

industries, in which it increased throughout. This has been interepreted

to imply, for most industries, a threshold size necessary before R&D is

performed, presumably because of fixed costs in performing R&D (Kamien

and Schwartz (1975)). As noted above, our results suggest the opposite,

though the selectivity issue precludes a definitive conclusion. In any
                                 —47—




 case, these data cast strong doubt on the existence of any significant

 R&D threshold!3

      There are several possible reasons for these conflicting results.

First, earlier studies were based on smaller samples of larger companies,

of the Fortune 500 variety. An attempt was made to approximate these

samples by estimating equation (3) of Table 6 on those firms with sales

of $500 million or more (256 observations). This regression indicates

that this sample difference is not the source of the discrepancy; the

relationship was close to linear with an implied elasticity of R&D with

respect to sales of 1.23 at sales of $1 billion.14

     In addition, our R&D variable is an expenditure variable, whereas

much of the previous work used the nunber of R&D employees. If R&D

expenditures per research employee rise fast enough with increasing

firm size, perhaps because of greater capital intensity of R&D, we

would expect the observed difference in the results. It is not possible,

with these data, to test this hypothesis.

     Finally, it is possible that the size—R&D intensity relationship

has changed since the earlier work was done. 15   Becuase this work

did not look at small firms at all, it would be sufficient to postulate

increased relative R&D intensity by the largest firms to reconcile their

results with ours. We hope that our examination of the time—series

component of this data set will shed some light on this question.

     Turning to the second question in our title, we have found that some,

but not all of the firms which do R&D also patent, and that there is a

strong relationship between the two activities throughout our sample.

The small firms which do R&D tend to patent more per R&D dollar than
                                 —48—

larger firms, and firms with R&D programs larger than about one or two

million dollars have a nearly constant ratio of patenting to R&D

throughout the sample except for the firms with the very largest R&D

programs -

     Previous research on the relationship of R&D and patenting, in

particular Scherer (1965), has tended to focus on the largest U.S. corporations.

Scherer found an elasticity of patenting with respect to R&D employment of

unity with a hint of diminishing returns at the highest R&D input intensity.

Our data do not contradict this result, but they do suggest that for these

larger firms the elasticity of patenting with respect to R&D may have

fallen slightly between 1955 and 1976. However, measurement issues cloud

this conclusion since we are relating contemporary R&D expenditures and

successful patent applications while Scherer looks at patents granted

and the number of R&D employees (lagged by four years). It is not

easy to say a priori which relationship will be most free of noise, and we

must wait for time series studies to give us a better reading on the

precise relationship of the two variables. Work thus far (Pakes and

Griliches (1981), Fakes (1981)) has shown a strong contemporaneous

relationship of R&D and patent applications, but also found a total

elasticity closer to one when lagged R&D is included.

     These data also confirm and extend what others, including Scherer,

have observed: a higher output of patents per R&D dollar for smaller

fins. However, our results are for many more smaller firms than previously,

and they show much sharper decreasing returns both in the measured

elasticity and in the basic patents to R&D ratio. We also found that

for this sample it mattered very much whether we used a model and estimation

method which allowed for zero—valued observations.
                                 —49—



      In looking at these results on smaller firms, however, it is

important to emphasize that although we include all manufacturing firms

in our sample, whether or not they do R&D or patent, there is another

kind of selectivity at work: for a smaller firm, whether or not it

appears on the Compustat file in the first place is a sign of success

of some sort, or of a need for   capital. The basic definition which

gets a firm into the sample (if it is not automatically included

due to being traded on a major stock exchange) is "commands sufficient

investor interest." One of the likely causes of interest is a successful

R&D program, and hence some patent applications. Thus we tend to

observe small firms only when they have become "successful",

whereas almost all large firms are publicly traded and will appear in

our sample whether or not they have been particularly successful

recently in research or innovation. We find it difficult to argue

purely from this data that small firms have a higher return to R&D

when we have reason to believe that only those whith are successful

at it are likely to be in our sample in the first place.

     This is our first exploration of this rather large and rich data

set. We hope to focus in the near future on the time series characteristics

of these data. We expect to be able to construct a consistent set of data

for at least seven years (1972—1978) for over a thousand firms. This

should allow us to investigate more thoroughly some of these same questions

and also many other aspects of R&D and patenting behavior.

1.     This limitation is primarily for convenience; about 97% of company—

       sponsored R&D was performed in the manufacturing sector in 1976

       (NSF, 1978). It does, however, exclude a few large performers of

       R&D in the communications and computer service industries.


2.     The vast majority of patents are owned by principal companies. In

       our earlier sample about ten percent of total patents were accounted

       for by patents of subsidiaries.


3.     The "not significant" code is a 1977 Compustat innovation which appears

       in 1976 data only for the Full Coverage tape companies.


4.     Or, more recently "not significant". See previous note.


5.     Also included in "missing", are companies that reported R&D but

       Compustat concluded that their definition of R&D did not conform.
  6.   This comparison of the definitions in the two surveys is drawn from

       a letter detailing the differences from Milton Eisen, Chief, Industry

       Division, Bureau of the Census, to Hr. William L. Stewart, R&D

       Economic Studies Section, Division of Science Resources Studies,

       National Science Foundation, in April 1978.


  7.   Leamer (1978) suggests using critical values for this F—test based

       on Bayesian analysis with a diffuse prior as a solution to the old

       problem of almost certain rejection of the null hypothesis with a

       sufficiently large sample. Using his formula (page 114), the 5% level

       for this F—test is 7.8, implying that we would accept the hypothesis

       of equal slopes in this data.


  8.   Average sales for reporting firms is $620 million, for non—reporting

       firms, $240 million.
  9.   Scherer (1981), using data on 443 large industrial corporations comprising
       59 percent of corporate patenting activity in the U.S., found an R&D cost per
       patent of $588,000 for the period June 1976 through March 1977 (adjusted to
       (annual basis).
10.    We also looked at this question for two different size classes of firms:

       above and below 100 million dollars in gross plant. We found that

       the smaller firms had a lower R&D coefficient (.26 in contrast to .36)

       and slightly less curvature. For these firms, the industry dummies

       were completely insignificant, whereas they remained at about the same

       level for the large firms.

11.    It should be emphasized, however, that our finding of increasing

       R&D intensity as firm size rises does not necessarily imply returns

       to scale in research and development unless one assumes homogeneity

       of some degree in the R&D production function (see Fisher and Temin

       (1973 and 1979)).

12.    See Kamien and Schwartz (1975) for a summary.
13. These data also do not support the existence of a peculiar size—R&D

     thtensity relationship in the chemical or petroleum industries.

14. The coefficients (standard errors) were log sales, 1.29 (.61),

    log sales squared, —.008 (.038).

15. I-lamberg used 1960 data; Comanor used 1955 and 1960 data; Scherer

    used 1955 data.
