Adverse behavioral risk factors contribute to a large share of deaths. We examine the effects on life
expectancy (LE) and quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE) of changes in six major behavioral risk
factors over the 1960-2010 period: smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol use, and unsafe use of motor vehicles,
firearms, and poisonous substances. These risk factors have moved in opposite directions. Reduced
smoking, safer driving and cars, and reduced heavy alcohol use have led to health improvements, which
we estimate at 1.82 years of quality-adjusted life. However, these were roughly offset by increased
obesity, greater firearm deaths, and increased deaths from poisonous substances, which together reduced
quality-adjusted life expectancy by 1.77 years. We model the hypothetical effects of a 50% decline
in morbid obesity and in poisoning deaths, and a 10% decline in firearm fatalities, roughly matching
favorable trends in smoking and increased seat belt use. These changes would lead to a 0.92 year improvement
in LE and a 1.09 year improvement in QALE. Thus, substantial improvements in health by way of
behavioral improvements and public health are possible.

While health is often thought of in terms of diagnosed medical conditions, it is modifiable
behavioral risk factors such as obesity and smoking that account for the largest portion of deaths
each year.1,2 For example, Mokdad et al.1 report that in 2000, 43% of total deaths were accounted
for by six behavioral risk factors: smoking (18%), obesity (17%), alcohol consumption (4%),
motor vehicle accidents (2%), firearms (1%), and illicit drug use (1%).


In addition to affecting mortality, these modifiable behavioral factors have significant effects on
health-related quality of life (HRQOL).3,4,5,6 Smoking, heavy alcohol use, and obesity have been
causally linked to a myriad of diseases and symptoms,6,7,8 and injuries from motor vehicle
accidents and firearms can be severe. When feasible, considering this nonfatal impact can
provide a more comprehensive picture of the health outcomes attributable to these factors.


Behavioral and public health interventions have been very successful in reducing the harms of
some of these factors.1,9 Deaths from smoking and (to a lesser extent) motor vehicle accidents
have declined markedly over time.9 Other factors, such obesity1 and drug overdose,10 have
worsened. On net, there is little understanding of how these risk factor changes as a whole have
contributed to U.S. health trends.


This paper examines the effects of changes in six major behavioral factors on HRQOL and
mortality from 1960 to 2010: smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol use, and unsafe use of motor
vehicles, firearms, and poisonous substances. For the factors that have improved, we evaluate
how much improvement there has been in length and quality of life. For those that have
deteriorated, we simulate the hypothetical gain achievable through effective public health
interventions and behavioral change targeting these factors.


In each case, we try to differentiate medical from non-medical changes. In the case of smoking,
for example, cigarette consumption has declined by over half, and medical care has extended life
for people with cardiovascular disease.11 Our primary focus is on the non-medical changes. We
separate the medical from the non-medical changes as we are able to do so. Unfortunately, we
generally do not have enough evidence to differentiate amongst sources of non-medical
improvement or decrement: behavioral health, public health measures, or other causes.

                                                 Methods


For each of the six behavioral risk factors that we considered-- smoking, obesity, heavy alcohol
use, and unsafe use of motor vehicles, firearms, and poisonous substances--our goal was to
measure changes in health-related quality of life, including both mortality and morbidity, over
the past several decades.


The data sources and methods for each of the risk factors that we considered are shown in Table
1. For smoking, obesity, and alcohol use, we had consistent measures of prevalence over time,
and could examine the effects of both fatal and nonfatal exposures. For these conditions, there
were multiple steps to the analysis: measuring the historical trend in the prevalence of the risk
factor, and evaluating how it has affected both length and quality of life. We describe each of
these further below.

For motor vehicle accidents, firearms, and accidental poisoning, there are multiple underlying
behaviors and factors that can affect a person’s risk. For example, in the case of motor vehicles,
these can include reckless, distracted, or impaired driving, failure to use a seat belt, and the
safety features of roads and vehicles.12 For firearms, they include factors such as secure storage,
locking devices, safety training, community-based prevention, identification of individuals at
risk of misuse, and laws regarding firearm acquisition and possession.13,14 These factors can be
difficult or impossible to track reliably over time, and they can affect both the risk of an incident
and the extent of resulting injury. In addition, for nonfatal motor vehicle accidents, firearm injury,
and drug misuse, HRQOL is difficult to account for due to a lack of consistent data on non-fatal
outcomes and to changes over time in the number and severity of injuries. Thus, as a measure of
the effect of these risk factors over time, we used mortality data from U.S. vital statistics.15
Motor vehicle deaths include those resulting from collisions of all types of road vehicles,
including collision of these vehicles with pedestrians and bicycles. For firearm deaths, we
considered homicides and suicides. In the accidental poisoning category, the vast majority of
deaths since the 1980s were due to unintentional overdose of prescription or illicit drugs; the
remainder resulted from exposures to other substances such as alcohol, noxious fumes and
ingested chemicals. Since we used data on mortality only, we omitted quality of life estimates for
these factors.


Motor Vehicle Accidents, Firearms, and Poisoning--Trends and Assessment. We began by
measuring trends in mortality from motor vehicle accidents, firearms, and accidental poisoning,
for all years from 1960 through 2010. To adjust for changes in the definition of motor vehicle
deaths in the different versions of the International Classification of Diseases used over this
period (ICD-7, 8, 9, and 10), we used comparability ratios provided by National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS).16,17,18 Comparability ratios were not provided for the subcategories of
firearm suicide and homicide, however these deaths are more straightforward to measure over
time, and comparability ratios for the broader categories of suicide and homicide were close to 1.
For poisoning, comparability ratios were not provided by NCHS due to insufficient sample sizes
for stable estimates. However, specific categories of poisoning match well over time. Thus, we
followed the method of a prior study examining child poisoning,19 using accidental poisoning by




	                                                3	  
solid and liquid substances in all years and excluding deaths from poisonous vapors and gases,
which includes carbon dioxide poisoning.


Modeling the Portion of Change due to Medical Care. An important consideration when using
mortality as a proxy for exposure to these risk factors is that there are medical contributions to
survival. Advances in trauma care have reduced the probability of death from motor vehicle
collisions, drug overdoses, and shootings. The proportion of population health improvement
attributable to medical care is unknown, with varying estimates derived or used in the literature,
including 10, 20, and 50%.20,21,22 The proportion also depends on whether improved access to
medical care is counted as part of medical improvement or as public health improvement. For
example, improvements in emergency response such as ‘enhanced 911’ (which provide the
precise location of callers) have sped up response times and improved patient survival.23,24


To address this uncertainty, we used the approximate median of the existing estimates and
assumed that 25% of the mortality improvements for motor vehicle accidents and poisonings
have resulted from medical care. (We did not assume a medical contribution to reduced firearm
deaths since gun suicides are nearly always fatal and comprised over half of firearm deaths. Also,
and the analysis did not allow estimation of a contribution of medical care to only the homicide
portion of deaths in the firearm category.) We performed sensitivity analyses using values of
10% and 50% for the contributions of medical care to mortality change, with any remaining
improvement attributable to behavioral and public health factors. In the case of motor vehicle
accidents, these include impaired driving prevention and surveillance, seat belt and child safety
seat use, graduated driver licensing, vehicle and road safety advances, and many more. For
prevention of drug overdose, interventions are being designed at the federal, state, local, and
insurance company level to address and prevent dangerous prescription drug addictions.10,25,26,27


Prevalence and Effects of Smoking, Obesity, and Heavy Alcohol Use. To measure the historical
distribution of body mass index (BMI), we used physical measures of height and weight from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)28 a comprehensive national
health survey that combines interviews with physical examinations. We also used its precursor,
the National Health and Examination Survey (NHES). Respondents were classified using World



	                                               4	  
Health Organization (WHO) criteria29 as underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), normal weight (18.5
to 24.9 kg/m2), overweight (25.0 to 29.9 kg/m2), obese (30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2, WHO obesity class I),
or morbidly obese (≥ 35.0 kg/m2, WHO obesity classes II and III).
Sample size considerations do not permit exact estimation of BMI by single year of age, which is
needed for the mortality estimates. To form estimates by single year of age, we used regression
analysis to assess the likelihood of being in each BMI category based on age, gender, race, and
their interactions and predicted the distribution of categories by year of age for each time period
covered by the data: 1959-1962 (NHES), 1971-75 (NHANES I) 1976-1980 (NHANES II), 1988-
1994 (NHANES III), and the continuous NHANES (2000-2010, in 2-year cycles). In essence,
this just smooths the observed data across nearby ages.


To measure the historical distribution of current and former smoking, we used data from the
National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), an ongoing health survey of the U.S. civilian non-
institutionalized population.30 Current smokers and former smokers were defined as those who
had ever smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who still smoked, or had quit, respectively. Smoking
rates were predicted by year of age in 1965 (the first year in which smoking questions were
asked in the NHIS) and 2010. To estimate smoking rates by single year of age, we used the same
smoothing process as described above for BMI.


We measured the prevalence of alcohol use in NHANES I (1971-75), NHANES III (1988-1994)
and in the continuous NHANES (2000-2010, in 2-year cycles). (Alcohol was not asked about in
the 1959-62 NHES, and we did not use NHANES II due to a difference in alcohol measurement
in that year.) We defined heavy alcohol use as 15 or more drinks per week for men and 8 or more
drinks per week for women, consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) definition.31 As with BMI and smoking, smoothed heavy alcohol use rates were predicted
by year of age from a regression of heavy drinking on age, gender, race, and their interactions.


To measure how each of these risk factors affects length of life, we estimated Cox proportional
hazard models relating each risk factor to subsequent all-cause mortality, controlling for age,
race, gender, and their interactions. For this we used data from the combined NHANES I, II, and




	                                               5	  
III surveys, matched to subsequent death records (through 1992 for NHANES I and II and 2006
for NHANES III).


To estimate the impact of BMI and smoking on HRQOL, we used data from the 2002 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS),32 which measures health status, medical expenditures, and
socioeconomic characteristics in a sample nationally representative of the U.S. community
population. Following a method that we previously developed,33 we related each risk factor
separately to a 100-point rating of overall health (the ‘visual analog scale’ from the Euroqol EQ-
5D34 health measurement instrument), controlling for age, gender, and race. From this we
predicted HRQOL weights for each risk factor by 10-year age group.


To estimate the effects of heavy alcohol use on HRQOL, we used data from the 2010 NHIS. The
NHIS does not contain a 100-point self-rating of health, but it does include a large number of
impairments and symptoms that enabled the estimation of HRQOL scores using techniques that
we developed in previous work.33,35 First, we identified the full set of impairments and symptoms
asked in both NHIS and MEPS: depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, and limitations in
primary activity (e.g. work), self-care (activities of daily living), routine needs (instrumental
activities of daily living), walking, bending, standing, dexterity, vision, and hearing. We then
regressed the 100-point rating of overall health in MEPS on this set of impairments and
symptoms. Using these regression coefficients,	  we calculated predicted HRQOL scores using this
same set of impairments and symptoms in the NHIS data. Previous analyses33 supported holding
constant the impact of each impairment and symptom over time, since the effect of a particular
impairment on HRQOL remains relatively stable over time, whereas its prevalence can change
more rapidly.


Life Expectancy and QALE Calculation. To calculate life expectancy at age 18, we used U.S. life
tables for the base year, 1960 (1973 for alcohol).36,37 To measure change in life expectancy
through 2010 due to each risk factor, we used the 2010 mortality rate for that risk factor,
otherwise holding life expectancy constant at the 1960 level (1973 for alcohol). This provided an
estimate of the life expectancy change that would have occurred if only this risk factor had
changed. For obesity, smoking, and alcohol, the 2010 mortality rate was the product of the



	                                                6	  
relative risks of mortality associated with each risk factor and the predicted share of the
population with the risk factor at each year of age in that year.


To calculate quality-adjusted life expectancy (QALE), mean HRQOL for each 10-year age group
was used to adjust remaining life expectancy at each age. For motor vehicle accidents, firearms,
and poisoning, where we were able to measure mortality but not quality of life, in order to also
obtain a QALE value, we calculated QALE using the rough assumption that HRQOL remained
constant over time. Since not all years are in perfect health, this reduces the quantity of quality-
adjusted life years relative to life years. To place a dollar value on QALE, we valued each year
of life at $100,000 and used a 3% discount rate for future years lived.


Finally, for those factors found to have worsened rather than improved over time, we performed
simulations of the potential benefit of successfully curbing these problems. Based on what was
achieved for factors that improved, we modeled the effects of similar improvements for the
factors that did not improve, simulating the hypothetical effect of this progress.



                                               Results

Trends in Behavioral Risk Factors

Of the six factors that we examined, three improved: smoking, motor vehicle deaths, and alcohol
use. The others – obesity, firearms, and poisoning – worsened over time. Table 2 shows the
percentage change in prevalence or the deaths from each risk factor over time, age-adjusted to
the 2000 population. Smoking prevalence and motor vehicle deaths showed the largest declines,
while obesity and poisoning showed the greatest increases. Figure 1 (a-g) shows the trends in
each factor, age-adjusted to the year 2000 population. Smoking is the leading preventable cause
of death; a regular smoker has a life expectancy that is about 7 years below that of a never
smoker.7	  Figure 1a shows the smoking rate among US adults over time. The rate declined by
more than half, from 42% in 1965 to 19% in 2010.38


Motor vehicle accident deaths have also declined over time, as shown in Figure 1b. Unadjusted,
the decline was 46%. However, more people had cars over time, and vehicle miles driven

†Heavy  alcohol use change is from 1973-2010. *Accounting for the increase in miles driven over this
time period, motor vehicle deaths would have increased by 234% if the death rate per mile had not
changed. Percent change in each factor using rates that are adjusted to the age distribution of the
population in the year 2000, to account for changes in the age distribution of the population over time.




increased markedly. Thus, Figure 1b also shows a counterfactual mortality rate assuming no
change in deaths per mile during this time of increased driving. That mortality rate is forecast to
have increased by 234%. Thus, the net reduction in motor vehicle mortality adjusted for miles
driven was 280%. This is believed to result from many successful public health interventions,
including safer automobiles and roads and enforcement of seat belt laws, motorcycle helmet laws,
graduated driver licensing, and impaired driving laws and penalties.12,39


Heavy use of alcohol has declined over time (Figure 1c). The change from 1971-75 to 2009-10
was -22% in relative terms, or 3 percentage points. Given the relatively low relative risk for
heavy drinking and small change in heavy drinking prevalence, this did not contribute a great
amount to population health.


Obesity has increased over time (Figure 1d); among behavioral risks, this is the major
contributor to worse health. The share of the population that is obese or morbidly obese
increased from 14% in 1959-62 to 36% in 2009-10. The increase in obesity is attributed to many
causes, including reductions in the time cost of food preparation.40


Firearm suicide and homicide (Figure 1e) increased into the 1970s and declined in the 1990s.
Firearm homicides also declined in the mid-1970s and 1980s, but rose again in the late 1980s
and early 1990s. This rise is largely attributed to the crack-cocaine drug epidemic at that time.41

Note: Mortality rates from U.S. vital statistics are adjusted for changes in the age distribution of the population over
time and for changes to the definition of motor vehicle accident (MVA) mortality across ICD (International
Classification of Diseases) versions 7-10. Includes deaths resulting from collisions of all types of road vehicles,
including collision of these vehicles with pedestrians and bicycles. The counterfactual trend reflects the increase in
deaths that would have occurred if the death rate per mile had remained at the 1960 rate while driving rates (number
of miles driven) increased over time. The drop in this trend in 2007-2009 reflects a decline in miles driven,
coinciding with the Great Recession.

Note: Categories of body-mass index (BMI, the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters)
were defined according to the World Health Organization criteria: underweight (BMI <18.5), normal weight (BMI
18.5 to 24.9), overweight (BMI 25.0 to 29.9), obese (BMI 30.0 to 34.9; obesity class I), and morbidly obese (BMI
!35.0; obesity classes II and III). Underweight is shown in figure but not used in calculating life expectancy because
low BMI can be indicative of pre-existing illness.42 Data are from the National Health Examination and the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Rates in each year are age-adjusted to the 2000 population.

Note: Mortality rates from U.S. vital statistics. Drug overdose includes accidental death from prescription,
over-the-counter, and illicit “drugs, medicaments and biological substances.”43 The broader category of deaths
due to accidental “poisoning by and exposure to all solids and liquids” includes these drug substances as well
as alcohol, pesticides, “organic solvents and halogenated hydrocarbons and their vapours”, and “other and
unspecified chemicals and noxious substances”, but excludes deaths due to “other gases and vapors” 44 Rates in
each year are age-adjusted to the 2000 population. Note difference in scale compared to Figure b.

Firearm homicides have declined by nearly 50% since that peak in the 1990s.45 Firearm
homicides changed little through the 2000s, and declined in the most recent years. Firearm
suicides declined slightly in the mid-2000s, with an uptick in the most recent years. The net
change over the past half-century was a slight increase 0.7 percentage points for gun homicide
and 0.2 percentage points for gun suicide.


Finally, deaths due to poisoning (Figure 1f) increased dramatically over the past 20 years. The
vast bulk of this is overdose of drugs, particularly prescription opioid medications, which has
more than quadrupled since 1999.10,46 This increase overwhelmed a decline in infant and child
poisoning since the 1960s (findings by age not shown). Poisoning deaths do not include
intentional suicides or deaths due to accidents of undetermined intent, which are measured
separately by the CDC. While the dramatic rate of increase in drug deaths slowed slightly from
2006 to 2010, during this time the rate of alcohol poisoning suddenly increased among all age
groups. Explanations for this include increased frequency of binge drinking during the Great
Recession of late 2007 to mid-2009,47 and increased use of caffeinated energy drinks containing
alcohol; these energy drinks increase consumption of alcohol during binge drinking by masking
the depressive effect of alcohol.48


Changes in QALE
Table 3 shows relative risks of all-cause mortality by smoking status, BMI status, and alcohol
consumption calculated using separate Cox proportional hazards models for each risk factor.
Current smokers had the greatest relative risks of death, followed by those who were morbidly
obese and heavy drinkers. The effects on HRQOL of smoking, BMI category, and heavy alcohol
use are shown in Table 4. As expected, mean quality of life was worse for current smokers than
never smokers. Those in the morbid obese category had HRQOL similar to smokers. The
HRQOL of those in the obese category was higher than for smokers but not as high as that of
those in the normal weight or overweight categories. Heavy alcohol users had HRQOL scores
essentially the same as non-heavy users.


The changes in life expectancy (LE) and QALE for each risk factor that we estimate to be
attributable to public health interventions and behavioral change are shown in Table 5, which

Notes: Body mass index (BMI) was based on measured weight and height and categorized according to the World

least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and smoked now. Heavy alcohol use was defined as 15+ drinks/week for men
and 8+ drinks/week for women. Separate regression models were fit for deaths that occurred before and at/after age
65. Deaths among those under age 65 were left censored in the first model, and deaths among age 65+ were right
censored in the second. (The SAS entry= option was used with proc phreg) Fifty percent of the sample in our
analyses attained age 65 or greater. Those lost to follow-up were assigned a survival time of ½ the possible survival
interval before the time when they were lost, but were censored on mortality. Models also included race: white
(including Hispanic), black, and other, and age in 5-year age groups (coefficients not shown). These analyses omit
those under age 25 and those who died within the first 4 years of follow-up. BMI analyses excluded those who were
underweight at baseline because this can be indicative of pre-existing illness.42 Analyses used the Naitonal Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys I, II, and III, linked to the National Death Index (NDI).

separates factors into those that improved and those that worsened and ranks them by the
magnitude of these effects. Reduced smoking has had the largest effect, improving life
expectancy by 1.26 years and QALE by 1.42 years. Reductions in motor vehicle fatalities
affected fewer individuals but also had an important effect of improving population life
expectancy, by 0.43 years. To put the magnitude of these improvements in context, the total life
expectancy improvement at age 18 over the past half-century was about 7 years; we do not have
a comparable QALE estimate because quality of life data are not available for 1960. In terms of
life expectancy, therefore, the factors that improved LE accounted for 25% of the total. Valuing
the total effect of the factors that improved in dollars, the QALE gain is over $65,000 per person
over the course of his or her adult life.

 Excluding 25% of improvement assumed to be attributable to improvements in medical care.

Note: LE = life expectancy; QALE = quality-adjusted life expectancy; QOL = quality of life



Of the factors that worsened, obesity had the largest effect, reducing LE by one year and QALE
by over a year and a half. Increases in accidental poisoning deaths held back LE improvement by
over a quarter of a year. Accounting for the contribution of medical advances to improved
survival of poisoning victims over time means that poisoning events occurred even more
frequently than the mortality data indicate. In this case because the effect of behavioral change

	                                               14	  
for poisoning was negative, we accounted for the improvement in medical care by increasing the
behavioral effect to 125%. Firearm suicide and homicides, which worsened slightly overall, held
back LE by a small amount, 0.03 years. The total dollar value associated with QALE not gained
due to the three worsening factors combined was about $64,000; only slightly less than the
$65,000 gained from factors that improved.


The results of our sensitivity analyses on the proportion of mortality improvement attributable to
medical care are shown in Table 6. Whether medical care accounts for as little as 10% or as
much as 50% of the improvement, the remaining improvement in motor vehicle mortality
attributable to public health and behavioral change remains large, accounting for a gain in life
expectancy between one-half and one-third of a year from 1960 to 2010. For poisoning deaths,
the extent of the public health problem varied little with the magnitude of the assumed medical
benefit; poisoning held back LE improvement by between 0.23 and 0.31 year, depending on the
extent to which medical care may have prevented additional overdose deaths. The total net effect
of public health and behavioral change on life expectancy for all six factors was estimated to
vary between 0.57 and 0.25 year depending on the assumed effect of medical care in preventing
motor vehicle and poisoning deaths.

Note: For motor vehicle deaths, we model results assuming that a portion of the observed mortality
improvement (25%, 10%, and 50%) was due to medical care. For poisoning deaths, we assume that
mortality would have worsened even more than observed if not for the effect of medical care; thus we
model an increase in the effect of behavioral change and public health interventions (125%, 110%, and
150%). Last row shows the net effect on life expectancy change of all six risk factors we considered.

Impact of Reversing Trends
Table 7 shows the results of simulated improvements for obesity, poisoning, and firearm
suicide/homicide. These were hypothetical scenarios in which we modeled the effect of progress
that might be possible if public health and behavioral changes could be achieved in these areas at
levels similar to those seen with smoking or motor vehicle accidents. We did not assume that we
could completely reverse the negative factors, returning the population to 1960 rates, since this
would be unrealistic; looking back at the dramatic reduction in smoking, it was far from
completely eliminated. Rather, it was reduced by about half. Thus, we chose to model a 50%
decline in morbid obesity (and a corresponding increase in normal weight), since morbid obesity
was the major driver of ill effects of high BMI. Similarly, we modeled a 50% reduction in
accidental poisoning (primarily drug overdose) deaths.


In estimating what would be a comparable rate of progress for firearm fatalities, we considered
firearm safety as approximately equivalent to convincing people to wear a seat belt. The
literature on motor vehicle interventions estimates that primary seat belt laws (allowing ticketing
for not wearing a seat belt with no other traffic offense) resulted in about a 10% reduction in
motor vehicle deaths.39 We thus modeled the effect of a hypothetical firearm intervention with a
similar impact. The positive effect on overall life expectancy was fairly small, primarily because
firearm morality had already declined since its peak in the 1980s and 1990s.


As Table 7 shows, these simulated improvements yielded 0.92 years of improved life expectancy
together and 1.09 years of increased quality-adjusted life expectancy. These are substantial. For

since 1960. The gain in reduced poisoning deaths would be about one-third of the gain from
reduced motor vehicle deaths since 1960.



                                             Discussion

Declines in just two factors--smoking and motor vehicle accident deaths--account for a
substantial portion (one-quarter) of the improvement in population quality-adjusted life
expectancy over the past half-century, demonstrating the important impact of behavior change
and public health interventions. Though the mortality decline from reduced smoking is well
known, we also quantify the effect of this decline on nonfatal health.


Of the other factors that we consider, slight reductions in heavy alcohol use also had a small
positive effect, while slight increases in firearm suicide and homicide had a negative effect on
population health. Substantially holding back population QALE improvement over the past 50
years were increases in obesity and drug overdose deaths. Our simulations indicate the extent of
improvement that could be achieved with effective public health interventions to address the
worrisome trends in these harmful factors, if we can repeat in these areas the success we’ve had
in others. Our simulation suggests that progress on obesity and accidental poisoning comparable
to that made on smoking in the past half century would have an effect on health almost three
fourths the size of the large (1.26 year) effect of the reduction in smoking on life expectancy.


Implications for Practice
Following the examples of the various effective interventions in the areas of tobacco,7 motor
vehicle accidents,39 and child poisoning,19 Hemenway and colleagues13,14 have proposed many
analogous ways in which similar progress could be made in reducing firearm deaths, including
regulation, taxation, safety training, and identification and counseling of at-risk individuals. In
the case of accidental poisoning, rapidly growing abuse of prescription medications, which is
also known to serve as a gateway to the use of illegal drugs, is currently gaining widespread
attention, garnering efforts to better understand and address the problem, in part by detecting and
reducing over-prescription of the most problematic medications.25,46,49 The recent increases in



	                                               17	  
alcohol poisoning deaths underline the importance of increased efforts to reduce binge drinking
and discourage the mixing of alcohol with energy drinks.48


Prevention of obesity, particularly among children, has been a key focus in recent years, but it
has been difficult to combat the roots of obesity, including sedentary lifestyles, insufficient
physical activity, widespread availability of high-calorie food in large portions, and reduced time
available for food preparation in the home50,51,52,53,54 Those with low incomes face unique
challenges in adopting healthful behaviors, including reduced or inconsistent access to affordable
healthy food of good quality, greater availability of fast food restaurants, reduced physical
activity resources, reduced access to quality health care, and greater exposure to advertising of
obesity-promoting products.55 Continued efforts to address these problems will be essential in
order to reduce death and disability resulting from high BMI.


Among those already obese, the clinical efficacy of a number of weight loss interventions has
been demonstrated56 and there is encouraging evidence that even modest weight loss can have
important impacts on public health.56 The challenge is to increase the use of these interventions,
as well as providing ongoing support to help individuals maintain weight loss in the long-term.
Complementary interventions include those affecting food consumption (e.g. nutrition labeling,
taxation and subsidy of specific foods57 or nutrients58) and increasing access to healthy foods and
exercise opportunities within communities.59


Alcohol use can also be reduced through taxation, and restrictions on alcohol availability.60
However, in order to further combat the effects of heavy and binge drinking, these strategies
must be combined with others that are known to be effective, including information
dissemination, early intervention by primary physicians, and behavioral and pharmacological
interventions to treat alcohol dependence.60


Finally, continued progress is crucial in the areas where we have seen success; increasing the use
of proven methods to prevent youth smoking and achieve smoking cessation,31 and broadening
the adoption of laws and practices that improve the safety of vehicles, roads, drivers, passengers,
pedestrians, and those riding bicycles.12 Measures to address the safety of older drivers and



	                                               18	  
pedestrians will be increasingly important as the population ages.12 Promising new technological
interventions to save lives in motor vehicle accidents include features to help first responders
more quickly access vital information, such as Google Glass,61 vehicles with the ability to
automatically contact emergency workers in the case of a collision, and quick response (QR)
codes that provide internal vehicle diagrams to emergency rescue workers.62


Implications for Research
Our findings underline the importance of research to understand the roots of behavioral health
problems and develop successful interventions and implementation strategies. The dramatic
lifesaving effect of prior research is demonstrated most poignantly for smoking and motor
vehicle fatalities.7, 39 The skyrocketing rates of poisoning deaths, driven in particular by
prescription drug overdose, point to an urgent need for research on the prevention and treatment
of prescription drug addiction. Additional research on the impact of firearm interventions, which
has lagged behind research on other behavioral causes of death, will also be critical to addressing
this social problem. Finally, continued research is required to understand specific pathways to
the development of obesity, heavy alcohol use, and binge drinking habits, and to test the most
effective ways to broaden the use of strategies already known to be effective in reducing the
harms of all of these behavioral risk factors.


Limitations
Our study has some limitations. While it quantifies the effects of some major causes of mortality
and morbidity, it does not account for the many other factors that determine life expectancy and
HRQOL, such as genetics, environmental toxins, and stress. Also, the impact of different BMI
levels on mortality is a matter of ongoing debate.63 However, we have calculated our relative
risks of mortality directly in nationally representative data and have found our past results to be
robust to sensitivity analyses using other published relative risks.3,42,64


We measured HRQOL associated with obesity, smoking, and heavy alcohol use at a single point
in time, since quality-of-life data were not available over our extended time period of analysis.
While we would not expect the ill-effects of these behaviors to change nearly as rapidly as their
prevalence, the morbidity associated with them may have been worsened or improved by various



	                                                19	  
factors, including intensity of smoking and alcohol use, diet quality and activity level, and
improved medical treatment of diseases associated with behavioral risk factors.11,65,66


Finally, our study uses the period life table approach, which assumes that as cohorts age, the
distribution of their risk factors will change to reflect the distribution among people currently
living at these older ages. However in the case of BMI, though obesity prevalence may be
stabilizing50,67 population BMI levels will rise with the aging of current younger cohorts, among
whom obesity rates are (or were recently) at a historical high.67 The effects of obesity on health
occur primarily via disease, and the prevalence of diabetes in particular is at an all-time high and
continues to increase. Our prior work forecasting alternate future scenarios concluded that the
obesity increases would outweigh the benefits of smoking declines.3 This is where medical care
can have an important effect; an encouraging finding is the improved control of cardiovascular
risk factors such as high cholesterol and hypertension, particularly among those who are
overweight and obese.65 More recently, a sharp decrease in complications has been found among
those with diabetes.66 Improved treatment of obesity-related diseases is thus vital to improving
the Nation’s health.


                                            Conclusion

The benefits of behavioral and public health advances, where they have occurred, have been
large; nearly 2 additional years of life primarily from improvements in just two main factors—
smoking and motor vehicle accidents. In addition to reduced mortality, this accounts for quality
of life improvements due to reduced smoking. However, these improvements are
counterbalanced by declines in health due to other factors, primarily obesity and accidental drug
overdose. These are fairly untapped areas in which progress could provide significant benefits,
but they have proven more difficult to address. Our study demonstrates the enormous benefit of
public health and behavioral change in improving population health, underscoring the
importance of continued advances in these areas of research and practice.
