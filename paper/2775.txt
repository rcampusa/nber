                                        ABSTRACT




                      This paper discusses exchange rate issues in advanced and

in developing countries. For the determination of exchange rates among

industrialized countries the key question is the following: What is the

right framework- -   the   monetary approach, the equilibrium approach, the new

classical approach or the macroeconomic model in the tradition of Mundell-

Fleming. To shed light on that question two empirical problems are

considered: What is known about the behavior of real exchange rates and how

well do alternative models explain the relation among interest rates,

expected depreciation and actual depreciation.

          The second half of the paper discusses real exchange rates in

developing countries. This strand of literature has become important in the

context of adjustment programs. We focus on the relation between real

exchange rates and the profitability of capital. The model highlights the

sharp discrepancy between the mobility of capital (even physical capital, in

the long run) and the immobility of labor.

                     This paper discusses exchange rate issues in advanced and

in developing countries. For the determination of exchange rates among

industrialized countries the key question is the following: What is the

right framework- -   the monetary approach, the equilibrium approach, the new
classical approach or the macroeconomic model in the tradition of Mundell-

Fleming. To shed light on that question two empirical problems are

considered: What is known about the behavior of real exchange rates and how

well do alternative models explain the relation among interest rates,

expected depreciation and actual depreciation.

                      After twenty or thirty years of exchange rate modelling,

from the work of Meade and Mundell to the New Classical Economics, we are

left with an uncomfortable recognition that our understanding of exchange

rate movements is less than satisfactory. Most models have lost their

ability to explain what has happened, when exchange rates moved a lot, as in

the l980s. The dollar movements of the 1980s are to open economy

macroeconomics what the Great Depression has been to macroeconomics- - a

baffling, largely unexplained phenomenon. For some approaches the

explanation has to rely on mystical productivity shocks, other approaches
                                      2



now use models of asset markets that consciously reject conventional

rationality.
                   The uncertainty about the relevant model spills over to

policy advice. Recommendations abound. They range from a return to a managed

system of target zones to dual exchange rates, financial transactions taxes

and doing nothing. None of the recommendations has a firm basis, but the

activist ones reflect a belief that when one does not understand what is

going on it is good to tie down      things. Others believe that nailing

dow-n variables may simply shift the problem from one market to another, and

they therefore prefer to tax speculative activity directly. Taxing

speculative activity is justified, in their opinion, because such activity

generates negative externalities. By contrast, the equilibrium approach

views even large exchange rate movements as the reflection of market

adjustments to disturbances and sees no need for policy intervention. On the

contrary, equilibrium theorists argue that policy will lead at the best to

extra noise and will more likely lead to distortions.

                   The second half of the paper raises some issues about

real exchange rates in developing countries. This is an entirely different

strand of literature, which has become important in the context of

adjustment programs in developing countries. We focus on the relation

between real exchange rates and the profitability of capital. The model we

present highlights the sharp discrepancy between the mobility of capital

(even physical capital, in the long run) and the immobility of labor.

                   We begin our discussion now with alternative approaches

to exchange rate economics in industrial countries.

 I .REAL EXCHANGE RATES AMONG INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES IN THE LONG RUN

             Figure 1   shows the real exchange rate (using CDP deflators) between

 Sweden and the US. The figure shows more than one hundred years of annual

 data. Two patterns are of interest. One is the year-to-year fluctuations as

 for example in the early 1920s or the 1980s. The other is changes in the

 decadal averages.

              The barter theory of international trade provides a suitable

 framework for the analysis of real exchange rates in the long run. This

  theory emphasizes that real exchange rates are determined by resource

  endowments, tastes, technology, and intertemporal saving and investment

  choices. In the short run, it may be superseded (in ways to be explored

 below) by macroeconomic considerations, including price stickiness. But over

  a horizon of decades these factors cannot possibly matter (except in so far

  as they influence growth performance); and, hence, the microeconomic

  framework is appropriate.

              We emphasize at the outset the relevance of the barter model of

  trade for long run real exchange rate economics, not purchasing power parity

  (PPP). Samuelson (1964,p.153) aptly summarized the discussion on PPP when he

  wrote:

            "Unless very sophisticated, indeed, PPP is a misleading, pretentious
            doctrine, promising what is rare in economics, detailed numerical
            prediction."

              The   idea that exchange rate movements tend to offset (passively)
divergent   trends in national rates of inflation was discredited virtually on
                                         4


conception. The hyperinflation in Germany and Central Europe was an extreme

counterexamPle as was the French experience prior to the Poincare

stabilization. The 1970s and early 1980s have simply brought additional

confirmation for the proposition that PPP does not hold in any form.

              To explore the relationships between exchange rates and prices it

is useful to separate out long-term trends in real exchange rates from

movements in the short run. Whatever one's macroeconomic persuasion, the long

run trends of real exchange rates must certainly be interpreted in terms of

microeconomic models of resource allocation. We introduce here a Ricardian

model of real exchange rates and use it to review the evidence developed by

Kravis (1986) and his associates.



Trends in Real Exchange Rates: Ricardo, Harrod, Samuelson, Balassa and Irving

Kravis argue that movements of real exchange rates over time reflect the

divergent trends of productivity between home goods and traded goods sectors.

              Let P and * be the home and foreign consumer price levels measured

in a common currency. Suppose, as in Dornbusch, Fischer and Samuelson (1977)

that there are traded goods and home goods with prices T and N' and let 1-k
                                                                                  is
be the share of nontraded goods in spending. Then the real exchange rate, R,

given by



        R —        — (PN/PN*)l                                          (1)




where we have assumed that the prices of traded goods are equalized and that

expenditure shares are equal across countries. Let      —
                                                            aNW,
                                                                   and PN* — aN*W* be
                                          S



the unit labor costs in the home goods sector. Then the real exchange rate is

equal to:



        R —                                                           (2)


where v is a function of the given relative unit labor requirements in the home

goods sector. The model is closed by noting that the relative wage must solve

the goods market equilibrium condition:



                                              — (W/W*,A);
       WN — (WN+W*N*) + (l-k)(WN+TN);                       1<0,2>0         (3)




where N and N* denote the home and foreign labor force and T is a (per capita)

transfer received by the home country, and numerical subscripts denote the

derivatives with respect to the arguments. The term A denotes the relative

level of home country technical efficiency requirements. The expenditure share

falling on the home country's tradables is     and has a maximum value of k. The

share of spending falling on home goods in each country is a constant 1-k. The

expenditure share of domestic tradeables is determined by efficient geographic

specialization. An increase in the relative wage, given technology, reduces the

share. But a relative improvement in home technology, or an increase in the

shift parameter A, raises the share of goods produced competitively by the home

economy.

              Equation (3) can be solved for the equilibrium relative wage,
                                        6




            — ic(T, N*/N,A);   "T'A ' cN*/N >0                      (4)




            The equilibrium relative wage in (4) shows a central result of

Ricardian trade theory: an improvement in a country's relative efficiency (a

rise in A) leads to real appreciation. The mechanism is simply the following:

The gain in productivity reduces unit labor costs at the competitive margin and

thereby leads to an incipient expansion in output and employment. The excess

demand for labor at home (and the excess supply abroad) bring about a change in

the relative wage and hence in the competitive margin. The real exchange rate

appreciates, because wages at home rise in the home goods sector and they fall

abroad. The wage increase raises costs and prices of nontraded goods at home

while lowering them abroad where there was no progress. This movement of home

                                                                  transmitted via
goods prices, initiated by productivity growth in tradables and

the labor market, is the source of the real appreciation.

            Support for this theory was adduced first by Balassa and then, in a

major way, by Kravis and his associates in the context of the national income

comparison project of the World Bank. Table 1 reports one set of results from

this research. Kravis and his associates show that the real price structure of

a large group of countries shows an systematic correlation with the level of

per capita income. Specifically, prices of services are low in poor countries

relative to rich countries. Even goods prices (at the consumer level) are low,

because delivered prices have a significant service component.

              The data reported in Table 1 are built up from detailed consumer

price data for closely comparable consumption baskets with equal weighting. The

price comparisons thus present as good a test of absolute PPP as possible. It

is clear that the presence of home goods causes an important departure from

absolute PPP and more so, the poorer the country. Interestingly even for

"goods" as opposed to "services" is the departure significant. One reason is

certainly distribution and hence the service content of consumer prices for

goods.

              A different kind of evidence of the effect of productivity growth

on relative prices is based on the time series of relative prices within

industrial countries. The higher the growth rate of productivity, other things

equal, the more rapid the change in the relative price of manufactures in terms

of the GDP deflator.

              Figure 2 shows this effect for Japan. The figure shows that over

the past quarter of a century the relative price of exports (manufactures) has

declined by about one half in terms of the deflator. Similar diagrams can be

shown for any country with a pronounced rate of productivity growth, such as

Korea.

            Equation (4) helps establish a further point. A transfer received

by the home country leads to real appreciation. The mechanism through which the

real appreciation comes about is as follows. The transfer raises real aggregate

demand in the home country. Part of the increased spending falls on traded

goods and is offset by reduced foreign spending. But the part that falls on
                                                                    there is an
home goods is not offset by reduced foreign spending. As a result

excess demand for home goods and labor at home. The relative wage and hence the

relative price level rise in the country receiving transfers.

            The idea of a transfer can be interpreted quite broadly, as it

indeed has been in the literature. In particular we can think of the transfer-

receiving country as borrowing from abroad. Thus Ricardo's remark "in borrowing

countries prices are high" has a counterpart in this model.



Relative Deflators: The previous discussion focussed on the trend behavior of

relative consumer prices. But we can also interpret PPP relations in terms of

producers' prices, and in particular relative value added deflators. Letting R'

— Q/Q* denote the relative value added deflators in a common currency we have:



           — Q/Q* — (PT/PT*)C(PN/PN*)l                           (5)




            It is apparent that the relative producer prices represent a
                                                                                11i
mixture of the terms of trade and of the relative price of nontraded goods.

this framework, factors that worsen the terms of trade, such as an unfavorable

demand shift, will tend to lead to real depreciation.

           Figure   3 shows 100 years of the US-UK   real   exchange rate as

measured by relative value added deflators. It is interesting to observe the

relative stability of the real exchange rate prior to World War II, followed by

a large structural adjustment, and then the extraordinary fluctuations

associated with British and US macroeconomic policies under flexible exchange

rates in the 1970s and 1980s.

            The large realignment in the aftermath of World War II stands out

as a striking example of a change in the real exchange rate in response to a

loss in wealth, income, and world market share. Note, however, that because of

price controls during World War II and relatively effective exchange control in

the early postwar period the rate in the 1940s cannot be interpreted as an

"equilibrium" real exchange rate. But even so a significant difference remains

between the average of the pre and post World War II    real   exchange rates

remains. This large shift attests to the critical importance of structural

factors in the long-run behavior of real exchange rates.



II. REAL EXCHANGE RATES IN THE SHORT RUN

            In   this part, we discuss two central issues of exchange rate

economics among industrialized countries: the link between exchange rates and

prices, and difficulty in accounting for observed exchange rate movements in

terms of the "fundamentals" suggested by theoretical models of the exchange

rate.

            There are four broad approaches to modelling short run exchange

rate behavior. They are not strictly alternatives and, on occasion, come in

combination. These are respectively the monetary approach (MOA), the new

classical economics (NEC), the equilibrium approach (EA) and, for lack of a

better term the macroeconomic approach (MAC). Within each of these broad

groups there are differences of models. Our focus, however, is on broader

differences which have two dimensions. One is whether the model assumes market

that .jj. markets clear. The other is whether an effort to   establish the

microeconomic foundations of the model on the basis of uncompromising, explicit

maximization is made. Table 2 presents an overview of how the various

approaches fall into categories.

             We   will use the macroeconomic approach as a benchmark to judge the

specific contentions of alternative approaches.

The Macroeconomic Atroach: A generally accepted, simple model of the

macroeconomic determinants of exchange rates is the extended Mundell-Flemming

model. One version in this tradition is as follows:1



       y —      a(p*+e.p)           -
                                        (i-p)   +   u        (6)



       in   - ap      -       (l-a)e    — ky -Ai             (7)




       i —      i*   + e                                     (8)




            -   r(y       -
                              y')                            (9)



where p and e denote the domestic prices and the exchange rate, y denotes

output and i denotes the home interest rate. The term y' denotes potential

output and in     denotes money. All the other terms are positive constants. All
variables, except nominal interest rates, are in logs, and u is a disturbance

term representing foreign demand or fiscal policy.

                     In this macroeconomic approach, the asset market (equations (7)

and (8)) clears continuously, but prices adjust only gradually. Given the

future paths of the forcing variables (foreign interest rates, money and fiscal

policy) the model can be solved for the level and path of output, prices and

the exchange rate.

                 The model has the property that in response to a permanent,

unanticipated increase in the money stock the exchange rate and the price level


  'See Dornbusch (1976,1986), Obstfeld and Stockman (1985).
                                               12


ultimately rise in the same proportion. In the short run, because prices are

sticky, there is an immediate depreciation of the exchange rate, which

overshoots the long-run equilibrium level. The overshooting is a consequence of

the combination of the perfect foresight assumption and instantaneous asset

market adjustment: an increase in the nominal money stock, is an increase in

the real money stock which, absent changes in any other variables influencing

real money demand, must lead to a decline in the equilibrium home interest

rate. But the home interest rate decline is compatible with an international

equalization of returns only when the exchange rate is expected to appreciate,

thus yielding capital gains offsetting the lower interest earnings.

Appreciation can be expected only at a level of the exchange rate that is

higher than the long run equilibrium value. Hence the overshooting

characteristic where the exchange rate is immediately driven above the long run

equilibrium level.

                     The model can also be expressed in terms of real interest

differentials and the rate of depreciation of the real exchange rate. Let

q —   p*   + e   -
                      p.   Then we have:




                 r.r*q                                             (8a)



where r and r* are the home and foreign real interest rates. It can be shown

that in the model laid out above the real exchange rate converges

asymptotically to the steady state real exchange rate q'

Combining (8a) and (10), the dynamics of the real exchange rate following an

unanticipated, nonrecurrent money supply changes can be summarized in an

equation for the real exchange rate:




(11)           q —   q'   -
                              v(r.r*);   v—1/i



               From (11) and (8a), it is apparent that the impact effect of a

monetary disturbance and the resulting impact on real interest differentials

depends on the speed of adjustment of the system. The more gradual the

adjustment the larger is the initial overshooting. The speed of adjustment

depends in turn on all the structural parameters.

               The model is not limited to studying once and for all current and

unanticipated money supply changes. It also lends itself to asking q'estions

about the effect of fiscal (or export) shocks. A permanent fiscal expansion,

for example, leads immediately to a real appreciation that crowds out fully the

increased demand by an offsetting current account deterioration.

               Wilson (1979) and Mussa (1982, 1984), in particular, have

emphasized the forward looking nature of exchange markets. The above model
                                                                              -
captures this aspect because the future time paths of the forcing variables -

m,u,i*   --   determine the current values of interest rates, output, and the

exchange rate.

            This macroeconomic approach has as a central working hypothesis the

continuous clearing of asset markets and stickiness of prices of at least some

goods. Attention focuses on the implications of this asymmetry in the speed of

adjustment of goods and asset markets for real exchange rates, employment and

trade flows. Uncompromising informational efficiency is imposed in asset

markets, as it is in the other approaches.



Alternatives: Competing with the macroeconomic approach are three alternatives:

the new classical economics, the monetary approach and the equilibrium

approach.

            The monetary approach today commands virtually no attention. Soon

after the move to flexible exchange rates, there was considerable interest in a

model of exchange rate determination based on PPP and money market

equilibrium.2 With strict purchasing power parity prices and the exchange rate

are related by a constant and thus in logs we have e — p   -
                                                               p*.   Using money

market equilibrium to solve for prices in terms of nominal money, interest

rates and output, yields the central equation:



       e — (m-m*)   -
                        c(i.i*)   + (yy*)                                 (12)




            The empirical success of this equation has been so poor, and the

PPP foundations so doubtful, that this approach is basically extinct.

The Equilibrium and New Classical Approaches:     The equilibrium approach

shares an emphasis on market clearing with the monetary approach. In fact, the

central assumption is that .ll markets, specifically the markets for goods and

labor clear continuously. In this model, all prices and wages are flexible and

the focus of attention is the determination of absolute and relative prices and

their possible correlations. But there is, at the same time, an uncompromising

attention paid to microeconomic foundations. Behavioral equations are derived

from maximization considerations rather than assumed ad hoc.

            The double edge of the approach are market clearing and

microeconomic foundations, in particular maximization and an explicit role for

budget constraints as well as informational efficiency on the part of agents. A

focus of the search for microfoundations is the concern for an explicit well-

motivated role for money. As a result, transactions technologies play a central

role in establishing a demand for money. This approach also emphasizes in

particular intertemporal consumption and investment choices and the effect of

intertemporal and intratemporal relative price changes on saving and spending

decisions. But the model must be closed by an explicit assumption about how

markets function, and it differs occasionally from the equilibrium approach in

this respect.

            The closure may be obtained either by the assumption of short-run

stickiness of wages and prices (as might be the case in models with long-term,

overlapping contracts) or else in the same way as the equilibrium approach.

Work by Calvo, for example, tends to emphasize utility maximizing, money using,

forward looking agents operating in a world of full price flexibility or of
                                          16



contracting with only marginal prices flexible. Some work by Helpman, Razin and

Svensson, in the same manner tends to be uncompromisingly in the tradition of

the new classical economics but with different scenarios as to prices.

Specifically, models of liquidity constrained behavior emphasize the

interaction of price stickiness (and hence real balance shortages) and

maximizing behavior.3 In summary, the new classical approach is less catholic

than the equilibrium approach in that it studies, in some applications,

situations where markets do not clear. But, except in those instances, it fully

overlaps with the equilibrium approach.



2. Evaluation

             How does one choose among these approaches? The choice between

non(explicit) -maximizing approaches in the equilibrium tradition and the

macroeconomic approach must be based on their predictive ability. We look at

that issue below. The choice between the new classical and macroeconomic

approach is a mud- more difficult one.

            In principle the new classical approach should win hands down

because it derives properly those relations which the macroeconomic approach

assumes are derived from maximization. Thus, in case of doubt, one would

invariably turn to the new classical approach to give the more specific,

qualified answer. And this would be the case especially for specific

intertemporal, intersectoral issues where answers depend on the exact relative

price effects and the budget constraints to which consumers or firms are


  3For an extensive list of writings see the reference section.
                                       17



subjected. For example, the distinction between transitory and permanent import

price changes might be easily glossed over in a macroeconomic approach but is

addressed a a central concern by the new classical economics.

            The hands down superiority of the new classical approach may

falter, however, on two features: One is that the formulation of transactions

technology-based money use, for the time being dominates the predictions of the

model in a most idiosyncratic fashion. Traditional, ad hoc money demand

formulations, even though they cannot (yet?) be derived, may offer a more

sturdy building block. The other difficulty is an overabundance of Ricardian

equivalence effects which undo much of the potential role of fiscal policy.

            It is clear though, at least in respect to this latter issue, that

the new classical approach is being revamped in the direction of ad hocery

either by imposing and exploring the implications of credit constraints for

consumers or by introducing Blanchard-type nonneutrality. When the task is

ultimately completed, one suspects that we will all use the new classical

approach, having learned to assume rigorously everything that the macroeconomic

approach assumed as critical features of the operation of the economy. I use

the term to "assume rigorously" to denote the current fashion of introducing ad

hocery at a lower level, and then deriving its implications rigorously.



Macroeconomic vs Equilibrium Aroach: Stockman (1987,1988b) has confronted

the task of setting out the claims of the equilibrium approach, its empirical

relevance and the evidence that favors this view over an alternative approach

that relies on price stickiness as an essential element in the explanation of
                                        18



exchange rate movements. The Stockman contributions are welcome because they

offer in stark colors the claims and evidence. We quote here at length from

Stocknian (1987)

            "Economic theory predicts that real disturbances to supplies and
            demands for goods cause changes in relative prices, including the
            'real exchange rate'. In a wide variety of circumstances, these
            changes in the real exchange rate are partly accomplished through
            changes in the nominal rate. Repeated disturbances to supplies and
            demands thereby create a correlation between changes in real and
            nominal exchange rates. This correlation is consistent with the
            equilibrium in the economy, in the sense that markets clear through
            price adjustment."

             He further notes several implications, of which two deserve special

emphasis:
             • the correlation between nominal and real exchange rates is not

exploitable by government policy, and
             • statistical evidence indicates that changes in exchange rates

                                                            is inconsistent with
(real and nominal) are nearly permanent. This persistence
                                                               the source of
the view that monetary shocks or transitory real shocks are

exchange rate movements. Instead, it is consistent with the view that most

changes in real exchange rates are due to real shocks with a large permanent

component. because of the high correlation of nominal and real exchange rate

changes the evidence is consistent with the view that most changes in nominal

exchange rates are caused by largely permanent real disturbances.
                                                               Stockman has no
             In making the case for the equilibrium approach
                                                                         does not
doubt exaggerated his message in two ways: the macroeconomic approach

predict that exchange rates overshoot in response to any and all disturbances.

 In the model set out above, real disturbances, i.e. changes in exports or
                                           19


fiscal disturbances represented by the parameter u, do change the nominal and

real exchange rate permanently. As the model is an equilibrium model in the

long run, and exchange rate determination is forward looking, the adjustment of

prices is exactly the same, as would be the case in an equilibrium model. It is

also the case that support for a unit root in the time series of real exchange

rates is increasingly being questioned. There is evidence of reversion rather

than random walking even if the reversion is not rapid and fails to exhibits

stable patterns.

              To appreciate the difference between the two approaches, we can

focus explicitly on the dynamics of output and prices in the macroeconomic

approach. A fiscal contraction, to give a concrete example, has the following

effects: in the long run, the real exchange rate adjusts to achieve full

crowding in. This is accomplished by a depreciation of the nominal rate and a

fall in domestic prices. The equilibrium approach would predict this as the

immediate effect. In the macroeconomic approach, because prices are not fully

flexible in the short run, there is an immediate depreciation and a decline in

output. The   output   decline lowers prices over time. After prices have declined

sufficiently and the exchange rate has further depreciated, the economy

ultimately settles at the new fullemploytnent equilibrium.4

              An obvious variable to use to judge the macro versus equilibrium

approach is the behavior of output. The equilibrium approach asserts that


  4Note that if the relevant deflator in the money market equilibrium
  condition is p and not xp+(l-x)e, the exchange rate will do all the work and
  domestic prices will be unaffected in the short and long run. In that case,
  the macroeconomic and equilibrium approach cannot even be distinguished.
                                        20



output follows its full employment path with productivity shocks (and world

factor cost shocks) as the only disrupting events. By contrast, the

macroeconomic approach asserts that monetary and fiscal disturbances (in

addition to supply side shocks) cause output to diverge from its full

employment path. But the fact is that protracted deviations of output from

potential have never been accepted as a fact by adherents of the equilibrium

approach, even though they have not offered satisfactory explanations for major

recessions other than to appeal to mystical productivity events.

            The behavior of real and nominal exchange rates is the main area

where a resolution of the superiority of one of the contending approaches is

sought. One obvious challenge is to explain the real exchange rate behavior of

the 1980s. Figure 4 shows the (multilateral) real effective exchange rate for

the US.5 The macroeconomic approach has sought to explain the large real

appreciation of the dollar in terms of fiscal policy developments in the US and

in other industrialized countries. In the period of the early 1980s, US fiscal

policy (measured by the structural budget) became very expansionary even as

fiscal policy tightened in other industrialized countries. In Europe and Japan

the reverse pattern prevailed. The Mundell Fleming model predicts a real

appreciation in these circumstances.6

            But even if the real appreciation can be explained by fiscal

developments, three questions remain to be answered. First, how does this same

theory explain the dollar decline since 1985, second, does the theory   also



  5We use the Morgan Guaranty data.

                                        21


 apply to other episodes, as for example the Yen appreciation of 1977-78; and

 third, is the size of the real exchange rate movements in line with predictions

 that could plausibly come out of the macroeconomic model.

             Even if it is possible to account for the broad pattern of the real

 exchange rate by appealing to the anticipation of future fiscal correction the

 problem of accounting for the size of the movement in the real exchange rate

 remains.

            The equilibrium approach has not tried to offer a concrete

explanation for the real exchange rate movements of the 1980s. The new

classical school and the macroeconomic model emphasize fiscal policy. For the

new classical school (e.g. Frenkel and Razin (1987)) the explanation is no more

than episodic. But the demonstration has not gone far enough for the

macroeconomic approach either. The broad pattern of real exchange rates can be

explained, but the explanation does not cover the relation between interest

differentials and exchange rate depreciation which is a central part of the

model. This is a decisive reason, as we shall now see, to question the

macroeconomic approach as a full explanation, also.

            When exchange rate movements are small any theory can offer a

plausible explanation, and few can be decisively rejected. But when movements

are extremely large, as was the case in the US 1980s, there is a firm test for

any theory. The events were too large and the reversal too sharp and complete

to allude to mystical shifts in tastes and technology. Thus equilibrium

theories fail to explain what happened and are therefore found wanting. We turn

next to the link between interest rates and exchange rates to show that the

macroeconomic model is also unable to explain the experience of the 1980s.

3. Interest Rates and Depreciation

               Equation (8) in the macroeconomic model laid out above assumes that

investors are risk neutral. A discrete time, rational expectations version of

(8) is:




          E(et+i) —   et   +   i    -                                 (13)


With the assumption of rational expectations the realized level of the exchange

rate is equal to the expected level plus a white noise error term. The theory

predicts that we should observe the following relationship:




    et+l -et —
                       -           + '?t+l   —   -    + "news"         (14)




where the error term t+1 is orthogonal to the interest differential and thus

can be referred to as "news".

              A simple test of this model is shown in Table 3. The model suggests

that on average interest differentials should be matched by realized

depreciation on average. The table shows annual averages of the three-month

interest differential as well as the depreciation rate during the year. It is

apparent that the divergences are so large that one does not need a lot of

econometrics to see that interest rates fail to forecast depreciation.

Note: diff is the interest differential between a country and the US. Dep
measures the exchange rate of as country's currency relative to the dollar.


  If the path of the real exchange rate in the 1980s is to be explained by

anticipated behavior of the structural budget (first an expansion, then a

contraction), the interest rate pattern must be consistent with that

explanation. Interest differentials were, in fact, far smaller than the

realized rate of depreciation. To rescue a macroeconomic approach, one would

have to appeal to a sequence of "fiscal contraction" news. It is difficult to

document this news and certainly it is not possible to establish it in the

joint behavior of the dollar and longterm interest rates.

            The evidence from interest differentials and exchange rate

depreciation goes much further than rejecting a particular exchange rate model.

In fact, there is no model that can give a satisfactory empirical explanation

of exchange rate behavior. Meese and Rogoff (1983) have made this point, and

Frankel and Meese (1987) have offered a painstaking review of every testable

implication. They report that in virtually every respect exchange rate behavior
                                           24



remains a mystery. Specifically, asset market models with risk neutrality do

evidently fail to explain exchange rate patterns.

             The attention has therefore shifted to the possibility of a risk

premium as an additional factor. With the inclusion of a risk premium, the

relationship between the interest differential and expected depreciation

becomes:




           E(et+1) —   et   +   -   + R + "news"                (15)




            But inclusion of a risk premium fails equally, as does work that

includes time varying risk premia. There is, in perhaps as many as 100 studies,

only one message: a resounding rejection of the basic models.



Alternative Models: In response to the very unsatisfying explanatory power of

received asset market models, some researchers are exploring entirely different

approaches to the determination of exchange rates. Frarikel and Froot (1986

a,b,c), De Grauwe (1988) and Goodhart (1987) have emphasized that the evidence

from market participants does not bear out the rational asset market model.

Frankel and Froot have shown extensive evidence of large discrepancies among

forecasts gathered from market surveys, forward premia, and realized

depreciation. Table 4 shows some of their data for the case of the

dollar/sterling exchange rate. It is apparent that forecast averages differ

widely from forward rates and from realized depreciation.

            Frankel and Froot (1986a,b) have explored alternative expectations

formation mechanisms to determine whether simple processes such as adaptive

expectations are consistent with the survey data. They conclude that the models

differ with the sample period. They note that a suitable model of expectations

formation would have to include actors with heterogeneous expectations.

             As a first empirical implementation of their lessons, Frankel and

Froot (l986b,c) have proposed a model where forecast errors are made

systematically. A "portfolio manager" forms exchange rate forecasts drawing on

two sources: chartist predictions which extrapolate the current rate of

depreciation and "fundamental" predictions, which would be based on a theory

such as the current account model where real appreciation leads to

unsustainable deficits. The weighting is updated in Bayesian fashion based on

the recent relative forecasting performance of the two kinds of prediction.

This model generates extended cycles in the real exchange rate.

           Although suggestive, their model has two difficulties. First, it

involves blatant statistical forecast errors and as such is probably too crude
                                        26


 to be a reasonable description of the market process. Second, it involves a

 very smooth peaking of the real exchange rate. But, as Figure 4 above shows,

 the peaking is far from smooth. It more nearly reflects an abrupt shift in

 expectations.

 Summary: Equilibrium theory has failed to offer persuasive evidence to explain

the large recessions or the large movements in real exchange rates. Standard

macroeconomic models do well in the goods and labor markets, in that the

stickiness of some wages and prices is a stylized fact. But they do poorly,

along with the other two approaches, in explaining the price movements of long-

term assets. In the exchange market, just as in all other asset markets the

question is why long-term, stabilizing speculation is not more pervasive.

            The message from the exchange market is then one of full

solidarity. The evidence from the exchange market argues for a research

strategy that seeks to explain the joint behavior of long-term asset prices

rather than isolated attention on stocks, bonds or foreign exchange.



III. EXCHANGE RATE REGIMES

            We saw that the equilibrium approach the claim that the behavior of

real exchange rates is invariant to the nominal exchange rate regime.

Pioneering research by Stockman (1983, 1988b) and Mussa (1986) bears on this

question. They show persuasively that the variability of (bilateral) real

exchange rates among the main industrial countries and the US is far higher

under flexible exchange rates than under fixed rates. Figure 5 and 6 make this
                                          27


point for the real exchange rate between the US and Germany.7 The former figure

shows the level and the latter shows the monthly percent change of the real

exchange rate. Table 5 shows the increased variability for various bilateral

real exchange rates with the United States.


Table 5    Variability of Real Exchange Rates
          (Coefficient of Variation)

US-Sweden                        0.08                   0.21

Note: Variability is measured by the Coefficient of Variation of the real
exchange rate. The real exchange rate is the ratio of consumer prices measured
in a common currency.


            Although the increased real exchange rate variability in Figure 6

and Table 5 coincides with the flexible exchange rate period (and does so for

all industrialized countries), equilibrium theorists would claim that this does

not constitute proof of regime dependence. Stockman (1987,   1988b),   for example,

makes two points: First, real shocks in the 1970s and 1980s may well have been

different from those in previous periods. The oil shocks would be a case in

point. Second, the exchange rate regime itself may condition policies.

Specifically the flexible exchange rate regime may have changed the constraints

perceived by policy makers and hence their policies.


  7See Dornbusch and Ciovannini (1988) for further evidence.
                                         28



             If policies do change equilibrium relative prices a different time

 series behavior of real exchange rates emerges. Stockman (l988b) advances an

 explanation of policy differences: under pegged exchange rates, governments use

 balance of payments restrictions, under flexible exchange rates, they do not.

 The expectation of such policies is shown to stabilize the real exchange rate

 when the nominal exchange rate is pegged. This theory still requires testing.

            A separate area of research originated by Baxter and Stockman

 (1988) investigates the behavior of macroeconomic aggregates under different

 exchange rate regimes. This question is a natural counterpart to the observed

 increase in the volatility of the real exchange rate. Strikingly, Baxter and

Stockman conclude (with some caveats about detrending procedures) that there is

little evidence for changes in the behavior of macroeconomic aggregates- -

consumption, exports, industrial production. They note:


       "A large class of theoretical models implies that the exchange rate
       system has important effects on a number of macroeconomic quantities;
       however, we have found little evidence of quantities for which the
       exchange rate system is an important determinant."


            This finding is interesting because it may constitute evidence

against the equilibrium approach. If real exchange rate changes reflect changes

in eQuilibrium prices, how is it possible that these equilibrium prices are so

much more volatile than quantities? One possible explanation is that monetary

and fiscal policies have real effects (contrary to the implications of the

equilibrium approach) and that their effects are regime dependent. Some very

tentative evidence supporting this view is shown in Table 6. The table shows

correlations among realized real 3 month interest rates, the full employment

                Note that in Table 6, the size and sign of correlations is very

different in the fixed and flexible exchange rate periods. Including policy

variables and prices in the range of variables to be studied may solve the

Baxter-Stockrnan puzzle.



IV. DESTABILIZING SPECULATION AND EXCHANGE RATE POLICY

                The basic message from the work of Frankel and Froot (l986a,b,c,

1987), de Crauwe (1988), Garber (1987) and Coodhart (1987) is that asset

markets are not rational, or at least not in ways identifiable in terms of the

models we use and believe.

                 The message is to look for alternative models of exchange rate

expectations formation and speculation which are not necessarily closed by

consistency of short and longterm speculation. They should respond to the most

striking feature singled out by asset market participants, namely the dominance

of short horizon speculation. The basic fact of life in asset markets is that
                                        30



the average professional thinks he or she can liquidate a position before a

major turn in the market. Speculation can lead to the possibility of trading on

noise which may generate cumulative exchange rate movements out of thin air,

taking the real exchange rate far away from fundamentals. Unless there is

strong, offsetting speculation on fundamentals, these trips away from

fundamentals need to be neither small nor of short duration.

            Of course, what is said here of the exchange market applies equally

to markets for real estate, stocks or longterm bonds. Nurkse (1946), Shiller

(1986a,1986b) and Summers (1986,1988) have been very vocal and persuasive in

arguing this point. The more diffuse the fundamentals, the more room there is

for dominance of short-run speculation and for asset prices to depart from

fundamentals.

            None of this is new. Keynes (1934, chapter 12) offers a description

of the difference between "speculation" which is geared to making capital gains

from uncovering the shifting psychological moods of the market versus

"enterprise" which seeks to earn income from the long-term holding of an asset.

He notes the markets' pursuit of short-term capital gains rather than long-term

holding yields:

       "It might have been supposed that competition between expert
       professionals, possessing judgment and knowledge beyond that of the
       average private investor, would correct the vagaries of the ignorant
       investor left to himself. It happens, however, that the energies and
       skill of the professional investor and speculator are mainly occupied
       otheise. . .They are concerned, not with what an investment is really
       worth to a man who buys it "for keeps", but with what the market will
       value it at, under he influence of mass psychology, three months or a
       year hence...
       The battle of wits to anticipate the basis of conventional valuation a
       few months hence, rather than the prospective yield of an investment
       over a long term of years, does not require gulls amongst the public to
                                           31



          feed the maws of the professional - -   it   can be played by professionals
          amongst themselves."


               Even though exchange rate behavior is not well understood, there is

a live policy issue. Should exchange rates be allowed to float freely or should

they be closely managed?

Policy:

               For many observers extreme exchange rate volatility and persistent

misaligrunents in the $-DM-Yen triangle calls for a move toward a better

international monetary system. Naturally, participants in that debate follow

the principle "the neighbors' grass is greener": given that we have flexible

rates now, they urge a return to fixed exchange rates. Two kinds of remedies

specifically address this problem. One is target zones ,         the other is the
introduction of a comprehensive financial transactions taxes as suggested by

Tobin (1982). But there is another direction: maintaining a flexible exchange

rate system but discouraging destabilizing speculation by a financial

transactions tax.

               The target zone proposal, advocated by by Williamson and Miller

(1987), rests on the premise that longterm speculation is supported if market

participants know that the authorities have a firm commitment to limit the size

of exchange rate fluctuations. Moreover, even if the market does not provide

the stabilizing speculation, policy makers bring it about by their own

intervention   and by policy changes in support of the band. The arguments

against such proposals are well-known and have failed to convince the

proponents of the scheme: First, that in the absence of fiscal coordination the
                                         32


support of target zones may lead to an undesirable use of interest rate policy.

Second, that target zones may be too sticky to deal effectively with the need

for changes in equilibrium real exchange rates.

             If most of the shortcomings of our exchange rate experience stem

from excessive, overly volatile capital mobility, a way to cope with excess

capital mobility is to use a dual exchange rates, thus separating commercial

transactions from the vagaries of the capital market. An alternative system is

a worldwide financial transactions tax. A moderate, worldwide tax on all

financial transactions would force asset markets to take a long run view of

the assets they price. Tobin (1982) has suggested such a tax for all foreign

exchange transactions, but the logic can be carried to all financial

transactions. The attraction of the Tobin tax is that when levied at a very

moderate rate it still creates a tax on shortterm (round trip) transactions,

while leaving the profitability of longterm investment virtually unaffected.

            But a critical question then is whether a reduction in short-term

speculation increases stability of the exchange rate. If short-term speculation

is the main source of the cumulative departures from fundamentals today then

reduced shortterm speculation and hence relatively stronger longterm

speculation might well limit the extent of exchange rate fluctuations, But that

point still has not been demonstrated.

            The major objections to the Tobin tax are two. One is the resource

cost of implementing yet another tax. That cost would have to be compared to

the costs of large exchange rate misalignment and the resulting resource cost.

On that basis, it presumably comes out to be small. The second is the argument
                                           33



that   with   the tax implemented in only one or a few locations, business would

merely shift to offshore centers. Tobin recognized that point in arguing for a

worldwide foreign exchange transactions tax.



IV. REAL EXCHANGE RATES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES

               In this part of the paper, we investigate problems of real exchange

rates in developing countries. One concerns the interaction of the world

capital market which a country faces, capital accumulation, real wages and the

standard of living. The simple point of the model we develop is highlights the

asymmetry between the mobility of real capital and the immobility of labor.

Policies that reduce the profitability of capital ultimately reduce the

standard of living of labor.



1. Capital and the Real Wage

               In this section, we set out a simple model of a small open economy.

The model is readily recognized as a variation on work by Kouri (1979, 1982).



The Model: There are three sectors: home goods, exportables and a capital

installation industry. The export sector produces with constant returns, using

capital and labor. Firms can sell output at the exchange rate e and hence have

profits equal to:



   VE — eF(K,LE)     -
                         11E                                       (16)
                                               34



which gives rise to the labor demand equation



     LE —   f(w)K ; f<O                                                (17)




where w— W/E is the wage in dollars. In the home goods sector, output is

produced with a constant unit labor requirement (of one) and no capital. Demand

for home goods is a fraction a of labor income plus government demand, denoted

C:




             —                + C                                        (18)
                 e(p)WL/PN



where p —PN/e is the relative price of home goods. The home goods price is

given by unit labor costs, N — W. Accordingly, labor demand in the home goods

sector is



            —   e(p)L   + C                                              (19)




where L denotes the level of employment.

                 The capital goods installation industry sells installed capacity at

a price Q.       Installation   requires an increasing marginal input requirement of

imported goods. Thus profits of the installation industry are



     V1 — QI      -
                      (I)e;   e',e">O                                     (20)
                                          35



 Optimization gives the optimal rate of production of installed capacity:



        I —   1(q);                                                 (21)



 where q—Q/e is Tobin's real price of installed capacity.

              The labor market equilibrium condition is given in (22):



      L —   [f(w)K + G)/[1-e(w)]                                    (22)




Note the employment multiplier 1/[l-e(w)] to which we return presently.

              The equilibrium real wage is therefore a function of the capital

stock and government spending on home goods.



        w — w(K,L,G)                                                (23)
                                       WK>O, wL<O, wG>O



The sign pattern assumed for the equilibrium wage functions requires that e' (w)

be negative or at least not too positive. This assures that a rise in the wage,

w, reduces labor demand. In fact, if e'(w) is positive it is possible that very

large real wage cuts are required to reduce labor demand.

              Capital accumulation is defined by the difference between

investment and depreciation:



       K — 1(q)   -   5K —   K(q,K)                               (24)


where 6 is the rate of depreciation.
                                              36



              The model is closed by an equation relating the return on

domestically installed capital to the rate of return that can be obtained in

the world market, i*:



      q/q —   i*   -
                       4(w)/q — h(q,K;i*,G)                       (25)



where 1(w) is the marginal product of capital in the traded goods sector. The

equation states that capital gains must make up the difference between the

world interest rate and the domestic dividend yield of capital.

              Substituting (23) in (25) yields the conventional phase diagram

(Figure 7) which shows the dynamics of the capital stock and the real price of

capital. The path JJ is the unique stable trajectory. The subsidiary equations

which already have been used to derive these paths, give the behavior of real

wages and the allocation of labor between sectors.



Three Applications: The first application of this model is to show that

increased home demand by the governnent. via the crowding out effect in the

labor market, reduces the profitability of capital. This must lead to a decline

in the real price of capital and hence to a gradual decline in the capital

stock.

              The increase in government spending raises the equilibrium wage and

hence raise the capital intensity in the export sector. In Figure 7, the

resulting reduction in the yield of capital must be offset by a fall in the

real price of assets. The —O schedule therefore shifts downward. The forward
                                            37



 looking asset price declines immediately. Over time, the capital stock declines

 until a new equilibrium is reached.

                The net effect of this adjustment on wages will be positive. Thus

 labor gains, and that gain is achieved at the expense of capital. The initial

gain in real wages is subsequently dampened by a decline in the capital stock,

but labor is ahead even in the new long run equilibrium.

                Of course, that strong conclusion overshadows the question of how

the expenditure policy is financed. Typically the real appreciation involves

trade and budget deficits, both financed by external loans. The adverse effects

of the policy on the export sector are part of the trade deficit, while the

other part is the increase in imports that occurs as a result of income and

substitution effects. The example illustrates the policy disturbances that led

in many Latin American countries, specifically Mexico, to the debt crisis.

Figure 8 shows Mexico's real exchange rate in the past forty years. The

recurrent episodes of massive real appreciation, such as 1976 or 1982 are

associated with election year spending sprees. They are invariably followed by

massive real depreciation when the external constraint becomes binding.

                The asymmetry in the adjustment is worth noting. When the

overvaluation episode has lasted for a while capital will have been decumulated

and, as a result, the equilibrium level of real wages at a balanced budget i11

be below the level at which the overvaluation episode started. A recurrent

policy of overvaluation thus leads, over time, to a declining sustainable real

wage. This is, of course, the pattern observed in many Latin American countries

as shown   in   Table 7.

            The real wage effects are further aggravated, as is apparent from

(22), by the employment multiplier, which tends to be very high, and the fact

that the government budget tends to have a high domestic employment content.

            The second application deals with international risk premia.

Suppose that a country, because of poor policy performance Peru-style has

scared off international investors. The result is an increase in the cost of

capital. Investors will hold assets in this country only if they receive a

margin over the world rate of return sufficient to compensate for the perceive

risks. In terms of the model this corresponds to an increase in the cost of

capital from i* to i*+R. The —0 schedule will shift down. There will be an

immediate decline in asset prices and, just as discussed above, the capital

stock will decline over time. This time, the long run effect is unquestionably

adverse, even leaving aside the balance of payments crisis. The decumulation o

capital implies that the long run sustainable wage has fallen. Falling out of

favor with the world capital market thus implies a lowering of the standard of

living.
                                       39


            The long run consequences of policies that raise the cost of

capital are worth noting because of a temptation to take only the short run

view. It is true that physical capital is in fixed supply, in the short run

and is earning rents. But, because of depreciation, capital is ultimately

mobile, and a period of negative net investment is entirely conceivable.

Argentina in the 1980s is a case in point as is Peru.

            The third application concerns an overvaluation imposed by an

increase in the real wage above the market clearing level. Let w' be the real

wage fixed by unions and the government. Suppose also that the immediate

unemployment effects from such a policy are offset by increased government

spending. The focus here is on the long-term employment effects. With a real

wage w' > w(K,G), capital intensity in the traded goods sector increases

immediately and profitability of capital is reduced. Accordingly, as shown in

Figure 9, the —O schedule now becomes horizontal at a level q°, defined by the

equation q°(i*+&)—(w'). There is an immediate decline in the real price of

capital from E to E' At this point, workers have increased purchasing power

and unchanged total employment, but capitalists have already suffered capital

losses.

            The next stage is an inevitable decapitalization of the economy. At

the reduced price of capital, investment has fallen, and thus the capital stock

declines until the economy reaches point E°. It is conceivable that the

government increases its demand for goods, thus stabilizing employment. But

sooner or later there is an inevitable payments crisis. Once again, because of

the decapitalization the equilibrium real wage will have to fall far below the
                                        40


initial level. The decline is larger when the real wage cutting itself reduces

the demand for labor in the home goods sector.



Concluding Remarks

             The variety of topics reviewed in this selective survey represents

some of the diverse directions of current research of exchange rates. Two

thrusts are dominant. One is the rationality of asset markets and the resulting

question about resource allocation guidsed by disequilibrium real exchange

ratres. The other is an increased focus on microeconomic effects of real

exchange rate changes. We have sketched here a model of capital and

employment, but there is an equally important direction of research emphasizing

hysteresis effects as developed in Krugman's (1988) highly original work.
