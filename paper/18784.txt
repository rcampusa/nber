Untangling Searchable and Experiential Quality Responses to Counterfeits

                                                ABSTRACT

In this paper, we untangle the searchable and experiential dimensions of quality responses to entry
by counterfeiters in emerging markets with weak intellectual property rights. Our theoretical framework
analyzes the market equilibria under competition with non-deceptive counterfeiting and deceptive
counterfeiting, respectively, as well as under monopoly branding. A key theoretical prediction is that
emerging markets can be self-corrective with respect to counterfeiting issues in the following sense:
First, counterfeiters could earn positive profits by pooling with authentic brands only when consumers
have good faith in the market (believe in a low probability that any product is a counterfeit). When
the proportion of counterfeits in the market exceeds a cutoff value, brands would invest in self-differentiation
from the competitive fringe counterfeiters. Second, to attain a separating equilibrium with counterfeiters,
branded incumbents upgrade the searchable quality (e.g. appearance) of their products more and improve
the experiential quality (e.g. functionality) less, as compared to monopoly equilibrium. This prediction
uncovers the nature of product differentiation in the searchable dimension and helps in analyzing the
real-world innovation strategies employed by authentic firms in response to entries by counterfeit entities.
In addition, the welfare analyses hint at a non-linear relationship between social welfare and intellectual
property enforcement.

1     INTRODUCTION

    Besides rapid growth and industrialization, emerging markets are often characterized by

under-development in legal infrastructure. Emerging markets grow fast despite these lim-

itations. Last year, Chinese luxury consumption accounted for USD 12.6 billion, and by
2015, China is expected to top luxury consumption. This study sheds light on some of the

self-correcting mechanics of a market in a setting where brands face competition from coun-

terfeiters under weak intellectual property rights, as is common in many of the emerging
markets. By providing counterfeit products with an appearance that is similar to that of

a brand, counterfeiters can trick consumers into purchasing their products. Even the non-

deceptive counterfeits are desired by a large segment of customers in the emerging market.

In a 2004 study on global counterfeiting, the World Customs Organization estimated that as
much as 512 billion Euros of traded world merchandise may have been counterfeits (Busi-

nessWeek, 2005). The sheer volume of counterfeit merchandise around the world underscores

the importance of studying how markets function in the face of counterfeiting, a topic that
no multinational corporations operating in emerging markets could avoid. In particular, how

should brands design various quality dimensions in response to counterfeiting?

       To some extent, the marketing literature has explored the demand of counterfeits

(Bloch et al., 1993; Wee et al., 1995; Celso et al. 2007, Commuri 2009, Wilcox et al. 2009,
Han et al. 2010), with price, social aspiration, and attitudes toward large branded compa-

nies cited as main factors in driving counterfeit demand. On the supply side, several studies

have examined piracy effects (Conner and Rumelt, 1991, Sinha et al., 2010, Vernik et al.,
2011), legal responsibilities (Olsen and Granzin, 1993), counterfeit impacts in the interna-

tional trade setting (Grossman and Shapiro 1988, 1989), and firms’ internal organizations

in complementing weak IPR enforcement (Zhao, 2006 and Qian, 2008). The fact that coun-
terfeiters usually mimic an authentic product’s design but offer inferior functional quality

has important implications for authentic producers’ incentives for innovation and the nature

of innovations. Our theoretical framework helps unravel these complexities with intuitive

closed-form solutions. While Grossman and Shapiro (1989) primarily define a prestige effect


                                             2
as a function of the total sales of the brand (including counterfeits) and one dimensional

quality, we decompose quality to a finer level. In addition, we endogenize quality choice.

       We build upon a vertical differentiation model (Gabszewicz and Thisse, 1979 and 1980;
Shaked and Sutton, 1983) with two dimensions of endogenous quality to analyze the quality

and pricing responses to counterfeit entry. Since counterfeiters attempt to copy authentic

products and usually produce inferior quality, the competition is actually more vertical in
nature. We incorporate two quality dimensions, both vertical in taste. One dimension of

quality is observable before purchase, and hence “searchable” (analogous to “search good”

as defined by Nelson, 1970). A prominent example of searchable quality is appearance of a
product. The other dimension of quality requires experience to know, such as functionality,

hence it is “experiential” (analogous to “experience good” as in Nelson, 1970). While Nelson

categorizes goods into searchable and experiential, we observe that most products possess a

combination of searchable and experiential attributes. This novel model captures the special
feature of counterfeits in unbundling searchable quality (e.g., brand name and appearance)

and experiential quality (e.g., functionality), and examines the brand’s strategies in these

two quality dimensions in responses to counterfeiting.
       We analyze the market equilibrium under both complete information (in the case

of non-deceptive counterfeiting) and asymmetric information (specific to deceptive counter-

feiting), and compare equilibrium solutions with the monopoly equilibrium. We take into
account asymmetric information by building on the literature of quality uncertainty. Price is

the conventional signal for product quality, but Nelson (1974) points out the importance of

advertisement as a form of non-price signal for quality. Milgrom and Roberts (1986) argue

that prices are better signals for quality than non-price signals (notably advertisements) un-
less we assume repeated purchases. Moorthy and Srinivasan (1995) propose a money-back

guarantee as another effective quality signal. Metrick and Zeckhauser (1999) use a simplified

vertical differentiation framework to model competition under asymmetric information. De-
spite the sophistication of the previous literature, these models only consider a monopolistic

market and assume exogenous quality levels. A few exceptions are Moorthy (1988) who

examines product and price competition, and Purohit (1994) who models a Counot game

                                              3
with endogenous quality. However, their models are confined to a single dimension of quality.

There exists a small literature on non-price signaling in nonmonopolistic markets. Hertzen-

dorf and Overgaard (2001) and Fluet and Garella (2002) consider duopolies facing partially
uninformed consumers. They show that adjustments along the non-price investments (e.g.

advertising and packaging) can be used to signal underlying quality.

         Different from these traditional models that consider one pre-determined and often
fixed quality for each producer, we introduce two continuous quality variables for the pro-

ducers. The brand chooses both searchable and experiential quality levels based on which

yields more profits, and the counterfeiter also has the liberty to choose quality freely. Unlike
a non-deceptive counterfeiter who truthfully reveals both dimensions of quality, deceptive

counterfeiters attempt to fool consumers by copying the authentic searchable quality. We

incorporate asymmetric information between such counterfeiters and consumers by assum-

ing that a fraction of consumers cannot differentiate counterfeits from authentic products
at the same price and searchable quality levels.1 We then analyze the quality decisions by

producers. This endogenization of qualities helps to explain pricing and quality dynamics in

the face of competition.
         The key findings among a rich set of results is that emerging markets can be self-

corrective with respect to counterfeit issues in the following sense: First, counterfeiters

could earn positive profits by pooling with authentic brands only when consumers have a
prior belief on a low probability that any product is a counterfeit. When the proportion of

counterfeits in the market exceeds a cutoff value, brands would invest in self-differentiation

and profits dissipate for the competitive fringe counterfeiters.

         Second, we derive solutions and conditions under which the brand can utilize the
two dimensions of quality as key strategic decision variables to combat counterfeits. In the

case of non-deceptive counterfeiting, the brand differentiates from counterfeiters by offering

a high level of searchable quality if it has a marginal cost advantage over the counterfeit-
ers, while experiential quality would be set at its baseline level. When the brand does not

enjoy a cost advantage over counterfeiters, however, no producer would have any incentive

                                                      4
to innovate. Deceptive counterfeiters induce an authentic producer to invest even more

in improving searchable quality and less in improving experiential quality, as compared to

monopoly equilibrium or competition with non-deceptive counterfeiting. Intuitively, this
is because experiential quality is fully appreciated by only the expert consumers (who can

tell all quality) at the time of purchase, and the novices cannot correctly infer experiential

quality when counterfeits take on the same searchable quality and price as the brand’s. The
brand therefore has all the more incentives to differentiate from the counterfeiters by raising

its searchable quality to an unmatchable level.

       While there is no consensus on how entry affects innovation in the economics litera-
ture (Purohit 1994, Aghion et al. 2005), marketers often note product differentiation as a

practical consequence. Establishing such results in closed-form solution is novel. Our find-

ings yield additional insights into the nature and extent of quality differentiation. Our model

aids in understanding the counter-intuitive observation in practice that authentic produc-
ers only differentiate in visible quality dimensions and that authentic prices often rise after

entry by counterfeiters (Barnett, 2005). In addition, we highlight the strategic nature of

searchable quality differentiation and analytically reveal the two uses of searchable quality
upgrades in the face of counterfeiting, namely widening the searchable quality gap to allevi-

ate competition and disentangling asymmetric information brought by counterfeiting. Our

study provides one of the first analyses on the interesting theoretical finding that searchable
quality often times provides signal value for experiential quality and on the conditions under

which entry would lead to innovation.

       It is worth noting that such innovation responses could generate mixed welfare im-

plications across product categories. In industries where the marginal benefits of searchable
quality are high, such as fashion products, the searchable quality innovations would bring

welfare gains. However, in other industries where there is little marginal utility associated

with searchable quality, such as pharmaceuticals, then such innovation responses are rather
wasteful. Our predictions shed new light on the debate in the marketing and economics

literature on the relationship between competition and innovation.

       We then buttress our main theoretical predictions through business cases across in-

                                              5
dustries and empirical settings in Qian (2011). Using panel dataset on the Chinese footwear

industry that includes detailed quality dimensions of a representative sample of brands and

their corresponding counterfeits, analyses reveal that authentic branded firms invested hand-
somely on various searchable quality dimensions (shoe style, surface and side materials, etc.),

while their shoe bottom and functional quality experienced minor differences, if any at all.

Such practices are starting to be adopted by various companies, ranging from Microsoft’s
software encryptions to the most recent conspicuous CD packaging, and from unique im-

prints on pharmaceutical pills to holograms on Fendi scarfs (Passariello 2006). All these

findings align with our theoretical predictions.
       We organize the rest of the paper as follows. We first develop the theoretical model

that incorporates two dimensions of quality under competition with asymmetric informa-

tion. We then proceed to validate the key theoretical predictions. Finally, we conclude by

summarizing the managerial insights and contributions.




2     THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK

    In this section, we first set up the game. We then solve the benchmark case with a

monopoly brand before probing into the competitive market equilibria. In particular, we

derive the pooling and separating equilibria properties. We refine equilibria with the D1

criterion (Banks and Sobel, 1987). Finally, we end this section with welfare analyses and
discussions.

2.1    Model Set-up

    Extending the traditional vertical differentiation framework to incorporate two dimen-

sions of quality, we characterize a good with an experiential quality (e.g. functionality) index

hi and a searchable quality (e.g. appearance) index si , where i indexes good i, and each
company produces only one good. Experiential quality includes dimensions of quality that

are unobserved but can only be inferred. In the data for shoe companies, h includes cush-

ioning effects, frictions, and other shoe functionality. Searchable quality, on the other hand,

                                               6
includes dimensions of quality that are searchable or observable at the time of purchase. For

instance, s includes the brand name, shoe surface materials, and other appearance charac-

teristics.
        There is a continuum of consumers. Each consumer has unit demand U = V (hi , si , θ)−

Pi = θ ∗ (hi + si ) − Pi if one unit with quality {hi , si } is consumed by a consumer with taste

θ ∼ unif[0, 1] at the price Pi , and U = 0 if the consumer does not buy any unit. All consumers
prefer high quality, given the same price. We therefore capture consumer heterogeneity in

tastes by θ: higher θ indicates more willingness to purchase a given quality. The cumulative

distribution function F (θ) is therefore the fraction of consumers with a taste parameter less
than θ. We start with the assumption that the tastes for the two dimensions of quality are

collinear because high-income consumers can better afford both dimensions of quality, or be-

cause true lovers of the product can better appreciate its finer attributes.2 This assumption

is similar to that commonly made in the price-discrimination literature: that individuals
demand curves do not cross. Relaxing this assumption does not change the predictions qual-

itatively but only complicates calculations. Results are available upon request.

        At first one branded producer leads in the market, and a set of counterfeiters could
potentially seek opportunities to enter. To offer a product of quality qi = {hi , si }, the pro-

ducer i faces a combination of marginal and fixed costs. We model the sunk R&D cost of

experiential quality h (above the baseline level L) with a function ηh (h − L)2 . The sunk cost
of searchable quality s above its baseline level s0 is analogously defined with ηs (s − s0 )2 . The

counterfeiters free ride on authentic producer’s R&D and hence incur no sunk costs. We

further simplify3 without loss of generality that ηs = ηh = η. The marginal costs are:

                                         ′                               ′
                                       βsi s > s0                      βhi h>L
                          βi (s) = {              ,       βi (h) = {
                                        β s ≤ s0                        β h≤L
   2
      Analogously, Grossman and Shapiro (1988) model the utility of a status goods as being derived from its
quality and prestige, which positively correlates with quality and negatively relates to total sales. Our model
differs from theirs in three important ways: 1. We disentangle quality into two dimensions; 2. We endogenize
quality and price choices; and 3. We incorporate potential asymmetry in information about quality due to
counterfeiting. It is a common phenomenon in emerging markets that consumers are fooled into purchasing
counterfeits.
    3
      This primarily simplifies the equilibrium solution expressions and comparisons, and results without this
simplification is qualitatively the same and available upon request.



                                                      7
The counterfeiters face perfect competition among each other. Without loss of generality,

we assume that these counterfeiters are symmetric in their marginal costs. We normalize
 ′     ′
βhi = βsa = β, and ∆β = βsl′ − βsa
                                ′
                                   denotes the difference in the marginal costs associated
with increasing searchable quality between the counterfeiters (subscript l) and the brand

(subscript a). Then the set of marginal costs for the brand and counterfeiters are as follows:

             β s a > s0             β h>L              β + ∆β sl > s0             β hl > L
βa (s) = {              , β (h) = {       ; βl (s) = {                , β (h) = {
             β sa ≤ s 0 a           β h≤L                 β   sl ≤ s 0 l          β hl ≤ L

       We model a game with a dominant authentic branded firm and a set of competitive-

fringe imitators or counterfeiters, which is closest to actual interactions among consumers,
authentic and imitative producers. The sequence of events is:

  1. An authentic producer chooses her quality, both experiential and searchable dimensions

      {ha , sa }, with the corresponding costs as specified before. She also sets the optimal

      price Pa corresponding to this quality level;

  2. Based on the brand’s price and quality decisions, counterfeiters decide whether to

      enter the market and, if so, whether to enter without deception (i.e. revealing the true

      product source and quality) or with deception (i.e. fooling consumers into thinking
      they are real) or both;

  3. Counterfeiters pick their searchable quality sl and the corresponding price Pl for a

      product with experiential quality hl ;

  4. Each consumer purchases at most one unit of a product.

   To solve this game, we first solve for benchmark prices and profits when the authentic

firm is a monopoly and when it faces non-deceptive counterfeiters. We then introduce asym-
metric information between the counterfeiters and consumers, a unique feature associated

with counterfeiters as compared to general entrants. We examine the pooling equilibrium

under the constraint that the brand’s quality and price choices need to be such that coun-

terfeiters have incentive to pool. We solve for separating equilibrium prices, qualities, and
profits when some consumers can be fooled, under the constraint that counterfeiters have no

                                               8
incentive to match price and quality with the authentic firm, which is necessary to guarantee

separation. Since the authentic firm moves first, his actions will determine whether we are

in a pooling or separating equilibrium. Under the D1 criterion, we will prove that there is a
unique perfect Bayesian equilibrium. We finally analyze welfare implications of competing

with counterfeiters.



2.2    Monopoly Benchmark

   Let us start with the benchmark scenario where the market has just a monopoly branded

producer. Consumers will purchase the authentic product of quality {h, sa } and price Pa if
                                                                                                 Pa
they derive positive utility from it. That is, θ(h + sa ) − Pa ≥ 0, implying that θ ≥           h+sa
                                                                                                     .
                                                                       Pa
The market demand for the authentic product is then 1 −               h+sa
                                                                           .   The authentic producer

maximizes profit:

            max Pa Da (sa , h, Pa ) − [β(sa − s0 ) + βs0 ] Da (sa , h, Pa )
           h,sa ,Pa

         −βhDa (sa , h, Pa ) − ηs (sa − s0 )2 − ηh (h − L)2
                                                             
                                                         Pa
       = max [Pa − β(sa − s0 ) − βs0 − βh] 1 −                  − η(sa − s0 )2 − η(h − L)2
         Pa ,sa ,h                                     sa + h
Solving this yields the following

Proposition 1 The optimal choice for the branded monopoly is:
                                                     (1 − β)2

And the monopolistic profit is :
                                                (1 − β)2 (s0 + L) (1 − β)4

The monopoly brand offers searchable and experiential qualities that are above their baseline

The comparative statics show that high costs (marginal or fixed) prohibit quality upgrades.



2.3         Non-deceptive Counterfeits

     We next consider market equilibrium under perfect information. Non-deceptive counter-

feits are most common in cases where counterfeiters sell at distinct locations from legitimate
sales, notably street corners or small booths in Malls. Non-deceptive counterfeits are present

in not only emerging markets but also developed markets, e.g., Canal street in NYC.

            In a vertical differentiation framework under complete information, the market nat-
urally segments into three types of consumers. The high-valuation consumers purchase

authentic products, the medium-valuation consumers purchase counterfeits, and the low-

valuation consumers purchase none. Hence the demand of the authentic and counterfeit

products can be outlined as:

                                                             Pa
                               Da (sa ,h,Pa ) = 1 −
                                                           sa + h
                                                         Pa       Pa − Pl
                              Dl (sl , hl , Pl ) =           −
                                                       sa + h sa − sl + h − hl

With weak intellectual property protection, it is possible for the counterfeiters to fully knock-

off the authentic quality levels {h, sa }. Therefore, the counterfeiters choose the searchable
quality from the interval [s0 , sa ] and experiential quality from [L, h]. Since the competitive-

fringe counterfeiters are price takers, their prices are driven to equate marginal costs:

                                  Pl = (β + ∆β) (sl − s0 ) + βs0 + βhl

The brand maximizes profit:

                  πa (sa , h, Pa ) =   max [Pa − β(sa − s0 ) − βs0 − βh] Da (sa , h, Pa )
                                       Pa ,sa ,h

                                       −η(sa − s0 )2 − η(h − L)2

The solution depends on the parameter ranges, as discussed below.

                                                         10
Proposition 2 In a market with complete information and ∆β ≤ 0, both the authentic

producer and the counterfeiters will choose quality {s0 , L} and price Pa = Pl = βs0 + βL

Proof: Please see Appendix A.2
This proposition reveals the fascinating intuition that when it takes non-deceptive counter-

feiters a lower marginal cost to imitate the authentic searchable quality than the authentic

cost, there is no incentive for any producer to offer the bare minimum in both dimensions of

quality. The market equilibrium quality will be offered at their baseline levels.
       Sometimes the counterfeiters’ marginal costs can be higher than the brand’s. For

instance, elegant appearance of authentic branded shoes requires advanced materials, fine

labor, and pattern-press technologies in the production process. Lacking economies of scale
and legitimate accesses to technology and knowhow, it is often more costly for counterfeit-

ers to achieve the exact same appearance level as the authentic producer does. Notably,

counterfeiters as illegal entities do not have import license to acquire fancy materials (Qian,
2008), and branded companies have strict allocation of raw materials for their subcontracted

manufacturers to prevent them from counterfeiting (Zhao, 2006). Counterfeiters usually use

inferior materials to mimic the authentic appearance, and it naturally gets harder to do so

when the appearance becomes more sophisticated. In light of the fact that the branded
producer enjoys economies of scale and designs an appearance level that is hard to imitate,

we also consider the case that ∆β > 0.

Proposition 3 In a market with complete information and ∆β > 0, the counterfeiters will

always choose appearance and functional quality sl = s0 , hl = L, and price Pl = βs0 + βL,
while the optimal choices for the authentic producer are:
                                            (1 − β)2
                             s∗a = s0 +              = sM
                                                        a
                                               8η
                            h∗ = L
                                    (1 + β) (1 − β)2
                            Pa∗   =                  + βs0 + βL
                                          16η
And the maximum profit of the brand is :
                                                         (1 − β)4
                                   πa∗ (sa , h, Pa ) =
                                                            64η

                                                 11
Proof: Please see Appendix A.3.

In the case that non-deceptive counterfeiting involves higher marginal cost than the authentic

cost for searchable quality, the brand will choose a higher searchable quality (the same as
the Monopoly optimum) to differentiate from the counterfeits. The brand offers the baseline

level of experiential quality, since the counterfeiters can free rid on the R&D sunk costs

for any functional improvement. The counterfeiter will choose lowest quality level in both
dimensions. The equilibrium solutions further give rise to the following comparative statics:



                                                     2                            2        ∂(Pa∗ −Pl∗ )

                                                                     = − (1+β)(1−β)
                                                                            16η 2

The price difference of authentic product over counterfeit decreases when β increases. When

β increases, the counterfeits’ price increase, but the price difference of brand over counterfeits

decrease. The overall effect is uncertain.



2.4    Deceptive Counterfeits

   In the previous section, consumers had perfect information on quality. This captures

circumstances where non-deceptive counterfeiters reveal their products as different from the

authentic ones. In this section, we analyze a market with deceptive counterfeiters, who in-
tends to fool consumers, and compare with the previous equilibria. Asymmetric information

is important in the context of counterfeiting, as many articles and news stories reveal how

consumers are conned into buying counterfeits. In a Chinese national survey with 30 retail-

ers and 200 consumers (Qian 2012), Some retailers were fooled by the counterfeiters who
claimed to be sales force of branded company and who offered huge discounts to fulfill their

year-end sales quota. A majority of the consumers at the mall intercepts claim that they

cannot tell counterfeits apart, and they usually rely on price or store signals to infer quality
and authenticity of the product.




                                                     12
2.4.1    Modeling Deception

   While the optimized quality and prices are public information (h, sa , Pa , hl , sl , Pl ), we
assume that a fraction, γ, of consumers may not be able to tell counterfeits apart from their

authentic counterparts at the same price and searchable quality (henceforth shorthanded

as “appearance”), at least not until after the purchase. This setup is intuitive because

authentic producers tend to provide detailed information about their products in order to
build reputation and brand recognition. Counterfeits, on the other hand, mostly try to

mimic the appearance of authentic products and misrepresent attributes to extract short-

term windfalls (Qian 2011).
        The other 1−γ fraction of consumers are experts in the product and know exactly the

quality of the product they are purchasing. They may purchase counterfeits at a lower price

depending on their individual willingness to trade off quality for price (similar to the case
with complete information). The uninformed consumers have prior belief on the probability

of any product being each type (counterfeit or authentic): µ(φc ) = τ and µ(φa ) = 1 − τ .

They are drawn uniformly from all consumers in the valuation distribution.4 They have

experienced various shoes or talked with friends about shoes before and know what the
authentic experiential quality should be based on expectations and inferences, although they

cannot tell it in practice. They also can calculate the Pase , sse        pe       pe
                                                                a , s0 , sa , and Pa , where the

superscripts se, pe denote separating and pooling equilibria, respectively. After observing
seller’s price and searchable quality, consumers update their beliefs about seller’s type. Let

µ(φi |p, s) = 1 denote uninformed consumers’ updated beliefs about seller i’s type being

exactly φ = φi .
        We handle the technical issue of specifying the out-of-equilibrium beliefs following

the prior literature (e.g. Simester 1995, Desai and Srinivasan 1995, Zhao 2000, Feltovich et

al 2001, Harbaugh and To 2008, Mayzlin and Shin 2010). We narrow down the set of out-

of-equilibrium beliefs using an existing refinement. This approach is known for its strength
in imposing some structure on the out-of-equilibrium beliefs. That is, the belief that is
   4
     Relaxing this assumption and drawing them more heavily from the low-valuation consumers would not
qualitatively change the results.


                                                 13
consistent with a refinement is more reasonable.

       We apply the popular Divinity Criterion (D1) (Banks and Sobel, 1987) to refine the

set of perfect Bayesian equilibria. Consider the set of best responses associated with a
particular out-of-equilibrium belief. Suppose that the counterfeiter type benefits from the

deviation under a bigger set of best responses than the authentic type. Moreover, this is the

case for all possible beliefs. D1 then requires that the consumer does not believe that the
deviating type is an authentic producer. More generally, suppose that in deviation A1 =

{p, s} 6= (P ∗ , s∗ ), the counterfeiter is more likely to yield higher profits than in equilibrium

under a bigger set of best responses from the consumer than an authentic producer does.
D1 then requires that the consumer does not believe that the product could be authentic.

We detail the D1 criterion and its applications in our setting (both separating and pooling

equilibria) in Appendix A.14.

       The authentic producer maximizes profit:


             max [Pa − β(sa − s0 ) − βs0 − βh] Da − η(sa − s0 )2 − η(h − L)2
            Pa ,sa ,h


The counterfeiters can arbitrarily choose appearance quality from s0 to sa , and functional
quality from L to h. We assume the counterfeiters choose appearance and functional quality

as {sl , hl }, where sl is continuous in its domain [s0 , sa ] and hl is continuous in its domain

[L, h]. Then the counterfeiters will again set the price at the marginal cost level due to
perfect competition among the fringe players: Pl (sl , hl ) = (β + ∆β) (sl − s0 ) + βs0 + βhl

Lemma 1 Under asymmetric information, since consumers cannot observe the functional

quality of the product, the counterfeiters will always choose functional quality as L.

Proof: Please see Appendix A.4.
In the following sections, we analyze the two types of equilibria: the pooling equilibrium and

the separating equilibrium.




                                                14
2.4.2     Pooling Equilibrium

    Our theoretical framework yields insights in the pooling equilibrium where counterfeiters
opt into the same price and searchable quality levels as the authentic ones. In this section,

we analyze the model to draw out these implications.

         Because only 1 − γ fraction of consumers are experts in differentiating authentic

products from counterfeits, the other γ fraction of consumers will have probability τ of
being conned into purchasing counterfeits5 . There are now three types of products: authen-

tic branded products, non-deceptive counterfeits that self-differentiate from the authentic

products at a lower quality and price, and counterfeits that are indistinguishable from the
authentic product in price and appearance (searchable quality). The latter two types of

products are both produced by the set of competitive-fringe counterfeiters. Their produc-

tion capacity is not satiated in either the perfectly competitive low-end market with residual
demand or the pooling market with a fixed probability τ of being purchased by the unin-

formed consumers. These counterfeiters would then produce both types of products in the

pooling equilibrium. They set {sa , Pa } for their counterfeit products in a pooling equilibrium

and {sl , Pl } for the non-deceptive counterfeits.
         Expert consumers will always choose authentic products over counterfeits in this

pooling equilibrium. The expert consumers who purchase authentic product must derive

non-negative utility from it, V (h, sa , θ) − Pa ≥ 0, and that utility must exceed their util-
ity derived from a unit of the lower-quality product V (H, sa , x) − Pa ≥ V (L, sl , x) − Pl .
                                                                 Pa         Pa
These two conditions imply that their taste parameter θa ≥ max( h+αs  ,
                                                                     a h−hl +(sa −sl )

        The following set of propositions weave into a fascinating story of the self-corrective

mechanism of emerging markets. We detail the predictions and the corresponding intuitions
below. The first proposition below shows that asymmetric information aggravates competi-

tion and promotes the need to differentiate.

Proposition 4 In the pooling equilibrium, the counterfeiters choose the same searchable

quality as the authentic producer and enjoy positive profits. That is, Dl (s∗a , L, Pa∗ ) > 0, and
                                                Dl (s∗a ,L,Pa∗ )
Pa∗ > Pl (s∗a , L). In addition,      Dl (s∗a ,L,Pa∗ )+Da (s∗a ,h∗ ,Pa∗ )
                                                                            = τ.

Proof: Please see Appendix A.7.

In the pooling equilibrium, if attainable by the incentive compatibility constraints of the
brand and counterfeiters, the counterfeiters split the market with the brand and earn a

positive profit. This is more desirable for counterfeiters than the separating equilibrium,

where counterfeiters as fringes compete away the economic rents from the residual demand.

We also come to the following conclusions on the comparative statics:

Proposition 5 In a pooling equilibrium with counterfeiters, an authentic producer’s optimal
                                   ∂πape (h,sa ,Pa )                           ∂πape (h,sa ,Pa )

                                                                                                 |h,s̃a ,P̃a   < 0. With a large

enough τ , the brand chooses to separate from counterfeiters.

                                                                  16
Proof: Please see Appendix A.8.

The mathematical derivations confirm the intuition that the authentic producer’s profits

under pooling equilibrium declines as the proportions of uninformed consumers and coun-
terfeits in the market increase. When there are more uninformed consumers and more

counterfeits in the market, the probability that uninformed consumers purchase counterfeits

increases. When asymmetric information becomes too severe, the brand has incentives to
self-differentiate from the counterfeiters to alleviate the erosion in profits.

       Private incentives to compensate for public enforcement surge when counterfeits

become very pervasive and when too many consumers cannot tell counterfeits from authen-
tic products. The following Corollary establishes that the authentic producer will upgrade

searchable quality to differentiate its product from the counterfeits when the proportion of

uninformed consumers is above a threshold level, given any relatively large proportion of

counterfeits in the market.

Corollary 3 There exists τ̂ ∈ (0, 1), such that ∀ τ ∈ (τ̂ , 1), ∃ γ ∗ (τ ) ∈ (0, 1) so that an

authentic producer will choose a separating equilibrium when γ > γ ∗ (τ ) and prefer pooling

equilibrium when γ < γ ∗ (τ ).

Proof: Please see Appendix A.9.
       Analogous to the previous Corollary, the following result illustrates that the authentic

producer will choose separating strategies to differentiate its product from the counterfeits

when the probability of randomly picking up counterfeits among all products is above a

threshold level, given the existence of any relatively large fraction of uninformed consumers
in the market.

Corollary 4 There exists γ̂ ∈ (0, 1), such that ∀ γ ∈ (γ̂, 1), ∃ τ ∗ (γ) ∈ (0, 1) so that an

authentic producer will choose a separating equilibrium when τ > τ ∗ (γ) and prefer pooling
equilibrium when τ < τ ∗ (γ).

Proof: Please see Appendix A.10.

       When there are few presence of uninformed consumers or there is a small probabil-

ity of puchasing counterfeits unknowingly, the authentic producer will opt for the pooling

                                               17
equilibrium because the small loss of demand to the counterfeits does not justify the cost for

upgrading searchable quality in order to separate from counterfeits.

        In sum, it is very interesting to note the self-correction property of the market
as analyzed here: when counterfeiting becomes too pervasive and confuses too many con-

sumers in the market, the authentic producer are motivated to upgrade searchable quality

and induce counterfeiters into a separating equilibrium, as analyzed in detail in the next
sub-section.



2.4.3    Separating Equilibrium

   If the brand and counterfeiters choose different prices and searchable qualities from each

other, then all consumers can tell the products apart based on the model setup, and the

resulting prices and profits can be easily solved as in the game with non-deceptive counter-

feiting in Section 2.3.

Lemma 3 In separating equilibrium, the counterfeiters will always choose minimum quality

sl = s0 , hl = L, and price Pl = βs0 + βL. Economic profits dissipate for the competitive

fringe counterfeiters.

Proof: Please see Appendix A.11.

The brand and the counterfeiters face the following demand functions, respectively:

                                      p
        Da (s∗a , h∗ ) = 1 − 2β − ∆β + (β + ∆β) (2β + ∆β − 1)
                                     p
                           2β + ∆β − (β + ∆β) (2β + ∆β − 1) if (sl , hl ) = (s0 , L)
        Dx (sl , hl ) = {
                                          0                   if (sl , hl ) 6= (s0 , L)

The optimal choices for the brand are determined by the following equations:
                                         
           (β + ∆β) (sse            se
                      a − s0 ) + β(h − L)           se             ∆β(hse − L)
    ∆β 1 −                                  − ∆β (s a  − s 0 )                     2
                 hse − L + sse
                             a − s0                            (hse − L + sse

                                                   − 2η(sse
                                                         a − s0 ) = 0
                                   ∆β (sse
                                        a − s0 )
               ∆β (sse
                    a − s0 )
                                                         se
                                                 2 − 2η(h − L) = 0

                               (h − L + sa − s0 )

We subsequently have the following predications:


                                              18
                                                                        ∆β 2
Proposition 6 In the separating equilibrium, there exists h = L +        2η
                                                                               such that the au-

thentic producer does not improve the experiential quality more than h. Searchable quality,
                                                                       (1−β)2
however, would be improved. In addition, when ∆β (1 − β − ∆β) >           4
                                                                              ,   the brand would
upgrade searchable quality even above the monopoly equilibrium level.

Proof: Please see Appendix A.12.

This proposition highlights one of the key findings that counterfeiting could stimulate the

brand to offer higher searchable quality but a stagnant experiential quality. Based on the

nature of the innovation induced by counterfeits, such innovation could be more valuable for
certain industries where searchable quality brings utility in its own right (e.g. fashion) than

others where consumer utility is primarily derived from experiential quality (e.g. pharma).

We provide empirical support to this prediction based on various cases and a unique panel
dataset on the Chinese footwear industry in the next section.

       When ηs = 0, we obtain the explicit solutions from the brand’s profit-maximization

problem, and interesting comparative statics follow in the proposition.

Proof: Please see Appendix A.13.
This proposition reveals the following intuitions: When the marginal cost advantage of the

brand over counterfeiters for improving searchable quality (∆β) increases, the brand would

offer a higher searchable quality (sse∗
                                    a ) to separate from the counterfeiters, resulting in a


                                                     19
higher separating equilibrium authentic price (Pase∗ ). When fixed R&D cost for improving

functional quality (ηh ) decreases, the brand would improve quality and charge a higher sep-

arating price.


       In refining the perfect Bayesian equilibria of this game, we have the following

Proposition 8 There is a unique PBE for any parameter values under the D1 Criterion.

µc = 1∀(p = Pase , s = sse
                        a ) is consistent with D1.

2.5    Welfare Implications

   In this section, we calculate the welfare impacts of counterfeiting. Notably, we are inter-
ested in deriving the welfare implications of the different market structures.

and experiential quality when ∆β ≤ 0. So there is no economic profit. SW C = CS =

into two segments: the higher-valuation segment purchases authentic product with higher
quality and the low-valuation segment purchases counterfeits of the baseline quality levels.

The social welfare turns out to be the same as the complete information case.

Proposition 9 Under symmetric information, the social welfare increases upon the entries

Proof: Please see Appendix A.15.

If innovation cost (η) is high, it is good to introduce competition to provide more varieties
in the product space.

       While the social welfare for the separating equilibrium (normalized to be 1 for com-

parison) and pooling equilibrium with some novices do not have closed-form solutions, we
end with some simulations. Figures 3 and 4 reveal that social welfare decline as asymmetric

information becomes more rampant in the market (larger γ and τ ).

       Synthesizing all the results, welfare is likely to be non-linear in government enforce-

ment. Notably, when government enforcement is so strong that there is no counterfeits,
monopoly producer surplus is the largest. When public enforcement is medium strong, the

brand would choose to pool with moderate amount of counterfeits, where consumer surplus is

compromised for the novices. When public enforcement is so weak that counterfeits become
rampant in the market, brands innovate to separate from counterfeits, resulting in higher

social welfare. Consumers enjoy more product varieties (innovated authentic products and

low-quality counterfeits).




3     Case Validation

    The main theoretical predictions are buttressed through various business cases. As cited
in the introduction, many products responded to counterfeit infringements by upgrading

searchable quality while the improvement in experiential quality is limited. To note a few

examples, In the face of rampant piracy, musicians and recording companies conspicuously

package their CDs. Prominent pharmaceutical companies like Abbott and Pfizer adopt
unique color, shape, and RFID imprints on each pill to differentiate from counterfeit drug

even though the active ingredients of the pill remain the same. Many fashion brands, such

as Fendi, adopt visible hologram on their products.
       Based on a panel data on branded leather and sport shoes, we provide additional em-


                                             22
pirical support to the key proposition that authentic producers have incentives to ameliorate

experiential quality upgrades while overinvest in searchable quality in the face of entry by

counterfeiters as compared to generic entry (Proposition 1). Furthermore, the easier it is
for counterfeiters to imitate authentic searchable quality, the less an authentic producer will

upgrade experiential quality (Proposition 2).

       Qian (2008) collect panel data on the product price and cost of 31 authentic branded
companies operating in China (including multinational and national brands), and the pres-

ence of counterfeits of each brand in the years 1993-2004. Based on interviews and analyses

on authentic prices and costs, she notes that “the authentic firms did not engage in innova-
tion when there was already significant competition from all the other authentic producers.

Innovation occurred and prices jumped only after these authentic brands were infringed upon

by counterfeits.” (p.1604). Qian (2011) compiles a dataset of different characteristics for

each type of shoes listed in the brands’ product catalogs, consisting of materials, comfort
levels, decorative patterns, support and cushioning features, ventilation, etc. She ran He-

donic regressions of the unit production costs, as provided by the sampled companies, on

the corresponding material, machinery, and other characteristics of the shoes, as recorded in
the catalogs. Those characteristics together accounted for 90% of the cost variation on the

products. These results lend credibility to the company data.

       We study shoe characteristics before and after the brands were infringed by coun-
terfeiters arising from unexpected loosening of government enforcement. Wilcoxon ranksum

tests on the set of product characteristics variables pre- and post-entry by counterfeiters

provide summary statistics of the innovation patterns. Results (Tables 1 and 2) clearly show

that the authentic producers used fancier surface and side materials and improved the shoe
appearance tremendously (especially for leather shoes) after counterfeit entry. The equip-

ment and technology were improved significantly as well. There is no matching improvement

in the functionality (both at the aggregate level and the detailed-characteristic level): mobil-
ity, versatility, having cushioning effects, etc. The overall quality is shown to be better after

entry, with an extremely low p-value in the Wilcoxon ranksum test. These findings directly

supports the predictions on searchable quality innovations in the Propositions 1 and 2.

4     CONCLUSION

    Counterfeiting is an unavoidable issue for policy makers and business managers operat-

ing in emerging markets. While counterfeit entry is a form of competitive entry, it differs
from other regular competition in three key ways. First, counterfeiters attempt to imitate

authentic products and free ride on the investments in trademarks and quality by branded

companies. Secondly, counterfeiting unbundles searchable quality (e.g., appearance) and ex-

periential quality (e.g., functionality) of a product. Thirdly, counterfeiting has a defining
trait of bearing the intent to deceive. Its deceptive nature often gives rise to asymmetric

information between the counterfeiters and consumers in transactions. Such asymmetric

information could aggravate competition and influence market incentives in nonconventional
ways. The media frequently report stories where confused consumers are conned into buying

counterfeits. Our model is adept in addressing these scenarios.

       The main contribution of this paper is to develop a theoretical model that incorpo-
rates all these unique features of counterfeiting competition and to uncover the direction and

nature of authentic product innovation in response to counterfeiting. While Nelson (1970)

introduced the concepts of searchable and experiential goods in economics, we argue that

searchable and experiential dimensions of quality could coexist within the same good. We
propose a novel model that include both these quality dimensions to analyze competitive

effects by imitators and counterfeiters. In the theoretical literature, this study contributes

to offer a tractable theoretical framework to cover two distinct quality dimensions in a ver-
tical differentiation setting and to unveil the entry effects of counterfeits. By examining

the equilibrium conditions and allowing the authentic producer to endogenously determine

experiential quality and searchable quality as well as prices, we are able to shed new lights

on the nature of innovations in different quality dimensions as brand protection strategies.
The results therefore have immediate managerial implications.



                                             24
      In the case of non-deceptive counterfeiting, the brand differentiates from counter-

feiters by offering a high level of searchable quality if it has a marginal cost advantage in

producing searchable quality over the counterfeiters, while experiential quality would be set
at its baseline level. When the brand does not enjoy a cost advantage over counterfeiters,

however, no producer would have incentive to innovate and all the quality will be at the bare

minimum.
      In the case of deceptive counterfieting, our theory predicts a noteworthy phenomenon

that market could serves as the invisible hand even for regulating counterfeits. When coun-

terfeiting grows to be too rampant and to fool too many consumers, the market incentives
turns from favoring a pooling equilibrium to a separating equilibrium. The authentic brand

would invest to innovate and differentiate from the counterfeiters on the searchable quality.

In such separating equilibrium, counterfeiting would induce the authentic producer to invest

more in product searchable quality (e.g. appearance) and less in experiential quality (e.g.,
functionality of shoes that are not apparent to consumers at the time of purchase). This

could be socially wasteful if searchable quality does not contribute to consumer utility as

much as experiential quality does. Theory further shows that the harder it is for counter-
feiters to reproduce authentic searchable quality, the more it induces authentic producers to

emphasize searchable quality improvements rather than experiential quality improvements.

      These predictions are empirically validated by findings on a sample of authentic and
counterfeit shoes for 31 brands operating in China. In particular, the branded companies

that survived counterfeit infringements all significantly improved shoe surface and side ma-

terials and appearance, while functional quality such as sturdiness and flexibility did not

witness any significant changes. These innovations pushed up marginal production costs
and hence raised authentic prices after their counterfeiters entered the market.

      The findings bring to light the nature and extent of product differentiation in the face

of counterfeiting, in contrast to a general low-quality competition with perfect information,
and provide managerial guidance as to which product attributes to differentiate on. This

research enriches a Teecean perspective: a substantial portion of the rents from innovation

arise not from technological novelty but from embedding innovation in brands (and other

                                             25
searchable quality dimensions) insulated from fringe competition.

       This paper is a stepstone in exploring the complex impacts of counterfeits as com-

pared to generic competition. While the current analyses shed light on the key quality and
pricing strategies against counterfeits, other strategies (e.g., product line proliferation) and

dimensions of asymmetric information and implications can also be associated with counter-

feiting. It will be interesting to extend the model to a dynamic multi-period model, where
one can study the reputation effects of brands, and explore whether brands would invest

in experiential quality in anticipation of future benefits. We are making further attempts

to better understand counterfeiters’ decisions to enter markets and any potential comple-
mentary effects counterfeits could have for authentic products, in line with the analytical

framework in Chen and Xie (2007).

This Table tabulates the Ranksum test statistics for the leather shoe characteristics pre- and post-
counterfeit entry. All the characteristics variables are categorical. Surface material includes 14 varieties,
ranging from plastic leather to crocodile skin; Side material includes 7 varieties, ranging from plastic
leather to baby cow skin; Bottom material includes 5 varieties, ranging from inferior PU to cow skin.
The Appearance variable is the sum of the dummies indicating whether a pair of shoes is fine, elegant,
and with decorative patterns. Functionality is an aggregate variable for various functional attributes,
including adroit (a dummy equals one if a pair of shoes is adroit), absorption (a dummy equals one if
a pair of shoes absorbs sweat), athleticfeet (a dummy equals one if a pair of shoes helps treat athletic
feet), soft, cushion (a dummy equals one if a pair of shoes has cushion effects), and comfort, sturdy,
warm, friction (a dummy equals one if a pair of shoes protects from slippery grounds). Workmanship is a
dummy that equals one if a pair of shoes is carefully and finely manufactured. Quality is the sum of all
dimensions of shoe characteristics.
