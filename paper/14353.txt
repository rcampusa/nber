                                              ABSTRACT

We use two different approaches to measure intertemporal preferences. First we employ the classical
method of inferring preferences from a series of choices (subjects choose between $X now or $Y in
 days). Second we adopt the novel approach of inferring preferences using only response time data
from the same choices (how long it takes subjects to choose between $X now or $Y in days). In principle,
the inference from response times should work, since choices between items of nearly equivalent value
should take longer than choices between items with substantially different values. We find that choice-based
analysis and response-time-based analysis yield nearly identical discount rate estimates. We conclude
that response time data sheds light on both our revealed (choice-based) preferences and on the cognitive
processes that implement those preferences.

1. Introduction
         Following Samuelson (1938), economists have adopted the theory of
revealed preferences: Economic analysis uses choice data to infer underlying
preferences (or tastes). However, there are many observable phenomena other
than choices that could in principle be used to infer latent preferences.
         For example, one could try to infer preferences using physiological
measurements (Edgeworth, 1881). Observers could determine which flavor of
ice cream produces the greatest anticipatory salivation, or the sharpest spike in
skin conductance, or the greatest blood flow in the brain’s reward systems.
These physiological responses could then be inverted to impute the underlying
preferences that evoked them. A growing body of work in neuroeconomics has
followed such strategies, concluding that preferences inferred from
neurophysiological measurements closely match those inferred from choices
(e.g., de Quervain et al., 2004).
         Social scientists could also try to infer latent preferences from response
time (i.e., the amount of time subjects take to make decisions) in choice tasks,
which is the approach taken in the current paper.1 In theory, response time
should be relatively long when agents choose among goods that have similar
value (Gabaix and Laibson, 2005; Gabaix et al., 2006). If an agent has a noisy
estimate of the value of a good but the good almost surely dominates its
alternatives, then it is not worth taking the time to refine that noisy estimate.
However, if an agent has a noisy estimate of the value of a good that seems to
be close in value to the next best alternative, then it is optimal to take additional
time to refine the noisy estimate. If such theorized mechanisms operate in
practice, then it should be possible to use only response times to impute
preferences. Long response times imply near indifference between items in a
binary choice set. Short response times imply a strong preference for one of the
items in a binary choice set.
         In psychology, a similar relationship between response time and
quantities under comparison has been observed in a variety of domains as early
as the work of Henmon (1906). In perception, Johnson (1939) had subjects
decide which of two simultaneously presented lines was longer, and found that
response time was a negative linear function of the logarithm of the difference
in length. This has been found with other perceptual quantities like area and
luminance, with the size of visualized objects, and even with the magnitudes of
abstract numbers (Moyer and Landauer, 1967). Brain imaging studies suggest
that many, if not all, of these comparison tasks invoke a common cognitive
process localized in the parietal lobes (Pinel et al., 2001, 2004).
         In this paper we find that response times can be used to infer economic
preferences. Specifically, we use laboratory data to measure temporal discount

them to infer underlying preference parameters.
rates in two ways. First, we measure intertemporal preferences using data from
27 binary choices, each of which has an immediate reward option and a
mutually exclusive delayed reward option (Kirby et al., 1999). Second, we infer
intertemporal preferences using only response times measured in the same
experiment. With this second approach, we infer that subjects are indifferent
between two mutually exclusive alternatives—an immediate reward and a
delayed reward—when the observed response time in the choice task is
relatively long compared to other intertemporal choices in our experiment.
         Remarkably, the parametric discount function that we infer directly
from the choice data closely matches the parametric discount function that we
infer indirectly from the response time data. We also find that response time
analysis predicts subsequent choice data almost as well as choice data predict
subsequent choice data. We conclude that response time is an operational and
effective measure of preferences. Response time data appear to reveal
preferences by revealing key attributes of the cognitive processes that
implement those preferences.
         This paper is divided into five sections. Following this introduction,
Section 2 discusses our data, which are taken from three different experiments
involving 712 total subjects. Section 3 presents our modeling framework, and
explains how we infer intertemporal preferences first from choice data and
second from response time data. Section 4 reports our results comparing the
preference estimates derived from choice data and the preference estimates
derived from response time data. Section 5 concludes.
2. Data description
        We created a computerized version of a 27-question delay-discounting
task developed by Kirby et al. (1999). Each question asks the subject to choose
between a smaller, immediate reward (SIR) and a larger, delayed reward
(LDR), both denominated in U.S. dollars. For example, the first question asks
“Would you prefer $54 today, or $55 in 117 days?” Rewards range from $11
(the smallest SIR) to $85 (the largest LDR). Delays range from 7 to 186 days.
Nine trials involve “small” LDRs ($25–35), nine involve “medium” LDRs
($50–60), and nine involve “large” LDRs ($75–85). Following Kirby et al.
(1999), we refer to these sets of nine trials as reward size categories.
        We administered the questions as described by Kirby et al. (1999),
except that we also recorded the time that each subject took to answer each
question, starting from the time it was displayed on the screen. Responses were
entered by pressing the B key for the SIR or the N key for the LDR.
        This task was included in three separate studies that yielded data from a
total of 712 subjects: (1) The Weight study examined associations between
body mass index (BMI) and discounting, as well as other measures of reward-
related behavior. (2) The Cognition study examined individual differences in
cognitive abilities, decision-making, and personality. (3) The Web study
examined differences in cognition and personality that may be associated with
differences in academic disciplines and career choices.2
         In all three studies, each subject had a 1-in-6 chance of having one
randomly-selected question played out for real stakes. In the Weight and
Cognition studies, the subject rolled a six-sided die at the end of the testing
session. If a 6 was rolled, the subject blindly drew a card from a box containing
cards labeled 1–27, corresponding to the 27 trials of the discounting task. If the
subject chose the SIR on the randomly-drawn trial, the amount of the SIR was
added to the subject’s show-up fee for participating, and a check request for the
total was submitted to the research administration office within one business
day. If the subject chose the LDR, a separate check request for the LDR amount
was made after the specified delay. In the Web study, a spreadsheet was used to
generate the necessary random numbers, and “winning” subjects received
payment through an Amazon.com gift certificate, which was e-mailed by the
next business day (SIRs) or after the specified delay (LDRs).
         In the Weight and Cognition studies, the questions were presented, and
choices and response times recorded, using PsyScope 1.2.5 (Cohen et al., 1993)
running under OS 9 on Apple Macintosh computers. For the Web study, this
PsyScope implementation was converted into a Flash movie that ran in each
subject’s web browser on his or her own computer and transmitted data back to
a central server. Because the three studies varied in recruitment strategies,
participant characteristics, payment methods, and apparatus used to measure
response time, we analyze them separately in this paper.
3. Models and estimation techniques
3.1. Discount function
         We use a generalized hyperbola to model time preferences. We assume
that the discounted value of a one unit reward delayed τ days is
                                                 1
                                     D (τ ) =        .
                                              1 + ατ
Previous studies linking discount rates to behavior have adopted this function
as well (e.g., Mazur, 1987; Kirby & Marakovic, 1996; Kirby et al., 1999; de
Wit et al., 2007; Myerson & Green, 1995; Rachlin et al., 1991).

2
  In total 751 subjects were tested, but 18 subjects were excluded from the Weight study and 16
subjects were excluded from the Cognition study for one or more of the following reasons:
reported brain injury; reported mental illness; reported drug use; had difficulty understanding
directions; was unable to complete the protocol; was previously tested. Additionally, any subject
who had three or more responses faster than 200 milliseconds on the discounting task was
excluded; a total of five subjects from the Web study were excluded based on this criterion. The
average ages of remaining participants in the Weight, Cognition, and Web studies were,
respectively, 32, 27, and 31 years; the average numbers of years of education were 15.0, 14.3,
and 18.4; the percentages of female participants were 50%, 52%, and 67%. Complete details of
the study procedures can be found in Chabris et al. (2008).
       This discount function D (τ ) is a special case in the family of
hyperbolic discount functions derived by Loewenstein and Prelec (1992):
                                          D(τ ) = (1 + ατ ) −γ /α .
        In this family of discount functions, the discount rate—the rate of
decline of the discount function—is given by
                                          ∂D(τ ) / ∂τ      γ
                                                      =        .
                                            D(τ )       1 + ατ
Hence, the discount rate is decreasing with horizon τ . The falling discount rate
generates dynamically inconsistent preferences (Strotz, 1957; Ainslie, 1992).
        Our specification imposes the common restriction γ = α. Thus at
horizon τ = 0, the discount rate is α. To simplify notation, we sometimes refer
to parameter α as the “discount rate,” though it is actually the instantaneous
discount rate at horizon τ = 0.

3.2. Choice data model
       We assume that time preferences are homogeneous within each of our
three datasets.3 A subject chooses delayed reward Y in τ days over an
immediate reward X if and only if the net present value of Y exceeds X:
                                            Y
                                                − X ≥ 0.
                                         1 + ατ
We assume that subjects experience preference shocks with the logistic
distribution, so subjects choose the delayed reward with probability
                                                                ωY
                       ⎛ Y        ⎞

                                                     ⎛                ⎞
                                                   / ⎜ eω X + e1+ατ

                ⎣           ⎝ 1 + ατ t        ⎠⎦

  Even though the choice data allow us to estimate a distinct discount rate for each subject as in
Chabris et al. (2008), we were not able to do the same with the response time data. Because the
response time model contains many more parameters and because the response time data is
naturally noisier than the choice data, there are not enough observations per subject to estimate
the model well. Accordingly, all analysis in this paper is at the group level.
where T is the number of trials, N is the number of subjects,
and d = {d it }1≤i ≤ N ,1≤t ≤T is the set of the NT binary decisions made by the
 N subjects. In trial t , dummy variable dit = 1 if subject i chose the delayed
reward Yt in τ t days over the immediate reward X t (otherwise dit = 0 ).

3.3. Response time (RT) model
        Following the framework in Gabaix and Laibson (2005) and Gabaix et
al (2006) we assume that subjects take longest to decide when the two options
are most similar in their discounted values. For example, a choice between $10
immediately or $40 in a week would not be difficult, whereas a choice between
$10 immediately or $15 in a week would take more time.
        Formally, subjects should take longest on those trials t for which the
difference in the discounted values of the choices on trial t ,
                          Yt
                Δt ≡            − Xt ,                           (3)
                       1 + ατ t
is closest to 0. The proxy for decision difficulty, Γ(Δ t ) ∈ [0,1] , that we
actually use is given by the transformation
                              (          )
              Γ ( Δ t ) ≡ 2 / 1 + eω Δ t .                   (4)
        This transformation has three desirable properties. First, Γ is convex
and decreasing, which means that as the difference between the discounted
values of the options grows larger, Γ exhibits less sensitivity to changes in Δ .
Second, this transformation is based on the logit distribution function (1);
another interpretation of Γ is that subjects take longest to decide when the
probability of choosing one or the other reward is close to ½. Third, the
precision parameter ω incorporates the effect of the variance of taste shocks on
response time—greater variance in taste shocks corresponds to a smaller
precision parameter ω , which corresponds to larger response times.
        The response time model is
             RTit = b0 + b1t + b2 Γ(Δ t ) + ε it                  (5)
where t is trial number, RTit is the response time of subject i on trial t , and
εit is the subject and trial specific noise term (section 4.1 motivates the
b1t term). We make no assumptions about the errors except that the random
vectors εi = (εi1 , …, εiT ) are mutually independent. Our approach to estimating
the model is simply to minimize the sum of squared residuals; in other words,
we seek the vector (bˆ0 , bˆ1 , bˆ2 , αˆ , ωˆ ) that minimizes
               ∑ [ RT
                it
                       it   − (bˆ0 + bˆ1t + bˆ2 Γ( Δˆ t ))]2 ,              (6)

4. Results
4.1. Using choice data to predict response times
         Table 1 shows the estimates α̂ obtained by using choice data to
estimate the discount function. Specifically, we maximize the choice-based
likelihood function in equation (2) for each of our three studies. We also
estimate separately the discount rates for each of the three different reward size
categories. Consistent with others (e.g., Kirby et al., 1999; Kirby and
Marakovic, 1996; Jaroni et al., 2004) we find that subjects’ discount rates
decrease with reward size category. Moreover, we find that subjects in the
Weight study have higher discount rates than subjects in the Cognition study,
and that subjects in the Cognition study have slightly higher discount rates than
subjects in the Web study. This is probably at least partially due to
demographic differences between the samples.4
         We find that we can use the discount function estimates from choice
data to predict response times. Specifically, for each study we use the estimated
                               ˆ as in equation (3), apply Γ as in equation (4)
parameters α̂ and ω̂ to define Δ t

to get our proxy for decision difficulty, Γ(Δ    ˆ ) , and then show that Γ(Δˆ )
                                                  t                              t
correlates with response times.
         We also control for the effect of experience—as subjects become
accustomed to the format of the discounting task, they answer the questions
more quickly. We find that subjects take a disproportionate amount of time on
the first two trials but that the effect of experience is approximately linear for
the subsequent trials. Therefore, we leave the first two trials out of the response
time analysis and control for the linear learning effect in the remaining 25 trials.
Finally, we trim our dataset by cutting observations with extremely high
response times—we demean response times at the subject level and drop

  For example, the Weight study recruited subjects with high BMI whereas the Web study
recruited college graduates. The differences in the group-level discount rates are reduced when
we exclude overweight and obese subjects (BMI ≥ 25) from the estimation samples. Chabris et
al. (2008) estimate discount rates at the individual level and show statistically significant
relationships between the estimated discount rates and composites of variables such as BMI,
smoking, and exercising.
observations that are in the top 2% of the distribution of the demeaned response
times.5 We apply these exclusions to all subsequent analysis.
        The columns labeled choice data in Tables 2 and 3 show the estimated
discounting parameters when the model is estimated with choice data that is
taken from the trimmed sample.6 We form the decision difficulty measure,
Γ(Δˆ t ) , using these parameters.
                                       ˆ ) predicts response time, we estimate
         To test our hypothesis that Γ(Δ t
the linear regression model
                                    RTit = b0 + b1t + b2 Γ(Δˆ t ) + ε it .
The effect of Γ(Δ ˆ ) is highly significant (p < 0.001) and positive in the
                   t
regression. Figure 1 shows, for each of the three datasets, a plot of
RTit − b1t (averaged by trial) against Γ(Δˆ t ) , and the corresponding regression
lines. When we average by trial and control for the learning effect,
Γ(Δˆ t ) accounts for 51.2%, 49.8%, and 61.3% of the variance, respectively, in
the Weight, Cognition, and Web studies. When we estimate a different α for
each of the different reward categories, the results are even more statistically
significant—the corresponding R 2 values are 74.8%, 64.1%, and 70.8%.

4.2. Using response times to predict choice
         We also estimate the discount function using only the response time
data. Specifically, we estimate equation (5) by minimizing the sum of squared
residuals (6). Table 2 shows the estimates of α̂ and ω̂ for each of the three
datasets, with the choice data columns showing estimates obtained by
estimating the choice data model (2) and the RT data columns showing
estimates obtained by estimating the RT model (5). Overall, the estimates based
on choice data covary closely with the estimates based on response times. The
correlation between the α̂’s estimated from choice data and the α̂’s estimated
from response time data is 0.97.7


5
  Response time is a very noisy variable because of the many ways in which it can be affected on
any given trial. An example of an outlier is a 59-second response in the Weight study (compared
to a mean of 3.4 and SD of 2.8 seconds in this dataset). In other analyses, varying the cutoff point
from 2% yielded similar results to those reported here.
6
  These estimates are nearly identical to those in Table 1.
7
    In contrast, the   ω̂   estimates do not move together because of a discrepancy that arises in the
Weight study. The correlation between the ω̂ ’s estimated from choice data and the               ω̂ ’s
estimated from response time data is –0.66.
         Additionally, we estimate α and ω for each of the three reward
categories. We simply estimate the choice model separately for each reward
size category. The response time model is similar to expression (6), except that
we allow a distinct discount rate, αˆk , and precision parameter, ωˆ k , for each of
the three reward size categories—small, medium, large. Therefore, we seek the
vector (bˆ0 , bˆ1 , bˆ2 , αˆ s , αˆ m , αˆl , ωˆ s , ωˆ m , ωˆ l ) that minimizes

                                 ∑ [ RT
                                   it
                                            it   − (bˆ0 + bˆ1t + bˆ2 Γ(Δˆ tk ))]2 ,

where
                                                                  2
                                          Δˆ tk =                   Yt
                                                                                   ,
                                                           ωˆ k             − Xt
                                                                  1+αˆ kτ t
                                                     1+ e
and k ∈ {s, m, l} indexes the reward size categories.
        Table 3 shows the estimates of α̂ and ω̂ for each of the three reward
categories in each of the three studies. Again, the estimates based on choice
data covary closely with the estimates based on response times. The correlation
between the α̂’s estimated from choice data and the α̂’s estimated from
response time data is 0.82.8


4.3. Monte-Carlo horse race
           As a final test, we compare the predictive power of models estimated
using choice data and models estimated using RT data. The idea of the
procedure is to estimate α and ω on a subsample of the data using the choice
model and also using the RT model, and then compare the out-of-sample
predictions for choice data of the two estimated models. This places the RT
model at a disadvantage because we are using RT data to make predictions
about subsequent choice behavior.
           We run Monte Carlo simulations with 1000 trials for each of the three
studies. On each trial, we choose M subjects randomly and without replacement
from the N subjects in the study. Using data from those M subjects we find
αˆ choice and ωˆ choice by maximizing expression (2) and we find αˆ RT and ωˆ RT by
minimizing expression (6).
           For the other N–M subjects, we first calculate the mean squared
residual from the choice-estimated and RT-estimated parameters. We define the
squared residual on trial t of subject i induced by parameters α and ω as

  The correlation between the ω̂ ’s estimated from choice data and the ω̂ ’s estimated from

response time data is 0.94.
                                                             2

where the variance of the logistic distribution is 1/ ω and where dit is a binary
0-1 variable that equals 1 if and only if subject i chooses the delayed reward on
trial t . Next, we calculate the fraction of responses predicted correctly by the
two sets of parameters. We say that a response dit is predicted correctly by the
discounting parameters α and ω if the probability of that response is at least ½
under the choice model:
                                     ⎛ Yt             ⎞
                        dit − FLogit ⎜          − X t ⎟ ≤ 1/ 2 .
                                     ⎝ 1 + ατ t       ⎠
         For each study, we run the Monte Carlo procedure for M = 25, M = 50,
and M = 75 and we compute the average of the mean squared residual and the
fraction of responses predicted correctly across the 1000 trials. Table 4 shows
the mean squared residual and the fraction of responses predicted correctly for
the two sets of parameters estimated from choice and RT data, respectively.
The discounting parameters estimated using RT data predict out of sample
responses almost as well as the parameters estimated using choice data.
         When we estimate the discounting parameters for each of the three
reward categories, the results are qualitatively similar. The difference is that the
discounting parameters estimated using RT data do not predict out of sample
responses very well when the sample size is small (M = 25). This could be due
to the addition of more parameters to the model and the inherently noisy nature
of response time data.
5. Conclusion
        We have used two different approaches to measure preferences. First
we adopted the classical approach of inferring preferences from choices.
Second we adopted the novel approach of inferring preferences using only
response time data. Remarkably, these two approaches yielded nearly identical
preference estimates for our aggregated subjects. We conclude that response
time data sheds light on both our preferences and on the cognitive processes
that execute those preferences.
        Future work should extend this analysis by asking related questions at
the individual subject level. Can response time data also predict variation in
preferences at the subject level? Are there sources of data, whether response
times or other indices of information processing such as neural activity, that can
be used to improve our ability to predict an individual’s choice behavior? Fully
exploiting all of the behavioral and physiological information that we can
measure during intertemporal choice should enable us to construct more
accurate models that yield more novel and precise predictions.
