Econometric Risk Adjustment, Endogeneity, and Extrapolation Bias

                                            ABSTRACT

In econometric risk-adjustment exercises, models estimated with one or more included endogenous
explanatory variables ("risk adjusters") will generally result in biased predictions of outcomes of
interest, e.g. unconditional mean healthcare expenditures. This paper shows that a first-order
contributor to this prediction bias is the difference between the distribution of explanatory variables
in the estimation sample and the prediction sample -- a form of "extrapolation bias." In the linear
model context, a difference in the means of the respective joint marginal distributions of observed
covariates suffices to produce bias when endogenous explanatory variables are used in estimation.
If these means do not differ, then the "endogeneity-related" extrapolation bias disappears although
a form of "standard" extrapolation bias may persist. These results are extended to some of the
nonlinear models in common use in this literature with some provisionally-similar conclusions. In
general the bias problem will be most acute where risk adjustment is most useful, i.e. when estimated
risk-adjustment models are applied in populations whose characteristics differ from those from
which the estimation data are drawn.

I. Introduction
          In econometric risk-adjustment exercises, models estimated with one or more
included endogenous explanatory variables ("adjusters") will generally result in biased
predictions of outcomes of interest, e.g. unconditional mean expenditures. Taken at face
value, this result hardly seems surprising.
          Interestingly, a first-order contributor to this prediction bias turns out to be the
difference between the distribution of explanatory variables in the estimation sample and
that in the prediction sample -- a form of "extrapolation bias." In the linear model context,
a difference in the means of the respective joint marginal distributions of observed
covariates suffices to produce bias when endogenous explanatory variables are used in
estimation.     If these respective means do not differ, then the "endogeneity-related"
extrapolation bias ("EEB") characterized below disappears even though a form of "standard"
extrapolation bias ("SEB") may persist.         These results suggest that the bias problem will
tend to be most acute where risk adjustment exercises are likely to be most useful, i.e.
when estimated risk-adjustment models are applied in populations whose characteristics --
observed and unobserved -- differ from those from which the estimation data are drawn.
          The plan of the paper is as follows.          Section II provides the basic econometric
analysis and results. Using these results, Section III demonstrates how these extrapolation
biases arise in the linear model.       Section IV sketches briefly how related extrapolation
biases might be manifested in some nonlinear models. Section V concludes.


II. Analysis
          To the extent that there is a typical econometric risk-adjustment exercise, it might
entail:
          (a) regressing some measure of period-(t+1) expenditures (y) on a set of period-t
                "adjusters"   or   covariates   (x,z)    using   data   characterizing   a   reference
                population ("A") described by the distribution φA ( xA , zA ,uA ) , where u are

                unobserved determinants of y and y = y(x, z,u; β) ;

          (b) deploying these results to formulate a generic prediction model for an outcome

                like mean expenditures as m(x, z) = m(x, z; βA ) (note that m(x, z; β) does not

                necessarily represent a correct specification of E ⎣⎡y|x,z⎦⎤ ; more on this below);

                and
          (c) applying this estimated model in a different population ("B") to predict
                unconditional mean expenditures in that population by utilizing covariate data

conceptual and empirical risk adjustment literature.
            It is assumed in this section that the model relating (x,z,u) to y in a population

described by φ j uj, x j, z j (             )   is a linear model with parameters β j = ⎡β0 , βx , βz ⎤ ' :
                                                                                        ⎣⎢ j          ⎦⎥


                y j = y(x j, z j,uj; β j ) = β0 + βx x j + βzz j + uj ,                                        (1)

where for simplicity of exposition x and z are specified for now as scalar "endogenous" and
"exogenous" covariates, respectively; the general k-covariate case is presented below.2
While the parameters ⎣⎡βx , βz ⎤⎦ are assumed invariant across populations, the constant term

is permitted to vary across populations to accommodate distributions of unobservables that
may have different unconditional means in different populations. Then


            E ⎡⎣ y j ⎤⎦ = E[β0 + βx x j + βzz j + uj]

endogeneity of x in population j are characterized here as, respectively,

  For present purposes, a "population" is a collection of individuals defined by some
geographic, demographic, temporal, administrative, membership, or other relevant
exogenous characteristics. Thus, for instance, a set of individuals defined by a common
geographic criterion but having time-varying characteristics that is observed at two distinct
points in time might usefully be described as two distinct populations.

    In general, the "j" notation will be used here to index populations (e.g. j ∈ {A,B} ); except
where useful for clarity, subscripts indexing individual observations are suppressed.                                The
symbols           { y j, x j, z j,uj    }   represent either scalars or Nj × 1 vectors; the particular meaning
should be obvious from context.

For particular characterizations of x and u, a suggestion that σxu ≠ 0 would be compelling

under any number of reasonable assumptions about the nature of observed and unobserved
determinants of healthcare expenditures.

and using (5)-(7), it is instructive to note that

i.e. that the inconsistent OLS estimator βA does not translate into an inconsistent estimator

of E[y A ] in (2).                    m(x, z) evaluated at           (µ   A A
                                                                          x , µz   )   consistently predicts E[y A ] even though

m(x, z) is in general inconsistent for E ⎡⎣ y j|x,z ⎤⎦ = β0 + βx x + βzz + ξ j(x) for arbitrary values
                                                           j

( x,z ) .   The next section shows, however, that this consistency property is fragile, holding

only at the particular point of evaluation                          {( x = µ ) , (z = µ )} ; it is this fragility that ultimately
                                                                                A
                                                                                x
                                                                                            A
                                                                                            z

has potentially serious implications for empirical risk adjustment exercises.


III. Extrapolation Bias in the Linear Model
            The policymaker or risk adjuster is presumed to be interested primarily in the
quantity E[yB ] -- i.e. mean expenditure in population B in period t+1 -- but has access only

to period-t data from φB ( xB , zB ) .                        (The quantity of interest might be total expenditures,

NB × E[yB ] , rather than mean expenditures, but this distinction is not important here.) The

forecasting stage of the risk-adjustment process would then proceed by taking the generic

prediction model estimated using population-A data, m(x, z) , and predicting E[yB ] as


                              N
            E ⎡⎣yB ⎤⎦ =   ∑i=B1 wim(xiB , ziB )                                                                          (10)

consistent owing to suitable specification of the weights wi (e.g. wi = 1 / NB in random

sampling). From Slutsky's Theorem,

            p lim E ⎣⎡yB ⎦⎤ = p lim β0          ( A ) + p lim (βx ) µBx + p lim (βz ) µBz ,                              (11)

so it follows that

            This is the central result of the paper: In cases where endogeneity is in play in the
                         A
estimation population ( σxu ≠ 0 ), the departure of the estimator of unconditional mean

expenditures in population B from its true value will be governed in part by how much the
marginal means of the explanatory variables differ between the A and B populations, i.e.

(µB
  x   − µxA   )   and       (µ
                             B
                             z             )
                                     − µzA .     Note that this large-sample "endogeneity-related" extrapolation

bias ("EEB") may or may not have the same sign as the "standard" extrapolation bias

("SEB"),          (β0A − β0B ) , that arises even when                             A
                                                                                  σxu = 0 owing simply to the distributions of

unobservables in populations A and B having different unconditional means. Finally, note
from (5)-(7) that the parameters underlying the bracketed term in (12) except for
                      A
(β0       − β0 ) and σxu can be identified from the population-A and population-B samples, and
      A       B

in some instances theory or prior information might shed light on at least the signs of
                      A
(β0       − β0 ) and σxu if not their magnitudes.

            These results generalize to the more empirically-relevant cases that specify (k+1)-
vectors of explanatory variables, subsets of which may be endogenous.                                              The model of

  The derivation of the results that follow is facilitated by reference to two theorems
provided by Graybill, 1983. Suppose J is a nonsingular k × k matrix and that v is a k × 1
vector such that J+vv' is also nonsingular. Then:


                       ⎛          J−1vv ' J−1 ⎞
       ( J + vv ')−1 = ⎜⎜ J−1 −                ⎟              (Graybill, Theorem 8.9.3)
                       ⎝          1 + v ' J−1v ⎟⎠

and
       v ' Jv = tr ( Jvv ') .                                 (Graybill, Theorem 9.1.20)


Equations (14) and (15) are derived starting with familiar expositions of OLS estimator
properties when the latter are presented in terms of matrix partitions (e.g. Amemiya, 1985,
equations (1.2.12) and (1.2.13)).

i.e. the inconsistent OLS estimator ⎢β0 , βQ '⎥ still yields a consistent estimator of E ⎣⎡yA ⎦⎤ .

       As in (12), however, there will arise in general large-sample extrapolation bias when

m(Q) is evaluated at the covariate means from population B. Specifically,

IV. Extrapolation Bias in Nonlinear Models
       The use of linear risk-adjustment models like (1) or (13) may be more exception
than rule in practice. A reasonable conjecture is that the conclusions reached here for the
linear model will hold a forteriori in the variety of nonlinear approaches ( y = ϕ ( Q, u) ) to

econometric risk-adjustment that have been proposed and applied in the literature:
transformation-retransformation          models;            two-part          models     with     or   without   part-two
transformation-retransformation; generalized linear models under log-link assumptions; and
others. In these contexts it would be expected that the aforedescribed biases will depend

on properties of the joint marginals φ j x j, z j      (      )   beyond simply their marginal means.                This

section sketches briefly such an approach for one prominent nonlinear model structure used
in the risk-adjustment literature; however, further research into this issue would probably
be valuable.     Suppose that the standard log-transformation-retransformation approach
provides the basis for estimation, i.e.




                  (
        y j = exp β0 + βx x j + βzz j + uj ,
                          j                   )            yj > 0                                                 (19)

with

          ( )
        ln y j = β0 + βx x j + βzz j + uj ,
                      j
                                                                                                                  (20)




                                                             7
       j           j
where σxu ≠ 0 and σzu = 0 as before.                         Such a model may be appropriate when positive

expenditures are observed for all subjects, or alternatively as part two of a two-part model.

With covariate endogeneity, an explicit functional-form characterization of E ⎡⎣ y j ⎤⎦ is typically

more difficult to derive than in the linear case.4
       On the basis of OLS estimation of (20) using population-A data, a researcher might
posit the generic prediction model



        m(x, z) = m(x, z;βA ) = exp β0          (   A                )
                                                        + βx x + βzz ρA ,                              (21)



and then (in light of Jensen's inequality) use a sample average of this quantity rather than
evaluating it at the covariates' means to estimate mean expenditures in population j as



                        ∑i=j1 wi exp (β0A + βxxij + βzzij ) ρA ,
                           N
        E ⎡⎣y j ⎤⎦ =                                                                                   (22)

with wi = 1 / Nj , for example. In (21) and (22) ρA is an estimated retransformation factor

that will be discussed below.                   Specifying (22) as a generic prediction model under the
(incorrect) assumption that all covariates are exogenous would be sensible under an
assumption of mean-independence of u conditional on (x,z), i.e.

           The (second-order approximate) manifestations of extrapolation bias are apparently
more complex here as compared with the linear model. T2 will equal 1 if the endogeneity-

related parameter estimator inconsistency, κ(.) , equals zero or if the covariate means in the

prediction population j are equal to those in the estimation population A; otherwise, the
magnitude of T2 will be governed by the magnitudes of the large-sample parameter

estimator biases and the degree of discrepancy between the respective populations'
covariate means. In addition, the form of T3 indicates that the magnitudes of the κ(.) will

interact with the second moments of the population-j covariates, so that -- unlike the linear
model -- more than just the first moments of the covariate distributions come into play in
determining the properties of the estimator (22).
           Finally, this discussion has assumed the existence of an estimated retransformation

factor ρA .      Whether standard methods of estimation like homoskedastic smearing retain

their consistency properties in the presence of endogenous covariates seems tenuous;
definitive resolution of this issue awaits further research.


V. Conclusions
           If population B is similar to population A in the sense that φB ( xB , zB ,uB ) resembles

closely φA ( xA , zA ,uA ) , then the utility of any econometric risk-adjustment exercise is

limited: In this case, simply use a statistic like the marginal sample mean of yA to predict

E[yB ] .    As such and unfortunately, the results presented here suggest that when risk-

adjustment exercises are likely to be of greatest utility -- those circumstances where
φB ( xB , zB ,uB ) is dissimilar to φA ( xA , zA ,uA ) -- they will be most prone to the extrapolation

biases described above.
           While the paper's algebra is not particularly novel, its application to this important
realm of policy research and implementation raises issues that have not -- to the author's

knowledge -- been addressed explicitly in the risk-adjustment literature.5      Ultimately the
paper's central results underscore the importance of a careful, reasoned approach to risk-
adjustment exercises.     The use of endogenous adjusters might in some instances be
defensible; for instance, it is imaginable that the inclusion of additional adjuster variables,
even if endogenous, could result in a smaller prediction MSE than were they excluded. Such
considerations notwithstanding, the main message to be drawn here is that it can be
dangerous to apply a risk-adjustment model estimated using data drawn from one
population to a second population whose characteristics -- observed and unobserved --
differ importantly from those of the former population, particularly when maintaining
econometric exogeneity of all the adjuster variables is tenuous.

   While this paper has focused on the specific case of healthcare expenditure risk
adjustment, the analytical results presented above are likely to be applicable generally in
situations where extrapolations of the sort considered here are of central concern.
