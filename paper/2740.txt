                      MANAGEMENT OF A   COMMON   CURRENCY



                                  ABSTRACT



                                                                 coun-
 This   paper presents a simple general equilibrium model of two

tries using a common currency. The goal is to study how the monetary

arrangement influences the optimum financing of a public good.

   If the two countries are allowed to print the common currency

autonomously, they will finance their fiscal spending with money,

oversupplying the public good and crowding out the private sector.

The possibility to export part of the inflation creates a distortion

in incentives such the resulting equilibrium is strictly welfare in-

ferior to the one prevailing under flexible exchange rates.

   If the management of the common currency is deferred to an interna-

tional central bank, each country will try to use domestic policy var-

iables (taxes) to manipulate in its favor the actions of the bank.

With no independent domestic taxes, the bank can improve welfare.

However, its policies naturally support the larger country, and to in-

duce the smaller one to participate requires giving it a dis-

                                                               in the

                                     Introduction

      The possibility of European monetary integration has been frequently discussed in
the past few decades; see for example the volumes edited by Fratianni and Peeters (1979),
Johnson and Swoboda (1973), Salin (1984), and Masera and Triffin (1984) . Much of
the debate derives from the theory of optimum currency arms originally proposed by
Mundell (1961) and extended by McKinnon(1963) (see also a useful recent discussion in
Wood (1986)). More generally, Fischer (1983) provides an enlightening commentaryon
the problems involved. While interesting issues have emerged, the literature has remained
informal, with few attempts to provide a systematic foundatii __ which to base arguments
for and against common currency.
      Our purpose in writing this paper is to present a formai two auntry general equilib-
rium framework in which the questionof alternativemonetzysystems can be addressed,
in the spirit of Helpman (1981) and Helpman and Ftazin (122) We are especiallyinter-
ested in contrastingthree monetary regimes, flexible exchange rates, a commoncurrency
issued autonomously by both countries, and a common         rrey       whose management is
delegated to a jointly controlled central bank. Flexible exchangerates are the appropriate
reference case, since they will prevail whenever either country deviates from the common
currency agreement. We keep our model very simple, especially in that we assume com-
plete information and consider only the case of two countries. As an added simplification,
we summarize each country's welfare in terms of a single representative citizen. The citi-
zen possesses a parametericutility function which depends on both the home and foreign
goods, which are different, and on the home country government's provision of a public
good. Money is needed to help finance the public good, which alternatively can be financed
through lump sum taxation.
       Broadly stated, we find that establishinga common currency area is difficult, because
each country views such a system as a means of exploiting the other. These pervasive
free rider problems tend to reduce both countries' welfares. often below that which they
achieve under flexible exchange rates. Of course, these difficulties are of the same nature as
 those studied in the literature on international policy coordination, from Hamada (1976)
onwards.
      More specifically, when the two countries maintain a ocnmon currrency which each
can print, the free rider problem leads to an equilibrium tlaiitt is strictly dominated by the
flexible exchange rate case. In our model this result is &las true, but more generally
                                                                          Common Currency -   3




it will be true when governments weigh the utility of future generations sufficiently. We
argue, therefore, that such a regime is not enforceable, since both countries would have
an incentive to deviate by issuing a national currency. This first result suggests that the
organization of a jointly controlled central bank is crucial for a common currency, and
we devote much of the paper to this case. Unfortunately, even here coordination can be
difficult. When the countries maintain control over taxation the central bank is unable
to improve over the flexible exchange rate system: each country uses its tax policy to
manipulate the Bank, hoping thereby to strengthen its position vis-a-vis the other, but in
the process attenuating Bank effectiveness. With no taxes, the Bank can improve welfare.
However, ifthe influence of each country on the decisions of the central bank is proportional
to the country's relative wealth, an agreement is attainable only if the two economies are
either comparable or extremely asymmetrical in size.
      As mentioned, the model is very simple and we do not claim these results to be
general. Nonetheless, the incentive effects which arise are likely to be important in eval-
uating a variety of suggestions for monetary integration. Our results also suggest that
considerably more attention should be addressed to the specific organizationalfeatures of
a jointly controlled central bank. In particular the following seem relevant: the mechansim
design literature; the application of Groves' mechanisms as a way for the central bank to
coordinate countries' fiscal interventions;and the political forces lying behind the Bank's
charter and decision-making body.


                                  Model Specification

      The world is comprised of two countries, Red and Blue (R and B). Each period,
citizens of each country are born with a fixed endowment of their respective good; Red
are born with 9, Blue with (2 â€” 9). When young, the citizens sell their endowmenton a
competitive market in their home country. When old, they spend the proceeds from their
previous period's sales on purchases of both the domesticand the foreign good; they then
return home, consume, and exit the economy.1 All transactions happen through money.
      In addition to the private goods, the consumers' utility depends on the provision
of a public good (as in Kehoe (1987)). While demand for the public good might be
independentof events in the private sector (for example military spending), we prefer to
think of it as directly related to the trading process itself. Thus for example the Red
                                                                       Common Currency - 4



and Blue markets may be situated on the border between the two countries; to arrive at
the markets consumers travel on roads maintained by their respective govenments. If the
roads are in poor condition, purchased goods depreciate substantially before consumption
is possible.
      More formally,
                          Up = O.5log(Cftjj) + O.5log(Cajtt)
                                = O.5log(CB) + O.51og(C)

C denotes

             consumption of good i by a citizen of country in timeperiod t, and for each
period
                        CRIt   = rRR      CBR    = FBR       r>0
                               = FBg      CRB    = FR8       b> 0
with R, (B1) being the quantity of good R (B) purchased by a citizen of country j during
                                                                                  j
t, and F3 representing provision of the public good by the government of country in the
period.
     The government supplies the public good by collecting resources from the private
sector. This can be done either in the form of direct lump sum taxation of the citizens'
                          j
endowments (denoted Tj, = R, B ), or throughthe expenditureof fiat moneyon the
domestic market (M,,j = R, B ). For each period we define


                                       F3 = 7,   + m3

where
                                       inj =
with p, the nominal price on market j.2
      Depending on the monetary regime between the two countries, we can solve for
the equilibrium prices on the private markets as a function of the governments' policies.
This results in country specific indirect utility functions, which the governments in turn
maximize over the variables T3 and M3.
      The interest of this simple model rests precisely in the interactionbetween the two
governments' policies. Each country's welfare function depends on foreign choices of taxes
 and money, and lack of cooperation leads to suboptimal equilibrium.

      In thenext sections we study different forms of monetary (and fiscal) linkages between
the countries; we are interested in which types of linkages lead to effective coordination
of the governments' actions and achieve the highest welfare outcomes. We focus on three
possible regimes: flexible exchange rates, a common fiat currency printed autonomously
by the two governments, and delegation of monetary policy to a common central bank.3


                                 Flexible Exchange Rates

     Each country issues its own currency which must be used on the local market. Ex-
change rates are perfectly flexible and there are no transactionscosts.
     In period I the red consumer maximizes

                              = r1og(rft) + O.5log(R4rjt) + O.5log(Bat)               (1R)

subject to the budget constraint

               PRtRRE   + etPBtBRi = PR(t_1)(RR(t_i) + RB(t_l) + ma(g_fl)              (2R)

where   e is the exchange rate (defined as units of Red Currency required in exchange for
one unit of Blue Currency), PR,(zâ€”i) is the nominal price on the Red market last period,
and mRt is the real money spent by the Red government on the Red market. (The left-
hand-side of equation (2R) gives the nominal income earned by a red consumer through
the previous period sale of his endowment.)
        Similarly a Blue consumer maximizes

                        UBf   = b1og(r) + O.5lo9(B3g) + O.51og(Ra)                     (1B)

        Each government chooses the path {Tjt, vnt} that maximizes the discounted sum of
its citizens' utilities:
                                       max     =E
                                   {T m}           1=0
where  Â£ is the discount rate reflecting the length of the governments' horizon.
      The interactionbetween the governments may therefore be formulated as a dynamic
game, possessing multiple equilibria. Since instantaneousutilities only depend on contem-
poraneous policy variables (i.e.  U    = U1(T1, m1)), we can easily solve for one possible
equilibrium of this game: the "static" equilibriumin which dynamic interactions are ne-
glected, reducing the dynamic case to a sequence of repetitions of the "one-shot" (single
period) game. The static solution is a perfect equilibrium of the full dynamic game.
      Maximization of CT31 over F31 and Uet over F81 yields optimal expenditure policies,
which are constant over time:
                                       2r9                 2b(2 â€”
                                                   8= 1+2b9)                                  (13)

Two points are noteworthy. First, whether a country's public good is financed by taxes
or by flat money is irrelevant. An increase in the proportion financed by money increases
inflation, while leading at the same time to a proportionate depreciation of the exchange
rate. Thus the higher nominal wealth of the country's citizens does not translate into a
higher share of world resources. Second, the governments' decisions are independent of
one another, even though each country's citizens' utility depends on the other country's
policy; this finding is special to the simple Cobb-Douglas utility form we have specified.
     Since each government neglects the effect of its public expenditure on the other
country's welfare, the non-cooperative Nash equilibrium we have derived is not Pareto
optimal. In fact, the two countries spend too large a fraction of their resources on the
public good. The intuition is straightforward. An increase in government expenditure

reduces the supply of goods for private consumption. While residents are compensated by
the additionalsupply of the public good, foreigners, in our model, do not benefit from it in

                               SimulationMethodology

      Each of the models presented has been simulated over a range of parameter values.
We concentrate on variation in two parameters: 6, which measures the relative size of
Red as opposed to Blue; and r (with b fixed) which measures Red's relative desire for the
public good (the size of the public sector). To calibrate these parameters, considerthe left-
hand-side of Table 1, which lists the European countries which are members of the EEC,
together with their GDP (in ECU units) and the share of GDP devoted to government.
The right-hand-sideof Table 1 depicts the ranges of 6, i-, and 6 chosen. The variable &
ranges from 1.0 (equal size) through 1.25 and 1.50 to 1.75 (7 to 1 size differential), while
his fixed at 1/2 (government's share is then one third) and r ranges over 1/4,1/2, and 1.


                   Simulation of Flexible Exchange Rate Regime

       Figure 1 illustrates Red and Blue utility under flexible exchange rates as a function
of the relative endowment (6), for different values of r (Red's need for the public good).
As 6 increases, the share of world resources owned by the Blue country falls, and so does
Blue welfare. As the weight of the public good in Red utility, r, increases, so does the
intervention of the Red government in the Red market. This implies a decrease in the
proportion of Red goods available for private consumption,and therefore a loss of utility
for Blue nationals.
       In the Red country, an increase in 6 increases national wealth, but reduces relative
world supply of the Blue good. The two effects tend to counteract each other, the first
dominating for & close to one and the second becoming progressively more important, until
Red utility begins to fall for 6 approximately larger than 1.5. The relevance of this second
effect is smaller, as expected, when the publicgood plays a larger role in utility (r higher).

                    Common Currency            Printed by Both Countries

      Suppose now that the two countries use the same currency, and that each country
maintains a central bank and can print as much of the currency as it likes. This seems the
natural setting for the case of perfectly substitutable currencies studied in the literature
(see for example Kareken and Wallace (19S1))6, and is to be distinguished from the case
of a common currency printed by a joint central bank.
      Derivation of the demand functions is identical to the flexible exchange rate case

with set equal to 1 for all t. Substitution of (4) in the two goods markets' equilibrium
conditions yields the equilibriumrelative price:

      The utility of a consumer at time t now depends both on contemporaneous and last
period government policies. However, the problem is greatly simplified by the additively
separable form of the utility function. At time t, a government maximizing the present
discountedsum of its citizens' utilities can isolate the terms depending on its period t poli-
cies. Redefining this sum as the government payoff of the "one-shot" game, the repetition
of the static solution yields once more a perfect equilibrium for the dynamic problem, in
which each period policy is independentof the previous period choice.
      Taking into consideration only the relevant terms, the red government will act at

      In contrast to the flexible exchange rate regime, the policy mix between money and
taxes is now relevant to welfare. The first important observationis that, in this framework,
the optimal level of taxes is zero in both countries. Collecting revenues through seignorage
has a positive effect on the relative wealth of nationals next period, because the world
inflationrate rises less than proportionately. Since this is not true for taxes, all government
expenditure will be completely financed by fiat money.

      The nature of the solution dependson the value of 5 (the length of the governments'
horizon). If S is equal to zero (the governments do not consider future generations'utilities),
then optimal policy is identical to the flexible exchange rate considered above.

Utilities are also equal to the flexible exchange rate case. However, as S increases (as
the governments give more weight to future generations'utilities), the optimum amount of
money becomes larger since its only partial effect on world inflation allows each government
to increase the purchasing power of its future citizens. At the same time, utilities become
lower, as the Nash equilibrium yields ever higher world inflation. Eventually, for S equal to
one (the governments care equally about current and future generations), this monetary
regime fails to possess a Nash equilibrium: for any amount of currency issued by the foreign
government, the home government desires to supply more.
      In the simple case 8 = 2â€”9 = 1, the first order conditions associated with optimiza-
tion problems (18) are:

If S = 1   and r = S = 0.5, these expressions can be further simplified:

     For different values    ,
                           of we were unable to obtain a simple closed form solution,
and we checked our intuition with numerical simulations. The results of the simulations,
confirming the expected outcome, are depicted in Figure 2. The conclusion does not depend
on the symmetry of this simple example. Different endowments (9 1) or different needs
for the public good (r b) did not alter the qualitative nature of our result.7
      The important point established by this exercise is that, at least in our model, in-
dependent printing of a common currency by national central banks is strictly dominated
by the flexible exchange rate regime, and is not, therefore, a viable institutional arrange-
ment. Each country ha.s an incentive to deviate, printing a new currencyand requiring its
exclusive use on the domestic markets.
      The source of this result lies in two effects. The first one relates to the distortion
caused by non-cooperation between the two governments in the flexible exchange rate
regime. In our model, the two public sectors in a Nash equilibrium with national currencies
are too large. The second effect is the free-rider problem connected with the shift to a
common money. If 8 is different from zero, such a shift implies an ever higher level of
spending by the governments (this is quite general, and does not depend on our specific
assumptions). When the two effects are added, the result, or course, is that the institution
of a common currency exacerbates the already present distortion and leads to a decrease in
welfare. While our result remains true in models in which flexible exchange rates achieve
the first best, in a more general setting the welfare comparison would depend on 8. We
believe that it is always possible to identify a 8 < 1 such that welfare under flexible
exchange rates is inferior to welfare under common currency and national central banks if
and only if 8 < 8 In our model, 6 = 0.


                                 Common Central Bank

      Suppose now that the two countries have agreed on the institution of a common
central bank to whom decisions concerning the fiat currencyare deferred. The central bank
acts to maximize the weighted sum of the utility of its members, with the weightsreflecting
the proportional representation of each country. The Bank determines the paths over time
of three quantities, aggregate world money supply, the fraction of that amount spent on
each market, and the distribution of seignorage (which may differ from the distribution of
money purchases on the two markets) between the two countries.

framework of Beraheim and Whinston(1986), although we assume that all Bank actions
are observable, and, as an initial simple example, that full information about each coun-
try's parameters is common knowledge. We also, for the time being, assume that the

distributed to country z in period t and rn,1 is the real amount of fiat currency spent on
market   i   during t.
      In general, the two countries can supplement Bank action with their own fiscal and
monetary interventions. However, as the earlier analysis showed, in the case of common
currency, free and independent issuing of money by the two governments results in lower
welfare. This remains true when the governments'decisions coexist with a central bank.8
      More interesting, and relevant, is the case in which each government retains its right
to collect taxes from its nationals, while monetary policy is fully delegated to the central
bank. Quite suprisingly, it is possible to prove that in this regime it is optimal for the
central bank to set new money issues to zero. The two countries will completely finance
themselves through taxes, and will achieve exactly the same welfare as in the flexible
exchange rate case.
     The intultion is as follows. For any positive amount of real money injected into
the domestic market, an increase in taxes implies a reduction in the availability of the
domestic good in the private sector, and hence a rise in its relative price (relative to the
other country's good). This requires a higher level of nominal money from the Bank to
achieve the same real money injection, thereby increasing nationals' relative wealth.
      In other words, if mR and mB are positive, each governmentchooses a level of
expenditure that is larger than in the flexible exchange rate case, in the effort to exploit
                                                                           Common Currency - 14



central bank policy to its own purposes. In equilibrium, this implies a welfare loss. If
instead mR and mB are botb set to zero by the central bank, it is easy to show (by
comparing equations (16) and (12)) that the current problem is identical to the flexible
exchange rate case.
     Slightly more formally, the conclusion follows from proving that, for any n-z1, the
marginal utility of taxes in country .j is higher in the common currency regime than in
the flexible exchange case. Substituting the demand functionsgiven in (4), we obtaln the
discounted sum of the citizens' utility,

In the flexible exchange rate regime, lrjt is given by equation (10); in the common currency
regime by equation (14). Examinationof these equations demonstrates that d(los+) is
the same in both, whereas d(1og(1+,1,+n) is larger in the flexible exchange rate regime for
all rn1 different from zero. Since all other terms in equation (20) are the same across the
two regimes, the result follows.5
      In our model, if the governments retain their fiscal powers, not only is the central
bank incapable of improving coordination between the two countries, but in addition any
action it takes serves only to introduce incentives driving the countries further away from
a first-best outcome. Once again, the unqualifiedstrength of this result depends on the
specific assumptions of the model (the direction of the distortion in the flexible exchange
rate regime; the lump-sum character of the taxes and their effect on the terms of trade).
The point we want to stress is general, however, and, we believe, important: the presence
of a common currency, even under the control of a central planner. is the source of
additional potential distortions. In a world which is not Pareto optimal, the final outcome
 would then depend on second-best types of arguments.

      Consider now the extreme case in which the two governments are not allowed to
collect taxes. The only resources available for the supply of the public good are, in each
country, those ditributed as seignorage by the central bank.
      Since the central bank maximizes weighted aggregate social welfare, its choices will
clearly constitute a first best arrangementin this case; what is less clear is how the coun-
tries' weights translate into individual country utility, particularly as compared with the
earlier monetary regimes.

As above, the central bank maximizes the weighted sum of discountedutilities.

(Note that does not enter these expressions.) The total amount of money is spent on the
           c5


two markets in equal proportions, while the division of seignorage is determined by the
relative need for the public good.
       For 9    1 (and c c 0), we have not been able to obtain a closed form solution,
and we present the results of numerical simulations. In Figure 3 the welfare of the two
countries is depicted as a function of the relativesize of the endowments and of the weight
of the public good in Red utility (for = .910). As 9 increases, the Blue country becomes
                                                                         Common Currency -   16




poorer and has less influence on the decisions of the central bank. As expected, its utility
declines. The Blue country's utility is also lower the higher is r, since a higher r implies a
proportionallylower Blue share in the division of seignorage. This second effect becomes
more important the larger is 8.
      As in the flexible exchange rate case, the Red utility increases with 8, until the
negativeeffect of the Blue good's scarcity starts to dominate the positive impact of larger
national wealth and larger bargaining power. The relative importance of the negative
effect (scarcity of the Blue good) is lower the larger is the weight of the public good in
Red utility, since a larger r gives added relevance to Red's increased bargaining power in
the sharing of seignorage revenues.


                                 Welfare Comparisons

       It is now possible to compare utility levels across different monetaryregimes, as func-
tions of the parameters. Since the common currencyâ€” national central banks arrangement
is strictly dominated by the flexible exchange rate case, we havealready argued that such a
regime cannot be sustainedin our model. In addition, we haveprovedthat when the coun-
tries agree on a common currency and a common central bank, but retain fiscal powers,
the equilibrium reduces identically to the one characterizing flexible exchange rates. The
interesting comparison is thereforebetween the latter regime and the case in which, with
a common currency, the financing of the public good is entirely deferred to the common
central bank.
       In Figure 4, the welfares of the two countries under the two regimes are drawn as a
function of 8, the relativeendowment of the Red. When 8 is close to one the two countries
have similar wealth and similar bargainingpower. The central bank case then achieves a
first best allocation which is preferred to flexible exchange rates by both the Blue and the
Red. However, as 8 increases the bargaining power of the Blue country falls (recall that
representationis proportional). By the time the Red country is 25% bigger than the Blue
(8 equal to 1.125)Blue prefersthe flexible exchange rate regime: it will deviate, issuing its
own currency and requiring the currency to be used on the Blue market, thereby moving
the world economy back to the flexible exchange rate regime.
       The relative attractiveness of the two regimes dependsin a predictableway on Red's
relative need for the public good (see Figure 5). As r falls (diminished need) Blue's

preference for the central bank increases, and so does the difference in bargaining power
necessary for the Blue government to abandon the central bank agreement. As for the Red
country, an increase in B has, in both regimes, the two opposite effects discussed above. In
the central bank case, the growing scarcity of the Blue good is partially compensated by
Red's increased bargaining power.
      What is especially interesting is the finding that proportional representation,in
which a country's influence on the Bank is proportional to its size, is not a feasible system
for even modest deviations of B from one. Figure 6 explores this issue further, plotting
the "zone of participation" for the central bank money only case. The shaded region is,
for each 9, the range of weights for which both countries find the central bank preferrable
to the default flexible exchange rate regime. The forty-five degree line corresponds to
proportional representation and the horizontal axis to a one country â€” one vote system.
As noted above, by the time 9 reaches 1.125, proportional representation is not in the
feasible (participation) zone. Even though belonging to the union would eliminate the
externality, the small country would enjoy less of the public good than under flexible
exchange rates, and would face worsened terms of trade in the private markets. These two
negative effects disappear as the asymmetry between the two countries widens.
      Therefore we reach the (not implausible) conclusion that a common central U-nk
might be relatively easy to establishin a world of either equal or highly unequal trading
partners, but not otherwise.

                                        Extensions
      We believe the model presented here couldbe usefully extendedin several directions.
First, we could investigate more fully the mechanism design problem facing the two coun-
tries in the creation of an "optimal" central bank. Since the sharing of power is crucial to
the willingness of countries to participate, devising an appropriate system of representation
seems to be a crucial issue.
     Second, the extension of our model to a multi-country world would be nontrivial.
The incentives to join or abandon the union, and the choice of policy, presumably held
in common by all members, towards outsiders are examples of important questions that
would require analysis.
     Third, we can study optimal policy in a world of uncertainty. What we specifically
have mind is a situation where the Red country knows r and the Blue b, but neither

                                                                       Common Currency -   18




country knows the other; by assumption the central bank observes neither r or b, and
must solicit each from the respective countries, designing incentives which ensure these
are reported truthfully. We would guess that it will be difficult for the central bank to do
better in this case than in the perfect information examplewe have presented.
       Finally, there is a more fundamental point that needs to be addressed. While the
model we built can be used to study the potential for policy coordination in different mon-
etary regimes, it does not address an important aspect of the current European debate.
Specifically, nowhere does it demonstrate (derive endogenously) a need amongst the coun-
tries for a common currency, and more generally, common institutions, such as common
Snancial and bank laws. This problem is general and very important. Welfare improving
Irade between agents requires efficient communication,and this requirement becomesmore
rrucial as the economy grows, with technology becoming more sophisticated and fields of
specialization narrower. Traders who "speak a different language" will not only suffer
transactions costs, but will increasingly lose opportunities and information. Eventually,
they might remain confined to a secluded, low productivity corner of a global market. We
are currently developing analyses which address these points.11

      1Simple technical assumptions can give rise to the described sequence of transac-
tions. Suppose, for example, that each good comes in a specific variety and each consumer
has specific preferences. Then a competititivemarket will be needed to provide optimal
matching.
     2lii this formulation governments are prohibitedfrom purchasing goods on the foreign
market, and of course they can only tax their own nationals.
      3For completeness, we have also solved the model for the case in which the two
countries use the same currency, but this is supplied monopolisticaliy by one of the two.
Imagine that the Red currency is needed for transactionson both markets. We write here
this solution as a future reference, for comparison with results obtained later in the text.
The Red government alone can print the currency, and spends it on the Red market to
finance the public good. It can be proved that the Red government will never resort to
direct taxation. The two instantaneousutility functions are then:

      = rlog(mR1)+O.5log(6_mR)+log(O)â€”O.5log(2â€”Oâ€”TB)â€”Iog(2&â€”mR(l_1))
                                                                 (1AR)

UBi   = blog(TB)+.5log(2â€”9_T8)+log(9â€”m(1_l))+O.5log(9â€”mm)_Iog(2Oâ€”mjqt_l))
                                                                                            (lAB)
Maximizationof         SLTRr with respect to mRt gives the condition

                              â€”   r â€” 1/2) =         â€”   3r   â€”
                                                                  1)   + 292r                 (2A)

while the Blue government will set TB to

                                                 â€”
                                                 9)
                                        T8= 2b(2
                                              1+2b
The welfare of the two countries can then be derived as a function of the parameters 8, 5, b
and r. For example, when r = b = .5 and 8 = .9, we have for 9 equal to one:

                               UR   =    1.39    UB   = â€”2.6
                                                                         Common Corrency - 20


and for A equal to 1.5:
                              U8   = â€”1.33       1B = â€”3.06

The general result is that the Red country does better than in any other regime, while the
Blue country does worse.
     4We assume no government intervention in the foreign exchange market.

      5While it is clear that a better equilibrium can be reached through coordination of
financing decisions, thereis no reason why we should expect this to occur automatically,or
even just more easily, in a world with a unique currency. The shift to such a regime requires
justifications that are outside the model presented. As usual, the simplest justification
is transactions costs. Think, for example, of a scaling down of utility when consumers
purchase on the foreign market, spending time and effort to understand the workings of
a foreign currency system. This point is further discussed in the Extensions section of
this paper. For an interesting approach to transactions costs in the context of optimum
currencyareas, see Mundell(in Johnson and Swoboda(1973), Chapter 7).
       51f there are two distinct currencies, perfect substitutibility requires the highly un-
likely existence of fixed exchange rate regime with zero probability of revision.
       7Two points are worth mentioning. (1) While the dependence of optimal policy on
the government's horizon is well-known in the literature (see Alesina and Tabellini (1987)),
our model is somewhat special since it focuses on the strategic interaction between the
two countries (and not between two successive national governments) when a common
currency is used. This explains why our conclusion (a myopic government inflating less
than a forward looking one) is in contradiction to previous results. Of course, it would
be interesting to extend the analysis to a model taking both effects into consideration.
(2) Strictly speaking, the maximization problem is not well defined for S = 1 (since the
objective function is a non-converging infinite sum). We should then rewrite the problem
as the maximization of a time average, which we believe would give the same result. This
is a minor technical point.

      51t is presumably possible to design a tax scheme such that the two countries are
taxed by the central bank on their additional printing of the common currency, and these
tax revenues are then redistributed. It is crucial that each country not receive back what
was withdrawnfrom it in taxes. In fact, in accordance with the Groves' mechanismsolution
to the free rider problem in public finance, it might be sensible to study an agreement in
                                                                      Common Currency -   21



which the taxes collected from one government are distributed to the other. The tax rates
would then depend on the inflation rate. We would like to develop this point further.
     9More precisely, our result   obtained by assuming that the central bank acts as a
                                   is

Stackelberg leader with respect to the national governments. The conclusion is sensitive
to the equilibriumconcept we use.

      'Â°When 9 is different from 1, the solution seems to depend on but only slightly.
We have simulated the model for values of 5 ranging from .5 to 1, obtainingsubstantially
the same resuit.
