                                              ABSTRACT

Political future markets, in which investors bet on election outcomes, are often thought a recent invention.
Such markets in fact have a long history in many Western countries. This paper traces the operation
of political futures markets back to 16th Century Italy, 18th Century Britain, and 19th Century United
States. In the United States, election betting was a common part of political campaigns in the antebellum
period, but became increasingly concentrated in the organized futures markets in New York City over
the postbellum period.

         Election betting markets have been growing in popularity. These markets are
chiefly an internet phenomenon, leveraging the ability of a large number of participants
to quickly and cheaply place wagers on the outcome of upcoming elections. The first
such market, the Iowa Political Stock Market, was founded in 1988 and involved modest
stakes and only a few hundred traders. The more recent incarnations, most prominently
Intrade and Betfair, have thousands of traders and involve millions of dollars in wagers.
There is strong evidence that prices in these markets provide accurate forecasts of
election outcomes.1
         The prominence of internet election markets often obscures the long history of
such exchanges. Betting on elections has been going on for hundreds of years in many
western countries. The absence of these markets in the mid-20th century is more the
exception than the rule.
         In this paper we document the history of election markets. These markets reflect
the prevailing culture and electoral institutions. Betting focused on the most important
political outcomes of the time: papal selection in 16th century Italy, the timing and
winning party of Parliamentary elections in 18th and 19th century Britain, and Presidential
and Congressional winners in the 19th century United States. There were also markets on
other political events, such as the outcome of no-confidence votes, the tenure of leaders
and their successors, or the outcome of foreign/military ventures.2
         We focus on the historical evolution of the legality and microstructure of political
betting markets commonly referred to as prediction markets. The first two sections
describe the earliest markets in Italy as well as Great Britain and its former colonies. The
third section turns to the United States. During the antebellum period informal bets were
common in virtually every city, indeed they was a core part of most campaigns, yet there
did not exist a centralized, formalized betting market generating odds prices reflecting
changing expectations about election outcomes. Following the Civil War, more explicit

  There were also markets which indirectly captured election outcomes. Insurance premia, exchange rates,
and security prices of politically-connected assets often reflect (or span) the same fundamentals that would
drive political stock market prices.

markets emerged and betting activity became concentrated in New York City. Due in part
to changes in the legality of election betting, the New York markets moved from pool-
rooms to the Curb Market and uptown hotels and finally to illegal bucket shops on Wall
Street.3 The markets largely disappeared or went underground at about the time of the
Second World War as scientific polling came into its own.4


I. The First Markets: Italian City States and the Vatican

         Election betting was common in the Italian city-states in the early modern period,
1500-1700.5 In addition to voting, selection to public office often included intentional
randomization, for example, drawing lots to name the nominators or candidates. In
Venice and Genoa, gambling on the outcome of local elections was popular. Bellhouse
suggests that the Genoese lottery, one of the first modern numbers games, originated with
betting on the drawing of lots⎯pulling balls associated with specific candidates from an
urn.6 Political betting continued into Italy’s recent history including, at times, as part of
its national lotto (established in 1863). For example, in the pivotal 1948 election, the
state-run lottery experimented with a “totalvoto” pool allowing betting on the
composition of parliament.7 Figure 1 displays a 1948 “Totalvoto” ticket for sale recently
at EBay Italy.
         Gamblers have also long wagered on the selection to offices in the Catholic
Church. Quotes of betting odds on papal succession appear as early as 1503 when such
wagering was already considered “an old practice.”8 During the troubled papal conclave
of 1549, the Venetian ambassador Matteo Dandolo observed that the Roman “merchants

  Bucket shops operated off-site from the official exchange and catered to low-stakes investors who bet on
whether stock prices would rise or fall.

betting, but their odds fell by election day. During the campaign, the Communists protested against the
inclusion of the electoral contest within the national lottery system. But the winner of the 60 million lire
prize was a supporter of the Communist Popular Front.

are very well informed about the state of the poll, and … the cardinals’ attendants in
Conclave go partners with them in wagers, which thus causes many tens of thousands of
crowns to change hands.”9 Odds were offered not only on which candidate among the
papabile would win but also on when the conclave would end. About two months into
this long and conflict-filled process, the market odds were 10 to 1 (implying a probability
of approximately 9 percent) that this conclave would never elect a pope. Aversion to
such activities eventually led Pope Gregory XIV, in March 1591 to ban on pain of
excommunication all betting on the outcome of papal elections, the length of the papal
reign, or the creation of cardinals.
        Gregory XIV’s threat pushed wagering over papal succession underground, but at
times it resurfaced. As a 1878 New York Times article noted: “The deaths and advents of
the Popes has always given rise to an excessive amount of gambling in the lottery, and
today the people of Italy are in a state of excitement that is indescribable. Figures are
picked out which have some relation with the life or death of Pius IX. Every day large
sums are paid for tickets in the lottery about to be drawn.”10 Betting over the successor
to Leo XIII in 1903 and to Benedict XV in 1922 attracted considerable press attention.11
With the recent rise of internet betting markets, betting on the new pope could again
occur in public on a large scale.




II. Election Betting in the Anglo-American World

A. Britain

        Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As an example, Charles
James Fox, the late 18th-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler.
His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan noted that “(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards,
Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political

occurrences of the time.”12 His wagers recorded in the betting book of the Brooks’ Club
included whether the Tea Act would be repealed, how long Lord North’s minister would
last, or on other events related to the coming of the American Revolution. Such activity
at gentleman’s clubs (such as Almack’s, Brooks’, White’s, Boodle’s) as well as in less
elite public coffeehouses was considered in keeping with national tradition: “As far back
as the reign of William the Third, foreigners had observed that, on matters great and
small, the only sure test of English opinions was the state of the odds.”13 A common
phrase was “Bet or be silent.”14
         Wagering was generally legal under British common law, so long as it did not to
lead to immortality or impolity.15 Bets about the outcome of events in war, over the
death of political leaders, over court cases, or between voters over election results were
illegal on these grounds.16 In the Victorian and Edwardian periods, the British
government increasingly attempted to limit gambling, especially among the working
classes. The Gaming Act of 1845 made gambling contracts and debts unenforceable in
court (but otherwise liberalized what amounts could be wagered); the Betting Houses Act
of 1853 outlawed the operation of betting establishments other than private clubs; the
Betting Houses Act of 1874 cracked down of the advertisement of wagering; and the
Street Betting Act of 1906 made acceptance of wagers in streets and public places
illegal.17 Still in the late 19th and early 20th century, the Fleet Street press occasionally

reported on election wagering at the London Stock Exchange and at Lloyd’s in markets
for Parliamentary “majorities.”18
        The Economist noted that during the interwar years: “there was a considerable
amount of gambling on the composition of the next parliament. At one time there were
extensive dealings in ‘majorities’ on the Stock Exchange.”19 The quoted prices for the
shares of party seats in the 1924 contest were somewhat off but those in the 1929 contest
were closer to the mark. Real problems arose in the 1931 race when the market
significantly under-estimated the number of seats that the National government would
win.20 “There was a much publicized lawsuit when a trader, unable to honour his debts,
pleaded the provisions of the Gaming Act. The sequel was a ban by the Council of the
Stock Exchange on all such dealings, which has been reaffirmed at each subsequent
election.”21 For the 1935 election, betting moved from the Exchange to London
bookmakers. This did not totally end such betting in the City. In the autumn of 1940,
during the battle for Britain, London brokers among others ran organized betting
sweepstakes regarding how many German planes would be shot down each night. The
winnings were used to fund the construction of Spitfire fighters.22
        In the immediate post-WWII period, public election betting in Britain appears to
have slowed to a trickle. Newspapers offer only a handful of quotes regarding the 1945
and 1950 contests. And in 1950, the Economist observed: “It is curious that in a nation
devoted to gambling as the British, so little opportunity should nowadays be taken of a
general election, the most sporting of all events.”23 This situation changed with time.
        The modern era of open, large-scale political betting in Britain began in October
1963. Following Harold Macmillan’s surprise resignation as Prime Minister after the
Profumo Affair, the gambling house Ladbroke’s overcame the “long-standing reluctance

to make book on political events” by taking bets on his successor as leader of the
Conservative party.24 Prior to 1963, Ladbroke’s had handled the political betting
demands of its more gentlemanly clientele in a private election book.25 In 1964, William
Hill, the country’s largest bookmaker, also “quickly reversed its earlier policy not to
handle election betting.”26 By the end of that year, political betting totaled an estimated
₤1,000,000 (the equivalent of over $25 million in today’s money.) About nine-tenths of
this sum was placed on British contests, including the Wilson-Heath general election, and
about one-tenth placed on the 1964 American presidential race. Political markets
represented less than 2 percent of national gambling turnover. Several features of the
political markets’ microstructure were notable: the stakes were anonymously wagered;
house profit rates averaged about 7 percent (taking in ₤107 for every ₤100 it pays out);
and professional bookmakers set the fixed lines rather than accept bets in the form of
pools. This last feature mattered at times when, for example, Mr. Hill set a line too
favorable to a candidate he supported.27 In 1965, the London bookmakers began offering
odds on the German election contests. And in early 1966, with new general elections in
Britain, they handled over ₤2,100,000. This was purportedly the largest total ever taken
on a single event.28 Despite complaints about the immorality of such wagering, the
British betting public never looked back.29

B. British Commonwealth Countries

        Similar bouts of political betting occurred in many of the British offshoots with
parliamentary forms of government throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In
countries including Canada, South Africa, and the Republic of Ireland, local bookmakers
and members of the Stock Exchanges periodically wagered over the outcome of no
confidence votes, the timing of the elections, and the composition of the new majority.30
        In Canada, there were many reports of betting over results in both national and
local elections during the late 19th century. For example, the Toronto World had several
reports on betting markets covering the 1882 and 1887 Parliamentary elections, the 1886
West Quebec Provincial election, and the 1885 and 1887 Toronto mayoral elections.31
There was additional coverage of gambling on many of the Parliamentary elections
through 1930, with a half a million dollars bet in 1911 alone. In addition, there were
occasionally active markets on local elections.32 While many of the bets were one-shot
affairs involving prominent individuals, there were more traditional markets associated
with the stock exchanges in Toronto and Montreal.33 The Toronto Star provided
extensive coverage of election betting in the United States, reporting New York City odds
right before election day to bring its readers up to date.34

   For examples of election betting in Ireland, see the discussion of the Dail Eireann (lower house of the
Irish Parliament) in Scotsman, 5 January 1933, p. 9; for South Africa, see Scotsman, 13 June 1929, p. 9.
Interestingly there is little evidence of early betting markets in Australia, perhaps stemming from laws
which allowed bookmakers to accept wagers on horse racing but no other events (the latter restrictions
were lifted in the 1980s).
31
   The issues of the Toronto World are: 8 June 1882 for the 1882 Parliamentary election; 22 and 25 February
1887 for the 1887 Parliamentary elections; 1 October 1886 for the West Quebec election; 6 January 1885
for the 1885 Toronto mayoral election; 3, 4, and 5 January 1887 for the 1887 Toronto mayoral election.

III. Election betting in the United States

         In this section we trace the development of American betting markets in the 19th
through 20th centuries. A more formal analysis of the forecasting accuracy and financial
efficiency of these markets is described in two companion papers.35

A. Pre-Civil War

         Betting on political events was commonplace in the United States ever since the
early national period.36 Advocates of a candidate frequently offered public bets on his
behalf as a standard part of the election campaign. This became expected sign of support,
even for races of lesser offices. As an example, William Cooper of Cooperstown, New
York enjoyed the strong betting backing of his friends during his race for Congress in
1796.37 Political wagering became especially intense during the partisan conflicts of the
Jacksonian era.38 The practice fit into the spirit of campaigning in this period with its
torch-lit parades, chanting partisans, hard cider, and captive newspapers. In this era, most
press outlets were closely tied to the political machines of either the Democrats or the
Whigs. Newspapers were at the heart of much of the early betting activity. 39 Many of the

   Alan Taylor, “’The Art of Hook & Snivey’: Political Culture in Upstate New York during the 1790s,”
Journal of American History (March 1993), p. 1386, entire piece is pp. 1371-96. Taylor considered “bets
between the friends of candidates” one of four main instruments in early electioneering (p. 1380). He notes
“rival interests strove to intimidate one another and to impress voters with bets. A bet between the
supported of rival interests was an exercise in competitive self-assertion. A public bet on a candidate was
an investment of reputation and honor as well as of money.”
38
   As examples at the beginning of this era, see Baltimore Patriot, 9 November 1824, p. 2; and New-
Hampshire Patriot & State Gazette 1, December 1828, p. 2. Glenn C. Altschuler and Stuart M. Blumin,
Rude Republic: Americans and their Politics in the Nineteenth Century (Princeton, NJ: Princeton
University Press, 2000), p. 73 hold that while political parties were not directly responsible for most
election betting in the period, they did encourage the practice among their partisans.
          Several noteworthy recent surveys of political history in the early national and Jacksonian period,
including Sean Wilentz, The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln (New York: W.W. Norton,
2005) and Michael F. Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the
Onset of the Civil War (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1999) are remarkably silent about election betting.
39
   Regarding the political scene in New York in the 1790s, Taylor, “The Art of Hook & Snivey,” p. 1386
writes “the newspaper office became a kind of brokerage house for wagers. There a gentleman could leave
a note or bond indicating what he would bet on a candidate; there a rival gentleman could agree to take up
that note or bond or leave one of their own. The curious could call to inquire about who had bet and how


                                                      8
election betting articles that appeared in the press were boasts or challenges rather than
reports of actual wagers transacted. As one instance, “to test the sincerity” of local
supporters of Gen. Jackson who “express their entire confidence in the success of their
favorite candidate,” John Leach issued a slate of a dozen bets in his local newspaper
during the 1828 contest.40 The Albany Argus, voice of the New York regency, published
its own list of challenges in 1832 and 1836.41 Similar advertisements to wager appear
during most other major elections of the period.42
         We know that it was not all bluster; real money was wagered. For example,
archival records show that in late October 1832, John Nevitt of Natchez, Mississippi
placed a $960 bet on Andrew Jackson’s re-election. This sum was worth the equivalent
of $20,000 today and was more than double what Nevitt annually paid the manager of his
Clermont plantation.43
         Such big-money wagering was not limited to private citizens. Politicians were
often involved. As candidate for the Governor of New York in 1828, Martin Van Buren
wrote to a follow politico: “Bet on Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois jointly if you can, or
any two of them; don’t forget to bet all you can.”44 Battles between the Jackson forces
and the “Bankites” raged during the 1832 contest.45 And in 1834, Van Buren’s son, John,
and friend, Jesse Hoyt, record making over one hundred election bets, amounting to
$12,000 to $15,000 ($290-360,000 in today’s money). At this time, John Van Buren was
New York Attorney General and Martin Van Buren was the nation’s Vice President.46
As another indication of the involvement of elected officials, the Washington DC
correspondent for the North American reported in early 1840: “Some heavy bets were


the wagers stood. Like the accumulation of nomination notices in the papers, reports of the ebb and flow of
bets served as public opinion polls”

made between members of the House, to-day, on the approaching Presidential
Election.”47 Election betting in 1840 was carried on as never before.48 The 1844 contest
between Henry Clay and James Polk witnessed an even greater flurry of betting.49 Press
reports indicate more than $6 million ($138 million in current dollars) changed hands in
New York in the 1844 contest between Clay and Polk.50


B. The Ebb and Flow of Election Betting
         To provide a better sense of the ebb and flow of election betting in the antebellum
period, we surveyed the historical newspapers and periodicals available in the leading
online sources – African American newspapers of the 19th century; the Cengage-Gale 19th
Century US Newspapers, PaperofRecord.com, the Proquest American Periodical Survey
and Historical Newspapers, and the Readex Early American Newspapers -- for relevant
articles over the 1800 to 1860 period. Our tabulation excludes articles concerning
legislative action to outlaw election betting as well as those discussing non-financial bets.
This survey found roughly 150 articles. The cumulative distribution of this sample is
displayed in Figure 2. The sample contains a small number of articles in the first decade
of the 19th century, but observations drop off during the so-called “Era of Good Feelings”
(1815-1823) period. The number of articles picks up in the mid-1820s with the
beginning of the Jacksonian movement and Whig reaction. The peak of activity occurs in
1840 and 1844, and then falls off again. Activity falls in 1850s before rising during 1860
election season.51
         Wagering on elections became highly controversial. In 1840, Van Buren
supporters charged British gold was being invested in “bragging bets” and “buying votes”

   The number of newspapers covered in the online sources generally expand over time, This makes
interpreting these trends somewhat problematic. The decline in the number of observations on election
betting articles after 1844 is even more significant once the expansion in overall coverage is taken into
consideration.

in favor of Harrison.52 In turn, in the aftermath of the 1844 contest, the Whigs protested
that a combination of gamblers favoring Polk had committed voting fraud using the
winnings from election bets to defray their expenses.53 New York Governor Silas Wright
complained vigorously in his 1845 message to the state legislature of “the extensive and
rapidly increasing practice of betting upon elections, and the interested and selfish, and
corrupting tendencies which it exerts upon the election itself.” Wright urged the
legislature to make election betting a criminal offense.54 The evangelical reform
movements associated the “Second Great Awakening” also preached long and hard
against election betting.55 And the Illinois Supreme Court did invalidate one bet as
“against public policy and the best interests of the whole country.”56 Election betting was
commonly considered a form of vote buying.57
         With the collapse of the Second Party system and the ongoing Democratic-Whig
rivalry, election betting appears to have slowed.58 We can only speculate why. By the
late 1840s, a large number of states had made election betting illegal. The re-orientation
of the parties and the development of intense sectional conflicts may have reduced the

worst and most pernicious species of gambling… a people is preparing for despotism when it turns the
elective franchise of its highest offices into a mere subject of pecuniary speculation.” Atkinson’s Saturday
Evening Post, 5 January 1839, p. 2. But earlier in the election season, the pro-Ritner Philadelphia
newspaper, the Pennsylvania Inquirer and Daily Courier, 20 August 1838, offered to bet $10,000 in his
favor in the race for governor against David Porter. (For a counter-offer, see Harrisburg Reporter and
State Journal, 21 September 1838). In this hotly-contested election which ended in the so-called “Buckshot
War,” the sum wagered purportedly totaled over one-half million dollars. Colored American, 28 November

sphere of personal contact leading to wagering as well as trust that the losing stake would
actually be paid. Political wagering did not disappear as the career of Abraham Lincoln
makes clear. In 1857, his firm handled a case involving a bet over the 1856 presidential
election.59
        Much of the activity in the period surrounding the Civil War took the form of
public challenges, for propaganda purposes. In 1864, August Belmont, a wealthy New
York Democrat and representative of the Rothschild’s interests in America, boasted he
would “bet heavily on McClellan’s election.” His terms, however, represented a
conditional wager, stating that McClellan’s victory would bring peace but Lincoln’s re-
election would result in continued war and eventual disunion.60 Other proposals were
offered for bragging rights and were not serious wagers. An extreme example of this
purportedly occurred in 1868 when New York drug store owner, H. T. Helmbold, offered
to bet $1 million cash at even odds to take the Democratic side on a slate of election
propositions. J. Kinsey Taylor of Philadelphia offered to take Grant’s side.61 It is unclear
whether both sides actually staked this wager. Such even-money boasts do not provide a
meaningful set of odds concerning which candidate would win the election. But markets
generating such odds would soon come.


C. Post-Civil War
        Election betting involving real financial stakes occurred in almost every city. But
increasingly over the postbellum period, such wagering became organized in markets
centralized in New York City.        In the late 1860s and early 1870s, activity was focused in
pool halls such as Johnson’s and Morrissey’s. Betting in this period took the recently-
developed pari-mutuel form. That is, participants would buy fixed-dollar shares in the
final pot and the odds would be determined at the end of all betting (a candidate’s final
odds of winning was determined by the proportion the total bet volume which was
wagered on him). The New York dailies report substantial activity in the national and
state contests of the 1870s, but the form of betting make the odds difficult to translate

into subjective probabilities. In addition, problems arose with the 1876 Hayes-Tilden
contest. This election was essentially a draw with the political parties charging each
other with fraudulently manufacturing votes. The House of Representative eventually
decided this highly contested election. The acrimony spilled over into the betting market,
where $4 million was wagered.62 John Morrissey, the leading New York pool-seller and
an active Democrat, opted to cancel the pools, returning the stakes minus his commission.
This solution left many unsatisfied, contributing to the push in the next session of the
New York legislature to outlaw pool-selling.
        After a brief lull in the late 1870s and early 1880s, election betting revived in the
mid-1880s and began to flourish in the 1890s. Activity moved out of pool rooms onto
the Curb Exchange in the financial district and to the major Broadway hotels. The
politically-connected hotels included the Republican-oriented Fifth Avenue Hotel and the
neighboring Democratic/Tammany-oriented Hoffman House.63 The Metropol and
Waldorf Astoria were also locations for betting on elections. The leading bet
commissioner, or stakeholder, in the public eye was Charles Mahoney, who held sway at
the Hoffman House until 1910.64 Over most of this period, the standard betting and
commission structure was for the betting commissioner to hold the stakes of both parties
and charge a 5 percent commission on the winnings. If the commissioner trusted the
credit-worthiness of the bettors, it was not necessary to actually place the stakes and
instead the signed memorandum or letter of obligation sufficed.65
        During the heyday of election betting in the late 1890s and early 1900s, the names
and four-figure stakes of bettors filled the pages of New York’s daily newspapers. By
way of contrast, most of the reported wagering in the 1920s and 1930s involved six-
figure amounts advanced by unnamed leaders in the business or entertainment worlds.
This shift to increasing anonymity reflected changes in tax laws, New York state anti-
gambling legislation, and the public attitudes of the organized financial markets. The

Hart-Agnew act was passed by the New York legislature in 1908 to outlaw professional
bookmaking employing written bets (and was extended to cover oral bets in 1910). The
prohibition was directed primarily against horse racing and the Tammany-linked
Metropolitan Turf Association, but the law’s passage also reduced betting on elections
for several years.
        Figure 3 graphs the cumulative number of article returned from online searches
for “election bet” in the New York Times from 1851 to 1950 and the Washington Post
from 1880 to 1950. The Figure supports the conclusion that the heyday of election
betting extended from the 1890s through the mid-1910s.
        In 1912, the New York Curb Association publicly reminded its members that
placing bets was contrary to New York laws. “Any member found betting, placing bets,
or reporting alleged bets to the press will be charged with action detrimental to the
interest of the association, which may lead to his suspension.”66 The betting
commissioners in the financial district initially responded by revising their contract form
– creating a memorandum between “friends” to transfer money conditional on the
election outcome—and by raising the commission rates to reflect their increased legal
exposure. There was some talk of moving operations to New Jersey and many
commissioners reduced or stopped keeping book.67 When the heat was reduced after a
few years, election betting revived. Ironically, in the 1916 contest between President
Wilson and Charles Hughes, who as New York Governor had signed the Hart-Agnew act
into law, election betting on Wall Street reached its peak: $10 million (or $200 million in
current dollars) was wagered on the national election.
        By the late-1910s, the newspapers more commonly published stories centering on
bet commissioners and bucket-shops in the financial district. (Bucketing was the practice
of a broker accepting an order to buy a stock without actually executing it. The broker
was essentially betting with the client about the changes in the stock’s price.) In the early
1920s, three “brokerages” dominated election betting in the Wall Street financial district:

W. L. Darnell & Co., 44 Broad Street; J. S. Fried & Co., 20 Broad Street; and G. B. de
Chadenedes & Co., also of 20 Broad Street.68 Other prominent New York bookmakers of
the period include John Doyle, owner of a Broadway billiard academy, who principally
handled wagers on sporting events such as prize fights and the World Series and Fred
Schumm, a politically-connected café owner in Brooklyn, who dealt in both election and
sports bets.
        The organized financial markets continued to attempt to limit involvement of their
members. For example, in May 1924 both the New York Stock Exchange and the Curb
Market passed rules/resolutions against election gambling. The Exchanges liked to
distinguish between their risk-sharing and risk-taking functions, which was socially
productive, from gambling on sporting events such as horse races or prize fights, which
were zero-sum entertainment activities whose outcomes did not affect the broader world.
But unlike with sporting events, betting on elections potentially belonged in the risk-
insurance category and the information it provided had real-world value. One could
readily imagine a risk-averse owner of an investment project betting for a candidate
unfavorable to the project to hedge against a “bad” election outcome. However, in
practice it appears that bets were partisan in the sense that bettors took the side of their
preferred candidate.


D. Demise of the Election Betting Markets
        The formal political betting markets appear to have largely disappeared by 1944,
although informal bets continued to take place right up to the current period of internet-
based markets. There are several explanations for the demise of the markets: (1) the rise
of scientific polling; (2) the passing of several of the leading election betting
commissioners; (3) the active suppression of the New York illegal gambling scene; (4)
the contraction, during the early 1940s, of key sources of betting dollars; and (5) the
legalization of horse race betting.

68
  Two of the three (Fried and Darnell) in fact were owned jointly by Samuel Solomon (aka Sam Boston)
and the Silinsky brothers (Abraham, Frank, William). Although the newspapers often referred to the odds
as quotations from the Curb, the links with the New York Curb Exchange were informal at best. Frank
Silinsky did have a seat on the Exchange and Richard C. Fabb, an early publicist for the market, also
worked for the Fried firm over the mid-1920s. “Bets to Exceed $5,000,000” New York Times, 31 August
1924, p. 3.


                                                  15
        The press attention devoted to the Wall Street betting odds was due in part to the
absence of creditable alternatives. In the early years of the 20th century, the only other
information available concerning future election outcomes came from the results from
early-season barometer contests (such as the mid-September contest in Maine), overtly
partisan canvasses, and unrepresentative straw polls.69 Over the 1894-1918 period, the
New York Herald published the results of its massive straw polls in the weeks leading up
to election day. In November 1916, for example, it reported its tabulations of nearly one-
quarter million straw ballots collected from across the county.70 In the 1920s and 1930s,
Literary Digest, issued the best-known non-representative poll based on mass-mailing
postcard ballots to millions of names listed in telephone directories and automobile
registries. After predicting every presidential elections correctly from 1916 to 1932, the
Digest famously called the 1936 contest for Alfred Landon, the Republican candidate, in
the election that Franklin Roosevelt won by the largest Electoral College landslide ever.
        The early polls based on scientific samples correctly predicted Roosevelt’s
victory. George Gallup, who had left academia and the advertising industry to form the
American Institute of Public Opinion in 1935, was often credited with a singular gift of
prophesy.71 However, the polls of the other pioneers of public opinion research
including Elmo Roper, who began the Fortune Survey in 1935, and Archibald Crossley,
also called the 1936 race correctly (as did the Wall Street betting odds). The numbers
from scientific polls were available on a relatively frequent basis and were not subject to
the moral objections against election betting. Newspapers, including the Washington
Post, began to subscribe to the Gallup polling service and tout its weekly results in their
pages. At the same time, they reduced their coverage of betting markets. Such trends are
displayed in Table 1, which reports the number of articles in presidential election years in
the New York Times and Washington Post returned in online search from selected "poll"
and "election betting” terms from 1916 to 1944.

         Other factors also contributed to the demise of the Wall Street betting market.
Several of the pre-eminent betting commissioners active in election wagering left the
trade either due to death by natural causes (John Doyle) or to gang-land slayings (Sam
Boston).72 La Guardia’s general crack-down on illegal gambling, including “raids on
brokers’ offices” also made it “difficult to find betting commissioners in the financial
district” by 1944.73 Tammany Hall, which had often taken the Democratic side of wagers
during the heyday of New York election betting, also fell onto hard times. La Guardia’s
repeated re-election as New York City mayor cut off much of Tammany’s patronage,
driving the organization to declare bankruptcy in 1943. High wartime taxes were
purportedly crimping the pockets on Wall Street too.74 A final factor was the legalization
of betting on horse races in New York in 1939. The possibility of betting several times
each day at the track, rather than once or twice a year on elections, siphoned the dollars
of bettors and bookmakers.


IV. Conclusion

         Election betting has a long history in Western countries. These markets often
involved greater stakes and induced greater emotions than the internet markets of current
times. The bets were such a central feature of culture in certain times that even those
lacking the money to place a wager got involved. In the United States during the 18th and
19th centuries non-financial bets were wildly popular, where the losers had to roll peanuts
with a toothpick down a street, climb up a greased pole, shave their hair or make other
public gestures. In 1900, there were at least a half a million such “freak bets.”75

       While it is sometimes claimed that political betting markets are a recent invention,
they clearly are not. Rather it is the absence of such markets during the mid- and late-20th
century which is the exception.
