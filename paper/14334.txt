                                            ABSTRACT

Economic historians of the eighteenth-century British mainland North American colonies have given
considerable weight to the role of exports as a stimulus for economic growth. Yet their analyses have
been handicapped by reliance on one or two time series to serve as indicators of broader changes rather
than considering the export sector as a whole. Here we present new comprehensive export measures
for the middle colonies. We find that aggregate exports in constant prices grew very quickly, but barely
faster than population during the period under consideration. Furthermore, improvements in the terms
of trade increased the colonists’ ability to buy imports over time, especially after 1740. Although
the export sector performed well, it constituted a relatively small part of the region’s economy. It
is uncertain if this export success was sufficient to propel the entire economy at a rate that exceeded
the growth of population.

          Most interpretations of colonial economic growth lean heavily on the performance

of international exports. To some extent this comes out of necessity. “Almost the only

data available for income estimates are hard external trade figures and estimates of

population,” Jacob Price noted. 1 As a result, many scholars have stressed the causal role

that exports have played as the primary engine of economic growth for the colonies.

According to the dominant theme found in textbooks as well as scholarly works,

enterprising Europeans arrived in North America and through hard work and abundant

land created a prosperous and burgeoning economy based on the export of agricultural

staples. 2 Such arguments emphasize that the growth of external demand for colonial

exports was the crucial factor determining the pace of colonial economic growth. 3 As

Marc Egnal put it, even while acknowledging the limitations of the staple thesis, “the

export of primary products was the engine of growth for the colonial economy…[and] the

nature of these exports shaped the pattern of regional development.” 4

          Yet for all the interpretive weight that others have placed on the export sector, our

understanding of export performance in the colonial period remains relatively

incomplete. With the exception of recent work on exports from the Lower South

(Mancall, Rosenbloom and Weiss 2008), most scholars in the past have relied on an

incomplete analysis of trade performance by focusing on the rates of growth of one or

  For example, Ratner, Soltow and Sylla (1993, p. 8) observed: “In the economy that evolved in
the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, staple commodities produced for export became the
engine of growth as settlers capitalized on an abundance of resources and especially the fertility
of the soil.”

two prominent commodities, colonial trade with only Great Britain, or other indicators of

trading patterns, such as data on tonnage clearing various ports for specific sub-periods of

time. 5 They have not looked at the total value of colonial trade with the rest of the world.

         As a consequence, and not too surprisingly, different scholars looking at only

portions of the export sector have arrived at noticeably divergent conclusions about the

external trade of the Middle Colonies. 6 As we elaborate below, the lack of a

comprehensive and continuous measure of the export sector’s performance has

contributed to these disparate accounts of the timing of export growth and its impact on

the region’s economy. Although most scholars seem to accept that exports influenced the

region’s development, they do not agree on whether this resulted in a sluggish, modest or

robust rate of economic growth. This divergence of opinion reflects in part the

incompleteness of the evidence each scholar used. Until now, no one has combined the

available evidence for New York and Pennsylvania to produce an export series for the

region that covers the entire eighteenth century. 7

         In this paper we present new and more comprehensive measures of the overseas

export performance for the Middle Colonies (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and

Delaware). To produce these measures we have combined the available data for the

    See for example, McCusker and Menard (1984, p. 204) compared to Egnal, 1998, p.47.
7
   Most of these data are summarized in John McCusker’s recent compilation of colonial trade
statistics in Historical Statistics of the United States (2006), although McCusker chose not to
include the data on tonnage compiled by Lydon (1967) from reports in several Philadelphia
newspapers for 1720 to 1739. Egnal (1998, pp. 47-67), has made extensive use of these data, but
his evidence pertains to the Northern colonies, not only the Middle Colonies, and its coverage is
not consistent over time. For example, his discussion uses data on tonnage clearing Philadelphia
for the entire period 1720-1774 but adds data on tonnage clearing New York, Boston and Salem
in the years 1763-1774. And, as far as we can tell, he did not weight the tonnage from the various
ports to reflect differences in the value of their cargoes.
                                                                                                  3

major exporting colonies in the region to estimate total and per capita export volumes at

benchmark dates from c. 1726 to c. 1772; an annual series of regional exports based on

interpolation between these benchmark dates and reaching back to 1720; and a series on

invisible earnings. 8 We also examine the impact of changes in the terms of trade to

assess whether the real volume of exports was able to support an increasing volume of

imports over time.

        This paper is about trade, offering new export series and a new picture of the pace

and timing of the Middle Colonies’ external trade over the entire colonial period, as well

as documenting important shifts in the source of regional exports. We show that

aggregate commodity exports from the Middle Colonies grew rapidly, increasing nearly

6-fold in real value between 1720 and the early 1770s. There was also a significant shift

in the sources of regional exports. In the 1720s New York exported more than

Pennsylvania, but their positions eventually reversed. 9 Over the entire period,

Pennsylvania’s exports rose ten-fold, while New York’s increased a little more than

three-fold.

        Although this paper is not about economic growth, these new data have obvious

implications for the region’s economic performance. The region’s commodity exports

increased substantially, but their growth was not much faster than the growth of the

region’s population, which increased by a factor of 5.7 over the same period. As a result,

the value of commodity exports per capita exhibited little trend before the American

8
   Our series, described more fully in an appendix to this paper, encompass the period from 1720
to 1800, but the discussion in this paper is confined to the colonial period, because the estimates
for the post-Revolutionary War period are based on different sources and a different
methodology.
9
  An interesting question is whether the expansion of the port of Philadelphia facilitated the
growth of exports or the growth of exports spurred the expansion of Philadelphia.
                                                                                           4

Revolution. Such a finding is somewhat at odds with the notion, central to the staples

thesis, that the expansion of foreign demand for staples products shaped colonial

economic growth. We do not dispute the importance of exports as a source of foreign

earnings that enabled colonists to afford imported luxuries and manufactured goods that

they could not produce themselves. And it may still be the case that forward and

backward linkages played a role in the development of increasingly sophisticated colonial

economic institutions. But if the region’s economic growth depended only on the growth

of commodity exports per capita, its success would have been limited.

       Taking account of earnings generated by invisible exports and adjusting for

changes in the terms of trade helps to reconcile the perception of economic progress with

the absence of change in the volume of commodity exports. The addition of invisible

earnings raises the level of exports and exports per capita, and may have given a slight

boost to growth. The terms of trade have a more noticeable impact. Although our

constant price series of commodity exports per person rose only slightly between 1720

and 1770, improvements in the region’s terms of trade meant that the volume of imports

per capita that could be purchased by the region’s population increased at a rate of over 1

percent per year. But a focus on longer-run trends obscures another important aspect of

regional export performance. Regional exports were subject to very substantial short run

fluctuations – rising and falling by as much as 70 percent within 3 to 5 years in each

colony. These large changes must have added a great deal of uncertainty to the colonists’

economic situation.

Exports of the Middle Colonies

          Virtually all of the quantitative evidence necessary to estimate commodity exports

of the thirteen mainland British colonies can be found in data collected by imperial

officials. During the eighteenth century naval officers in American ports compiled

quarterly reports of all ships clearing and entering colonial ports along with details of the

cargos they carried and their destinations. While a large number of these naval officers’

lists have been preserved, their coverage for most ports is spotty and incomplete. 10

          British customs inspectors compiled a different, albeit similar, record of all

arrivals in English and Welsh ports beginning in 1696 and Scottish ports beginning in

1740. These data, compiled at the time into annual ledgers listing the value of imports

arriving from and exports leaving for different trading areas, provide a convenient time-

series of colonial exports to Britain. 11 They do not, however, provide evidence about

colonial exports to other areas, a limitation which is especially important for analyzing

the trade of the Middle Colonies, whose merchants sent only a small fraction of their

exports to British ports. The extent of this limitation is clear in data collected in the

American Inspector General’s Ledgers for 1768-1772. These records, compiled by the

American Board of Customs, recorded the quantities of all commodities legally exported

from and imported into 42 colonial port districts throughout the British North American

mainland from January 5, 1768 through January 5, 1772. 12


10
     McCusker (2006) and Price (1984) provide good introductions to these data.
11
   The compilers of these ledgers used a set of official values that reflected prices near the
beginning of the eighteenth century. As a result these series are best interpreted as fixed-price
indexes of the volume of trade (McCusker 2006, pp. 641-43).
12
  According to Shepherd and Walton (1972, p. 204) they “represent the only period for which we
have data that purport to be a complete coverage of colonial overseas trade.”
                                                                                               6

        Although the Middle Colonies’ exports were less valuable than such southern

staples as tobacco, rice and indigo, the region’s fertile soil and abundant annual rainfall

supported a productive agricultural sector that generated surpluses for export that have

figured prominently in discussion about the region’s economy. 13 Residents of the Middle

Colonies produced and exported a diverse array of products, but grain production, as the

assistant secretary of Treasury for the newly founded United States Tench Coxe

recognized during the post-Revolutionary era, dominated the region’s exports. At the end

of the colonial period bread and flour together with wheat made up nearly two-thirds of

the value of regional exports, but Indian corn, flaxseed, and beef and pork also made a

noticeable contribution to regional exports (see Appendix Table 2). In addition to

agricultural products the region also exported modest amounts of manufactures, including

pig and bar iron as well as a variety of wood products, such as staves, headings and

shingles. Together this small group of products accounted for close to 90 percent of all

exports from New York and Pennsylvania.

        New York and Pennsylvania dominated exports from the Middle Colonies in

these years, together accounting for more than 96 percent of the value of regional exports

(see Appendix Table 1). But most of these exports were not bound for Great Britain.

Instead, more than three quarters of the region’s exports went either to the West Indies or


13
   Despite a wealth of material on the Middle Colonies there has been no comprehensive
overview of the region’s economic history. A number of studies have explored aspects of
Philadelphia’s trading relationships, but less work has been done on New York. Despite some
recent studies of New York, discussions of the extent and growth of regional trade remain sketchy
and impressionistic. McCusker and Menard (1984, pp. 191-93) cited a number of studies that
traced the history of trade through Philadelphia, but reported that the literature on New York’s
trade was distinctly more limited, concluding that Harrington (1935) remained the best work on
the subject of New York’s trade. A somewhat more recent addition to the literature is Matson
(1998).
                                                                                                    7

Southern Europe. As a result, the volume of exports from New York and Pennsylvania to

Britain provides an imperfect and distorted guide to the importance of trade in the region.

        Unfortunately, it is impossible to find quantitative estimates as comprehensive for

earlier years. A number of scholars have been able to piece together data on the quantities

of exports of specific commodities from Philadelphia for scattered years, but these data

are too sparse and inconsistent to allow a reconstruction of the volume of trade earlier in

the century. 14 As a result, most of the analysis of trading patterns of the region’s major

ports has relied on information on the tonnage of ships clearing for different destinations,

which are available for a greater number of years.15 The tonnage data illustrate both the

rapid growth in the volume of trade from the region and the shifting importance of

different trading regions. We have used these data to compile a more complete time

series of the region’s trade which captures the impact of the shifting importance of New

York and Philadelphia and of the various destinations for their exports. 16




14
   Helen Klopfer (1936) assembled data on exports of wheat, flour, bread, and corn for most
years after 1760, but before that she was able to obtain only scattered observations for a few
years. Lydon (1967) reports data for a few years in the early 1730s, but these are not entirely
consistent with those found in Klopfer’s work. Shepherd and Williamson (1972, p. 170)
summarized what can be gleaned about exports of bread and flour from New York from the
Naval Officers lists analyzed by Louis Harper. Their tables indicate that with the exception of
data for 1733-1735, there are only a few scattered years with usable data. There are no data in
this source for Philadelphia, as the records from this port appear to have been destroyed at some
point in the nineteenth century.
15
   See in particular, Jensen (1962), Lydon (1967), McCusker and Menard (1984), Egnal (1998).
In Appendix Tables 5 and 6 we report tonnage clearing Philadelphia and New York in all of the
years for which we could find data.
16
   Tonnage clearing for other mainland colonies also increased over time. Although coastal
shipments were part of the region’s overall trade, they were not part of the foreign trade we are
focusing on here. We have estimated that the value of the region’s trade with other mainland
colonies was in the range of approximately $1 to $2 per capita from the early 1700s through the
end of the colonial period, and displayed little or no trend growth.
                                                                                                    8


New Estimates of Exports from the Middle Colonies, 1700-1772

        Our estimates of the region’s commodity exports begin with the tonnage data that

have been used by other scholars but we develop a framework within which the tonnage

data may be used to derive estimates of the value of regional exports. Following this

methodology we have constructed two sets of estimates of the region’s exports for the

years from 1700 to 1772: a series of benchmark estimates at dates for which tonnage data

are available for both New York and Pennsylvania, and a second series that interpolates

between these benchmark figures to produce an annual series. 17 The benchmark data

establish the trends in exports over the long term and major sub-periods, while the

interpolated series provides plausible annual values for other years, and thus reveals

growth over time periods that differ from those circumscribed by the benchmark years.

        The details of our estimation procedure along with the underlying data are

described in the Appendix. Here we briefly summarize the major steps in the process.

To convert the data on tonnage clearing colonial ports into export volumes we used data

from the American Inspector-General’s ledger tabulated by Shepherd (1969) to establish

the average annual quantities of commodity exports in the years 1768-1772 from New

York and Philadelphia to each of five destination regions. Then we converted these

quantity figures into a monetary value using 1840 prices and calculated the value per ton

clearing each port for each destination by dividing the value of exports by the average

annual tonnage clearing. 18 For all destinations except Great Britain we multiplied the


17
  For each of the two colonies, we also have a benchmark series that differs in terms of the time
period covered and has additional benchmark dates than those found in our regional benchmark
series.
18
   Because our eventual goal is to integrate these export figures with estimates of regional
income, and to link these eighteenth century income figures to those for the nineteenth century,
                                                                                                      9

time series data on tonnage by our base period estimates of value per ton to estimate the

value of exports from each colony. 19 To estimate exports to Great Britain we

extrapolated the base year value of exports using an index derived from the constant

value series of imports into Great Britain from each colony. After aggregating the value

of exports to each destination from New York and Pennsylvania we inflated them to

capture the value of the region’s exports from Delaware and New Jersey.

        Table 1 presents the base year data (1768-72) on the value of exports in 1840

prices, tonnage clearing for various destinations, and the average value per ton to each

destination from New York and Philadelphia. In both regions, the value per ton clearing

for Southern Europe was the highest of any destination, and by a fairly wide margin,

especially for Philadelphia, where the average value shipped to Southern Europe ($88.87)

was 42 percent higher than that for the West Indies, the second highest value-per-ton

destination. For exports to all destinations, the value per ton clearing Philadelphia was

approximately 13 percent higher than that for New York, a difference of about $8 per ton.

Shifts in the importance of New York and Philadelphia as ports of origin, and in the

destinations of the exports from each port, had bearing on the growth of the region’s

export trade.


we valued regional exports in 1840 prices, reported by Cole (1938). Because the relative prices
of different commodities affect their weight in the overall calculation, shifts in relative prices
could have an impact on the size of regional exports. In practice, however, relative commodity
prices in 1840 were highly correlated with those in the 1770s, so the choice of base year prices
has little impact on our estimates. See the Appendix, especially Table 3.
19
   The assumption that the ratio of cargo values to tonnage remained constant over the period
from 1720 through 1772, appears reasonable based on data for the years when tonnage and the
value of imports into Britain (in constant Sterling value) are both available. As shown in the
Appendix, those data indicate that, if anything, the value per ton fell slightly over time. If this
were true for other destinations then our assumption of constant value per ton imparts an upward
bias to our estimates of the growth of exports over the period 1720-1772.
                                                                                          10

          Changes in the relative importance of the various destinations were more

pronounced for New York’s trade than Philadelphia’s. In Table 2 we present the average

shares of tonnage clearing each of these ports by destinations for the sub-periods of time

for which we have benchmark data. For the most part, the relative importance of

destinations did not increase or decrease steadily or on a long term basis, but rather rose

and fell during various subperiods of time. Only the West Indies share of New York’s

trade declined throughout the period from 72 percent in the 1720s to 43 percent in 1768-

72. For Philadelphia, the share rose slightly between the 1720s and 1754, and then

declined. Despite these different patterns over time, trade with the West Indies

comprised approximately the same average share of each port’s exports for the entire

period 1720 to 1770. Another noticeable shift was the rise in the importance of Britain’s

share of New York’s trade, especially after mid-century, which meant an increase in

tonnage clearing that carried - on average - less valuable exports than ships clearing for

any other destination except Africa. The only other shift of any consequence was the

rise in the importance of Ireland’s share of the trade of both New York and Philadelphia.

For New York, this represented a rise in the importance of a destination for which the

average value per ton cleared was higher than that for the destination declining in relative

importance, namely the West Indies. For Philadelphia, the effect is less obvious since the

rise of Ireland’s share came at the expense of shipments to both Britain, where value per

ton was lower, and the West Indies, where it was higher. Moreover, for Philadelphia the

rise in Ireland’s importance took place in the 1720s and 1730s, relatively early in the

period.
                                                                                           11

       The net impact of the shifting importance of destinations for each port is shown in

Figures 1A and 1B. There we present a comparison of the behavior of the unweighted

tonnage data with our value-weighted series (the benchmark estimates of exports)

between 1726 and 1772. The differences between the series are not large, but in both

cases, the weighted value index rises more slowly than the unweighted tonnage series.

The differences in growth between the two indices are roughly the same for each of the

colonies. And, for both New York and Philadelphia, the slower growth of the weighted

series reflects the declining importance of the West Indian market, for which the value

per ton was higher than for other regions.

        The timing and pace of growth in the region’s exports reflects both the shifting

importance of the various destinations, as well as the changing importance of

Philadelphia vis-à-vis New York. In Figure 1C, we show the weighted and unweighted

series for New York and Philadelphia combined. Although we have fewer observations -

- because the number of years for which we have reported tonnage figures for both

colonial ports is fewer than the number of years for which we have tonnage figures for at

least one of them – the pattern is the same. The weighted series rises slightly more

slowly than the unweighted series. Between 1726-27 and 1768-72, the unweighted index

rose 350 percent, whereas the weighted tonnage index increased by only 340 percent.



Growth between Benchmark Dates

       Table 3 presents the rates of growth between the various benchmark dates, and

over longer periods of time. For the combined series, tonnage clearing rose faster than

the value of exports in three of the five intervals, and perhaps more importantly did so
                                                                                         12

over periods of time cumulating to 34.5 years while the export series outpaced tonnage

for only 10 years. Over the entire period, the two series grew at very similar rates, with

the tonnage series having increased slightly faster at 3.47 percent versus 3.43 percent per

year. Again, the ports had different experiences. For New York, the tonnage series had

the edge in the same time periods as in the combined series, but the differences were

larger in almost every period. For Philadelphia, the export series increased more rapidly

in three of the time periods, although the tonnage series increased more rapidly over the

longer periods of time, totaling 27 years versus 17.5 for the export series. Over the

entire period, 1726-27 to 1770-72, the tonnage series grew faster than the export series in

New York (2.66 percent vs. 2.46) whereas the rates of growth were nearly identical in the

case of Philadelphia.

       Whichever of the two series one considers, the growth of exports from

Philadelphia was quite rapid, whereas exports from New York did not fare so well.

Taken together, exports from these two colonies combined nevertheless grew at a notable

pace over the entire period 1726-1772, and in every sub-period that we are able to

distinguish with the existing evidence. Based on the benchmark estimates, growth of the

region’s exports over the long term averaged 3.44 percent per year. In only one time

period (1750-54 to 1765-67) did the rate fall below 3.0 percent, while in two sub-periods

it exceeded 4.0 percent, and in the brief period 1733-35 to 1739 it exceeded 5.0 percent.

       Of course, the region’s population was also growing rapidly--3.57 percent per

year for New York and Pennsylvania combined. As a consequence, the value of

commodity exports per capita for Pennsylvania and New York combined was unchanged

between the benchmark date of 1726-27 and in 1770-72 (see Table 4). Over this same
                                                                                                 13

period export values per capita fell for New York and increased slightly for Pennsylvania.

Despite the relative long-run stability, export values rose and fell by more than one dollar

per capita, between some of the benchmark dates.

         Although the differences in growth between the unweighted (tonnage) and

weighted (export value) series are not large, a comparison of the combined value of

exports with that for individual colonies shows how previous scholars have come to

different conclusions regarding the region’s trade. McCusker and Menard argued that the

export sector was doing well after 1720, recovering from an earlier slump, and

“…Philadelphia’s external commerce, however measured, nearly tripled in size between

1720 and 1740.” 20 McCusker and Menard did not make clear the basis for this

conclusion about the growth in Philadelphia’s trade, but apparently it was based on

tonnage clearing that port, which rose from 2,847 tons in 1720-22 to 8,107 in 1737-39. 21

Marc Egnal, on the other hand, offered a pessimistic assessment of the region’s economic

fortunes in the first half of the eighteenth century. “Lackluster sales of flour, bread, and

other exports [before 1745],” he argued, “slowed northern growth. At the heart of the

problem was the downturn in the British West Indies.” 22 The tonnage data, as just noted,

do not support this. 23 While tonnage clearing Philadelphia for the West Indies did not

keep pace with the buoyant trade described by McCusker and Menard, it nevertheless


20
     McCusker and Menard (1984, p. 204).
21
   The tripling is more obvious if one looks at the individual terminal year values which were
2,980 tons in 1720 and 9,050 in 1739.
22
   Egnal, 1998, pp. 47. Egnal did not report on the Middle Colonies separately, but rather on the
broader Northern region, which included New England.
23
   It seems his conclusion may be based on the behavior of flour exports per capita from
Pennsylvania. (Egnal, 1998, p.51, Figure 4.5). His conclusion implies that much of the increased
tonnage clearing Philadelphia was sailing empty.
                                                                                                 14

doubled between 1726-27 and 1737-39. 24 Moreover, tonnage clearing for Southern

Europe rose nearly six-fold, while tonnage clearing for Ireland rose from nothing to 1,450

tons, an increase which by itself increased total tonnage clearing Philadelphia by about 50

percent. On the other hand, if Egnal had also taken New York’s exports into account his

gloomy picture of trade would have been close to the truth. Tonnage clearing New York

rose by only 40 percent between 1726-27 and 1739. 25 Tonnage clearing from the two

ports combined rose by about 55 percent between 1726-27 and 1739, an increase more

like that described by Egnal than the booming trade depicted by McCusker and Menard.



Annual Series of Exports from the Middle Colonies

         We used these benchmark figures to construct an annual series of exports for the

region by interpolation. 26    To create this series we first interpolated the tonnage series

from each colony to each destination, except Great Britain, between benchmark dates and

then weighted those tonnage figures by the value per ton in the base years of 1768-72.

For exports to Great Britain we extrapolated the base year value of exports by changes in

the official values of imports into Great Britain from each colony, which are available in

every year. To obtain the regional total value of commodity exports in each year we

summed the values clearing for each destination from New York and Philadelphia, and

inflated this sum to account for exports from New Jersey and Delaware, on the

24
   For a slightly longer period, 1720-22 to 1737-39, using 3 year averages, tonnage cleared from
Philadelphia nearly tripled rising by 185 percent. Tonnage cleared in 1720 was higher than in
any of the three succeeding years, so from that single year to 1739 tonnage clearing for the West
Indies rose by only 57 percent.
25
     Between 1715 and 1739 tonnage clearing New York rose by only 20 percent.
26
   The resulting series is in Appendix Table 15 and the per capita figures derived from this series
are plotted in Figure 2.
                                                                                           15

assumption that the share of regional exports from these two colonies was constant and

equal to its value in the base years, which was approximately 3.5 percent.

       This series involves more construction than the benchmark series, and may not

capture all the ups and downs in international trade, but nevertheless it does provide a

rough gauge of the region’s fortunes over sub-periods of time that do not necessarily

coincide with the periodization established by the benchmark dates. Further, the annual

estimates allow us to extend the series back to 1720, thereby covering more of the

colonial period than was possible with the benchmark evidence. This series yields results

which, if nothing else, indicate how sensitive the estimated rates of growth are to changes

in the beginning date of coverage, and to the methods of estimation.

       This annual series shows lower average values of exports per capita and different

rates of growth than does the benchmark series over comparable time periods. The lower

average values simply reflect the inclusion of Delaware and New Jersey, each of which

exported far less than either New York or Pennsylvania. Their inclusion raises

population considerably but increases exports by less than five percent. Whereas the

benchmark series indicated no change in the value of exports per capita from New York

and Pennsylvania between 1726-27 and 1770-72 (See Table 4), the annual series shows a

slight rise of 0.04 percent per year over that same period. The reason for this is that

population in Delaware and New Jersey was growing more slowly than in New York and

Pennsylvania, while our method of estimation assumed that exports from Delaware and

New Jersey grew at the same rate as those from New York and Pennsylvania. 27 Thus the


27
   We added a constant percentage of exports to capture those for Delaware and New Jersey and
thus implicitly assumed that the growth rate of the exports for the region would not change.
                                                                                                16

inclusion of these two colonies slows down the rate of growth of the region’s population,

but not the growth of its exports.

          Moreover, the annual series yield higher rates of growth for Pennsylvania and the

region over the entire period--if the series begins in 1720 rather than 1726-27. For

Pennsylvania, the rate of growth was 0.70 beginning in 1720 versus only 0.13 beginning

in 1726-27. For the entire region, the rate of growth beginning in 1720 was 0.31,

whereas it was only 0.04 from 1726-27 forward. 28 New York’s performance on the other

hand appears worse; the rate of growth was -0.30 between 1726-27 and 1770-72 using

the benchmark series, but declined at -0.53 using the annual series that begins in 1720-22.

          As an example of the different sub-periods of time that can be examined with the

annual series, but not the benchmark series, consider the changes in the region’s trade

over the period 1720 to 1745, rather than 1726-27 to 1739 as dictated by the benchmark

dates. 29 The benchmark series indicated that exports from New York and Pennsylvania

rose by 4.32 percent per year between 1726-27 and 1739 and exports per capita rose at a

rate of 0.24 percent per year. The annual series shows that for the period 1720 to 1745

exports rose by 3.84 percent annually, and on a per capita basis the value increased at

only 0.13 percent per year.



Invisible Service Exports

          In addition to the visible trade in commodities, the American colonies also

produced a number of invisible service exports. These included earnings from goods

28
   These rates were all calculated from end points. A natural log regression estimate for the
region shows a rate of 0.22 percent per year.
29
     The period 1720 to 1745 is that identified by Egnal as one of relatively slow growth.
                                                                                               17

carried on colonial owned ships as well as charges for other commercial services such as

insurance and commissions. The estimates constructed by Shepherd and Walton (1969)

for 1768-1772 indicate that income from shipping and commercial services in foreign

trade from the Middle Colonies was worth nearly 44 percent of the value of the region’s

commodity exports. 30 These earnings may have been increasing over time, as suggested

by the traditional story about the rising importance of colonial merchants in trans-Atlantic

trade. One proxy for the growing role of colonial merchants is provided by data on the

share of tonnage owned by residents of the colonies. McCusker (1972) found that local

ownership increased relatively rapidly, but data in Crowther (1973), and Walton (1968)

suggest that the rate of growth of colonial ownership may have been slower than implied

by McCusker’s data.

        Because invisible exports were so substantial their value must be estimated

throughout the century in order to have a better gauge of the overall level of foreign

trade. The value of these services, which were largely earnings from shipping, was

closely linked to the value of the trade in commodities, so would rise and fall reflecting

the volume of exports. The other factor that would affect the value of these service

exports was change in the share of these earnings that accrued to the colonists in the

region, which to a large extent can be taken into account by changes in the ownership of

tonnage engaged in trade. As described in the Appendix, we used the evidence on the

relative importance of invisible exports for 1768-72, along with our new series on

commodity exports and an estimate of changes in ownership of registered tonnage, to

30
  Invisible earnings were highest in the trade with Great Britain and Ireland, where they reached
nearly 50 percent of the value of commodity exports, and lowest in the trade with Southern
Europe and the Wine Islands, where they amounted to 34 percent of the value of visible trade.
                                                                                             18

construct a time series on invisible exports. We assumed that the ratio of invisible to

visible exports to each destination was the same for both New York and Philadelphia and

equal to the regional value implied by Shepherd and Walton’s estimates for the end of the

colonial period (i.e. 1768-1772), and multiplied these ratios by our estimates of

commodity exports from these two colonies by destination to construct an unadjusted

series of invisible earnings in each year. We then adjusted these figures to reflect the

changes in ownership over time. We assumed that the proportion of this income earned

by residents of the Middle Colonies varied in proportion to the share of tonnage owned in

the region and that the ownership share increased at a rate of 0.4 percent per year

between 1720 and 1772. 31 We then summed these destination-specific estimates for New

York and Philadelphia, and inflated them, as we did for the value of visible exports, to

produce estimates for the region as a whole. Although the resulting series on invisible

earnings may not be as reliable as that for commodity exports, it nonetheless improves

the overall level of earnings the Middle Colonies received from the foreign trade sector,

and captures the growing role of colonial merchants in trans-Atlantic trade. Table 4

reveals our estimates of this broader measure of trade on a per capita basis, where it can

be compared to the figures for commodity trade, and Figure 2 shows the relationship

between exports and population by graphing the per capita values of commodity exports

and of the combined value of commodity and invisible service exports. This figure

reveals that per capita exports varied widely around a gradually increasing trend. Per

31
   See the appendix for a discussion of the evidence underlying the assumption about growth in
ownership. The 0.4 percent per year is the mid-point between no growth as implied by the data
for 1715-43 to 1763-65 presented by Shepherd and Walton (1969, Table 3) and the growth of
0.83 percent per year shown in McCusker’s data for 1726-29 to 1770-75 (1972, Table 3).
Estimates based on the work of Crowther (1973, Table 8) and Walton (1968, Tables 3 to 7) fall in
that range.
                                                                                              19

capita values of commodity exports in the first third of the period fluctuated between

about $4.50 and $5.50 and then rose to a colonial era peak around $6.00 in 1750 before

beginning a sustained decline that lasted until the conclusion of the Seven Years’ War.

From the mid-1760s through the early 1770s per capita export values recovered, rising to

nearly $6 per capita toward the end of the colonial period. Accounting for invisible

earnings raises the level of exports by about $2 per capita in any year, but does not

dramatically change the trend in the series or alter the pattern of year-to-year

fluctuations. 32

        Even with invisible earnings included, the export sector constituted a relatively

small component of the regional economy. We do not have regional per capita income

estimates for the Middle Colonies, but Mancall and Weiss (1999, p. 26) have estimated

that per capita incomes for all colonies was around $64 in 1700 and $68 in 1770 (both

years valued in 1840 prices), the latter figure being nearly identical to McCusker’s

estimate of $63 for 1774. 33 It is unlikely that the Middle Colonies deviated much from

this average performance, so regional commodity exports ran between 8 and 10 percent

of income. 34 With invisible exports included, the value of the region’s foreign trade

amounted to 11 to 14 percent of income.



Terms of Trade

32
    The trend based on regression estimates indicates that invisible earnings raise the growth of
per capita exports slightly as shown in Figure 2, whereas when calculated from end points growth
is reduced slightly as shown in Table 4.
33
    McCusker’s figure is reported in Susan Carter, et al, 2006, p. 5-671, Series Eg221.
34
   If we use McCusker’s estimate that real GDP per capita was only 46 dollars in 1720 (Susan
Carter, et al, 2006, p. 5-671, Series Eg221), than commodity exports amounted to between 10 and
14 percent of GDP per capita.
                                                                                                 20

        So far our discussion has concentrated on the real value of exports. By

abstracting from the effects of price changes we are able to identify changes in regional

productivity that are the source of rising living standards. But prices matter. Changes in

the terms of trade--shifts in the relative prices of exports to imports--are another avenue

through which regional trade may have affected regional economic activity.

        Over most of this period, British prices were quite stable, so changes in the terms

of trade came about largely from fluctuations in the prices of the Middle Colonies’

exports. Those prices fluctuated without any clear trend between 1720 and 1740 and then

began to rise at a fairly robust rate around 2.0 percent per year. Over the entire period

1720 to 1770 the terms of trade improved on average at an annual rate of 1.04 percent. 35

The impact of these movements on regional terms of trade is shown in Figure 3, where

we plot the ratio of a weighted index of prices of major regional exports to the

Schumpeter-Gilboy price index, which represents movements of prices in Great Britain,

the primary source of the region’s imports.

        The effect of these movements in relative prices was to exaggerate the decline in

export values between the benchmark dates 1726-27 and 1739, and then magnify the later

rise. Between 1726-27 and 1739 visible and invisible exports per capita fell at a rate of

0.48 per cent per year, while the terms of trade adjusted series fell at a rate of 2.6 percent

per year (see Table 4). Over the long term, however, the effect of changes in the terms of

trade was to enhance the growth in the purchasing power of the region’s exports. Over

the entire period from 1726-27 to 1772, exports per capita adjusted for the terms of trade
35
   The prices of the region’s exports fell from 1700 to 1720 and the terms of trade had
deteriorated at 3.3 percent per year prior to 1720. The rise after 1745 was so strong that the terms
of trade recovered all of the ground lost from 1700 to 1720 by the time of the American
Revolution.
                                                                                            21

increased at a rate of almost 1 percent per year, while real exports per capita remained

essentially constant.



Conclusions

       Colonial economic historians have given considerable weight to the role of

exports as a stimulus for economic growth. In part this reflects the pragmatic fact that

exports are one of the few areas of the colonial economy for which reasonably sound and

extensive quantitative data are available. Yet efforts to make use of these data have been

handicapped by the incompleteness of the evidence. Scholars have tended to focus on

the behavior of one or two key commodities, taking them as indicators of broader

changes without placing them in the context of the export sector as a whole or comparing

them to changes in the overall scale of the colonial economy.

       Evidence for the Middle Colonies presented here reveals that commodity exports

did grow quickly, and while this growth exceeded the pace of population growth, the

difference was very small. While the trend rate of increase of per capita exports valued

in constant prices was small the series fluctuated substantially, with the result that rates of

growth are extremely sensitive to the choice of time period considered. Between the

benchmark dates of 1726-27 and 1770-72 real commodity exports per capita increased at

a rate of only 0.04 per cent per year, but annual data suggest that between 1720-22 and

1770-72 the rate of growth was 0.31 per cent per year. Invisible exports were a large

component of colonial earnings, but the addition of this component does not dramatically

alter the picture of relatively slow per capita export growth. The lack of long-run growth
                                                                                          22

in the real value of exports suggests that there was little change in productivity between

the 1720s and 1770s.

       When changes in the terms of trade are taken into account, however, the growing

value of regional exports meant that a constant volume of exports per capita allowed the

region to purchase more imports. Thus, despite the lack of evidence of productivity

advance, it appears that living standards may have been rising. The value of exports per

capita adjusted for terms of trade rose at 1.6 percent per year between 1720 and 1770,

with most of that increase having taken place after 1740.

       Our estimates also reveal something about the short-run performance of the

regional economy. Even though our method of interpolation introduces an excessive

degree of stability into the annual export series, our estimates nonetheless reveal a

considerable degree of volatility, which suggests that that exports were not likely a

constant fraction of GDP. It also suggests that the fortunes of the colonists waxed and

waned, and an individual’s view of the period would be influenced by how these

fluctuations affected him or her.

       Compiling all of the available data in a consistent framework helps to resolve the

conflicting interpretations of the history of the Middle Colonies. Specifically, export

growth continued at roughly the same pace throughout the entire period from 1720 to

1772, although changes in the terms of trade gave a boost to the value of exports after

1740. The stability in the unadjusted export series, however, masks the different records

of slow-growing New York and rapidly increasing Philadelphia, which came to dominate

regional exports.
                                                                                            23

       Viewed from the perspective of the export staples model of growth that is at the

heart of most interpretations of colonial history these estimates suggest that the colonial

economy may have been growing at a pace that compared well to what the U.S.

experienced in the nineteenth century. In the simplest version of those models, where

exports remain a constant percentage of the economy, real GDP per capita would have

been rising at the rates at which exports were growing. Of course, other factors

influenced the growth of GDP, and, as we have seen, the value of exports per capita from

the Middle Colonies was a relatively small share of average incomes. In light of the large

share of domestic production in the region’s aggregate economic activity, it may be

premature to use the performance of the export sector to extrapolate trends in overall

performance. 36




36
   It may also be worthwhile to reexamine the idea that Malthusian forces rather than exports
were the most important determinants of long run economic success in the mainland colonies.
See Smith (1980) for further discussion of the merits of the Malthusian perspective. Even
McCusker and Menard (1984) who place much more emphasis on the staple export model,
acknowledge the relevance of Malthusian forces (chap.1). See also Edwin J. Perkins (1988, pp.
39-44)
