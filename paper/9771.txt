                                           ABSTRACT

Over the past three centuries there has been a rapid accumulation of physiological capital in OECD
countries. Enhanced physiological capital is tied to long-term reduction in environmental hazards
and to the conquest of chronic malnutrition. Data on heights and birth weights suggests that
physiological capital has become more equally distributed, thereby reducing socioeconomic

disparities in the burden of disease. Implications for health care policy are: (1) enhanced

physiological capital has done more to reduce inequities in health status than has wider access to
health care; (2) the main contribution of more advanced medical treatment so far has been to retard
depreciation in individuals’ physiological capital; (3) prenatal and early childhood care and
environmental issues are key for interventions aimed at enhancing physiological capital and at

affecting its rate of depreciation; (4) lifestyle change is the most important issue affecting health
equity in rich countries; and (5) greater access to clinical care should be promoted through
aggressive outreach, since expanded insurance coverage by itself is inadequate.

                        Secular Trends in Physiological Capital:
                         Implications for Equity in Health Care


       The Malthusian world was a terrible world for health in general, but it was especially bad

for the lower classes. Chronic malnutrition was so severe that the bottom 20 percent of the

English income distribution lacked the energy for regular work. From the Elizabethan Age to the

end of the nineteenth century, one-fifth of the potential English labor force lived out their brief

lives as paupers and beggars. These potential workers were excluded from the labor force not

because of an inadequate demand for labor, as was the case during the Great Depression of the

1930s, but because they lacked entitlements to food. The situation in France and the rest of

Western Europe was even worse than in England. Chronic malnutrition was the fate of the

majority of the population prior to the twentieth century.

       The problem was not only that most of the population of Western Europe lacked adequate

amounts of energy for work, but also that their food supply was typically too small to allow for

their proper physiological development. Energy available for work is a residual. It is the

difference between the food metabolized (chemically transformed so that its energy is available

for use by the body) and the energy that the body requires for baseline maintenance. Baseline

maintenance has two components. The larger component is the basal metabolic rate (or BMR),

which accounts for about four-fifths of baseline maintenance. BMR is the amount of energy

needed to maintain body temperature and to keep the heart and other vital organs functioning

when the body is completely at rest. The other 20 percent of baseline maintenance is the energy

needed to digest food and for vital hygiene. It does not include the energy needed to prepare a

meal or to clean the kitchen afterwards.




                                                                                                 2
       The amount of energy required for baseline maintenance depends on the size of an

individual. The typical American male today in his thirties is about 69.7 inches tall and weights

about 172 pounds. Such a male requires daily about 1,794 calories for basal metabolism and a

total of 2,279 calories for baseline maintenance. If either the British or the French had been that

large during the eighteenth century, virtually all of the energy produced by their food supplies

would have been required for maintenance, and hardly any would have been available to sustain

work. The relatively small food supplies available to produce the national products of these two

countries about 1700 suggests that typical adult male must have been quite short and very light.

       This inference is supported by data on stature and weight that have been collected for

European nations. Table 1 provides estimates of final heights of adult males who reached

maturity between 1750 and 1975. It shows that during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries

Europeans were severely stunted by modern standards (cf. line 6 of Table 1).



                             The Concept of Physiological Capital

       Individuals who are stunted and wasted are at much higher risk of the early development

of chronic disabilities and premature death. Over the past three centuries human beings in OECD

countries have increased their average body size by over 50 percent, their average longevity by

over 100 percent, and they have greatly improved the robustness and capacity of vital organ

systems. I shall refer to this enhanced physiological capacity as physiological capital.

       Physiological capital is a relatively new concept for economists. It differs from, but is

related to, the better known concepts of human capital and health capital. The human capital

concept was developed to explain differences in earnings by occupation, over the life-cycle, by




                                                                                                   3

                                                                                               4
industries, and by regions. It focuses especially on the contribution of education (including on-

the-job training) to an individual’s stock of human capital and to the rate of return on

investments in education. The health capital concept was developed to explain the demand for

goods and services that offset the depreciation in the initial endowment of health over the life-

cycle.

         Health capital presupposes physiological capital, but does not explicitly deal with it.

Health capital assumes the health stock that each individual is born with and considers how

investment in health care can reduce the rate of depreciation in that stock. It does not address

why some people have a greater initial stock than others. It does not recognize the relationship

between the size of the initial stock and its rate of depreciation. It does not take notice of the

effect of the date of birth on the size of the initial stock or on the rate of depreciation. In other

words, it does not confront the issue of how the average initial stock of physiological capital has

been changing from one generation to another.

         These are all issues that are central to the concept of physiological capital. Since the

beginning of the eighteenth century physiological capital has been accumulating very rapidly.

Much of this improvement is the result of a process that Dora Costa and I have called

technophysio evolution, a synergism between technological advances and physical

improvements that has produced a form of human evolution that is biological but not genetic,

rapid, culturally transmitted, and not necessarily stable. This process is still ongoing in both rich

and developing countries.

         The rapid accumulation of physiological capital is tied to long-term reduction in

environmental hazards and to the conquest of chronic malnutrition (made possible by

technophysio evolution) that is reflected in the improvements in stature and the Body Mass Index




                                                                                                   5
(BMI), which is a measure of weight standardized for height. Variations in height and weight are

associated with variations in the chemical composition of the tissues that make up vital organs, in

the quality of the electrical transmission across membranes, and in the functioning of the

endocrine system and other vital systems. Nutritional status, as reflected in height and weight,

thus appears to be a critical link connecting improvements in technology to improvements in

human physiology.

         Research on this connection is developing rapidly and the exact mechanisms by which

malnutrition and trauma in utero or early childhood are transformed into organ dysfunctions are

still unclear. What is agreed upon is that the basic structure of most organs is laid down early,

and it is reasonable to infer that poorly developed organs may break down earlier than well-

developed ones. The principal evidence so far is statistical and, despite agreement on certain

specific dysfunctions, there is no generally accepted theory of cellular aging (Tanner 1990,

1993).

         With these caveats in mind, recent research bearing on the connection between

malnutrition and body size and the later onset of chronic diseases can conveniently be divided

into three categories. The first category involves forms of malnutrition (including the ingestion

of toxic substances) that cause permanent, promptly visible physiological damage, as is seen in

the impairment of the nervous systems of fetuses due to excessive smoking or consumption of

alcohol by pregnant women. It appears that protein calorie malnutrition (PCM) in infancy and

early childhood can lead to a permanent impairment of central nervous system function. Folate

and iodine deficiency in utero and moderate-to-severe iron deficiency during infancy also appear

to cause permanent neurological damage (Scrimshaw and Gordon 1968; Chávez, Martínez, and

Soberanes 1995).




                                                                                                 6
       Not all damage due to retarded development in utero or infancy caused by malnutrition

shows up immediately. In a series of studies D. J. P. Barker and his colleagues (1998) have

reported that such conditions as coronary heart disease, hypertension, stroke, noninsulin

dependent diabetes, and autoimmune thyroiditis begin in utero or in infancy, but do not become

apparent until mid-adult or later ages. In these cases, individuals appear to be in good health, and

function well in the interim. However, early onset of the degenerative diseases of old age is

linked to inadequate cellular development early in life.

       Certain physiological dysfunctions incurred by persons suffering from malnutrition can,

in principle, be reversed by improved dietary intake, but they often persist because the cause of

the malnutrition persists. If the malnutrition persists long enough these conditions can become

irreversible or fatal. This category of consequences includes the degradation of tissue structure,

especially in such vital organs as the lungs, the heart, and the gastrointestinal tract. In the case of

the gastrointestinal system, atrophy of the mucosal cells and intestinal villi results in decreased

absorption of nutrients. Malnutrition also has been related to impairment of immune functions,

increased susceptibility to infections, poor wound healing, electrolyte imbalances, endocrine

imbalances, and in adults, dangerous cardiac arrhythmias and increased chronic rheumatoid

disorders (McMahon and Bistrian 1990).

       So far I have focused on the contribution of improved nutrition and technological change

to physiological improvement. The process has been synergistic, however, with improvement in

nutrition and physiology contributing significantly to the process of economic growth and

technological progress. For example, technophysio evolution appears to account for about half of

British economic growth over the past two centuries. Much of this gain was due to the




                                                                                                     7
improvement in human thermodynamic efficiency. The rate of converting human energy input

into work output appears to have increased by about 50 percent since 1790 (Fogel 1994).



              Equity Implications of the Accumulation of Physiological Capital

       The process of accumulating physiological capital has had an effect on health care by

reducing socioeconomic disparities in the burden of disease. I have italicized “reducing” because

so many recent epidemiological studies in OECD nations find strong relationships between SES

variables and health status. However, these relationships are what is left of a nexus that used to

be much stronger than it is today.

       The progress toward greater equity in health status between 1800 and the second half of

the twentieth century is illustrated by Figure 1. The lines on this graph are normal

approximations of the frequency distributions of birth weights. Birth weight is represented on the

vertical axis, and the horizontal axis represents z-scores (deviations of birth weight from the

mean measured in units of the standard deviations). Hence, the cumulative frequency distribution

is represented by a straight line. The lowest line represents the distribution of United States

nonwhites in 1950. They had a mean birth weight of 3218 grams and, as indicated by Figure 1,

about 13 percent of the neonates weighed less than 2501 grams at birth. The second line is the

distribution of birth weights for lower-class women in Bombay (Jayant 1964). Figure 1 indicates

the mean birth weight in this population was just 2525 grams. In this case nearly half (46

percent) of the births were below the critical level, although the women in the sample were not

the poorest of the poor.

       The third curve is the probable distribution of the birth weights of the children of

impoverished English workers about 1800. The distribution of the birth weights in this class




                                                                                                8

            and of Poor English Workers during the Early Nineteenth Century




                                                                                         9
around 1800 probably had a mean of 2276 grams, which is about 249 grams (about half a pound)

below the average in the deliveries of the lower-class women in Bombay. It follows that about 79

percent of the births among impoverished English workers around 1800 were at weights below

2501 grams.

       The implication of this distribution of birth weights is revealed by Table 2. Column 2

represents the actual schedule of neonatal death rates by weight for nonwhite United States males

in 1950, and column 3 gives the actual distribution of their birth weights. The product of these

two columns yields an implied neonatal death rate of 26.8 per 1,000, which, of course, was also

the actual death rate. If, however, this United States population had had the distribution of the

birth weights of the impoverished English workers of 1800, their neonatal death rates would

have been 173.0 per thousand (see col. 3). The implication of Table 2 is that improvements in

nutrition sufficient to have shifted the mean birth weight from 2276 grams to 3128 grams would

have reduced the infant death rate by 83 percent.

       Figure 1 reflects an important intergenerational influence on heath before the era of

cesarean sections and of neonatal intensive care units. Malnourished mothers produced small

children not only because of deficiencies in their diet and exposure to disease during pregnancy,

but also because their short stature was associated with small pelvic cavities. As a result, the

birth weight that minimized perinatal deaths was about 700 grams below that of the U. S. women

referred to in Figure 1. In other words, a condition for surviving the birth process was such a low

birth weight that the neonate was at very high risk of dying shortly after birth. The escape from

that dilemma is now almost universal in OECD nations. Poor women accumulated physiological

capital at an intergenerational rate that was rapid enough to shift the birth weight of their children

to a range that is about 1.7 times what it was two centuries ago. This means that less than 8

percent of all births in OECD nations are now below 2501 grams. (Martin et al. 2002; Graafmans

et al. 2002; Wilcox et al. 1995).

       Further evidence of the secular trend toward the more equal distribution of physiological

capital over the past two centuries comes from the changes in adult heights among the British.

Data collected on the stature of the British upper classes when combined with data on the lower

classes make it possible to estimate how much of the improvement in the average stature in Great

Britain between 1820 and 1978 was due to a closing of the gap between the upper and lower

classes and how much was due to an upward shift in attainable average height. By “attainable” I

mean not genetically attainable but, within genetic constraints, attainable under the most

favorable prevailing socioeconomic circumstances. It appears that about three-quarters of the

increase in the mean final heights of British males since about 1820 was due to the decrease in

class differentials in height and the balance to an upward shift in the mean final heights of the

upper class (which may be taken as a measure of the attainable mean height at any point in time)

(Floud, Wachter, and Gregory 1990). In this connection it is worth noting that Sweden and

Norway, which have relatively low after-tax Gini ratios, also have low height differentials by

socioeconomomic class. The means of adult height in these nations now exceed those of nations

with relatively high Gini ratios, such as the United States and Great Britain, by several

centimeters (Kuh, Power and Rogers 1991; Cavelaars et al. 2000; Fredriks et al. 2000; World

Bank 2002).

       What can be said about the factors responsible for the rapid increase in the national

stocks of physiological capital in OECD countries and for its more equal distribution? The

central scientific issue is, how much of the improvement in physiological capacity is due to




                                                                                              12
improvements in the environment, especially between the 1880s and the end of World War II?

And how much is due to advances in medical technology and the development of effective

systems for delivering health services? These two aspects of the accumulation of physiological

capital are not neatly separated, since physicians and biochemists played a large role in

environmental improvements. Moreover, some important steps in the improvements of the

environment, such as the draining of swamps, were byproducts of the growth of agriculture,

while others awaited the development of new technologies for waste disposal in the urban sector.

       Measurement of the relative importance of these and other factors, such as improvements

in the diversity and year-round supply of food, to the accelerated accumulation of human capital

is still elusive, partly because of the complex interactions that are involved, but mainly because

of the absence of a database containing information on the relevant explanatory variables.

However, the Center for Population Economics at the University of Chicago has launched a

major project to create such a database for the United States. The aim is to provide information

by small geographical units (wards or census tracts) in the 24 largest U.S. cities in 1900 and in

subsequent years, down to the end of the twentieth century.

       Although much was done to eliminate environmental barriers to the enhancement of

physiological capital during the course of the twentieth century, the process of improvement is

not yet complete, since environmental factors still contribute to low birth weight. As a result,

deficiencies in physiological capital continue to influence health status and rates of the

deterioration in health over the life cycle. Studies of a British cohort born in 1958 reveal that low

birth weight children were not only stunted at maturity (by about 2 inches compared to children

of optimal birth weight) (Teronishi, Nakagawa, and Marmot 2001), but they were also

disadvantaged in their cognitive development, as reflected in school performance, which was




                                                                                                  13
aggravated by the social class of their parents at the time of birth (Jefferis, Power, and Hertzman

2002). Some of the problems persisted even after the emergence of neonatal intensive care units

in the 1970s (Hack et al. 2002). Low birth weight children also have elevated risks of behavioral

problems, psychiatric disorders, linguistic defects, and motor disabilities (Elgen, Sommerfelt,

and Markestad 2002; Yliherva et al. 2001). Although recent advances in neonatal technology

appear to be improving long-term outcomes (McCormick and Richardson 2002), they have not

eliminated the need to confront continuing environmental hazards.



       Implications of Enhanced Physiological Capital for Egalitarian Health Policies

       Recognition of the substantial role of the secular enhancement in physiological capital

has a number of implications for those concerned with designing policies to reduce inequities in

health status by socioeconomic class. Since research bearing on secular trends in health status

and the factors responsible for the decline in disabilities over the course of twentieth century is

still at an early stage, I will summarize my current views as a set of theses.

       Thesis 1: The more egalitarian health status that exists today is due primarily to

environmental improvements that enhanced the physiological capital of successive cohorts rather

than to greater access to health care services. Support for this proposition is to be found in a

series of recent studies that have linked events early in life, including the intrauterine period, to

the onset of chronic conditions at middle and late ages. The strongest evidence for such links

pertain to hypertension and coronary heart disease (Cresswell et al. 1997; Barker 1998;

Scrimshaw 1997). A review of 32 papers dealing with the relationship between birth weight and

hypertension (Law and Sheill 1996) showed a tendency for blood pressure in middle ages to

increase as birth weight declines. Evidence of a connection between birth size and later coronary




                                                                                                  14
heart disease has been found in England, Wales, Sweden, India, and Finland (Frankel et al. 1996;

Koupilová, Leon, and Vågerö 1997; Forsén et al. 1997; Stein et al. 1996).

       The theory of a nexus between environmental insults in utero or at early postnatal ages,

and the risk of chronic health conditions half a century or more later, calls attention to the rapid

improvement in the environment between 1890 and 1940 to which I have already alluded. This

period also witnessed improvements in the diversity of the food supply throughout the year and

the beginnings of dietary supplements that improved year-round consumption of vitamins and

other trace elements. Two recent studies have shown strong correlations in month of birth and

the longevity of middle-aged men in Austria, Denmark, Australia, and the United States that

reflected differences in the availability of food to pregnant mothers over the seasons

(Doblhammer and Vaupel 2001; Kanjanapipatkul 2002). These developments largely preceded

the revolution in health care services that followed World War II.

       Further evidence that a substantial part of the improvement in health status during the

twentieth century was not due to direct medical care is provided by Table 3. It shows that the

proportion of white males who were still free of chronic conditions during ages 50-69 was

substantially higher in the mid-1990s than a century earlier. This improvement was not due

primarily to the curative interventions of health care providers with persons already afflicted

with chronic diseases, because we are looking only at the subset of people who were not yet

afflicted by chronic diseases. Table 4 shows that for those who did develop four common chronic

diseases, the average age of onset was between 7 and 11 years later for men who reached age 65

in the 1980s or later than for those who reached age 65 in 1910 or earlier (cf. Costa 2000).

       Thesis 2: Although the more extensive and more effective medical interventions of the

last third of the twentieth century have contributed to the enhancement of the physiological




                                                                                                 15
capital of successive birth cohorts, their main contribution has been to slow down the rate of

depreciation in the stock of the enhanced physiological capital that the members of these cohorts

accumulated during developmental ages. This distinction between the increasingly enhanced

physiological capital of successive cohorts and health care interventions that retard the rate of

depreciation in the initial stocks of physiological capital in a specific set of cohorts is what is

overlooked in the conventional theory of health capital.

       The underestimation of the extent of the increase in physiological capital may explain the

tendency of some economists to slight the role of improving environmental factors and to

attribute all of the decline in morbidity and mortality during recent decades to improved medical

technology.

       Moreover, while it may be true that most of the effort of health care providers is directed

at reducing the rate of deterioration in health, there are also significant contributions of

physicians to enhancing physiological capital. These include encouraging appropriate behavior

by pregnant women, administering nutritional supplements, correcting birth defects, and treating

a variety of diseases that interfere with normal growth patterns during developmental ages.

       Thesis 3. The evidence currently in hand points to the importance of prenatal care and

environmental issues in both the enhancement of physiological capital and in affecting the rate of

depreciation in that capital. Used in this context the word “environment” has a dual meaning.

The uterus is a crucial environment for the developing embryo and fetus. And the quality of the

external environment has an effect on the environmental quality of the uterus. Pregnant women

exposed to high levels of pathogens and suffering, for example, from frequent bouts of diarrhea,

will have intrauterine environments that retard the development of the children they are bearing.

Studies in underdeveloped countries have revealed that the neonates of women who suffered

from diarrhea were lighter, and at higher risk of perinatal mortality, than mothers who escaped

the diseases during their pregnancies (Mata 1978; Martorell and Habicht 1986).

       Neonatal care and early postnatal care present opportunities for physicians to affect the

enhancement of the physiological capital. Providing nutritionally stressed pregnant women with

such supplements as folate and iodine will not only reduce the rate of spontaneous abortions but

will also reduce the risk of permanent damage to the central nervous system. Counseling

pregnant women to avoid smoking and alcohol consumption during pregnancy can reduce a

major cause of low birth weight and of perinatal mortality. Effective measures to promote breast-

feeding can substantially reduce morbidity and death rates among infants who are bottle-fed

(Forste, Weiss, and Lippincott 2001).

       Thesis 4. From the standpoint of health equity the most important issue today in rich

nations is not the cleaning up of the environment, as it was a century ago, but the reformation of

lifestyle. Practices which undermine the accumulation of physiological capital (such as bottle-

feeding instead of breast feeding infants) or which accelerate the depreciation of physiological

capital (such as recreational drugs, smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and overeating) are

more frequently practiced among the poor and the poorly educated than among the rich and the

well-educated sectors of the population.

       As with the public health reforms a century ago, the campaign to change lifestyle in ways

that promote the accumulation of physiological capital and retard its depreciation must be a joint

venture between government authorities (especially at local levels), the private sector (including

commercial and voluntary organizations), and health providers. The local level is the key arena

for government operations, not only because conditions and issues vary from one locality to




                                                                                               19
another, but also because education in the school system is a key site in the campaign to change

lifestyles.

         The joint-venture tactic also applies to cooperation between churches and secular

authorities because of the vast pool of potential volunteers for mentoring those suffering from

detrimental lifestyles. And the tactic applies to the government and commercial sectors because

businesses, including the media, are needed both to propagate healthy lifestyles and to enforce

them in the work place.

         Health care providers are needed not only because of their expertise in helping to

formulate public policies, but also because teaching their patients about lifestyle issues is one of

their central missions. Doctors play a crucial role in helping patients to implement changes in

lifestyle that are promoted in the media and taught in the schools. Moreover, specific treatments

are required for those deeply addicted to drugs, excessive eating (or excessive dieting), and other

detrimental lifestyles.

         Thesis 5. Greater access to clinical care is a high priority in promoting greater health

equity, but implementing this goal requires new approaches. It is not enough to wait for poor and

poorly educated individuals to seek out available services. Outreach programs need to be

developed to identify programs for the needy, making use of a variety of community

organizations already engaged in outreach activities for other purposes. In this connection local

officials should consider the reintroduction into public schools, particularly those in poor

neighborhoods, of periodic health-screening programs, using nurses and physicians on a contract

basis.

         To some extent the focus on the extension of health insurance to the 15 percent of the

population not currently covered is a diversion from the effective delivery of health care services




                                                                                                 20
to the poor. Severe problems of underserving the poor exist in rich nations with universal

national health programs; what is needed is aggressive outreach, including the establishment of

public-health clinics in underserved poor neighborhoods that can supplement the emergency

rooms of regular hospitals, which are a frequent source of routine health-care services for the

poor. Convenient access is a key issue, because even individuals with insurance, such as those on

Medicaid, may fail to take advantage of available facilities if they are inconvenient. Basements

of churches and space in public schools after normal teaching hours can be good locations for

community clinics, both because they help to stretch available funds and because they provide

familiar settings.



                                      Concluding Comment

        Physiological capital is still a new concept. It is only recently that data sets needed to

measure changes in this form of capital have become accessible. The loci of changes in both time

and space are just now being assayed. Much remains to be learned about how large the effect of

the changes in the physiological capital of pregnant women was in contributing to the decline in

infant mortality rates, but the analysis in Figure 1 and Table 2 suggests it was quite large.

        The work undertaken to date suggests that environmental changes, particularly the

synergy between technological and physiological improvements, explains not only a large part of

the increase in life expectancy at age 50, but as Tables 3 and 4 indicate, a large part of the

twentieth century delay in the average age of incurring particular chronic conditions and in the

increased age-specific odds of being free of all chronic conditions after age 50. As the

physiological basis for these changes is identified, forecasts of trends in health care costs will

become more reliable.
