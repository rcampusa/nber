                      The Demand for International
                   Reserves and Monetary Equilibrium:
                Some Evidence From Developing Countries

                                  ABSTRACT


      Traditionally, two alternative explanations have been offered for the

behavior of international reserves through time. On the one hand, the

literature on the demand for international reserves postulates that reserves

movements respond to discrepancies between desIred and actual reserves. On

the other hand, according to the monetary approach to the balance of payments,

changes in international reserves will be related to excess demands or excess

supplies for money. The purpose of this paper is to empirically integrate

these two basic explanations for International reserves movements. This is

done by estimating a dynamic equation that explicitly allows reserves

movements to reflect the monetary authority's excess demand for international

reserves, and the public's excess demand for money. The results obtained,

using a sample of 23 developing countries that maintained a fixed exchange

rate during period 1965—1972, confirm the hypothesis that reserves movements

respond both to monetary factors and to differences between actual and desired

reserves. These results indicate that the exclusion of monetary

considerations from the dynamic analysis of international reserves will yield

biased coefficients.

 1. Introduction

        Traditionally, two alternative explanations have   been offered for the
behavior of international reserves through time. On one hand, the literature

on the demand for international reserves has postulated that reserves move-

ments basically respond to discrepancies between desired reserves and the

amount of reserves actually held by a particular country. (See, for example,

Clark 1970a,b; lyoha 1976; Heller and Khan 1978; Bilson and Frenkel 1979a,b;

Edwards 1980, 1983).1 However, an alternative explanation is offered by the

simple version of the monetary approach to the balance of payments. According

to this view, changes in international reserves will be related to excess

demands or excess supplies of money: international reserves will increase if

there is an excess demand for money (with domestic credit given), and will

decrease if there is an excess supply for money. In that sense, according to

the monetary approach, international reserves are a residual (see, for

example, the essays collected in Frenkel and Johnson, 1976).2 This apparent

contradiction between the demand for reserves theory and the monetary approach

can be solved once it is recognized that, as long as there is a stable demand

for international reserves, domestic credit cannot be exogenous. In this

case, changes in domestic credit will partially depend on the relationship

between actual and desired reserves. In a fixed exchange—rate system, with

other   things given, if actual reserves are below their desired level, there

will be a tendency to reduce domestic credit in order to increase actual

holdings of international reserves.

      The   purpose of this paper is   to empirically integrate these two basic

explanations   for international reserves movements. This is done by estimating
a   dynamic equation for the demand for reserves that incorporates monetary

disequilibrium   considerations.3 The analysis explicitly allows reserves
                                        2




movements to reflect the nonetary authorities excess demand for International

reserves, and the public's excess demand for money. The study uses annual

data from 23 developing countries that maintained a fixed exchange rate

between 1965 and l972. The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that

international reserves movements, during this period, responded both to

monetary factors and to differences between actual and desired reserves.

These results indicate that the exclusion of monetary considerations from the

dynamic analysis of international reserves will yield biased coefficients.



2. Dynamic Adjustment and the Demand for Reserves

      Most studies that have investigated the dynamic behavior of international

reserves have assumed that the following partial adjustment equation can be

written (Bilson and Frenkel, 1979a,b; Clark 1970b; Edwards, 1980, 1983):



                    Llog R = e[log R — log   Ri]                              (1)




where Rt refers to international reserves actually held at period t, and

      are desired reserves. It has also been assumed that the long run demand

for reserves function depends positively on a scale variable (i.e., GNP —

y);    positively on a variable that measures the degree of openness of the

economy (i.e., the average propensity to import ——   API); and positively on a
variable that measures the variability of international payments (i.e., the

coefficient of variation of detrended reserves ——    a).5   The long run demand

for reserves function can be then written as (Bilson and Frenkel 1979b):



            log R* = a   + a1 log   + a2 log APIt + a3 log at + u             (2)
                                         3



       Clearly, however, this formulation is incomplete to the extent that it

  ignores the possible effects of monetary disequilibrjuiji on the behavior of

 international reserves. If, for example, as the monetary approach postulates,

 an excess supply of money is partially reflected in a reduction of reserves

 actually held, equation (1) will be unsatisfactory. The effect of monetary

 disequilibria on reserves movements can be captured by rewriting the partial

 adjustment equation in the following form:6



              =
      Llog        a[log R — log Ri] + [log M — log                            (3)
                                                       Mt_il



      This equation indicates that, movements of (the log of) international

 reserves will respond to two factors: (1) differences between desired and

 actual reserves, (a[log R —   log Re_i]); and (2) disequilibria in the
money market ([log N — log               The coefficient a measures the speed

at which discrepancies between actual and desired reserves will be corrected.

On the other hand,      measures what proportion of an unitary monetary

disequilibrium will be translated, in the first period, into an accumulation

or disaccumulation of international reserves. The presence of 8[log M —

log Mt_il in equation (3) distinguishes the approach taken in this paper from
the dynamic equations used in previous work (Clark l970b, lyoha 1976, Hipple

1979, Shinkal 1979, Bilson and Frenkel l979a,b; Edwards 1980).

     The estimation of (3), however, presents some problems. First, it is

Important to decide if this equation should be estimated in real or nominal

terms. In this paper I present results obtained when all relevant variables

(i.e., M, R and y) are expressed in real terms. The reason for this is

that according to the theory of the demand for reserves, these are held either

to finance real transactions or t face real unexpected shocks. In that
                                          4




sense, the demand for   reserves   is a demand in real terms. On this see Machiup

(1966), Saidi (1981), von Furstenberg (1982), Edwards (1983) and Frenkel

(l983). The second problem is related to the estimation method. In this

paper I have used a two steps procedure. In the first step a demand for money

equation is estimated for these countries using a least squares with dummy

variables procedure (LSDV) on pooled cross—sectio.n and time series data for

1965—1972. In the second step the fitted values from this demand for money

equation [log M] are used as a proxy for [log M] in (3). The reason for

using an LSDV procedure is that, as has been pointed out by Balestra and

Nerlove (1966), Nerlove (1971), Maddala (1971) and Anderson and Hsiao (1981),

the use of pooled data on dynamic equations present a number of problems. En

particular, to the extent that it is assumed that the error term includes a

country specific element, OLS will yield biased results. A straightforward

way to avoid this problem is to assume, as we have done in this paper, that

these country specific terms can be captured by country specific dummy

variables. However, when more complicated methods —        like   Nerlove's (1971)

two steps procedure — are used, the results are not affected in any

significant way. For alternative methods of estimating the dynamic behavior

of reserves using pooled data see Bilson and Frenkel (1979b), Edwards (1983),

and Frenkel (1983). Then, in the second step the equation to estimate is

(from (3) and (2)):



log   R=   aa   +     log       + a2 log nt + O3 log nt + (1—a) log R_i
                + [log      —
                       M*       log M1] + w                           (4)




      It is assumed that the long run   demand for money   function has the

following form:
                                             5




                          log M*t = b                —
                                        + b1 log         b2Tt +

where    M*t is real money demanded in country n in period t,                 y is real
income, and lit is the actual inflation in country n during period t,

and is used as a proxy for expected inflation.8



3. Einirical Results

        In order to estimate the first stage, it is assumed that the dynamic

behavior of the real quantity of money can be expressed by the following

partial adjustment equation:



                    log Mt = log M1 + X [log M*t — log        M1] +                 (6)




     Combining (5) and (6) a standard short run demand for money function is

obtained. The estimation of this function using LSDV on pooled data yielded

the following result, where the number in parentheses are t—statistics, and

the estimated country dummy variables are presented in Table 1. (See the

Appendix for an exact definition of the variables.)

                         + 0.207 log nt                                             (7)
                                                                  tn—l

                                                               R2 =   0.994


     In (7) all the coefficients of the short—run demand for money equation

have the expected signs. From these results and the country—specific

constants reported in Table 1, the long run coefficients were derived, and the

estimated value of log M were computed. These values were then used in the

estimation of the demand for reselves—cum—monetary disequilibrium equation

estimation of (4), where the estimated country dummy variables are presented

in Table 1.

                                   nt                     n
                       (9.873)                (1.816)

                                                                  R2 =    0.984


     The results reported in equation (8) are interesting in various

respects. First, all the coefficients have the expected signs. Second, the

coefficients of log y1 and log               are highly significant, while the

coefficient of [log M* — log M_i] is significant at the 10% level. The

nonsignificance of the coefficients of the variability measure (a) and

openness variable (API) is consistent with previous results presented by

Frenkel (1978, 1980) for the demand for reserves for developing countries

between 1963 and 1978. The estimated partial adjustment coefficient (a) is

equal to 0.264, indicating that, with other things given, approximately one

quarter of a unitary disequilibrium between desired and actual reserves will

be solved in one year, This coefficient is lower than those previously

obtained in studies that did not include monetary considerations (Bilson and

Frenkel 1979, Edwards 1983), and indicates that on average once these

countries get off their long—run demand curves for reserves, it will take some

time before equilibrium is restored, However, this coefficient is much closer

to that recently obtained by Frenkel (1983) in his analysis of the dynamic

behavior of reserves in developed countries for 1963—1972, that includes

monetary considerations.

     The estimated efficient of [log M* — log M1] is significant at

the 10% level, suggesting that in these countries mpney market disequllibria

have had an important role in determining the movement of reserves through

time. Specifically, this result indicates that, on average (with other things

given), a 1% excess supply of money will result in a 0.3% reduction in the

level of reserves held by a particular country. Also, according to this

result, the coefficients of the long—run demand for reserves, obtained in

dynamic analyses on the demand for reserves that ignore monetary considera-

tions will be biased.

     From the results presented in equation (8) it is possible to obtain the

estimated long—run coefficients of the demand for reserves. These coeffic-

ients are: a1 = 3.011,   a2 = 0.231   and a3   0.098. According to these

estimates, the demand for international reserves by LDC's face strong

diseconomies of scale. Even though previous work on the subject had also

found diseconomies of scale (Edwards 1983), the estimated coefficient for

a1 obtained in this case [equation (8)] is higher than those previously

reported. A possible explanation for this difference in the results is that

the present study Includes monetary considerations, while these were ignored

by previous work.



4. Concluding Remarks

     This paper has empirically analyzed the dynamic behavior of international

reserves, integrating the demand for reserves theory and the monetary approach

to the balance of payments. The results obtained using data for 23 fixed

exchange—rate developing countries for period 1965—1972, show that reserves

movement respond both to discrepancies between desired and actual reserves and

to monetary disequilibrium situations. This indicates that dynamic analyses
                                        9




of the demand for reserves that have excluded monetary considerations have

yielded biased coefficients.

     The results obtained show that on average, for this sample, an excess

demand for money equal to one percent will result in an accumulation of

reserves of 0.27 percent. Also, the long—run demand for reserves for LDC's

exhibits diseconomies of scale (Edwards 1983). Finally, this analysis

suggests that while the country's scale is important for determining the

amount of desired reserves, the degree of openness and payments variability

play a secondary role.

     The results obtained in this paper suggest that, to the extent that there

is a well—defined demand for international reserves, domestic credit cannot be

considered to be completely exogenous. In fact, these results can be viewed

as partial evidence that at least for these countries during this period,

changes in domestic credit partially responded to the existence of discrepanc-

ies between international reserves actually held and desired reserves (see

footnote 2). Since the evidence available shows that during the more recent

period (i.e., post—Bretton Woods period), different countries also have a

stable demand for international reserves (Frenkel, 1978, 1980), these conclus-

ions can be extended for the present conditions. It should be noted, however,

that an empirical analysis of the more recent period should explicitly

incorporate the effect of exchange rate movements on the behavior of reserves

through time. In that sense, a model similar to that presented by Girton and

Roper (1977) for the Canadian case could be integrated with the demand for

     'There are two traditions in the laterature on the demand for

international reserves. One      tradition   is purely empirical (i.e., Frenkel

1974, 1978; lyoha 1976; Heller and Khan 1978; Edwards 1980, 1983); while the

second uses estimating equations derived from general equilibrium cost—benefit

models (i.e., Kelly 1970; Hipple 1974; Frenkel and Jovanovic 1980). The

present paper is an extension to the empirical side of this literature.

     2While most work on the demand for reserves has ignored money market

conditions, some of the work on the monetary approach recognizes the

possibility of a simultaneous determination of the reserves flow equation and

the domestic credit creation equation. See Cenberg (1976).

     3The need of finding a compatibilization between the demand for

international reserves theory and the monetary approach to the balance of

payments has been put forward by Frenkel (1978). Lau (1980) recently

attempted this. Also, von Furstenherg (1982) introduces monetary variables in

his new estimates of the demand for reserves. For recent attempts to combine

the demand for international reserves with monetary equilibrium considerations

see Frenkel (1983) and Levi (1983). On the relationship between "reserves

targets" and "domestic credit targets of monetary policy see Harberger and

Edwards (1982).

     4Both the countries and the time period considered responded to the need

of fixed rate economies, for the empirical analysis.

     5For reviews of the literature on the demand for reserves see Clower and

Lipsey (1968), Grubel (1971), Williamson (1973) and Bird (1978). Notice that

some authors —    Hailer   (1968), Kelly (1970), lyoha (1976) — have postulated a

negative coefficient for the average propensity to import. Also, the proxy

used for the variability measure has differed across studies. See, for
                                          11




example, Kenen and Yudin   (1965),   Clark (1970b), Frenkel (1974), Heller and

Khan (1978), Saidi (1981) and Edwards (1983). Also in some studies the

opportunity cost of holding reserves has been included. However, almost

always its coefficient has been insignificant (see Williamson (1973) and

Frenkej. and Jovanovic (1981)).

     6This equation can be derived from the monetary system's balance sheet

identity and the following assumptions: (a) the money market clears

slowly; (b) domestic credit (D) behavior can be summarized by the

following reaction function Alog D =      y[log Rtl — log R} + w; and
(c) the multiplier is constant. A detailed presentation of the model

underlying equation (3) Is available from the author upon request.

         is interesting to note that, despite these considerations, a number

of papers have specified the demand for international reserves function in

nominal terms. See, for example, Frenkel (1974, 1978). Recently, however,

most authors have specified their analysis in real terms.

     8Theoretically we would want to have the interest rate instead of r in

equation (4). However, there is no interest rate data easily available for

these countries.

A. Data Sources

International Reserves: Taken from the International Financial Statistics

    (IFS) tape.
Income: Measured as GNP       in    domestic currency units, converted into U.S. $

    using the average exchange rate. Raw data taken from the IFS tape.
Average Propensity to Import: Defined as the ratio of imports to GNP.
Variability Measure (c,):        To calculate          for year T for country   ri, the

    following regression was first run for that country:

                    Rt =   a + a,,t + e over t = T—14,...,T,

    then using the estimated value of aT,                was defined as:

                             T
                              E (R_Rl_aT)/l4
                           t=T—14

    The variability measure —              —— was   then defined as: T =
   where      IN are imports. For further details, see Bilson and Frenkel
    (1979).
Money: Ml as reported in IFS, converted into U.S. $ using average exchange
    rate.
Inflation: Computed as rate of change of CPI. The Price Indexes were taken
    from the IFS.
