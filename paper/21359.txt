                                         ABSTRACT

We explore the educational response to fracking, a recent technological breakthrough in the oil
and gas industry, taking advantage of the timing of its diffusion and spatial variation in shale
reserves. We show that fracking has significantly increased relative demand for less-educated
male labor and high school dropout rates of male teens, both overall and relative to females. Our
estimates imply that, absent fracking, the teen male dropout rate would have been 1 percentage
point lower over 2011-15 in the average labor market with shale reserves, implying an elasticity
of school enrollment with respect to earnings below historical estimates. Fracking increased
earnings more among young men than teenage boys, suggesting that educational decisions
respond to improved earnings prospects, not just opportunity costs. Other explanations for our
findings, like changes in school quality, migration, or demographics, receive less empirical
support.

I.      Introduction

        Technological change, much of it complementary to skilled labor, has defined the U.S.

economy for more than a century. Its effects have not been confined to labor markets. By

increasing the return to education, skill-biased technological change (SBTC) spurred stunning

growth in educational attainment through cohorts born in the mid-20th century (Goldin and Katz,

2008). In more recent generations, however, increases in the relative demand for skill have

consistently outstripped increases in its relative supply, suggesting that the elasticity of

educational attainment with respect to the skill premium may now be low and contributing to

rising wage inequality (Katz and Murphy, 1992; Goldin and Katz, 2008). Yet, producing credible

micro-level evidence on how SBTC affects educational investment decisions is difficult given

the typically widespread nature of technological change.

        This paper estimates the educational response to a recent technological breakthrough in a

specific industry – oil and gas extraction. By pumping large quantities of fluids at high pressure

down a wellbore into horizontal wells in a target rock formation, hydraulic fracturing – or

“fracking” – has made it possible to extract oil and natural gas from shale plays unreachable

through conventional technologies (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 2013). Recent

research suggests that the local employment impacts of fracking have been sizable and extend

beyond oil and gas extraction, expanding industries like mining, transportation, and construction

that disproportionately employ less-educated men (Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote, 2017).1

Additionally, labor markets that have tightened due to fracking have seen employers in other

sectors cut education and experience requirements to fill positions (Modestino, Shoag, and

Balance, 2017). There is also direct evidence that labor demand shocks from fracking have

favored men without a college degree (Bartik, 2018; Kearney and Wilson, 2018). We go further,

documenting that fracking has improved the labor market prospects of male high school dropouts

by more than any other group. Fracking thus provides a case study in “less” skill-biased

technological change, with implications for education that are the reverse of the standard SBTC

story: if responsive to the skill premium, educational investments should have fallen due to

fracking.

         We explore the evolution of educational outcomes across areas with different shale oil

and gas endowments as fracking has spread.2 Because of the identification challenges posed by

the migratory response to fracking, we focus on high school enrollment and dropout decisions of

teenagers, measured in both survey and administrative data (the Census/American Community

Survey (ACS) and the Common Core of Data (CCD), respectively). Our empirical approach is to

compare local labor markets – commuting zones (CZs) – with different shale oil and gas reserves

over time.3 We focus on 14 states with major shale plays,4 and our preferred models are

demanding, removing bias from time-varying shocks to enrollment that vary across states and

across CZs with different pre-fracking observables. Like Bartik et al. (forthcoming), our models

also allow fracking’s impacts to phase-in gradually. We assume that they begin to unfold across




2
  Our approach is methodologically similar to that of Michaels (2011), which estimates the long-term consequences
of oil abundance in the U.S. South, including impacts on educational attainment in the resident adult population.
3
  CZs are collections of contiguous counties (possibly crossing state boundaries) that were strongly linked on the
basis of commuting patterns in the 1990s (Tolbert and Sizer, 1996). Like metropolitan areas, CZs have been used in
past research to define local labor markets (e.g., Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor, Dorn, and Hanson, 2013a, 2013b;
Chetty et al., 2014), but they have the relative advantage of covering the entire United States, including rural areas.
CZs are thus ideal for our analysis, since fracking is largely a rural phenomenon. Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote
(2017) also find that CZs do a good job of capturing the local economic impacts of fracking, which do not respect
county boundaries.
4
  Shale plays are shale formations with similar geologic and geographic properties that have significant quantities of
natural gas. We define major plays as those shale plays that have reserve estimates reported by Energy Information
Administration. See Data Appendix.



                                                           2
the country in 2006, but our substantive conclusions are robust to incorporating geographic

variation in timing and to allowing fracking opportunities to arise nationwide at an earlier date.

       We find that fracking has slowed the rate of decline in high school dropout among male

teenagers since the early 2000s. Our estimates imply that, due to fracking, the dropout rate of 17-

18-year-old boys (as measured in the Census/ACS) was 1.1 percentage points higher and the

ratio of 11th and 12th grade enrollment (as measured in the CCD) to the 17-18-year-old

population 1.4 percentage points lower over 2011-15 in the average community with shale gas

and/or oil reserves. This substantive conclusion is robust to how we estimate reserves and, as

noted, to changes in timing the onset of fracking’s diffusion. We also show in the Census/ACS

that the estimates are accounted for largely by boys who have not recently migrated, suggesting

that fracking has changed educational decisions among teenagers, rather than their residential

choices. Controlling for changes in the demographics of teen boys and allowing for increases in

compulsory schooling ages to have disparate effects in CZs with larger shale endowments also

influence these findings very little. Estimates for girls are indistinguishable from zero, but we

can often rule out effects as large as we find for boys, consistent with the incidence of fracking’s

labor market impacts.

       These estimates are reduced-form, however, leaving causal mechanisms uncertain. Labor

demand shocks from fracking could have encouraged boys to drop out not just by increasing the

longer-term earnings prospects of male high school dropouts, but also by raising the short-term

opportunity cost of staying in school. While we cannot rule out a role for increased opportunity

costs, we show that fracking improved labor market outcomes significantly more for young men

than teenage boys, suggesting a change in the perceived return to schooling contributed to the

male dropout response. Even so, perceptions of this return based on older cohorts may differ




                                                 3
from the actual return for affected cohorts, since fracking may affect that return through other

channels – by reducing school quality, for instance. Though recent research has found male

schooling choices to be more sensitive to school quality (Autor et al., forthcoming), we can rule

out even small effects of fracking on overall per-pupil school spending and average class sizes,

suggesting that male schooling choices would have to be considerably more sensitive to quality

measures orthogonal to school resources to explain our findings.

         These conclusions diverge from those of Weber (2014), who finds that natural gas

fracking in four states has increased the share of the adult population with a high school degree

and reduced the dropout share. The difference may owe to migration: fracking has generated

modest, but consistent net in-migration of working-age adults (Bartik, 2018; Wilson, 2017). By

focusing on a younger, less mobile population, we attempt to isolate educational decisions from

residential ones, like previous studies of resource booms and busts (Black, McKinnish, and

Sanders, 2005; Emery, Ferrer, and Green, 2012; Morissette, Chan, and Lu, 2015), and as noted,

our survey data allow us to rule out migration as a confounder. By incorporating more states and

multiple data sources, our analysis is also more comprehensive than concurrent studies of

fracking’s impacts on the schooling decisions of young people (e.g., Marchand and Weber, 2015;

Rickman, Wang, and Winters, 2017; Zuo, Schieffer, and Buck, 2018). More states allow for

consideration of the mediating effects of changes in state education policies like compulsory

schooling laws. Multiple data sources also allow us to closely examine which mechanisms are

driving the dropout response.5

  Exploiting school district variation in shale geology across the state of Texas and temporal variation in energy
prices over the 2000s, Marchand and Weber (2015) find declines in vocational and economically disadvantaged
student enrollment. Rickman, Wang, and Winters (2017) focus on the educational attainment of native-born
individuals aged 18-24 using cross-state variation between three states and a synthetic control group. Zuo, Schieffer,
and Buck (2018) provide a complementary analysis using different sources of fracking-related variation and
focusing on aggregate high school enrollment from the CCD, without separate estimates by sex.



                                                          4
        More broadly, we add to a recent surge of papers on the educational impacts of aggregate

economic shocks, which has considered settings from trade shocks in Mexico and around the

world (Atkin, 2016; Blanchard and Olney, 2017), to the housing price bubble in the U.S.

(Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo, 2018), to infrastructure and workfare programs in India

(Adukia, Asher, and Novosad, 2017; Shah and Steinberg, 2017). Like these studies, we exploit

localized variation in the incidence of an economic shock. To our knowledge, however, this

paper is among the first to present micro-level evidence of the downstream effects of

technological change on schooling decisions.

        A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on our estimates yields an elasticity of male

high school enrollment with respect to adult male earnings of around 0.18, below the lower

bound of the range of elasticities estimated by Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) in their

study of the 1970s coal boom and 1980s coal bust. We might have expected if anything a

stronger response to technological change in resource extraction than to even long-lived resource

price shocks. Yet, these findings are consistent with a low supply elasticity of educated labor

today (Goldin and Katz, 2008), and provide some of the first credible micro-level evidence that a

weak educational response to SBTC may be contributing to widening wage inequality.

II.     Background on Fracking

A.      Geography and Timing

        Figure 1 plots geographic variation in fracking potential for the 17 states containing at

least one CZ that is part of a major shale play.6 We derive the reserve measure from the 2011

map of shale plays published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA) and the maximum


6
 We focus on all shale plays with oil reserves and/or gas reserves reported by the EIA for at least four years
between 2008 and 2015. There are 17 states with at least one CZ containing a major shale play by this definition:
Arkansas, Colorado, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota,
Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wyoming.



                                                        5
EIA-reported economically recoverable oil and gas reserves by major shale play across 2008 to

2015.7 Overlaying the shale map to CZs, we allocate oil and gas reserves to CZs based on the

fraction of each play that they represent, then convert them to a common metric that captures the

amount of heating energy that they contain – millions of British Thermal Units (MMBTUs).

         There is considerable regional variation in reserves per capita (2000 population), with

clusters of high-reserve areas in the Western, Southern, and mid-Atlantic regions. These areas lie

atop different major shale plays: the Bakken (in Montana and North Dakota), the Barnett, Eagle

Ford, Fayetteville, Haynesville-Bossier, and Woodford (in Louisiana, Oklahoma, and Texas),

and the Marcellus (in Pennsylvania and West Virginia). However, although the reserve measure

is rather blunt, constructed from just the intersection of a CZ with a major play and the overall

play’s economic potential,8 there is also variation in the magnitude of per-capita reserves across

areas that are close geographically. This means we can identify the effects of fracking from

within-state variation in reserves across CZs, an approach that helpfully sweeps out the shared

effects of other state-level shocks, such as changes in state education policy or other aggregate

economic developments. It also mitigates the influence of outliers in the reserve distribution,

which are concentrated in states like North Dakota and Texas.

         Our estimation sample restricts attention to the 14 states in Figure 1 where data on

employment and earnings by sex are available from the year 2000 forward from the Quarterly




7
  Economically recoverable reserves are estimated volumes of hydrocarbon resources that analysis of geologic and
engineering data demonstrates with reasonable certainty are recoverable under existing economic and operating
conditions.
8
  We therefore don’t take advantage of within-play differences in “prospectivity,” which could reflect local efforts to
identify economically recoverable reserves and be independently related to trends in educational attainment. See the
Data Appendix for a complete description of how the reserve measure was calculated. We explore the robustness of
our estimates to different ways of constructing reserves in Table 5.



                                                          6
Workforce Indicators (QWI), our primary source on the labor market impacts of fracking.9 We

also trim the sample to exclude the smallest 5% and largest 10% of CZs within each state, based

on population in the year 2000.10 Table 1 Panel A shows that, while the average CZ in this

sample has substantial shale reserves, its shale oil and gas production as of 2000 was not that

high. This is expected: shale gas and oil reserves have become exploitable only as horizontal

drilling and fracking have spread. For our main analysis, we date the start of widespread use of

fracking to 2006 – a year that predates the first frack dates of the highest-reserve plays but marks

the rough beginning of the application of the technology in lower-reserve plays.11 The aggregate

annual production trends shown in Figure 2 for horizontal or directional (“unconventional”)

wells, based on data from DrillingInfo, are consistent with shale gas and oil production taking off

after 2005.12

B.       Evidence on the Spread of Fracking

         The combination of geography and time forms the core of our identification strategy: if

fracking has increased the propensity of teens to drop out of school, dropout rates should have



9
  We lose Arkansas, Kentucky, and Wyoming due to missing QWI data for the year 2000. Schooling estimates are
substantively similar when we include these states, as shown in the Appendix. Data sources are discussed below and
described completely in the Data Appendix.
10
   The motivation for this is twofold: our outcome measures are especially noisy for the smallest CZs, and the
largest CZs often include large cities that do not seem a valid counterfactual for the typical CZ with shale reserves.
We drop a total of 57 CZs due to this sample restriction. Our findings for schooling attainment are substantively
similar if we drop the smallest 10%, rather than 5%, of CZs within each state, but are more sensitive to including
larger cities. See Appendix.
11
   We prefer this approach to one taking advantage of variation in first frack dates across shale plays given the
potential endogeneity of play-specific timing and the fact a lack of ACS data for 2001-2004 makes variation in
timing more difficult to exploit convincingly. However, our estimates are qualitatively similar when we exploit this
timing (Table 5). Bartik et al. (forthcoming) report first frack dates of 2008 for both the Marcellus play and the
Haynesville-Bossier play, for shale gas, and of 2007 and 2009, respectively, for the Bakken play and the Eagle Ford
play, for shale oil. Smaller plays, like Avalon Bone-Spring (oil), Fayetteville (gas), Woodford (gas), were reportedly
first fracked in 2005 or 2006.
12
   The data are annual aggregates of monthly well-level production data from DrillingInfo. Following prior research
using these data, we classify production from horizontal and directional (“unconventional”) wells as fracking, or as
coming from shale. To be conservative, we classify unknown well types as vertical (or “conventional”) wells. In
Table 5, we assess the robustness of our findings to the choice of 2006 in various ways.



                                                          7
increased more – or declined less, given that dropout rates were declining over this period

(Murnane, 2013) – as fracking has spread, and more so in places with larger shale endowments.

It is therefore useful to begin our investigation by establishing that our reserves measure and

assumptions about timing predict changes in local economic activity consistent with existing

estimates. Because it is important for the interpretation of the dropout findings that follow in

Section III, we also document the sex and skill bias in these changes to local economic activity

using data from the QWI, which aggregates administrative microdata on jobs and earnings

covering 95% of private sector workers (see Data Appendix) and has recently been used in other

work to expose granularity in the local labor market impacts of fracking (Kearney and Wilson,

2018).

         Figure 3 Panel A presents event-study estimates of the impacts of fracking on oil and gas

production per capita (in thousands of MMBTUs), based on CZ-by-year aggregates of the

DrillingInfo data underlying Figure 2. More specifically, the figure plots estimates of the 𝜃" ’s

from the following model:

(1)                      𝑦$%& = ∑"./001 𝜃" 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ 𝐷&" + 𝜆%& + 𝛿$ + 𝜀$%& ,

where 𝑦$%& represents per-capita oil and gas production in CZ z in state s in year t; 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ is

the CZ’s predicted per-capita shale reserves (in MMBTUs; Figure 1); 𝐷&" represents a year

dummy set to one when t=τ, and 𝜆%& and 𝛿$ are vectors of state-by-year and CZ fixed effects,

respectively. The 𝜃" ’s trace out what happened over time to the within-state slope that

characterizes the relationship between production and 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ ; as fracking has spread, for

instance, the 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient for shale production should have gone from flat (Table 1 Panel

A) to upward-sloping. The capped vertical lines represent 90% confidence intervals on these

estimates, with standard errors clustered on CZ.




                                                   8
        As expected, there is no evidence of an impact of shale reserves on conventional oil and

gas production from vertical wells: the slope on reserves does not significantly change between

2005 (the year for the omitted interaction) and any subsequent (or prior) years. However, the

coefficient estimates for production from horizontal wells (fracking) suggest that production

picked up in higher-reserve CZs several years after 2005; the first statistically significant change

in slope, relative to 2005, actually does not occur until 2011. But the overall pattern is not

surprising given the trends in Figure 2, and it is reassuring that greater growth occurs in CZs with

higher shale oil and gas endowments per our reserve measure.

        Wells needed to be drilled before they can produce, however, so the labor demand effects

of fracking should have been felt before large production impacts. And it is arguably these

employment shocks – rather than shale production per se – that are more salient for schooling

choices. The black triangles in Figure 3 Panel B represent event-study estimates for the jobs-to-

population ratio for men ages 25 and over.13 The underlying data are CZ-by-year aggregates of

quarterly county- and sex-level data from the QWI, for the numerator, and annual sex-specific

Census-based estimates of county population from SEER (Survey, Epidemiology, and End

Results Program at the National Cancer Institute), for the denominator (see Data Appendix). The

event-study coefficients imply that, despite significantly lower jobs-to-population levels in 2000

(Table 1, Panel B), higher-reserve CZs did not experience different job growth for men between

2000 and 2005. Thereafter, however, higher-reserve CZs start gaining jobs for men faster than

lower-reserve CZs in the same state. This phenomenon strengthens through the end of the period




13
  We focus on the entire population ages 25 and over because the educational breakdown of jobs and monthly
earnings by sex, explored in Table 3 and Figure 4, is available only for this broad age group in the QWI. See the
Data Appendix for a complete description of the QWI data. We consider impacts on jobs and earnings in narrower
age bands, across all education categories, in the section on causal mechanisms (Table 7).



                                                        9
with a distinct increase in effect size between 2010 and 2012. The female coefficients (gray

diamonds) are much lower in magnitude, implying smaller impacts on female employment.

         Another way of measuring the labor demand shocks from fracking is to estimate its

impacts on the earnings prospects. To this end, we follow Charles, Hurst, and Notowidigdo

(2018) in estimating impacts on the natural log of “expected” monthly earnings, with expected

monthly earnings defined as the product of the average monthly earnings of adults ages 25 and

over times the jobs-to-population ratio. As shown in Figure 3 Panel C, this measure suggests

more sizable labor market impacts over 2006 to 2010, but a difference between an immediate

and a later post-fracking period is still noticeable.

         To characterize the pattern of labor market impacts revealed by model (1)

parsimoniously, and to quantify the patterns shown, we consider a slightly modified difference-

in-differences model, with two post-fracking periods:

(2)               𝑦$%& = 𝜃6 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ 𝐷&07860 + 𝜃/ 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ 𝐷&66861 + 𝜆%& + 𝛿$ + 𝜀$%& ,

where 𝐷&07860 and 𝐷&66861 are dummies set to one when t is in the ranges 2006-10 and 2011-15,

respectively.14 𝜃6 thus represents the average change in the within-state 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient

between 2006-10 and 2000-05, and 𝜃/ represents the change between 2011-15 and 2000-05. To

validate this specification, we also test whether estimates of 𝜃6 and 𝜃/ are different.

         Unless otherwise noted, throughout the remainder of the paper, we estimate model (2)

including time-varying effects of the pre-existing (year 2000) CZ observables in Table 1 Panel

D. As shown in column 2, CZs with higher per-capita shale reserves differ in some ways from



14
   We have also estimated deviation-from-trend models, which effectively impose separate linear fits on the event-
study coefficients before and after 2005. The identifying assumption is that, in the absence of fracking, any trending
in the 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient in the pre-period would have simply continued. Such a model allows some of the effects
of fracking to be immediate (post-2005 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ intercept shift) and some to accumulate over time (post-2005
change in the trend in the 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient). The results are quite similar to what we report for model (2).



                                                         10
those with lower reserves in the same state: they had significantly lower median annual

household incomes and black population shares in 2000, for example.15 Though the coefficients

are not too large in magnitude,16 failure to allow for time-varying effects of these characteristics,

in addition to time-varying effects of 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ , could therefore bias our estimates.

         The first two columns of Table 2 Panel A present estimates of model (2) for the jobs-to-

population ratio of people ages 25 and over (x100), separately by sex, including this vector of

additional controls.17 Column 3 then shows estimates of the difference in the male and female

coefficients. Panel B repeats this exercise for the natural log of expected monthly earnings. In

each panel, the first row uses a simple linear transformation to convert 𝜃9/ into a more

interpretable magnitude: the implied effects of fracking over 2011-15 for the average CZ with

any reserves (𝜃9/ × 𝜇̂ >?%?>@?%|>?%?>@?%B0 , where 𝜇̂ >?%?>@?%|>?%?>@?%B0 = 42,060 MMBTUs, from Table

1 Panel A). The average CZ with reserves gained more jobs for men than women due to

fracking: about 43 male jobs for every 1000 adult men and about 6 female jobs for every 1000

adult women by 2011-15. It also saw substantial earnings growth: expected earnings were 10.4%

higher for men, and 2.6% higher for women, by 2011-15. These estimates are roughly in line

with other nationwide studies examining the labor market effects of fracking.18 For both


15
   Each CZ is given equal weight, except in the case of outcomes constructed from public-use microdata, in which
case we weight for efficiency purposes by cell size. For the purposes of the fixed effects, we assign CZs to the states
in which the majority of their population resides.

   Table 1 column 3 shows that the predicted difference in median household income in the average CZ with shale
reserves versus without is about $886, which represents 2.7% of the variable’s mean (figure in italics) and 15.4% of
its standard deviation. We arrive at similar calculations regarding magnitudes for other variables where there are
statistically significant coefficients on 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ .

   Appendix Table A1 provides the corresponding estimates for oil and gas production, measured both in thousands
of MMBTUs and in millions of 2012 dollars. Estimates of 𝜃6 and 𝜃/ for unconventional production are relatively less
precise, consistent with Figure 3 Panel A. Effects for the conventional production measures are not statistically
significant.

   For example, Bartik et al. (forthcoming) estimate an increase in employment of 3.6% to 5.4% and earnings of
4.4% to 6.9% in the top quartile of “fracking potential” counties. Extensive reviews of the relevant literature
provided by Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2017) and Krupnick and Echarte (2017) find employment effects that
range from 1.3% to 14.4% and earnings effects that range from 1.8% to 16.7%.

outcomes, there is a significant difference in effects between the immediate and later post-

fracking periods, and men were significantly more affected.

        As evidence on whether there is indeed a skill bias to these labor demand shocks, in

addition to a bias toward men, Table 3 breaks out the jobs and earnings gains by four categories

of educational attainment. We estimate the sex- and education-specific CZ population by

multiplying the overall adult CZ population by the share of adult men or women ages 25-64 with

the relevant completed education in the Census or ACS.19 For brevity, we show only implied

effects by 2011-15 for the average CZ with any reserves, calculated as earlier described.20 Figure

4 provides a graphical representation of the corresponding event-study (model (1)) estimates.

        Men of all education levels have experienced job and expected earnings gains as a result

of fracking (Panel A). However, gains along both dimensions have been largest among high

school dropouts: by 2011-15, the average male dropout in a CZ with any reserves had a 7 percent

higher chance of holding a job due to fracking – a figure marginally significantly larger than the

gain for high school graduates (p=0.063). In addition, male dropouts ages 25 and over in the

average CZ with reserves would have expected to earn, across 2011-15, 12.7% more than they

otherwise would have. This is not significantly greater than the earnings growth expected by

high school graduates (p=0.185), but it is significantly greater than the expected earnings growth

among men with some college or more. Among women, jobs gains were more similar across

education categories, but earnings gains were also most substantial at the bottom of the

distribution (Panel B).



19
   We estimate this time-, sex-, and education-varying population share using the 2000 Census and the 2005-2015
ACS. We linearly interpolate these shares for 2001 through 2004.
20
   Appendix Tables A2 and A3 show the corresponding coefficient estimates from model (2) for both outcomes
along with p-values on the difference in coefficients between 2006-10 and 2011-15. We reject equality at the 0.05
significance level in all cases except for the jobs-to-population ratio for female dropouts (p=0.055).



                                                        12
III.   Fracking and High School Dropout

       We have established that our measure of shale reserves and assumptions about the timing

of the spread of fracking predict changes in local economic activity consistent with existing

findings. We have also added to existing understanding of these changes by exploiting more

granular data: not only did places with more shale reserves experience more growth in labor

demand starting around 2006 – particularly in 2011 and later – those increases in labor demand

were weighted toward men, and among men, those less-educated. Male high school dropouts saw

the greatest improvements in their jobs and earnings prospects.

       Collectively, these findings suggest that the educational decisions of young men,

including on the high school dropout margin, are likely to have been affected by fracking. Our

next goal is to estimate the reduced-form effect of fracking on high school dropout by sex, using

the same models that we employed in Section II; we defer further discussion of causal

mechanisms to Section IV.

A.     Data

       We use two sources of information on dropout; neither is ideal, but they provide

complementary evidence on the phenomenon of interest.

       First, we construct high school dropout rates from the public-use microdata samples

(PUMS) of the 2000 Census and the 2005 through 2015 ACS (Ruggles et al., 2015). These data

provide person-level information on sex, age, school enrollment, and educational attainment and

identify local geography down to the Public Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. While PUMAs

are not the same as CZs, they can be allocated to CZs based on the division of county population

across PUMAs and the mapping between CZs and counties. As with our analysis on the spread

of fracking, we choose to aggregate to the CZ level to capture the local economic impacts of




                                                13
fracking, which do not respect county or PUMA boundaries (Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote,

2017). We focus on 17- and 18-year-olds – an age group for which dropout decisions are salient

but migration for work is low – and define dropout as having not recently been enrolled in school

and not having a high school degree or GED (see Data Appendix).

        Though suitable for this analysis, the Census and ACS have limitations. First, small

samples (5% in the Census and 1% in the ACS) contribute to imprecision. Second, no

information on PUMA is available in the 2001 to 2004 ACS, limiting the years available to

establish common outcomes trends in the pre-fracking period, which are implicit in a difference-

in-differences specification. Third, the dropout rates from the Census and ACS are not

necessarily comparable due to differences in survey timing.21

        Our second data source – the CCD – helps to address these limitations. The CCD

includes annual school-district level data on high school enrollment by grade and sex.

Enrollment data in the CCD are in principle consistently measured and cover all school districts

in the United States. After accounting for some lapses in coverage, aggregating 11th and 12th

grade enrollment (combined) from the district to the CZ level, and normalizing by estimates of

the 17-18-year-old population from SEER, we have an annual series on sex-specific enrollment-

to-population ratios beginning in the 1999-00 academic year (represented as 2000 to follow). The

main limitation of this series is that data are missing for 2009-10 (2010).22




21
   The Census, officially collected on April 1, solicits school enrollment as of February 1. By contrast, the ACS is
fielded throughout the year (with survey month not publicly reported) and asks about school enrollment over the
past three months. Because a new school year begins typically in August or September, a higher share of the 17- and
18-year-olds surveyed in the fall – and therefore a higher share of 17- and 18-year-olds in the ACS – will be of age
to be enrolled in 12th grade or beyond. If teens sometimes make dropout decisions based on grade rather than age,
and if that tendency happens to be correlated with 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ , our estimates from the Census/ACS analysis could be
biased.
22
   See Data Appendix for more detail on both sources.



                                                        14
B.     Baseline Estimates

       Figure 5 presents event-study estimates of model (1) for the 11th and 12th grade

enrollment-to-population ratio (Panel A) and for the high school dropout rate of 17- and 18-year-

olds (Panel B). In both cases, we restrict attention to the same sample of CZs considered in

Section II; the standard errors underlying the 90% confidence intervals (capped vertical lines) are

clustered on CZ; and we include time-varying effects of the CZ observables in Table 1 Panel D,

in an attempt to improve precision. We also weight the estimates in Panel B by cell size.

       The coefficients are noisier than those in Figure 3 Panel B and Figure 4. However, the

estimates are consistent with fracking weakening the attachment of teenage boys to high school.

As was the case in Figures 3 and 4 for jobs-to-population ratios and expected earnings, the

gradient between male dropout and 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ (black triangles) shows a distinctly different trend

after 2005 from the flat trend that preceded it. Starting in 2006, higher-reserve CZs begin to see

larger reductions – or smaller increases – in male enrollment-to-population ratios relative to

lower-reserve CZs in the same state (Panel A). For dropout, the pattern is flipped, showing

relative increases in dropout in high versus low-reserve CZs in 2006 and later (Panel B). In both

panels, the point estimates appear consistent with a larger impact, on average, in 2011 and later,

precisely when fracking appears to start having larger labor market impacts. The event-study

coefficients for female dropout rates (gray diamonds) do not display this pattern.

       Table 4 presents estimates from the more restrictive difference-in-differences

specification, model (2), for teen male (column 1) and female (column 2) enrollment-to-

population ratios (Panel A) and dropout rates (Panel B). Regressions in both panels include state-

by-year and CZ fixed effects as well as time-varying effects of year 2000 CZ observables, to

match the figures. Considering first the estimates for boys, neither outcome variable experiences




                                                15
a statistically significant change in the 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient between 2006-10 and 2000-05, though

coefficients move in the direction of increased dropout. However, there is a significantly greater

decrease (increase) in the enrollment-to-population ratio (dropout rate) for relatively high reserve

CZs between 2011-15 and 2000-05, and the data reject equality of the difference-in-differences

coefficients for 2006-10 and 2011-15. The point estimates imply that, due to fracking, male

enrollment-to-population (dropout rates) in the average CZ with any reserves were 1.4

percentage points lower (1.12 percentage points higher) over 2011-15. Column 2 confirms that a

similar phenomenon is not happening for teen girls, and column 3 shows the differences in

estimated effects across sex are statistically significant.

C.      Specification Checks

        Table 5 explores the sensitivity of our estimates to a number of changes in the

econometric specification. For reference, Panel A repeats the sex-specific estimates for both

enrollment-to-population and dropout rates from Table 4. Columns 5 and 6 of each panel

demonstrate how the changes in specification affect sex-specific estimates of the impact of

fracking on the natural log of expected monthly earnings (Table 2). This is a useful benchmark,

since specifications that generate weaker “first stage” impacts on the labor market should also

generate weaker impacts on school enrollment, if changes in the labor market are the key

mechanism linking fracking to schooling decisions. Throughout, we give predicted effects by

2011-15 in the average CZ with any reserves.23

        To begin, we consider sensitivity to controls. In Panel B, we first drop the controls for

time-varying effects of the year 2000 CZ observables in Table 1 Panel D. The impacts on the



23
  Appendix Table A4, A5, and A6 show the corresponding coefficients from the specifications in Panels B, C, and
D, respectively. Plots of event-study coefficients for each of these specifications are in Appendix Figures A1, A2,
and A3.



                                                        16
estimates are generally small and not consistent across outcomes. However, substituting year

fixed effects only for the state-by-year fixed effects in our preferred model slightly raises the

magnitude of the estimated impacts for boys. Such a finding may arise if fracking opportunities

in a CZ also increased dropout propensities of boys elsewhere in the state. But an alternative

explanation is that higher-reserve CZs are in states where dropout rates would have been falling

less quickly over time for other reasons. Although the estimates are largely similar, state-by-year

fixed effects help to ensure our estimates are not contaminated by these state-specific shocks.

The final specification in Panel B provides unweighted estimates for the dropout outcome. The

standard errors actually fall slightly in the unweighted specification, suggesting the potential

importance of small outliers. The point estimates, however, remain basically unchanged.

        Panel C considers different assumptions about timing. First, we assign each CZ with

reserves the first frack year for the earliest-fracked shale play it lies atop (𝑡$∗ ), with dates as

reported by Bartik et al. (forthcoming). The model of interest is then:

(3)                          𝑦$%& = 𝜃 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡$& + 𝜆%& + 𝛿$ + 𝜀$%& ,

where 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑡$& = 1[𝑡 ≥ 𝑡$∗ ]. The intuition of the empirical approach still applies; the only change is

the introduction of variation across states in when the 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ gradient should begin to change.

For both schooling outcomes, the estimates are now smaller in magnitude for boys. However,

estimated impacts on adult male earnings are as well, and implied effects of local earnings

growth on schooling decisions for boys are quite similar to what we saw at baseline, particularly

for the enrollment-to-population ratio. Nevertheless, we can no longer reject equality of the

impacts on dropout rates across boys and girls. The next specification is a simple difference-in-

differences, comparing 2011-15 to the year 2000 only, and so acknowledging that fracking

occurred earlier in some places. The primary consequence is to reduce statistical power.




                                                    17
           Panel D explores the robustness of our conclusions to alternative predictions of local

shale reserves. The first two approaches weight oil and gas reserves by price rather than energy

content in the aggregate reserve prediction under extreme assumptions: using the peak ratio of oil

to gas prices (from 2012) and the peak ratio of gas to oil prices (from 2003).24 We then apply the

earliest available shale play reserve estimates (from 2008), combining oil and gas into common

energy units as in our original measure.25 For boys, the implied effects of earnings growth on

enrollment (column 1) and dropout (column 3) are weakened the most when using 2008 reserve

estimates, but they are still evident, suggesting that using more recent reserves data mainly

serves to improve statistical power. Dropout estimates for girls continue to remain

indistinguishable from zero, and in most cases remain significantly lower in magnitude than

those for boys. Overall, the implications are the same regardless of how reserves are measured:

fracking appears to have lowered schooling attainment for teenage boys much more so than for

girls.26

D.         Education, Location, or Policy?

           Collectively, the specification checks above produce estimates that are substantively

similar to those at baseline: the schooling decisions of teenage boys appear to have been




24
   In essence, we bound the relative weights placed on oil and gas when combined using prices; although there is
temporal and geographic variation in energy prices, price expectations as relevant for our analysis would arguably
fall between these extremes of annual industry-standard price benchmarks.
25
   Shale oil reserve estimates are not available until 2011, so our local per-capita reserve estimates for 2008 are
imputed for oil with 2011 reserve values.
26
   Appendix Table A7 shows sensitivity of our schooling estimates to changes in the estimation sample. The
reduced-form estimates are slightly smaller in magnitude when we include CZs from the three states with major
shale plays but without QWI data for 2000, though we still reject equality of effects by 2011-15 across sex.
Dropping the bottom 10% rather than the bottom 5% of a state’s CZs (based on size) has lesser effect on the
estimates than dropping the top 5% rather than the top 10% of a state’s CZs. In the latter case, the estimated effect
on male dropout shrinks (but remains significant) and we can no longer reject equality of effects with females. We
think our preferred sample selection rule is justifiable given that large CZs are unlikely to provide a valid
counterfactual for smaller CZs where fracking is more prevalent, and indeed, the balance tests in Table 1 column 2
look less compelling with larger CZs included.



                                                          18
significantly more negatively affected by fracking than those of teenage girls. Before we move

on to why educational choices were affected by fracking, it is useful to confirm that the estimates

indeed reflect educational decisions rather than residential ones. Concerns over migration

motivated our study of teenagers, but could migration still be affecting our estimates? Setting

aside the question of migration, other explanations for our findings besides fracking, like

heterogeneity in responses to changes in state education policies, are also possible.

         Consider migration first, which we can observe in Census and ACS microdata. Because

of the endogeneity of migration, we do not condition estimation on it but rather decompose the

outcome variable into a dummy for being both a dropout and a recent migrant (in the past year in

the ACS and in the past 5 years in the Census) and a dummy for being both a dropout and not a

recent migrant; the sum of coefficients across these two outcomes is equal to the total baseline

dropout effect. As shown in Table 6 Panel B, only the estimates for being both a dropout and not

a recent migrant are statistically significant for boys and statistically different between boys and

girls. The vast majority of the reduced-form estimate thus appears to be accounted for by

educational choices rather than residential ones.

         Even if not driven by migration, shifts in the demographics of the local population could

be incidentally correlated with the spread of fracking and could therefore influence our estimates.

In the first set of estimates in Panel C, we control for time-varying local shares of the Census and

ACS 17- and 18-year-olds who are black, Hispanic, or who have recently migrated. The implied

effects on dropout change little, suggesting that fracking is not strongly correlated with changes

in the composition of 17- and 18-year-olds, at least on these observable dimensions.27



27
  We would like to include family background measures, like family income or parental education, but these
variables are only available for the selected sample of 17- and 18-year-olds in the Census and ACS who still live
with their parents.



                                                         19
        As a final check that our estimates reflect a response to fracking rather than to other

changes in the local environment, we control for changes in the age at which states allow

children to drop out of high school. Common effects of such changes are of course already

captured in our state-by-year fixed effects. But suppose that dropout rates in higher-reserve areas

fell relatively less in response to the increases in compulsory schooling ages that occurred over

our estimation period.28 Then a dropout effect we are attributing to fracking may really be caused

by heterogeneity in the impacts of state education policy. In the last rows of Table 6, Panel C, we

assess this possibility directly by including as a control the interaction between 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑠$ and a

state-by-time-varying indicator for the requirement that a person be enrolled in school until age

17 or 18. We do this both for the dropout rate of 17-18-year-olds and for the enrollment-to-

population ratio. For males, the estimates get slightly larger in magnitude, though not

significantly so, suggesting that such heterogeneity either is working against us seeing an effect

or is difficult to detect given the generally small changes in dropout in response to recent

changes in compulsory schooling laws (Oreopoulos, 2009).

IV.     Mechanisms: Theory and Evidence

        The dropout findings capture the reduced-form effects of fracking – the effects of

fracking on schooling decisions working through any channel. While such estimates are

independently interesting, we also care about causal mechanisms. For example, in Becker’s

classic (1964) model of human capital investment, candidate mechanisms for an increase in

dropout rates would include more than just a reduction in the return to a high school degree;



28
   Over the period of interest, the only states in our estimation sample where compulsory schooling laws changed to
require enrollment until age 17 or age 18 were Colorado, Maryland, Nebraska, and West Virginia. We obtained
compulsory schooling ages from 2000 forward from NCES at
https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/tables/dt15_234.10.asp?current=yes, and assumed any change occurred in
the earliest possible year over the relevant interval.



                                                        20
increases in the costs of staying in high school, namely increases in the opportunity cost, matter

as well. But fracking can also affect the return to a high school degree by influencing school

quality, which may rise due to additional funding, or fall due to crowding.29

        To formalize the discussion of channels, consider a choice between two states – high

school graduation and high school dropout – among 18-year-olds. Those who choose to graduate

enter the labor market one year later than those who do not. The decision point is normalized to

year 0, so that dropouts enter the labor market in year 0, and graduates enter in year 1; all

individuals then work through year T in discrete time indexed by t. Individuals i vary in their

ability, 𝑑L , which is uniformly distributed over [0,1]. For simplicity, assume that earnings in both

states are known at the time of the decision, with 𝑌NO (𝑡) > 𝑌STNO (𝑡) ∀𝑡. Also assume that the

indirect or psychic costs of remaining in high school until period 1, 𝜑(𝑑L ), are decreasing in

ability, so that 𝜑′ < 0. Most potential dropouts are enrolled in public school, so direct costs of

remaining enrolled are zero (no tuition).

        Teen i chooses high school graduation if the lifetime payoff from graduation exceeds that

from dropout, i.e., if 𝑉NO (𝑑L ) > 𝑉STNO . With ability uniformly distributed on [0,1], the break-even

ability for staying in school, 𝑑∗ , is also the high school dropout rate. If psychic costs are then

linearly decreasing in ability, with 𝜑(𝑑L ) = 𝜑 × (1 − 𝑑L ), 𝜑 > 0, 𝑑∗ takes on the intuitive closed-

form expression:

                                6           6
                     𝑑∗ = 1 − \ ]∑`&a6 (6^>)_ b𝑌NO (𝑡) − 𝑌STNO (𝑡)c −        𝑌STNO
                                                                             deefe (0)
                                                                                   eg        o.
                                 deeeeeeeeefeeeeeeeeeg

                                           >?&h>S &T iLji %kiTTl




29
  Increased family incomes could be another channel through which fracking influences the return to a degree. For
example, children from families whose incomes have risen due to fracking may be gaining more skills from high
school than they would have otherwise. To the extent that responses would be similar for girls and boys, they would
not help to explain the gap in estimated effects by sex, which is our focal point here.



                                                        21
Thus, the dropout rate is a decreasing function of the return to high school – or earnings

prospects of dropouts over their working lives – and an increasing function of the opportunity

cost of staying in school.

         How does this map to the evidence that we’ve presented thus far? We’ve shown that the

teen male dropout rate has risen and the return to education among adult men has fallen by more

over time in areas with more shale reserves. Evidence of the same phenomena for females is

much weaker, suggesting that the reduction in the return is the key causal pathway for our

findings. But an increase in the opportunity cost of school enrollment for boys could also be

contributing to our estimates. This would especially be the case if boys were present-biased

(Cadena and Keys, 2015; Lavecchia, Lu, and Oreopoulos, 2016) and fracking increased earnings

of teenage boys. The standard human capital model of course assumes that that they would be

forward looking, which might not be realistic.

         In an attempt to disentangle the relevance of the opportunity cost and returns to education

channels, Table 7 considers the jobs-to-population ratio (Panel A) and natural log of expected

monthly earnings (Panel B) for various narrow age groups and separately by sex, calculated from

QWI data and population estimates as earlier described.30 For each outcome, we provide the year

2000 mean (column 1), difference-in-differences estimates from model (2) with additional

controls (columns 2 to 3), the p-value on equality of the two coefficient estimates between year

groups (column 4), sexes (for 2011-15, column 5), and age groups (for 2011-15, column 6), and

the implied effect of fracking by 2011-15 for the average CZ with any reserves (column 7).

Though fracking led only to a small increase in the likelihood of 14-18-year-old boys having



30
  Unfortunately, information on jobs and earnings by educational attainment and sex is not available over narrow
age ranges considered in the table. See Appendix Figure A5 for event-study representations of the effects for these
outcomes.



                                                         22
jobs (Panel A), it substantially increased the wages and/or hours of those with jobs (Panel B).

Those estimates are nevertheless significantly smaller than those observed for only slightly older

males, ages 19-24 and 25-34, whose experiences on the job market are arguably particularly

salient for prospective dropouts in forming expectations of the future.

         We of course cannot rule out that teenagers are misinformed, over-reacting to a

misplaced notion that well-paying jobs are immediately available to them that are not. But the

estimates are also consistent with changes in the return to education playing a role in the dropout

decision of boys. Nevertheless, changes in the return to education among adult men may not

represent the changes in the expected return across the lifecycle for the cohorts of interest. The

fracking boom could have reduced school quality, for example, lowering the skill (and future

productivity) gains associated obtaining a high school degree.

         Table 8 considers whether school quality has declined as a result of fracking, potentially

lowering the return to schooling independently of labor market developments. We would have

liked to measure school quality with some measure of school output, like test scores, but

available test score data are not geographically disaggregated enough or do not span enough

years to apply our empirical approach.31 Instead, we consider class size and per-pupil school

spending and revenues, using CZ aggregates of annual data from the CCD and the Census of

Governments and Annual Surveys of State and Local Government Finances, respectively.




31
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) spans the period of interest, but reports data only for
states and selected large school districts. With passage of the No Child Left Behind Act, states were required to test
children in grades 3 through 8 in math and reading and publicly report the test results starting in 2002-03.
Unfortunately, the tests and reporting practices differ across states, so comprehensive estimates are unavailable for
our study period.



                                                          23
         The first three rows of the table show that there was no effect of fracking on average

class size, overall per-pupil spending, or overall per-pupil revenue.32 Given the standard errors,

we can rule out small contributions of changes in school resources to our schooling estimates.33

Fracking did affect the composition of revenues, though, consistent with expectations. In line

with fracking increasing property values (Bartik et al. forthcoming), fracking appears to have

increased local (property-tax based) revenues per student enrolled in public schools.34 However,

this positive effect on local revenues has been offset by negative revenue effects at the federal

and state levels.35

         While speculative, these auxiliary findings suggest that labor market developments

associated with fracking are important to our school enrollment findings, and that teenage boys

have based their decisions on more than just opportunity costs. Incorporating all causal

pathways, our estimates yield an elasticity of high school enrollment with respect to adult




32
   See Appendix Figure A6 for the corresponding event-study estimates. The revenue and spending results are in
line with the null effects obtained in other national-scale analysis (Bartik et al., forthcoming) but by construction are
unable to capture the heterogeneous effects uncovered in regional analyses (Marchand and Weber, 2015; Newell and
Raimi, 2015; Ratledge and Zachary, 2017; Weber, Burnett, and Xiarchos, 2016, Zuo, Schieffer, and Buck, 2018).
Our class size results obtained at the national level also cannot produce the heterogeneity documented in regional
analyses (Marchand and Weber, 2015; Ratledge and Zachary, 2017).
33
   For example, the upper bound on the 95% confidence interval for the average class size effect of fracking in a CZ
with any reserves is less than a one student increase. As a point of comparison, Dynarski, Hyman, and
Schanzenbach (2013) find that being randomly assigned to attend a small class in kindergarten (with 13 to 17
students) instead of a regular-sized class (with 22 to 25 students) – so having 5 to 12 fewer students in the same
class – increased the probability of attending college by 2.7 percentage points, with an effect size for males 1.6
percentage points higher than that for females. The implied effect of an additional student on the male-female
difference in college attendance is thus about 0.2 percentage point (1.6/8.5, where 8.5 is the average class size
increase). If we adopted the same 0.2 percentage point implied effect of an additional student for high school
dropout, we would be able to account for less than 20% of the increase in the male-female gap in dropout rates.
34
   Not all studies find positive effects of fracking on property values. Muehlenbachs, Spiller, and Timmins (2015)
find large negative impacts on nearby groundwater-dependent house prices, though at a broader geographic scale,
they find positive impacts that diminish over time. Gopalakrishnan and Klaiber (2013) also find negative impacts on
property values.
35
   State governments often redistribute local tax revenue across school districts in an effort to narrow spending
differences between more and less property-wealthy districts. Relatedly, the federal government’s primary grants
program (Title I) is distributed on the basis of child poverty. If fracking has reduced child poverty rates, any
educational impacts for local students may have eventually been offset by reductions in Title I funds.

earnings of 0.18.36 This elasticity estimate is on the lower end of the range of elasticities that

Black, McKinnish, and Sanders (2005) estimate by exploiting earnings variation from the coal

boom and bust of the 1970s and 1980s, which suggest that school enrollment falls by 2.2% to

7.2% for every 10% increase in earnings. The difference in truly comparable elasticities between

the two studies would, moreover, arguably be larger: the variation in Black, McKinnish, and

Sanders (2005) arises from long-lived, but ultimately transitory, price-shocks, biasing downward

their elasticity estimate as would be comparable to our setting of permanent, technological

change. The effect size for young men in our study is thus small by historical standards.

V.      Conclusion

        Over the past decade, the widespread diffusion of horizontal drilling and fracking has

fueled a structural transformation of local economies across the United States – from

Pennsylvania to North Dakota – increasing local incomes and helping to set the U.S. on a path

toward energy independence. Using high-frequency outcomes data and taking advantage of

geographic and temporal variation in fracking, we have demonstrated that this structural

transformation has had the additional consequence of slowing reductions in high school dropout

rates among teenagers, particularly the young males whose longer-term labor market prospects it

has more greatly affected. Though we cannot completely rule out other causal pathways, such as

an increased opportunity cost, we marshal additional evidence to support the conclusion that

perceptions of a reduced longer-term return to a high school degree for men were an important

causal mechanism. For example, fracking did not appreciably increase jobs for teenagers.




36
  We calculate this elasticity by comparing the 1.43 percentage point decrease in the teen male enrollment-to-
population ratio from our baseline specification – which amounts to roughly a 1.9% decline given the baseline ratio
(Table 1 Panel C) – to a 10.4% earnings gain from fracking for adult males (Table 3).



                                                        25
Fracking also appears to have changed school resources too little for changes in school quality to

be an important factor in our findings.

        Do these findings provide cause for concern? As we describe, the decision to drop out of

school could well be a rational one in the face of increases in later-life job opportunities for

dropouts. Nevertheless, some students could be making mistakes in dropping out. There are also

social benefits from completing high school that are ignored in private dropout decisions (e.g.,

Lochner and Moretti, 2004; Dee, 2004; Milligan, Moretti, and Oreopolous, 2004). Fracking may

thus be generating sub-optimally low levels of education among some individuals who would

already likely be relatively low-skilled, with possible implications for future productivity and the

social safety net. Whether the human capital of a generation of young men has been permanently

affected is an open question, one that cannot be readily answered with our data and research

design.37

        Second, and more broadly, we present new evidence on the relationship between

technology and educational attainment. With fracking, we have a technology that complements

low-skilled labor and one whose use is geographically constrained in a way that allows for

credible identification of its impacts on educational attainment. We find evidence of reductions

in educational attainment at the bottom of the skill distribution, and that longer-term declines in

the return to education could be an important contributing factor. In addition, converting our

point estimates to an elasticity and comparing our findings directly with earlier work, we find our

estimated effect sizes to be consistent with a low supply elasticity of educated labor today

(Goldin and Katz, 2008).




37
  Although those students who drop out may re-enroll later in their lives (Emery, Ferrer, and Green (2012) do find
some evidence for such re-enrollment in British Columbia), we cannot investigate this possibility with Census data.



                                                        26
       Altogether, our study suggests a smaller response in educational attainment to skill-

biased labor demand shocks today than estimated in earlier decades and supports the view that

SBTC has contributed to wage inequality. Even so, the effects of technological change on

education may be heterogeneous across the skill distribution. Future understanding of this

relationship would therefore benefit from exploration of other episodes of localized

technological change, particularly ones favoring the highly skilled.

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil
play (17 states), with available data from the Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) for 2000-2015, and between
the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their
state (202 of 259 CZs for all variables except the enrollment-to-population ratio, where there are 200 CZs). The
unit of observation is CZ-year (Panels A and D) or CZ-year-sex (Panels B and C). Data were drawn from
DrillingInfo (Panel A oil and gas production), the QWI (Panel B jobs numbers), the Common Core of Data (Panel
C enrollment numbers), the 2000 Census PUMS (Panel C dropout rates), and 2000 Census county-level
tabulations (Panel D and the population figures for the jobs and enrollment to population ratios). Column 2
regressions include state fixed effects, and standard errors are heteroskedasticity-robust. * Measured in 1000s of
MMBTUs.

and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their
state (202 of 259 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Data on jobs and monthly earnings
for individuals ages 25 and over are from the 2000-2015 QWI and correspond to unweighted averages
of beginning of quarter figures reported throughout the year, and data on the population ages 25 and
over are from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Expected monthly
earnings multiply reported monthly earnings by the jobs-to-population ratio. All regressions include
state-by-year fixed effects, CZ fixed effects, and time-varying effects of each of the 2000 Census CZ
characteristics listed in Table 1 Panel D. Regressions in column 3 also include interactions between
these variables and a dummy for male; coefficients on the interactions with the male dummy are
given in the table. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered on CZ.

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil play (17 states), with available data from
the QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state
(202 of 259 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Data on jobs and monthly earnings for individuals ages 25 and over are from the 2000-2015
QWI and correspond to unweighted averages of beginning of quarter figures reported throughout the year; data on the population ages 25 and over are
from SEER; and estimates of education shares in the poulation ages 25-64 are from the Census and ACS. Expected monthly earnings multiply reported
monthly earnings by the group-specific jobs-to-population ratio. Cell entries give estimated effects on outcomes as of 2011-15 for the average CZ in the
estimation sample with any shale reserves, calculated from model 2 (Panels A and B) or a fully-interacted version of model 2 using pooled data (Panel C).
All regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects and time-varying effects of the CZ observables summarized in Table 1 Panel D. Each CZ is
given equal weight in the estimation. Standard errors clustered on CZ are in parentheses.

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil play
(17 states), with available data from the QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on
average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state (202 out of 259 CZs for the dropout rate and 200 of
259 CZs for the enrollment-to-population ratio). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Enrollment data in Panel A are
from the 1999-00 to 2014-15 Common Core of Data (missing 2009-10); enrollment figures are divided by SEER-based
estimates of the CZ's 17- and 18-year-old population. Dropout data are from the 2000 Census PUMS and the 2005
through 2015 ACS PUMS. All regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects, as well as time-varying effects of
the 2000 Census CZ characteristics listed in Table 1 Panel D. Regressions in column 3 also include interactions between
these variables and a dummy for male; coefficients on the interactions with the male dummy are given in the table. Panel
B regressions are weighted by the number of Census or ACS respondents used to generate the CZ-year-sex mean dropout
rates. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered on CZ.

 Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil play (17 states), with available data from the
 QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state (202 of 259
 CZs for each outcome except the enrollment-to-population ratio, where there are 200 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Unless otherwise noted
 (Panel B), all regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects, as well as time-varying effectsd of each of the 2000 Census CZ characteristics listed in
 Table 1 Panel D. Cell entries give estimated effects on outcomes as of 2011-15 for the average CZ in the estimation sample with any shale reserves, calculated
 from model 2 as described in the text. Regressions for dropout rates (columns 3 and 4) are weighted by the number of Census or ACS respondents used to
 generate the CZ-year-sex mean dropout rates. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered on CZ.

Data Appendix

A.       Estimating Shale Gas and Oil Reserves

Our preferred approach to predicting CZ reserves relies on the maximum ever (across 2008 to
2015 for gas and 2011 to 2015 for oil) reported reserves for each major shale play, published by
the Energy Information Administration (EIA), and the 2011 EIA maps of shale plays.1 We
overlay these maps to counties, separately for oil and gas, and allocate maximum reserves to
counties based on the fraction of each play that they contain, following a process similar to that
of Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2017), who study the local economic impacts of fracking.2 A
given CZ’s oil (gas) reserves are then the sum of these prorated oil (gas) reserves across all
counties the CZ contains.3 To combine oil and gas reserves, we convert these predicted reserves
into millions of British Thermal Units (MMBTUs), which capture the amount of heating energy
that they contain.4 Finally, we normalize each CZ’s combined predicted oil and gas reserves by
its 2000 population to arrive at predicted shale reserves per capita.

B.       Data on Gas and Oil Production

Figure 2, Figure 3A, and Appendix Table A1 were estimated using CZ-by-year aggregates of
monthly well-level production data licensed to us under a special agreement with DrillingInfo.
The aggregate data give production (thousands of cubic feet of natural gas or barrels of oil) by
well type (horizontal or directional versus vertical or unknown).

Following prior research (Feyrer, Mansur, and Sacerdote, 2017), we classify production from
horizontal and directional (unconventional) wells as fracking, or as coming from shale. As with
our reserve measure, we combine oil and gas production using the conversion to MMBTUs. In
Appendix Table A1, however, we also consider the value of production (converted to real 2012
dollars using the energy CPI) as an outcome. To reduce imprecision in the estimates arising from
some extreme outliers in these data, we follow Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2017) in also taking
the inverse hyperbolic sine (IHS) of these measures. The IHS effectively allows us to take the
natural logarithm of production – and coefficients can be interpreted much as they would be in a
log-linear model as production levels grow – but retain observations with zero production in the
estimation sample.

        Reserves        by        play      for,       for      example,        2013,       are       reported      at
http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/pdf/table_2.pdf                                                    and
http://www.eia.gov/naturalgas/crudeoilreserves/pdf/table_4.pdf. The shapefiles for play boundaries can be found at
http://www.eia.gov/pub/oil_gas/natural_gas/analysis/publications/maps/shalegasplay.zip. We test the robustness of
our results to changing various aspects of the prediction in Table 5.
2
  Thus, we assign a county x% of a shale play’s estimated reserves if it accounts for x% of its land area. Unlike
Maniloff and Mastromonaco (2017), we use more frequent data and CZs rather counties. We also use the estimated
reserves rather than the fraction of each CZ with reserves to better capture fracking potential. For example, two CZs
with very different reserves would look identical under the latter measure. The latter measure also cannot easily
accommodate the fact that some labor markets lie atop multiple shale plays.
3
   We allocate counties to CZs (1990 boundaries) using the crosswalk provided by David Dorn:
http://www.ddorn.net/data/cw_cty_czone.zip.
4
  We use the production conversion factors reported for 2012 by the EIA (http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/pdf/
appg.pdf): 1,022 BTUs per cubic foot of gas and 5.85 MMBTUs per barrel of oil.

C.      Census and ACS Microdata

Overview and Key Variables

The 2000 Census and the 2005 through 2015 American Community Survey (ACS) Public Use
Microdata Samples (PUMS) (Ruggles et al., 2015) provide individual-level data on gender, age,
school enrollment, and educational attainment, and identify local geography down to the Public
Use Microdata Area (PUMA) level. PUMAs are not the same as CZs, but can be allocated to
CZs based on the division of county population across PUMAs and the mapping between CZs
and counties.5 Thus, we are able to estimate sex-specific dropout rates of teenagers at the CZ
level for two pre-fracking years (2000 and 2005) and ten consecutive post-fracking years (2006
through 2015). Unfortunately, no information on PUMA is provided in the public-use ACS
PUMS for 2001 to 2004.6

We define dropouts as those who have not recently been enrolled in school and do not have a
high school degree and limit attention to 17- to 18-year-olds in our main analysis. We focus on
the population that is of high school age to mitigate bias from selective migration. That is, by
including 19-year-olds or older adults, we would be more concerned that what might appear to
be an impact of fracking on education decisions is really an impact of fracking on location
choices of existing dropouts. We are interested in how fracking has affected the level of dropout
in the economy, not how it has affected the geographic distribution of existing dropouts.
Fortunately, by using microdata, we are able to explore the influence of migration on our
estimates directly, which we do in Table 6.

Considerations

The reporting period for school enrollment is the prior three months in the ACS (which is
conducted in all months of the year) and February 1 in the Census (which is conducted on April
1). These differences in generate several challenges in comparing dropout rates of 17- and 18-
year-olds across the two surveys, since survey month is not publicly reported in the ACS. First,
because school years generally last 180 days, starting in September and ending in May, there is
some potential that we misclassify ACS respondents interviewed in the late summer as dropouts,
since we do not observe the interview date in the public-use data. Because our analysis includes
state-by-year fixed effects, it will account for any resulting bias provided that it does not vary
within states over time. Second, with a new school year starting in September, a higher share of
the 17- and 18-year-olds surveyed in the fall – and therefore a higher share of 17- and 18-year-
olds in the ACS – will be of age to be enrolled in 12th grade or beyond. If teens sometimes make
dropout decisions based on grade rather than age, and if that tendency happens to be correlated
with reserves, our estimates from the Census/ACS analysis could be biased.

D.      Common Core of Data

  5
     Crosswalks between 1990 and 2000 PUMAs and CZs (relevant for the 1990 Census, 2000 Census, and the 2005-
2011 ACS) are available on David Dorn’s website: http://www.ddorn.net/data/cw_puma2000_czone.zip. We create
an analogous crosswalk between 2010 PUMAs and CZs (relevant for the 2012-2015 ACS) using data on the division
of 2010 county population across 2010 PUMAs from the Missouri Census Data Center (http://mcdc.missouri.edu) and
the county-CZ crosswalk (http://www.ddorn.net/data/cw_cty_czone.zip).
   6
     PUMA codes are not reported in the public-use ACS files for these years.




                                                      48
The Common Core of Data (CCD) is the primary federal database on public schools in the
United States. We used the Department of Education’s “ELSi tableGenerator”7 to gather
aggregated annual county-level CCD data on the number of students by grade and gender (for
calculation of the enrollment-to-population ratio)8 and the total number of students and teachers
(for calculation of the student-teacher ratio/class size).

For several states and years, we are missing sex-specific enrollment data. In these cases, we
impute missing values. We first attempt to impute with the product of total enrollment and the
sex-specific share in the enrolled population (averaged over 2000-2016). However, this only
works when total enrollment is reported. For years where total enrollment is not reported, we
impute with linearly interpolated values. These imputations affect a small number of
observations.9 For the purposes of the enrollment-to-population ratio analysis, we also drop two
CZs in Nebraska that are large outliers on this variable.

E.      QWI Data Description

Overview

The Quarterly Workforce Indicators (QWI) are a set of quarterly labor market indicators made
available by the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) at the U.S. Census
Bureau. The LEHD covers over 95 percent of U.S. private sector jobs and is compiled from a
variety of sources including state Unemployment Insurance (UI) records, the Quarterly Census
of Employment and Wages (QCEW), the Census, Social Security Administrative records, and
individual tax returns. Linkages across these data sources enable the LEHD to publish QWI data
with detailed firm characteristics and worker demographic information for geographies as small
as counties. The near-universe and demographic-specific nature of the QWI is particularly useful
for our study, which requires data by sex and education level for local labor markets that often
have low populations.

The QWI offers advantages over alternative sources of local economic indicators from the ACS
and QCEW. The ACS contains rich information on the characteristics of workers, but it is drawn
from a one percent sample of the population. Self-reported earnings in low-population areas
further disaggregated by educational attainment and sex can therefore be noisy. In addition, the
ACS was only consistently administered from 2005 onwards, while the QWI offer data for
earlier years, enabling a more robust analysis of labor market outcomes prior to the onset of
fracking. The QCEW provides near-universe data spanning the duration of our study, but it does
not contain any demographic details that are critical for our study.

  The first imputation affects approximately 90% of enrollment in the average Virginia CZ in 2000, 90% of enrollment
in the average Pennsylvania CZ over 2000-04, 8.6% of enrollment in the average New York CZ over 2000-04, and
2.4% of enrollment in the average Ohio CZ over 2000-04. The second imputation is relevant for less than 0.3% of
enrollment in the average CZ in all years except 2012 (4%) and 2015 (7%).



                                                        49
The QWI data do have some limitations which are important to consider in the context of our
analysis. First, because much of the data is collected via a unique federal-state data sharing
collaboration, the years of data availability differ by state. While 14 states in our study have data
available for our entire analysis timeframe (2000-2015), three states (Arkansas, Kentucky, and
Wyoming) are missing some years of data, particularly at the beginning of the study window.
We exclude these states in our analysis, but estimates that include data from all 17 states where
available look similar to those reported in the paper. The table below details the years of data
available in the QWI for the 17 states where at least one CZ overlaps with a major shale play.

                                       QWI Data Availability

                            NM        1995: Q3

Imputations in the published QWI data warrant consideration as well, especially for education-
specific data. QWI documentation states that the vast majority of jobs can be matched to
personal characteristics for sex and age variables (97 percent) and geographic variables (over 90
percent), so imputations are less of a concern for these variables. On the other hand, education
characteristics primarily rely on an imputation model with a statistical match between the Census
and LEHD data using a state-specific logit model that contains age categories, earnings
categories, and industry dummies for individuals age 14 and older who reported strictly positive
wage earnings. Although this method of imputation likely yields estimates that are generally
accurate, it may improperly capture dynamic effects specific to the fracking boom. It also adds
noise to our education-specific estimates (Table 3).

Finally, the format of the publicly available QWI data limits our analysis in a couple minor ways.
First, the online extraction tool for the publicly available QWI data allows for only three separate
ways to tabulate data: by sex and age, by sex and education, and by race and ethnicity. We are
therefore restricted to analyses based on two-way tabulations. Additionally, data suppression
prevents us from undertaking any industry-specific analysis.

Variable Definitions

Note that the QWI is constructed from firm statistics and therefore represents employment and
earnings at the job rather than the individual level. This means that individuals who hold multiple
jobs will be counted multiple times in the measures described below.

Jobs-to-Population Ratio: To construct the jobs-to-population ratio used in our study, we create a
yearly average of the quarterly total employment reported in the QWI and divide that by



                                                 50
population estimates10 corresponding to the sex by age parameters we select in the QWI. The
total employment figure used is defined as the count of people employed in a firm at the
beginning of the quarter, which is more of a stock measure than the alternative: the count of
people employed in a firm any time during the quarter, which is considered more of a flow
measure of jobs. Because this measure is not available until the second quarter of a state’s
reporting, we are able to construct it using only three quarters of data in the first year that data
become available for a state (see table). Overall, this choice does not greatly influence our results
as the event study figures are similar when using total quarterly jobs to construct our preferred
measure.

Earnings: We construct our preferred earnings measure by taking the beginning quarterly payroll
metric in the QWI, dividing by beginning payroll employment to obtain an average quarterly
earnings measure, and dividing by 3 to translate this measure to a monthly figure. We convert to
an annual measure by taking a weighted average across the four quarters, weighting by
beginning of quarter employment in a given quarter. Event study estimates do not meaningfully
differ when using total payroll earnings versus beginning of quarter earnings.11

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil

(based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state (202 of 259 CZs). The unit of
observation is CZ-year-sex. Data on jobs for individuals ages 25 and over are from the 2000-2015 QWI and
correspond to unweighted averages of beginning of quarter figures reported throughout the year; data on the
population ages 25 and over are from SEER; and estimates of education shares in the population ages 25-64 are
from the Census and ACS. Ratios multiply group-specific jobs by group-specific population, estimated as the
product of population and the relevant group share in the population. Cell entries give coefficients (standard
errors) from model 2 (Panels A and B) or a fully-interacted version of model 2 using pooled data (Panel C). All
regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects and time-varying effects of the CZ observables summarized
in Table 1 Panel D. Each CZ is given equal weight in the estimation. Standard errors clustered on CZ are in
parentheses.

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil
play (17 states), with available data from the QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 95th percentile of size
(based on 2000 population) for their state (202 of 259 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Data on
monthly earnings for individuals ages 25 and over are from the 2000-2015 QWI and correspond to unweighted
averages of beginning of quarter figures reported throughout the year. Expected monthly earnings multiply
reported monthly earnings by the group-specific jobs-to-population ratio. Cell entries give coefficients (standard
errors) from model 2 (Panels A and B) or a fully-interacted version of model 2 using pooled data (Panel C). All
regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects and time-varying effects of the CZ observables summarized
in Table 1 Panel D. Each CZ is given equal weight in the estimation. Standard errors clustered on CZ are in
parentheses.

Notes: Underlying sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil play (17 states), with available data from the
QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state (202 of
259 CZs for each outcome except the enrollment-to-population ratio, where there are 200 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-sex. Unless otherwise noted
(Panel B), all regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects, as well as time-varying effectsd of each of the 2000 Census CZ characteristics listed in
Table 1 Panel D. Cell entries give estimated effects on outcomes as of 2011-15 for the average CZ in the estimation sample with any shale reserves, calculated
from model 2 as described in the text. Regressions for dropout rates (columns 3 and 4) are weighted by the number of Census or ACS respondents used to
generate the CZ-year-sex mean dropout rates. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered on CZ.

Notes: Baseline sample consists of the 202 CZs in the 14 of the lower 48 states with any major shale gas or oil play (17 states), with available data from the
QWI for 2000-2015, and between the 5th and 90th percentile of size (based on average population of 17-18-year-olds over 2000-2005) for their state (202 of
259 CZs for each outcome except the enrollment-to-population ratio, where there are 200 CZs). Panels change this estimation sample in various ways, adding 3
states with major shale plays but without QWI data for 2000 (239 CZs), trimming the top and bottom 10% of CZs within each state in the original 14-state
sample (186 CZs), and trimming the top and bottom 5% of CZs within each state in the original 14-state sample (214 CZs). The unit of observation is CZ-year-
sex. All regressions include state-by-year and CZ fixed effects, as well as time-varying effectsd of each of the 2000 Census CZ characteristics listed in Table 1
Panel D . Regressions for dropout rates (columns 3 and 4) are weighted by the number of Census or ACS respondents used to generate the CZ-year-sex mean
