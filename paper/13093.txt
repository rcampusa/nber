This paper analyzes the ownership and governance of the business corporations of New York State
in the 1820s. Using a new dataset collected from the manuscript records of New York's 1823 capital
tax, and from the charters of the corporations, I analyze the ownership structures of the firms, and
investigate the degree to which ownership was separated from control at the time. In contrast to Berle
and Means's account of the development of the corporation, the results indicate that many of the firms
were dominated by large shareholders, who were represented on the firms' boards, and held sweeping
power to utilize the firms' resources for their own benefit. The oppression of minority shareholders
was a significant problem in early corporate governance, and many of the firms configured their voting
rights in a way that curtailed the power of large investors. A positive relationship between firm value
and these voting rights configurations is found among the publicly-traded firms in the sample.

    When did the separation of ownership from control arise in American corporations? Was there

an early period in the development of the American economy in which ownership and control were

unified, and if so, how did the governance of these early corporations function? Such questions are

difficult to answer, given the fragmentary nature of the records that survive from early businesses.

The most influential history of corporate ownership in the United States is presented in Berle and

Means’s The Modern Corporation and Private Property (1932), which argues that legal, organiza-

tional and technological developments in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries eroded

the power and influence of stockholders, and led to the emergence of large, diffusely-held enterprises

controlled by professional managers, or by minority interests. In particular, Berle and Means claim

that in the early nineteenth century, ownership and control were indeed unified, and they distin-

guish the corporations of their time from those of a hundred years earlier, in which “the number

of shareholders was few; they could and did attend meetings; they were business-men; and their

vote meant something.”1 Most of the subsequent literature on corporate governance has accepted

Berle and Means’s characterization of the history of American corporations, and its emphasis on

developments in the late-nineteenth century leading to the separation of ownership from control

(see, for example, Dodd (1938) or Coffee (2001))2 .

    But the early history of American corporations is not well understood. By the end of the

first quarter of the nineteenth century, thousands of businesses in all manner of industries had

been granted corporate charters by American states, and especially beginning in the 1820s, a

small but growing number of these firms had publicly-traded equity shares (Rousseau and Sylla,

2005)3 . This era is generally regarded as a “statistical dark age,” however, and although these

firms were certainly much smaller than the large industrial enterprises that appeared in the late-

nineteenth century, relatively little is known about their ownership or governance.4 With the

noteworthy exception of Werner (1986), who argues that control by management arose even in

the early-nineteenth century, the governance of America’s early corporations has been the focus of

numbers of owners in the 1830s, but claim that these enterprises “stood alone” at the time (pg. 12).

     Roe (1994) and Becht and Delong (2005) complement the analysis of Berle and Means by examining additional
causes of the diffusion of American corporate ownership in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries.
   3
     The total number of business incorporations in the United States for any year after 1800 is not known, but the
data in Davis (1917), Evans, (1948) and Kessler (1948) indicate that well in excess of two thousand businesses were
chartered prior to 1826 in the large but incomplete group of states covered by those volumes.
   4
     The ownership structures of extremely small numbers of early corporations in specific industries, including textile
manufacturing (Davis, 1958), turnpike roads (Majewski, 1996), banks (Wright, 1999), and whaling (Hilt, 2006), have
been documented from the surviving records of individual firms, but even these studies are unable to analyze the
governance of the firms in any detail.

little research. In view of the importance of the historical legal origins of contemporary investor

protections (see, for example, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and Vishny, 1998), this gap in

our understanding of early corporate governance is striking.

      This paper analyzes the ownership and governance of a relatively large sample of early-nineteenth-

century firms, using a newly-collected dataset of all of the business corporations chartered in New

York State through 1825. The main elements of the dataset were collected from the surviving

records generated by New York’s capital tax of 1823-28, which required all operating business cor-

porations to submit a list of their stockholders to the state’s comptroller. Many of these ownership

lists survive in the New York State Archives, and have been matched to the charters of the corpo-

rations; to lists of corporate directors obtained from contemporary newspapers and city directories,

and from surviving directors’ minute books; and to price data of securities traded on the New York

Stock and Exchange Board (NYS&EB), the institution that would later change its name to the New

York Stock Exchange, collected by Sylla, Wilson and Wright (2005). The extensive information in

the dataset enables me to analyze the governance of the firms in some detail.

      In particular, I examine a series of questions relating to the extent of separation between own-

ership and control at the time. The first question is: what rights or protections were offered to

investors in these early corporations, and how did these rights influence the governance of the firms?

Surprisingly, few of the firms were required to produce regular financial statements, and there were

no financial reporting standards of any kind, beyond the common-law prohibition against fraud.

Mandatory dividend payments were also imposed only infrequently. The voting rights specified in

the charters were the most important means by which the stockholders could protect their inter-

ests, and the configurations of voting rights chosen varied considerably. About half of the firms

offered one vote per share to their stockholders, whereas most of the others offered what might

be termed “graduated” voting rights—the number of votes per share an investor was entitled to

was a (weakly) declining function of the number of shares he or she held.5 In order to analyze the

different configurations of votes specified in the charters I develop a simple index of shareholder

voting rights, and analyze how the average values of the index varied across across industries.

      The second question I examine is: to what extent did large shareholders control these corpora-

tions? And what was the relationship between the extent of control by large shareholders, on the

one hand, and the governance institutions specified in the charters, on the other? Although the
  5
    Davis (1917) documents the use of these measures in the earliest American corporations, and Dunlavy (2004)
describes the political rhetoric surrounding their use.



                                                      2
data do indicate the presence of substantial numbers of small investors in many of the corporations,

in general, ownership was highly concentrated, and many firms appeared to have been dominated

by large shareholders. As most large investors were represented on the firms’ boards, the extent

of managerial voting power was extremely high, with on average about 40% of the votes in the

hands of the directors. The oppression of minority investors by large shareholders was therefore a

central concern in the governance of these firms, as with the firms of the mid-nineteenth century

(Lamoreaux and Rosenthal, 2006). In general, firms in the industries with the greatest ownership

concentration specified voting rights with the lowest values of the voting index, whereas firms in

industries where share ownership was most equally distributed specified one vote per share, which

corresponds to the highest value of the index. This suggests that graduated voting rights were

chosen at least in part in order to attract small investors by limiting the voting power of large

shareholders.

    The final question examined in the paper is: how did the protections of investors specified in

the charters, and the concentration of ownership of the shares, influence the market value of the

firms? Although securities price data from the period are perhaps less informative than those of

modern stock markets, as the trading volume was relatively light, the market values of the firms

provide a means to assess the consequences of dominance by large shareholders, or governance

institutions designed to curtail that dominance, for the performance of the firms. The results

indicate a positive correlation between firm values and voting rights provisions that limited the

power of large shareholders, based on analysis of the within-industry variation. Moreover, a strong

negative correlation between the degree of managerial ownership and firm value is found, which is

consistent with insiders expropriating the outside shareholders’ property.

    In general the results indicate that even in the early decades of the nineteenth century, before the

development of large industrial enterprises, and even before the emergence of railroads, there was

significant separation between ownership and control. Berle and Means’s (1932, pg. 70) typology

of control structures is useful in characterizing the results: they distinguish between “(1) control

through almost complete ownership, (2) majority control, (3) control through legal device without

majority ownership, (4) minority control, and (5) management control,” where each type represents

successively greater degrees of separation between ownership and control.6 Although few if any of
   6
     Berle and Means document that 44% of the 200 largest firms of their time were subject to management control
(1932, p. 115). Although their argument has become strongly identified with the consequences of management
control, even in their own sample the majority of firms were not subject to this form of control. Recent research
has also shown that management control is not an accurate description of modern firms in most contries (LaPorta,



                                                       3
the firms in the 1820s could be characterized as subject to management control, where ownership

is so diffuse that no individual or group dominates the corporation through stock ownership, most

of the firms in the dataset would have been characterized by Berle and Means as under minority

control—a group of investors held sufficient numbers of shares to dominate the firm, because the

rest of the shares were diffusely held. The problems associated with this form of control were

much more acute in the 1820s than in later periods, however, because at the time there was little

if any distinction between control and management. Early corporations were in general run by

their directors—there were few hierarchical levels within the firms.7 As there were few if any legal

constraints on self-dealing by directors at the time, an investor who controlled the management of

a firm could easily harness its operations for his own benefit. Conflicts between large shareholders

(insiders) and small shareholders (outsiders) were therefore the central concern in early corporate

governance, and the protections offered to investors at the time were often designed to address

this problem. Overall, the picture of corporate governance in the early-nineteenth century that

develops is one of weak investor protections, and strong ownership concentration—a relationship

entirely consistent with that found in modern economies (La Porta, Lopes-de-Silanes, Shleifer and

Vishny, 2000).

    The sample of corporations analyzed in this paper encompasses a relatively large number of

enterprises in a broad range of industries, and represents the first systematic and consistent dataset

on early corporate governance. But it comes from only one state. American corporation law falls

mostly within the purview of state law, and the statutes and case law pertaining to corporations,

along with the content of corporate charters, differed somewhat across states.8 Nonetheless New

York’s central role in the development of the American economy, and Wall Street’s central role

in America’s financial markets, makes New York’s corporations an appropriate focus for a study

of corporate governance during this period. The early-nineteenth century was a period of rapid

growth and dynamism for New York’s economy: the population of the state increased approximately

fourfold between 1790 and 1825, becoming the nation’s most populous; the city of New York

developed into the preeminent center of business and finance in the United States, surpassing
Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 1999).

     Several works have analyzed the development of the corporation law in particular states, including Massachusetts
(Dodd, 1954), Maryland (Blandi, 1934), New Jersey (Cadman, 1949), and New York (Seavoy, 1982). Although none
of these works provides the detailed tabulations of charter provisions that would be necessary to make systematic
comparisons with the data presented in this paper, New York’s corporation laws do not appear to be idiosyncratic
in any important sense.

Philadelphia; and the completion of the Erie canal in 1825 further invigorated commerce in across

the state.9 Perhaps more importantly, New York was a great innovator in the area of corporation

law, and enacted one of the earliest general incorporation acts of any significance for businesses, the

1811 act for manufacturing companies; the first limited partnership law (1821) and one of the first

free banking laws (1838) in the United States; and several influential regulatory statues, such as the

safety fund law for banks (1829). Many of these statutes influenced the subsequent development

of corporation law in other states; in some cases entire New York statutes were copied wholesale.10

        The next section of the paper presents an analysis of the voting rights configurations specified

in early-nineteenth-century charters, and documents the governance institutions in the charters of

all New York business corporations from the years 1790-1825. Section 2 documents the ownership

structures of the corporations operating in 1826-27. Section 3 investigates the relationship between

the governance institutions chosen by the firms, and their ownership structures. And section 4

presents an analysis of the relationship between the market values and the governance provisions

of the publicly-traded firms in the sample. A detailed description of the sources and methods used

in constructing the dataset is provided in the Data Appendix at the end of the paper.



1        The Charters of New York’s Corporations, 1790-1825

1.1       Historical Background

In the early-nineteenth century, the privileges of corporate status for businesses could only be ob-

tained by petitioning a state government for a charter, which would be granted by legislative act.

Although New York began to liberalize its incorporation process with its 1811 general incorporation

act for manufacturing companies, entrepreneurs in other industries still needed to obtain a special

act of the legislature in order to incorporate. The process of obtaining a charter was often costly

and time consuming, and the use of the corporate form was therefore confined to industries where

incorporation was a legal requirement, as with banks, or where special corporate powers were cru-

cial, as with insurance firms, some manufacturing firms, and public utilities such as turnpike roads,
    9
     New York’s population grew from 340,120 in 1790 to 1,614,458 in 1825 (French, 1860). On the early prominence
of Philadelphia in American finance, see Wright (2005), and Hammond (1957). For a discussion of the development
New York City’s economy during this era, see, for example, Albion (1939), Myers (1931), and Miller (1962).
  10
     For example, New Jersey adopted New York’s 1811 general incorporation act for manufacturing companies with
very few changes in 1816, and considered, but ultimately rejected, adopting an act similar to New York’s 1838 free
banking law in 1839 (Cadman 1949: pg. 21-27). Massachusetts adopted an act appointing commissioners for the
supervision and inspection of banks, similar to some of the provisions in New York’s 1829 safety fund law (Dodd
1954: pg. 276).



                                                        5
bridge companies, and gas light companies. Banks were among the most politically contentious

enterprises at the time, and banking charters were particularly difficult to obtain.11

       If granted, a charter of incorporation would specify the powers available to the firm, the size of

the capital stock and the par value of the shares, and the duration of the corporation’s existence.

The charters also included provisions that regulated the operations of the businesses, which varied

by industry—bank charters, for example, often included provisions that restricted the interest rates

that could be charged on loans, and limited their indebtedness; bridge and turnpike road company

charters dictated the rates of toll that could be charged; and manufacturing charters specified

the types of products the corporation was permitted to produce.12 In general, early corporations

did not have the power to merge with other corporations or in any way amend their charters

without seeking an additional legislative act. And in the years through 1825, none of New York’s

corporations were granted the power to issue any securities other than common stock, and the right

to invest in the stock of other corporations was usually forbidden, except with insurance firms.

       The governance institutions of corporations were prescribed in their charters. Most corporations

were to be managed by an elected board of directors, who would, in turn, elect a president, and

also possibly appoint a secretary or treasurer, from among their members.13 The board would

usually have the authority, by majority rule, to write the corporation’s by-laws, and generally run

the firm.14 The charters sometimes also referred to salaried agents, cashiers, clerks, secretaries,

tellers, and others who would be hired by the directors and might have assumed some managerial

responsibilities. In general, however, most of the firms in industries such as banking, insurance,

and bridges and turnpikes had very few employees,15 and although some of the manufacturing firms
  11
      See Hammond (1957) and Bodenhorn (2006). Many firms resorted to obtaining banking powers through a back-
door route by first incorporating in a different industry, and then lobbying to have banking privileges added to
their charter. Thus the New York Manufacturing Company became the Phoenix Bank, and the New York Chemical
Manufacturing Company became Chemical Bank. The Bank of the Manhattan Company was created by including
some vague and totally unrestrictive language about financial powers in the original 1799 charter of a water company.
   12
      Many authors have ascribed particular importance to these limits imposed on the scope of the enterprise in early
charters, and to the ability of the state legislatures to “safeguard” shareholders by dictating the terms of charters.
See, for example, Berle and Means (1932, p. 131 and 134.) In a related and important work, Roe (1994) argues that
later regulations prohibiting banks and insurance companies from holding securities, motivated by populist politics,
prevented them from becoming powerful blockholders, and thus playing a more effective role in the governance of
nonfinancial corporations.
   13
      For 15 of the corporations, mostly water companies, no board of directors was specified, although even for those
firms some kind of elected office, such as a treasurer, was created.
   14
      The directors’ decision-making rules specified in the firms’ by-laws often had important implications for the firms’
performance. For example, Meissner (2005) found that the voting rules governing loan approval in early banks had
significant effects on the rates of return earned by the banks’ shareholders.
   15
      For example, the directors’ minutes of the Bank of America, the state’s largest bank, indicate that in 1813 it
had only 13 salaried employees, including the president (Citigroup Archives, New York NY.) The directors’ minutes
of turnpike road companies record entries where the directors themselves hire contractors to build the road, co-sign
loans on the firm’s behalf, and supervise the conduct of the gate keepers (Directors Minutes, Albany & Schenectady



                                                            6
did have as many as 300 employees, the management of these enterprises probably had very few

hierarchical levels, and in many cases the directors supervised even the day-to-day operations of

the firms.16

    As in modern firms, the stockholders’ elective franchise was the principal mechanism by which

corporations were governed. For nearly all of the corporations in the sample, the charters required

elections of the entire board—there were no “classified” or staggered boards—to be held annually.17

As we will see, however, stockholders in early corporations enjoyed few other legal protections, and

were usually not even guaranteed the right to see annual financial statements.18 In the absence

of other safeguards, the election of directors assumed preeminent importance for the stockhold-

ers in defending their interests. And the conduct of the elections, including the voting rights of

stockholders, were often specified in great detail in the charters.

    In what was likely an effort to control the power of large shareholders, the voting rights specified

in the charters often did not grant one vote per share, but instead granted a number of votes per

share that was a (weakly) decreasing function of the number of shares held. Attempts to control

the power of large shareholders in this way date back the earliest history of the business corporation

in England (see the examples in Scott, 1912), and some of the voting rights schemes adopted in

New York during this period resemble those devised hundreds of years earlier. The next section

presents a simple analysis of these voting rights schemes, and develops an index of voting rights to

be used in the empirical analysis that follows.


1.2    Voting rights of stockholders

Consider the charter for the Bank of New York, written by Alexander Hamilton. For the election

of directors, it specifies the following:


Turnpike Road, New-York Historical Society, New York NY.)
  16
     An advertisement in the 1826 Longworth’s New York City Directory for the Sterling Company, a manufacturer
of iron goods, boasts of having 350 employees; the 1832 Census of Manufactures lists at least one other firm of that
scale in New York State, the Peru Iron Company. The director’s minutes of manufacturing firms often record the
directors deciding on the purchase of raw materials and equipment, hiring managerial employees and mechanics, and
supervising the sale of output (Directors’ Minutes, Oneida Manufacturing Society, 1820-56, Oneida Historical Society,
Utica NY.) On the development of managerial systems and hierarchies in corporations, see Chandler (1977).
  17
     The possible exception arises from the 1811 general incorporation act for manufacturing companies which did not
explicitly require annual elections of directors. Angell and Ames (1832), the first American treaties on corporation
law, argues that when the charter is silent on this issue, elections can be held “when the occasion requires it” (p. 66).
On staggered boards and firm value in modern firms, see Bebchuck and Cohen (2005).
  18
     The shareholders in a corporation possessed a common-law right to see its books (Angell and Ames, 1832, p.
408), but this right was mostly likely costly or even impossible to enforce in some circumstances.




                                                           7
         each stockholder shall be entitled to a number of votes proportioned to the number
         of shares which he or she shall have held in his or her own name...according to the
         following ratio’s [sic] that is to say, at the rate of one vote for each share not exceeding
         four, five votes for six shares, six votes for eight shares, seven votes for ten shares, and
         one vote for every five shares above ten.19

Such configurations of voting rights, which might be termed “graduated voting rights” schemes,

granted one vote per share when small numbers of shares were held, but then after some threshold,

a shareholder was entitled to less than one vote per share. Some were simpler than that of the

Bank of New York; most turnpike corporations, for example, allowed one vote per share for up to

10 shares, and then one vote for every five additional shares held. Other versions added a maximum

number of votes for any stockholder. But in every case we can think of the charter as specifying a

function, v(n), which determines the number of votes to which an investor holding n shares would

be entitled. For enterprises that chose one vote per share, v(n) = n, but in the charters of many

corporations like the Bank of New York, for values of n above some threshold, v(n) < n.

       The graduated voting rights granted to stockholders in some early-nineteenth-century corpora-

tions were somewhat more complex than the allocations of votes considered in the modern theoret-

ical literature on voting rights (see, for example, Harris and Raviv (1988) and Grossman and Hart

(1988)), because they caused the relative voting power of each shareholder to become an endoge-

nous function of the entire distribution of the shares. In particular, the power of large shareholders

was diminished by these schemes only when small shareholders were also present. For a firm with

stockholders who each hold equal stakes, whether they are large or small, graduated voting rights

will produce exactly the same relative voting power for each stockholder as one vote per share: the

nominal number of votes for each shareholder will be reduced, but each investor’s share of the total

votes will be the same. Only in the presence of small shareholders, who might receive as much as

a full vote per share, is the voting power of large investors diminished. This implies that impact of

graduated voting rights can only be assessed once the distribution of share ownership is known.

       We can, however, construct an index of the potential of a given voting rights configuration to

reduce the power of large shareholders. A simple way to motivate this index is to plot a typical

v(n) function—that is, a function specifying the number of votes a stockholder is entitled to when
                                                             v(n)
n shares are held—and also votes per share, or                n ,   for increasing values of n. Figure 1 plots

v(n) and      n     for two firms, one with one vote per share, labelled v1 (n), and one with a graduated

    New York Laws, 1791, ch. 37. This is similar to Hamilton’s scheme for the voting rights of stockholders in his
proposal for a “National Bank,” in which he also offers an extended analysis and justification of these schemes. See
Davis (1917, p. 324).

voting rights scheme, v2 (n). Both firms are assumed to have a total of N shares. The v2 (n) function

plotted is that employed in most turnpike road companies, and was the most common graduated

voting rights scheme chosen. As panel (a) illustrates, with the graduated voting rights scheme, the

slope of the line representing the number of votes a shareholder is entitled to becomes much flatter

than the line representing one vote per share once a fairly low threshold of holdings is reached. As

panel (b) of the figure makes clear, for a holder of a large block of shares, the number of votes

per share could be substantially reduced by these schemes. In the presence of many shareholders

holding small enough stakes so that they received a full vote for each share they held, the relative

power of a large shareholder would be substantially reduced by this scheme.
                                             v2 (n)
   In panel (b), the area below the            n      line, denoted (B), will be increasing in the number of

votes to which holders of large stakes are entitled. This suggests that the relative fraction of the
                                                        (B)
total area in the figure taken up by (B), or          (A)+(B) ,    could serve as an index of the potential voting

power of large shareholders. Formally, this is calculated as:

                                                          N
                                                        1 X vi (n)
                                                Vi =               .
                                                        N      n
                                                           n=1


The index can assume any value between 0 and 1, and can be thought of as measuring the voting

scheme’s potential to reduce the power of large shareholders; low values of the index signify poten-

tially substantial reductions in relative votes in the presence of small shareholders. Corporations

choosing voting rights with a low value of this index effectively grant more cash flow rights than



                                                           9
voting rights to large shareholders, and more voting rights than cash-flow rights to small share-

holders. Thus these measures have the opposite effect of the “control-enhancing mechanisms” of

founding families identified in some modern corporations (see, for example, Villalonga and Amit,

2006; and LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer, 1999).

       A corporation choosing a voting rights scheme with a low value of the index creates an obvious

incentive for investors to hold their shares in many names other than their own, in order wield a

larger number of votes. Although such behavior was documented among the shareholders of the

Second Bank of the United States—the privately-owned, quasi-central bank charted by the federal

government in 1816, which had a graduated voting rights scheme that was extremely punitive

towards large shareholders (Hammond, 1957)—the extent to which large shareholders circumvented

the voting rights configurations of other business corporations in this way is not known, and will

be investigated in the empirical analysis below.

       Also, to the extent that these measures were not circumvented, their effect on the quality of

management chosen, or firm value, is potentially ambiguous. On the one hand, they clearly limit the

power of large shareholders, and if the expropriation of outside shareholders by insiders who held

large stakes was a common problem, then voting rights that tipped the balance of power toward

small shareholders might have raised the value of the firm. On the other hand, such measures

would insulate the firm from the forces generated by the market for corporate control, and in

particular would make it quite difficult for a large investor to purchase a controlling stake in the

firm. The relationship between the choice of voting rights configuration and firm value will also be

investigated in the empirical analysis below.


1.3      Governance provisions in the charters

From 1790 to 1825, New York State granted charters of incorporation to 812 businesses. The spec-

ifications of voting rights in the charters, along with other governance provisions, are summarized

in table 1. As indicated in the table, in about 80% of the charters, the right to vote by proxy in the

election of directors was guaranteed.20 At the time, proxy votes (like all votes) were cast in person,

so a shareholder wishing to vote by proxy would send another individual in his or her stead.

       The charters sometimes also contained other provisions regulating the composition or the actions
  20
    New York’s courts later held that the right to vote by proxy could only be granted in a charter (Philips v.
Wickham, 1 Paige 590 New York (1829)). Prior to this decision in 1829, the rights of shareholders with respect
to proxy voting, when it was granted by a firm’s bylaws rather than its charter, were uncertain. Dodd (1954), for
example, mentions that the Connecticut courts held in 1812 that bylaws that permitted proxy voting were valid.

 that have a fraction of their capital invested in other industries. The insurance and finance companies include all insurance
 companies, along with the five loan or “lombard” companies that were permitted to make collateralized loans, but were forbidden
 from issuing banknotes. As insurance companies were also permitted to issue loans, in practice these institutions were quite
 similar. The category All Others includes 28 water companies, 18 canals, 4 mutual savings banks, a hotel, 15 steamboat or
 ferry companies, 2 trading companies, 4 gas light companies, a financial exchange, and 11 mining companies.

of the board. For example, the directors were usually (78% of the time) required to own stock in

the firm, and more rarely (4% of the time) imposed a specific local residency requirement for some

or all of the directors. About 40% of the firms’ boards were required to pay out all profits out as

dividends, leaving no discretion over retaining earnings.21 And finally, 14% of the charters required

the management of the firm to produce annual financial statements, either at the shareholders’

annual meeting, or in a filing to the state government.22

       The voting rights of the shareholders were generally specified in precise detail in the charters.

In 48% of them, each share was entitled to one vote, irrespective of the number of shares held. For

46% of the charters, a “graduated” voting rights system was specified. For 2% of the firms, each

shareholder was granted one vote, and, finally, for 4.7% of the firms, the votes of shares were not

specified at all. In the latter case, with no guarantee of voting rights for the shares in the charter,

most corporations likely specified the voting rules for shareholders in their bylaws; indeed, at least
  21
      For another 32% of the firms, their charter stated that it “shall be the duty” of the directors to pay dividends
out of the firms’ earnings, but the directors were given total discretion over the amount.
   22
      Another 0.4% of the firms were required to produce financial statements every three years, and 38% of the
firms, mostly the turnpike road companies, were required to produce a single set of financial statements once they
commenced operations, and then never again.




                                                              11
one charter from the era specified parameters within which the voting rights chosen in the bylaws

must fall.23 For all the firms in the sample where the voting rights of stockholders were specified,

the average value of the voting rights index Vi is .63.

       We can begin to understand the intentions behind the governance provisions in the charters by

comparing those selected in different industries, as in the further columns of table 1, where summary

statistics are presented for six broad industry categories. The columns in the table indicate that

there was substantial variation across industries in the style of governance institutions chosen.24

Manufacturing corporations, for example, almost always granted their investors one vote per share,

only rarely required annual financial statements, and never mandated that all profits had to be paid

out as dividends. Manufacturing firms also had the smallest boards, and imposed the requirement

of share ownership by directors with the lowest frequency. As we will see below, these governance

provisions reflected an ownership structure that was quite different than that commonly found in

other industries.

       In contrast, banks and insurance companies, whose financial powers created ample opportunities

to defraud investors and creditors, and to disrupt the payments system, were the only firms whose

charters mandated annual financial statements with any regularity, and even in these industries

the requirement was imposed only 40% of the time. Firms in these two industries had very large

boards, and the directors were never required to pay out all profits as dividends. The one important

difference between the charters in banking and insurance is in their voting rights: whereas the

average value of the index of voting rights for insurance firms is .96, in banking it is .74, reflecting

the use of some graduated voting rights schemes.

       In turnpike road companies, and to a lesser extent in bridge companies, graduated voting rights

were heavily used, as was the requirement of mandatory dividend payments of all profits.25 Overall

the lowest values of the voting index (reflecting voting rights configurations with the greatest

potential to reduce the power or large shareholders) were found in turnpikes, bridges, and banks.

One might imagine that the charters of firms in these industries were designed to attract the
  23
     Laws of New York, 1826, Ch. 202. New Jersey’s supreme court later held that bylaws could not override a
common law rule of one vote per person when a charter did not specify voting rights (Taylor v. Griswold, 14 N.J.L.
222 (Sup. Ct. 1834)). Ratner (1970), however, argues persuasively that the common law actually had no clear rule
with respect to stockholders’ voting rights. Moreover, Angell and Ames (1832, p. 64) point to cases that held that
corporations were free to regulate their election in bylaws when the charter was silent on the issue.
  24
     Gillan, Hartzell and Starks’s (2006) analysis of a large sample of modern firms identifies somewhat similar
clustering in firms’ choices of governance mechanisms, although they do not link the clusters to the firms’ industries.
  25
     In the case of turnpikes, these outcomes reflect the requirements imposed by the 1807 general regulating act for
that industry; all turnpike companies chartered after 1807 had these provisions imposed on them by the act.




                                                          12
participation of small shareholders by offering them some measure of protection from dominance by

large shareholders. Alternatively, the legislature may have regarded the control of these enterprises,

and in particular the potential for large shareholders to abuse that control, as a matter of public

concern: the route of a turnpike road, the placement of a bridge, and of course the notes or loans

issued by a bank all might have created opportunities for private gain by a dominant shareholder

at the expense of small investors, or the community, in a way that was far less likely to be true of

firms in industries such as manufacturing.


1.4    Other Governance Statutes

The rights of shareholders expressed in the charters were to a limited extent supplemented by statute

laws enacted during the period, but in general the rapid proliferation and increasing sophistication

of corporations outpaced the efforts of the legislature and the courts to protect the interests of

investors. There were, for example, still relatively few statutes governing the behavior of corporate

directors. Moreover, the notion that a corporate charter was a contract between the state and

the firm that could not be impaired, as held by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1819 Dartmouth

College decision, made it difficult for the state to impose measures such as a financial reporting or

inspection requirement on institutions whose charter did not already include such a provision.

    The ability of the state to enforce its statutes was also limited, as the state government had

only skeletal administrative offices. For example, many insurance companies, in violation of the

state’s restraining statutes and also in violation of their charters, issued bonds or notes designed to

circulate as bank notes, offered discount loans, and generally assumed the powers of banks.26 Even

after the restraining statutes were strengthened, and subsequent court decisions removed any doubt

regarding the legality of these actions, the New York Senate’s finance committee found in 1825 that

these practices remained fairly widespread.27 Even on matters that were simpler to monitor, such

as the use of the general incorporation statute, the limits of the law with respect to the industries

within which the firms had to operate were violated, with little apparent consequence.28 And in

other cases, safeguards or regulations were circumvented. Most charters of financial companies, for

example, included a requirement that a minimum amount of capital be paid in before the business

episode.
  27
     Albany Argus, 19 April 1825.
  28
     The statute permitted firms to incorporate in the production of very specific categories of textiles, metals, and
glass. And yet the “Farmers Brewery” was incorporated in Brooklyn in 1817 (Records of the state comptroller, New
York State Archives.)


                                                         13
could commence operations. These regulations seemed to presume that the payments would be

made in specie, but instead such payments were nearly always made notes of various kinds, or

pledged securities.29

    Notwithstanding these limitations, the state did enact a highly significant piece of legislation

in 1825 to protect the rights of shareholders and creditors. The act required that dividends could

only be paid out of firms’ profits; limited the indebtedness (relative to paid-in capital) that any

firm could take on, and made directors personally liable for any indebtedness in excess of this

amount; and imposed rules on the conduct of the election of directors, such as the requirement

that the stock transfer books (which list the shareholders eligible to vote in elections of directors)

be open to inspection.30 In response, a substantial body of case law relating to the election of

directors began to develop, as the courts interpreted this law in the context of different practices

employed by insiders seeking to disenfranchise other shareholders.31 In the following years, the

state’s regulations of corporations became more sophisticated, first in the Revised Statutes of 1828,

which strengthened and expanded the 1825 law, and later with the introduction of the safety fund

law for banks in 1829.

    In many respects, the rights of shareholders in early-nineteenth-century New York were rela-

tively weak: many fraudulent practices in the elections of directors where not made illegal until the

statute of 1825, and even then, the impact of the law took time to evolve; most corporations were

not obligated to present their investors with financial statements; and the state struggled to rein in

corporations that violated even the most politically sensitive laws, such as those regulating entry

into banking. Directors of financial corporations routinely “hypothecated” their shares, meaning

that they used their shares as collateral to borrow from the company and were often its debtors,

rather than investors.32 The shares of many banks and insurance companies were traded on the

New York Stock and Exchange Board, but the exchange itself had no listing requirements at the

time, and did not provide meaningful safeguards for investors. Nonetheless, many corporations
  29
     See the discussion in Hammond (1957). The descriptions of the financial transactions of some companies that
went bankrupt in the New York Evening Post of 22 December 1826 mentions firms where none of the payments were
made in specie.
  30
     Other provisions of the law included many specific regulations of banks, and penalties for violating the terms of
the charter. Laws of New York, 1825, ch. 325.
  31
     Among such practices that the courts took up were directors attempting to use pledged shares to vote (Ex parte
Willcocks 7 Cow 402 New York (1827)) using shares for which they were only trustees to vote (Ex parte Holmes
5 Cow 426 New York (Sup Ct 1826)), and using treasury shares to vote (Ex parte Desdoity 1 Wend 98 New York
(1828)). These practices will be discussed below.

government in the Bank of the United States was immediately hypothecated.

created during the period successfully attracted investments from large numbers of shareholders.

         In the next section, I describe the data collected from the records of New York State’s capital

tax, which will be used to analyze the ownership of these corporations.



2         New York’s Corporations in 1826-27 and Their Ownership

In 1823, the New York legislature passed a law that exempted individuals’ stock holdings from

taxation, and instead levied a tax on the paid-in capital of incorporated companies, payable by

the corporations themselves. The comptroller’s ledgers of corporations, shareholdings, and tax

payments, along with the stockholder lists submitted by many corporations, survive in the New

York State Archives.

         Of the 812 companies granted charters in New York in 1825 or before, the comptroller’s office

found that only 282 were in operation in 1826 or 1827.33 Table 2 presents the industries, reported

paid-in capital, and location of the operating firms. In total, the capital of all operating corporations

was about $48 million, and the state’s 95 banks and insurance companies accounted for about $39

million or 81% of that total. There were 67 manufacturing firms, 63 turnpikes, 36 bridges, and small

numbers of firms in other industries such as gas lighting, steamboats, and water works. The data in

the table indicate that there was significant variation in the average sizes of the corporations across

industries, with the largest companies in banking and finance, and the manufacturing corporations

and turnpikes and bridges much smaller.

         Turning to the lower panel of the table, of these 282 corporations, 74 (26%) were located in New

York City, and they had total capital of $34 million, or about 71% of all corporations’ capital—

a consequence of the fact that most of New York City’s firms were large banks and insurance

companies. In general, the remaining counties with significant numbers of corporations were located

either along the Hudson river, or in the counties in the central part of the state touched by the

Erie Canal, such as Oneida.


2.1        Ownership

For 132 of the 282 operating corporations, the complete list of their shareholders was found for

at least one year, and for 246, the geographical distribution of their shares aggregated by county
    33
     The comptroller’s records include many firms that filed reports in 1826 and not 1827, and vice versa. Although
in a few of the former cases it is clear that the firms went bankrupt in 1826, in most such cases the comptroller’s
office did not know the reason for the missing report. Therefore all companies that filed in either year are included.

was found. Most of the stockholder lists are for the year 1826, although a small handful are from

other years. In that year, the equity of 63 firms was traded on the New York Stock and Exchange

Board; all but one of these publicly-traded firms operated in New York City (with one in Brooklyn),

and all but four were banks and insurance companies.34 This market almost certainly facilitated

substantially greater diffusion of the shares of the listed companies.

      Some summary statistics of these data are presented in table 3. There was an enormous degree

of variation in ownership structures across firms. The number of owners ranged from 560 (Bank

of America, capital $2 million) to just 3 (Athens Turnpike Company, capital $8,000). On average,

the corporations had about 74 shareholders, which implies that at least some small stakes were

commonly held. The surnames of the shareholders reveal that kinship ties may have been important

in the allocation of shares; for 26% of investors in each corporation, there was another investor in

that corporation with the same surname. The average firm’s equity was owned in 5 counties, with

34% owned in New York City, and 10% owned outside of New York State. Certainly a fair number

of shareholders lived far away from the businesses in which they invested, and very likely had no

contact with or involvement in their day-to-day operations.

      Looking across the different industries, those with the largest firms, such as banks and insurance,

had the largest numbers of shareholders, and their ownership was also the most geographically

dispersed. The wide ownership of banks and insurance companies was probably also due in part to

the appeal of the equity of these often consistently-profitable firms to a broad range of investors, who

could trade shares in these companies through brokers on the stock exchange in New York City.

Moreover, firm size clearly was not the only determinant of ownership diffusion: manufacturing

firms, which were on average much larger than either turnpike companies or bridge companies, had

by far the smallest numbers of shareholders. Almost all of the manufacturing enterprises in the

dataset could be considered “close corporations,” with very illiquid shares that traded only rarely,

held in large blocks by local investors.35

       The table also includes two measures of the degree of concentration of ownership: the total frac-

tion held by the top 10% of investors, and also the Gini coefficient of shareholdings. These measures

are presented both for cash flow rights (percentage of the shares held) and voting rights, calculated

from the entire distribution of shareholdings according to the voting configuration specified in the

charter. On average, most firms had a few very large shareholders, with the top 10% holding 48%

of the shares. The firms with the most equally distributed shares were in manufacturing, and
  35
    The surviving stock ledgers of manufacturing companies record relatively few transactions. For example, the
Whitestown Cotton and Wollen Manufacturing Company had 15 shareholders in the mid-1820s, and from the inception
of the firm in 1812 until the end of the ledger in 1827, a total of 34 people held shares at some time. Many of the
transfers that did occur were between family members (Stock Ledger, Oneida County Historical Society, Utica NY.)



                                                              17
the most unequally distributed were in banking, turnpikes, and some of the firms included in the

“other” category. The effect of the voting rights configurations chosen in the different industries on

the power of large shareholders can be seen by comparing the measures of inequality in cash flow

rights with those of voting rights. In nearly all industries except manufacturing, where one vote

per share was nearly always chosen, the voting rights of large shareholders was curtailed at least

somewhat. In particular, in banks and turnpikes, the voting rights configurations chosen reduced

the power of large shareholders substantially. This finding implies that many investors were willing

to hold stakes in firms well in excess of the voting rights they would be granted. Even if they did

circumvent the effects of the firms’ voting rights by holding shares in more than one name, they

apparently did not do so enough to ensure that their voting power was undiminished.


2.2    Managerial Ownership and Corporate Control

A crucial element in understanding the ownership structure of these firms, and the extent of sep-

aration between ownership and control, is the degree of managerial ownership. Unfortunately, the

lists of shareholders submitted pursuant to New York’s capital tax did not identify the directors of

the firms, and were simply signed by the corporate secretary or president. An extensive search of

contemporary newspapers and city directories was therefore undertaken, and eventually the lists of

directors for 51 of the corporations were obtained, and matched to a shareholder list.36 The corpo-

rations for which a directors list could be found through this approach were overwhelmingly located

in New York City (43 of 51 firms), and tended to be institutions of a “public” character, such as

insurance companies, banks, and large manufacturing companies. If the relationship between firm

size and managerial ownership of the twentieth century holds for this period, then the extent of

managerial ownership in the large firms for which directors lists could be found is probably close

to a lower bound for overall managerial ownership.37

    Moreover, unlike the proxy statements of modern public firms, where the shares “beneficially

owned” or controlled by management are precisely enumerated, the shareholder lists from the

1820s do not identify shares that a director might have controlled or voted, but that he did not

own directly. For example, some contemporary accounts mention the practice of shareholders
  36
     Many corporations at the time listed their directors in advertisements or solicitations, and the results of elections
of directors were sometimes reported in newspapers. These findings were supplemented with a few lists of directors
obtained from the minute books of directors’ meetings held in various archives. See the Data Appendix.
  37
     The extent of managerial ownership, and the relationship between ownership and firm size, is documented in
Holderness, Kroszner, and Sheehan (1999).




                                                           18
“giving their proxies to officers of banks,” or essentially delegating their votes to the management

itself.38 There is no way to know how common such voting agreements were, as no such agreements

were identified on the shareholder lists. Similarly, some corporations, particularly insurance firms,

held relatively large stakes in other corporations, and it was often the case that a director of the

insurance firm was also a director of the corporation in which the insurance firm held a stake. In

compiling the directors’ shareholdings, I assumed that the shares owned by any corporations in

which a shareholder was a director would be voted by that shareholder.

       Often the lists of stockholders included trusts, where one or more of the directors were trustees.

Consistent with the treatment of shares owned by corporations, and with contemporary accounts,

I assumed that the directors would vote those shares. However, in many cases these shares were

actually treasury shares or shares forfeited by investors who never paid in the amounts they sub-

scribed for. In principle, these shares should not have entitled their trustees to any votes. And yet

the contemporary case law indicates that the shares in such trusts, which often constituted large

or even majority blocks of shares, were voted by the directors of the firm.39 Consider the example

of the Tradesmen’s Insurance Company. At its founding in 1825, a group of seven investors, one

of whom was the president of a New Jersey bank, subscribed to a majority of the shares. This

acquisition was financed through a “stock note” issued by the bank: the bank took the shares as

collateral, and the company was given deposit credit at the bank equal to that amount. When

some of the other bank directors objected to the transaction and refused to accept checks drawn

by the Insurance Company on its account, the transaction was eventually reversed, and the shares

were returned to the company. But rather than acknowledging that the shares had effectively never

been paid in, the directors placed the shares in a trust, with the president of the company and

two other directors as trustees. As the nominal owners of the stock, they voted the shares.40 And

because the shares in the trust accounted for 1,582 of the company’s 4,000 total shares, the votes of

these shares, when added to those of the shares owned directly by the board (511), gave them 52%

of the votes of the firm (the firm’s charter specified that each share was entitled to one vote). In

most cases, however, it is not possible to observe whether the directors actually voted those shares,
  38
      New York Daily Advertiser, 4 June 1819.
  39
      In some cases the shares were not held within a trust, but were instead held in the name of the president of the
company, or the company itself. For example, the 1826 stockholder list for the United States Fire Insurance Company
lists John L. Bowne, its president, as the owner of 189 shares, but then also lists “John L. Bowne, President” as
owner of 966 shares. (New York State Archives, Albany NY.)
   40
      These votes were later held to be illegal (Ex parte Holmes 5 Cow 426 New York (Sup Ct 1826)), but this practice
seems not to have been unusual.

so there is a danger that the managerial ownership data presented below may overstate the stake

held by the directors somewhat, if they in fact did not vote shares held in this way.

    With these caveats in mind, the data for managerial ownership are presented in table 4. The

data indicate that on average, ownership by the directors was extremely high, with 28% of the

shares held directly, and 14% held indirectly, either through corporations, partnerships or trusts,

for a total ownership stake of 42%. Given the firms’ voting rights configurations, these stakes

entitled the directors on average to 39% of the total votes of their firms. Compared to mean

ownership of about 13% and 21% for American public corporations in 1935 and 1995, respectively

(Holderness, Kroszner, and Sheehan, 1999), the extent of managerial shareholding in the 1820s was

much higher. The levels of management ownership during the period are similar to those of modern

firms in the first year after their IPO, which is about 38% (Helwege, Pirinsky, and Stulz, 2007).

    In order to assess the relative power of management’s voting stake, the percentage of all of the

votes controlled by holders of 5% or more of the stock who were not on the board was also calculated.

As these large blockholders had the greatest incentive to monitor the performance of management,

and to vote their shares, they were the mostly likely check on management’s power. On average,

these blockholders controlled 7% of the firms’ votes, meaning that the margin of managerial control

was 32%. Many of the firms might have been characterized by Berle and Means as under minority

control, as the stake held by insiders was large enough to be unchecked by any outside investors.

    The data presented in table 4 also indicate that there was substantial variation across industries


                                                               20
in the degree of managerial ownership in the firms. The directors of manufacturing firms held

enormous stakes, with 64% of the shares in total, but as the ownership of the shares was evenly

distributed among a small number of shareholders, many of the investors not on the board also held

large stakes, and the total votes of outside blockholders was 21%. In these firms, many of which

could be characterized as controlled by almost complete ownership, there was barely any separation

of ownership from control. In contrast, the management of turnpikes and banks held much smaller

stakes, and were entitled to around 20% of their firms’ votes. The directors of insurance firms held

39% of their firm’s shares, and nearly half of that was due to shares held indirectly, either through

corporations (usually other insurance firms) or shares held in trusts.

         Although one might be tempted to interpret the high degree of insider ownership as consistent

with strong managerial incentives, and perhaps good governance, it is likely that the opposite

was true. Directors in early-nineteenth-century corporations held sweeping powers to utilize their

firms’ resources for their own benefit and engage in self-dealing; bank directors, for example, were

commonly the largest borrowers from their own firms.41 The comfortable margin control over the

firms’ votes held by insiders implies that these firms were operated by managers who were not

accountable to outside shareholders, and also had the authority to utilize their firms’ resources for

their own benefit.

         The next section of the paper analyzes the connection between the governance provisions se-

lected in the corporate charters, and the ownership and control of the firms.



3         Ownership and Governance: Empirical Analysis

Which configuration of voting rights was chosen for firms with small shareholders? And perhaps

more importantly, what was the effect of different voting rights on the extent of control of the

corporations by large shareholders or directors? By examining the variation in the ownership

structures and voting rights configurations both between and within industries, the nature of the

relationship between the two can be better understood.

         Looking across industries presents some striking contrasts. For example, if we compare the

manufacturing firms to the banks and turnpike companies, clear differences in their ownership and

governance “styles” emerge. Manufacturing firms had relatively few shareholders, the most equally
    41
    On insider lending by banks, see Lamoreaux (1994). Rules governing self-dealing by directors first appeared in
New York’s revised statues of 1829, which limited total loans to directors to one third of a firm’s paid-in capital
(Revised Statutes, Title 2, Article 1.)

distributed ownership, and the greatest degree of managerial ownership. They essentially had no

small investors, and did not bother with the requirements of producing accounting statements or

mandatory dividend payments, or with graduated voting rights schemes. The shares were owned

in large blocks, and each investor had a strong incentive to monitor the performance of the firm.

       In contrast, banks and turnpike companies had much larger numbers of shareholders, the most

unequally distributed ownership, and the lowest degree of managerial ownership. Firms in these

industries often utilized graduated voting rights schemes, probably in an effort to offer small share-

holders some protection from the power of large shareholders. And they had larger boards, perhaps

as a means to increase the representation of different interests in the governance of the firm.

       The other major industries in the dataset, bridge companies and insurance companies, lie some-

where in between the extremes represented by manufacturing companies, on the one hand, and

banks and turnpikes, on the other. Their degree of ownership concentration and numbers of stock-

holders were certainly within the middle range of that spectrum.

       These comparisons across industries suggest the the degree of ownership concentration was

negatively related to the voting rights index chosen: firms in industries with unequally-distributed

shares tended to configure their voting rights in a way that diminished the power of large investors.

One might imagine that these firms would also offer other governance provisions designed to better

represent or protect small investors as well. But as this regularity observed between industries

might be due to other industry characteristics, a more persuasive test of this relationship would

focus on the within-industry variation in these measures. The ownership structure and governance

institutions of the firms, of course, were jointly endogenous, so the results presented below should

be interpreted as a descriptive analysis of the correlations in the data, rather than identification

of a causal relationship. But within-industry comparisons nonetheless shed important light on the

nature of the relationship between ownership structures and governance institutions.

       Therefore, I analyze these relationships in the context of a regression framework, which includes

firm characteristics as controls, as well as industry fixed effects. The number of years a firm had

existed would likely influence its ownership: over time, one might expect that the founders of the

firm, and other early investors, would gradually sell shares to new investors.42 Certainly the size

of firms might affect these measures as well. Therefore, in what follows, I regress measures of

ownership structures on measures of governance provisions, and firm size and age. Specifically, for
  42
   Field and Hanka (2001), for example, document this phenomenon among the managers of modern firms that go
public.

where Vi is the voting rights index; xi is a vector of firm characteristics, including other governance

provisions; and the industryik terms are a series of six indicator variables for each industry in the

sample. A table of summary statistics for all the variable included in the regressions is included in

the data appendix.

    The results for the ownership stakes and voting power of large shareholders, and measures of

the diffusion of ownership, are presented in table 5. In column (1), the degree of concentration of

ownership, measured by the percentage of the shares held by the top 10% of the investors, is the

dependent variable. Although the comparisons between industries suggest that ownership concen-

tration should be negatively correlated with the voting rights index, the results of this regression



                                                               23
indicate that there was no within-industry relationship between voting rights and ownership con-

centration. This also at least suggests that graduated voting rights schemes did not cause the

distribution of shares to become more equal, and also that they did not cause widespread efforts

by large shareholders to circumvent these schemes by holding shares in multiple names. Evidently,

investors were willing to hold stakes that were large enough to be penalized by graduated voting

rights schemes.

   The results in column (2), where the voting rights (as opposed to ownership stakes) of the top

10% of shareholders is the dependent variable, therefore follow immediately: firms that selected

voting rights schemes schemes that limited the power of large investors imposed them on essentially

the same distribution of ownership, resulting in much lower voting rights for the largest shareholders.

The regressions in columns (3) and (4) investigate whether lower values of the voting rights index

were associated with more diffuse ownership, either in the form of a larger number of owners, or

in a wider geographical distribution of the shares. In both cases, the variation in the voting rights

index within industries does seem to be associated with somewhat greater diffusion; a one-standard-

deviation increase in the voting rights index was associated with a reduction equivalent to about

15% of a standard deviation in both the log of the number of owners, and the log of the number

of counties in which the shares were held. Note that this is consistent with small, potentially more

distant shareholders expressing a preference for investments in firms with lower values of the voting

rights index, but it is also consistent with shareholders holding their stakes in multiple names when

graduated voting rights were chosen. Somewhat clearer evidence of the latter is found in column

(5), where the dependent variable is the percentage of the shareholders whose surname is the same

as that of another shareholder. If investors tried to circumvent graduated voting rights schemes by

holding their stakes in the names of others, it would have been convenient to hold them in the names

of relatives. And indeed this seems to have been the case, although the effect is extremely small:

the parameter estimates indicate that a one-standard-deviation increase in the voting rights index

was associated with a decrease equal to 3% of a standard deviation of the degree of commonality

of the shareholders’ surnames.

   Interestingly, in each of the regressions for the degree of diffusion of ownership, there is a robust

association between the number of members of the board, and the degree of diffusion. Evidently

larger boards were specified for firms with greater numbers of investors, and less concentrated

ownership. But perhaps in an indication of the low quality of financial reporting at the time, there

was no correlation between requirements to produce financial statements annually, and the degree

of ownership diffusion.

    Results for regressions estimating the relationship between governance provisions and manager-

ial ownership are presented in table 6. The sample used in these regressions is considerably smaller,

and in the remaining observations there is no within-industry variation in the use of dividend re-

quirements, so that regressor is dropped. The estimates tell a slightly different story than those in

table 5: higher values of the voting rights index were associated with greater degrees of managerial

ownership, and amplified the voting power of their larger stakes. Although outside 5% blockholders

also had a larger share of the votes, the margin of managerial control was much higher for firms

with higher levels of the index. Thus, even though the overall degree of ownership concentration

did not vary with the voting rights chosen, the degree of managerial ownership and control did,

and strongly: a one-standard-deviation increase in the voting rights index was associated with an

increase in managerial voting power of about 45% of a standard deviation.

4    Empirical Analysis: Firm Values

Assessing the impact of the ownership and governance data presented above for small investors or for

the performance of the firms is difficult. It is likely that the management and/or large blockholders

of some of the corporations in the dataset were essentially unaccountable to the other investors,

and the governance institutions specified in the charters of these enterprises played some part in

determining the extent of the balance of power between insiders and outsiders. But ultimately

the question of interest is: how did this balance of power affect the performance of the firms?

The absence of any financial reports or accounting data for most of the firms certainly presents

challenges for any attempt to address this question.

    One avenue for investigation that is available is to analyze the market values of the publicly-

traded corporations within the sample. In 1826, the year of most of the shareholder lists in the

dataset, the shares of about 63 New York corporations were traded with some regularity on the

New York Stock and Exchange Board (NYS&EB).43 These were all shares of common stock, and

although newspapers did not report trading volumes until around 1828, contemporary accounts

suggest that the market for many corporate securities was quite liquid.44 Thus the reported price

data of these markets might reasonably be interpreted as informative of the market’s assessments

of the firms. Weekly prices of all equities that traded regularly on the NYS&EB were recorded

from contemporary newspapers by Sylla, Wilson and Wright (2005), and these data were matched

to the companies in the dataset.

    The NYS&EB price data present at least two challenges for the researcher attempting to use

them in this way. First, although most modern research on firm value uses measures of Tobin’s

Q as the focus of the analysis (eg, Morck, Shleifer, Vishny, 1988; Gompers, Ishii, Metrick, 2003),

the NYS&EB data can not be used to construct a measure of Q, as there is no data available on

the value of the firms’ liabilities. The prices quoted in transactions and reported in the press are

expressed as a percentage of par value, or what would have been considered the book value of the
   43
      From time to time, a transaction involving the shares of other, more obscure New York companies’ equity were
reported in the papers, but these were extremely rare and do not appear in the Sylla, Wilson and Wright (2005)
dataset. In addition, the shares of a handful of corporations from other states, especially New Jersey, were traded
regularly on the NS&EB, as was the stock of the Second Bank of the United States, and many bond issues of the
state, local, and federal governments.
   44
      On the issuance of preferred stock by railroads in the 1840s, see Evans (1929). NYS&EB trading volumes were
first reported in the New York Journal of Commerce in 1828; prior to that date many prominent New York papers
reported prices but not volumes. On the history of the New York Stock Exchange and for early trading volume data,
see Werner and Smith (1991).

shares.45 Thus the data can be interpreted as an approximate measure of the ratio of the market

value of equity to the book value of equity.

       Secondly, many shares traded infrequently. Figure 2 presents a time series plot of the prices of

four stocks of varying degrees of liquidity. Whereas for Merchants Bank and the New York Gas

Light Company, transactions are recorded in most weeks, for the Bank of New York, and to a

much greater extent for Aetna Insurance, there are many weeks or even entire months when the

shares did not trade. Nevertheless, there are distinct differences in the average value of these firms

over the course of the year, and the empirical analysis that follows will use the annual average

values calculated from the weeks where transactions were recorded.46 But to address the problem

that some firms may have recorded transactions only in particular months of more buoyant (or

perhaps more depressed) conditions in the market, the analysis will include indicator variables for
  45
      At the time, the accounting treatment of par value was that it was equal to what would now be called contributed
capital; a firm’s “capital stock” was equal to the par value of its shares multiplied by the Student
                                                                                                numberVersion   of Any

retained earnings were considered liabilities, so this notion of the capital stock was considered the book value of the
firm’s equity.
   46
      The relative stability of the firms’ values over time is consistent with the the model of Jin and Myers (2006),
which finds that in opaque firms with poor corporate governance and weak investor protections, insiders may absorb
firm-specific risks through their efforts to capture part of the value of the firm. In their model insiders become the
residual claimants, and the stock held by outsiders becomes more like preferred shares.

the months of the year in which transactions were recorded.

    The relationship between the firms’ values, and their governance provisions, is analyzed in a

simple framework that focuses on the within-industry variation. Regressions of the following form

will be estimated:

                                                        P                      P
                     M B i = α0 + α1 Vi + xi β +            j δj monthij   +      k    φk industryik + ui ,


where M B i is firm i’s average market-to-book ratio for 1826; Vi is the index of the firm’s voting

rights; xi includes firm characteristics such as the size of its capital stock, and its age; the monthij

terms are a series of 12 indicator variables equal to 1 for each month of the year in which there

was at least one transaction recorded for the firm’s stock; and the industryik terms are a series of

6 indicators for the firms’ industries. In subsequent specifications measures of ownership will be

substituted for the voting rights index in the regression.

    The results are presented in table 7. Although the sample size is extremely small, and becomes

smaller when the ownership variables are included in the regression, some clear patterns emerge.

First, as shown in column (1), firms that offered voting rights that limited the voting power of

                                                              28
large shareholders had higher values, compared to other firms in the same industry. The size of

the coefficient indicates that a one-standard-deviation increase in the voting rights index would

reduce the firm’s market-to-book value by 25% of a standard deviation. The reason for this simple

reduced-form relationship is suggested in columns (2)-(4), where ownership data are included in the

regression. Each of the measures is negatively related to firm value, and in particular the ownership

stake of management has a strongly negative relationship with firm value. This is consistent with

insiders wielding control of their corporations for their own purposes and expropriating outsiders,

and reducing the value of their firms. However, it may also be due to the market’s perceptions of

the quality of firms’ capital: if investors knew that the capital stock was paid in using stock notes or

other illiquid or risky financial instruments, this would have been reflected in the firms’ valuations.

If high levels of insider ownership or high levels of the voting index were negatively correlated with

the quality of contributed capital, then this could also produce the same correlations.



5    Discussion and Conclusion

The business corporation found widespread adoption in the first three decades of the nineteenth

century, as firms in a range of industries received corporate charters. This paper has used data

from New York’s capital tax of the 1820s to analyze the ownership and governance of many of these

early firms.

    One immediate conclusion that can be drawn from the results of this paper is that well before

the emergence of the large industrial enterprises with tens of thousands of shareholders described

by Berle and Means, ownership and control were quite commonly separated. In the 1820s, corpo-

rations were much smaller, and had far fewer shareholders, than the firms of the late-nineteenth

century, but they suffered from this problem nonetheless. The extent of separation of ownership

from control varied significantly across industries, and moreover what Berle and Means would call

“managerial control,” where ownership is so diffuse that professional, salaried managers effectively

hold unchecked power, was probably quite uncommon. But “minority control,” where firms were

operated by managers holding stakes that were large enough to make them unaccountable to the

other shareholders, was quite common. And many of the governance institutions of the firms at

the time were configured to help mitigate this problem.

    Early-nineteenth-century firms utilized a variety of means to offer protections to their investors

and make their stock more attractive to small shareholders. Some specified graduated voting rights


                                                  29
in their charters—configurations of voting rights where the number of votes a stockholder was

entitled to decreased with the number of shares he owned. In response to an effectively punitive

voting rights structure, in which the voting power of large blockholdings was strongly reduced, large

investors did not, apparently, reconfigure their shareholdings to a large extent, but held stakes with

severely diminished voting power. Evidently the gains attained from the protections offered to

small shareholders outweighed the costs. Such voting rights schemes were associated with lower

managerial ownership, and higher firm values.

   Another conclusion that follows from the results of this paper is that the early evolution of

the corporation was not a single process, but several processes occurring in parallel. Banks and

insurance companies, for example, attracted large amounts of capital from a broad and diffuse

base of investors, and their governance institutions were configured to facilitate this arrangement.

Manufacturing firms, on the other hand, were quite closely held, with a few local investors holding

large stakes, and effectively had no “small investors” at all. Over the course of the nineteenth cen-

tury, with the rise of mass production, more integrated national markets, and other developments,

manufacturing firms grew considerably in scale, and their ownership and governance evolved as

well, whereas banks and other financial corporations continued to be subject to strict limits on

their size and on the scope of their activities (see Roe, 1994).

   Finally, the results of this paper suggest some important questions to be investigated in later

periods, as the corporation continued to evolve. For example, the extent of managerial ownership

of 1820s corporations was extremely high by modern standards. At what point did managerial

ownership begin to fall, and what developments were responsible for this change? Similarly, the

United States is often described as having some of the best investor protections of any country in

the world, and the least concentrated corporate ownership as a result. Certainly the level of investor

protections offered in the early-nineteenth century were much weaker—but how these protections

evolved across states and over time is far from clear. Answers to such questions will help place the

findings of this paper in their historical context.

Data Appendix

The Charters

812 charters of incorporation were granted to businesses in New York prior to 1826. The 659
charters granted via special act of the legislature were found and coded from New York’s session
laws (Laws of New York, 1790-1825.) A substantial fraction of these charters were subsequently
amended, often to increase the capital stock. The dataset includes the terms of the charters as
amended as of 1825. For the 153 firms incorporated under New York’s 1811 general incorporation
act for manufacturing firms, the certificates of incorporation were found in the records of the New
York State Comptroller in the New York State Archives, Albany NY (record group A1859).


New York’s 1823 Capital Tax and the Shareholder Lists

In 1823, New York levied a tax on the paid-in capital of incorporated companies, payable by the
corporations themselves (Laws of New York, 1823, Ch. 262). The law was revised in 1824 and
again in 1825 in response to difficulties encountered in its implementation (Laws of New York,
1824, Ch. 22; 1825, Ch. 254.) The evolution of these laws, and the difficulties encountered in their
implementation, are discussed in the report of the comptroller on the taxation of incorporated
companies (New York Assembly Journal, 1827, p. 538-549). The law required that all incorporated
companies submit a list of the names, places of residence, and numbers of shares owned, for all
stockholders, to the state comptroller, so that revenues could be distributed to county governments
in proportion to the amount of stock owned in each county. The law remained in effect until 1828,
when it was replaced with a simpler capital tax on corporations that did not provide for revenue
distribution on the basis of local shareholdings (New York Revised Statutes, 1828, chapter 13, title
4).

The lists of stockholders submitted by the corporations pursuant to the tax law were found in
various different record groups in the New York State Archives associated with the comptroller’s
office, including A0833, A0829, and A0847. The comptroller’s ledgers of taxes paid by incorporated
companies pursuant to the law, and amounts allocated to the different counties on the basis of the
residences of their shareholders, were found within record group A1301; the ledgers recording the
results of the comptroller’s attempts to determine whether chartered corporations were in operation
were found in record group A1204. The comptroller’s records indicate that compliance with the law
was initially low, but by 1826 most of the corporations believed to be in operation were submitting
the required stockholder lists. As a stockholder list could be found for at least one year for less
than half of the 282 operating corporations; this implies that most of these lists have not survived.
Although the staff at the New York State Archives can not be certain about the reason for these
losses, they have indicated that the fire at the state library in 1911, coupled with the destruction
of many historical records by the state archivist in the 1950s, are the likely causes. In an effort
to expand the scope of the dataset, an extensive search of various archives in New York State was
undertaken to try to find duplicate copies of the stockholder lists that may have been retained by
the corporations themselves in their correspondence files. A small number of these shareholder lists
found in the New York State Historical Association, Cooperstown NY, and the Citigroup Archives,
New York NY.

Managerial Ownership Data

Lists of directors were found by searching all New York City and many New York State newspapers
where issues from the year 1826 survive. The newspapers in which the identities of directors were
found were the Albany Argus, New York Evening Post, New York Enquirer, New York American,
Journal of Commerce, and the New York Commercial Advertiser. In addition, city directories for
New York and Albany contained a few lists of directors. These were supplemented with lists of
directors found in the minute books of corporations held a the following institutions: Citigroup
Archives, New York NY; Oneida County Historical Society, Utica NY; SUNY Albany Library,
Albany NY; the New York State Historical Association, Cooperstown NY; and the New-York
Historical Society, New York NY.
