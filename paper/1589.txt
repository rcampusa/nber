                                 ABSTRACT




   A model of interest rate movements in response to new information on

the money stock is developed.      The model, which incorporates several

earlier approaches as special cases, makes explicit the manner in which

estimated interest rate responses to money surprises depend on the rela-

tive variances of nominal and   real   disturbances, as well as on the moxie-

tary authority's policy and the credibility of that policy.

I.   Introduction


     Recent empirical evidence leaves little doubt that anticipated real

rates of return on a wide variety of assets are affected by the Federal

Reserve's weekly release of its latest estimates of the money supply.

The positive co-movements of nominal interest rates and the value of the

dollar, together with the negative co-movements of nominal interest

rates and both commodity and stock prices are inconsistent with the hy-

pothesis that the responses are solely due to variations in the expected

rate of inflation.2 Lagging behind the accumulation of empirical evi-

dence has been the development of theoretical models which are capable

of explicitly modelling the determinants of the response coefficients

measured in the empirical work. The need for such explicit models is

particularly important given the apparent shifts in parameters which the

empirical work has found to coincide with changes in Federal Reserve

policy.3


     While several heuristic explanations for the asset price responses to

money announcements have been offered (     Cornell   (1983) provides a survey

),   all   the existing models in this area have tended to treat only a sub-

set of the competing hypotheses.         For example, Urich (1983), Walsh

(1983), Nichols, Small, and Webster (1983), Roley and Walsh (1983), and

Campbell (1984) construct models of weekly interest rate determination

under the assumption that the aggregate price level is fixed. These

models have focused on the interest rate responses as real rate respon-



                                     —1—
ses to changes in expected future money demand relative to expected fu-

ture money supply.


   Roley and Walsh (1983) also construct a flexible price model in which

all observed interest rate movements are due to revisions in expected

inflation. Loeys (1983) incorporates sluggish price adjustment by as-

suming prices are fixed for a constant number of periods and completely

flexible thereafter. Engle and Frankel (1984) and Hardouvelis (1985)

also model the sluggish adjustment of the aggregate price level in mod-

els of the joint response of interest rates and exchange rates to money

surprises. However, they assume the equilibrium price level is deter-

mined by purchasing power parity and that uncovered interest parity

holds. By further taking the foreign price level and nominal interest

rate to be constant, the relevance of their models to an understanding

of the short-run response of U.S. interest rates to weekly announcements

of the U.S. money stock may be questioned.         In addition, neither of

these two models explicitly characterizes the behavior of the Federal

Reserve, a   factor   emphasized in most of the literature in this area.


   Engle and Frankel (1984) and Hardouvelis (1985) also assume the

long-run equilibrium real rate of interest is constant. Any movements

of distant future rates must therefore, by definition, be due to changes

in expected inflation, and they cannot analyze the real activity hy-

pothesis as modelled by Siegel (1985). Under this hypothesis, a money

announcement provides information on real shocks to the economy which

produce changes in the long-run equilibrium real rate of interest.

    The present paper develops a specific model of the interest rate re-

 sponse to the new information contained in the weekly money announce-

 ment. The extent to which interest rates adjust to new information on

 the money. stock is shown to depend on the monetary authorityts policy

behavior, as well as the credibility of its policy, the properties char-

acterizing the behavior of the aggregate price level, and the variance

of nominal disturbances relative to real disturbances.




II. The Model


   Since an interest rate such as the federal funds rate with only a one

day maturity responds to money announcements,' it is useful to base a

model of the announcement effect on a model of the market for bank re-

serves. Suppose that the demand for reserves by banks    arises   from the

existence of a binding reserve requirement on deposits. Under lagged

reserve accounting, as was in effect over the sample period used in most

of the empirical studies cited earlier,   rr k + m2, where rr is the
log of required reserves during week t and m_2 is the log of the money

supply during week t-2.5


   The supply of reserves consists of nonborrowed reserves
                                                             (NBRt) plus
borrowed reserves (BRt).   Equilibrium in the market for reserves re-

quires banks to be satisfied with the composition of total reserves be-

tween borrowed and nonborrowed reserves. This composition is determined

by the Federal Reserve. Given the manner in which discount window bor-

rowing is administered,6 bank borrowing will depend on both the current

federal funds rate, i, and the expected future value of this short-term



                                -3-
interest rate.7 A rise in current borrowing by an individual bank in-

creases the implicit cost of future borrowing. Thus, if the interest

rate is expected to be high next period, so that the profitability of

borrowing at the discount window is expected to be high, individual

banks may reduce current borrowing in order to increase access to the

window next period. The desired reserve composition is assumed to be

given by equation (1):


                  nbr -   rr          -          +         + Vt                 (1)



where nbr = ln(NBR) and.it÷i is the expectation, conditional on time t

information, of t+l The disturbance term                   is assumed to be serially

uncorrelated with mean zero.                           -




   Using   (1),



                     =
                               '[rr   -
                                          nbr   + o + 2t1t+1 + vt].              (2)




Equation (2) holds under either lagged or contemporaneous reserve ac-

counting. Prior to a money announcement, market participants know i -

   -1                     -1
                               [rr.-nbr +v]. The weekly announcement may lead
              .


        Eo+2t1t+1]

 to revisions in forecasts about rr, nbr, or v (under lagged reserve

 accounting, -aggregate required reserves, rr =              k + m_2 become known

 exactly),   but, given -+1'              is    unaffected by these revisions as it

 depends, from (2), only on the linear combination rr_nbrt+vt which was

 already known.9


    Let tz denote the revision in a variable z that results from the an-

 nouncement in week        of m_2. Under a federal funds operating proce-




                                           -4-
dure, the monetary authority keeps i fixed during the settlement week,

and nbr adjusts so that Li = 0.     Under a nonborrowed reserves operat-

ing procedure, nbr is kept fixed and, from (2),


                                     =
                                         12tit÷1.                       (3)



Thus, the current short rate responds if and only if the announcement

leads to a revision in expectations of the future short rate. To deter-

mine         the remainder of the model must be specified.


   The demand for real money balances is taken to be a decreasing func-

tion of the nominal rate of interest and an increasing function of real

permanent income:



                     m_p=o ai+y+u                                     (4)




where Pt is the log of the price level and y is real permanent income.

The assumptions made concerning the disturbance term u are very impor-

tant, particularly since evidence presented in Roley and Walsh (1984) of

a positive contemporaneous correlation between money and interest rates

using weekly data suggests that demand shifts, as opposed to supply

shifts, play a major role in observed short-run interest rate and money

stock movements.11 To capture the notion that money demand shocks have

both permanent and transitory components, it is assumed that


                          u. =   u1 +     -
                                                                       (5)


where c is a white noise disturbance term with variance .      The perma-

nent component of any shock    is equal to (l-)Et, while        represents

the transitory component.'2


                                 -5-
  Assuming permanent income is equal to the rational expectation of the


present discounted value of future income suggests that y should be

modelled as a random walk:



                                      v=v
                                       t t-l+Pt        .                     (6)


where tP is a serially uncorrelated mean zero random variable.



                       =                                    Taking expectations,

                      a[ac-mt+± +                          +±1


In response to a money announcement, (7) implies


                            =                                                 (8)
             -




Finally, if r+± is the anticipated real rate of interest from t+i to

t+i+l,


                                                           -l
         =       -l                        -l
                                                )-'+
                                                  -
                                                                 v
                                                                t+i  -l
                                                                    tut

    Equation -(9) is useful in illustrating the various factors different

 authors have emphasized in explaining the effect of announcements on in-

 terest rates. For example, Siegel (1985) can be viewed as focusing on

 the real income shocks affecting the equilibrium real rate of interest

 through the term               If   a money surprise is positively correlated

 with future real income, interest rates will rise if an unexpectedly

 large value of m_2 is announced. Other models have assumed this term

 to be identically zero, in which case, the interest rate response de-

                                         -6-
 pends on how new information affects expectations of the future nominal

 money supply, future prices, and future disturbances to money demand.

    In fixed price models,'3 (9) simplifies to                  =

             These models have thus emphasized the persistence of money de-

mand disturbances and the monetary authority's policy rule governing the

evolution of the nominal money stock.


   To complete the specification of a general model of all the factors

appearing in (9), two additional components are required: a model of ag-

gregate demand and supply to determine the equilibriwn price level and a

model of the perceived behavior of the monetary authority.


   Rather than explicitly model aggregate demand and supply in the goods

market, a shortcut will be taken.          A variety of rational expectations

models of an aggregate economy imply equilibria in which the price level

depends on past and current expected values of both the current and fu-

ture money stock.          Since equal changes in t+i and u÷., or m÷. and

         have no effect on the equilibrium price level," it is assumed

that



                  +    N      co
                                                          p
    Pt                                                          +
            Pot       Zs0 d5I0 b[_5mt÷ -11+             t5Y+]          (10)



For example, N might be the length of the longest nominal wage contract.

The current price level depends on expectations of Pt formed at times

t-l to t-N since such expectations are imbedded in the current structure

of nominal wages. If Pt is expected to depend on m and futUre values

of the money stock, an equation such as (10) would result. The time

varying term           will be discussed below, while    is a white noise dis-

turbance.

                                       -7-
  Rational expectations models which exhibit both static and dynamic

neutrality impose restrictions on the d5 and b coefficients. First,

the neutrality of money implies that proportional changes in the nominal

money supply at all dates raise the price level by the same proportion.

Equation (10) possess this property if and only if



                                   X d b. =         1.                       (11)



   Condition (11) is not sufficient to ensure dynamic, or super, neu-

trality. If anticipated future real rates of interest are invariant to

the anticipated path of money, further restrictions are imposed. For

example, equation (10) implies that Pt S not perfectly flexible since

it is partially determined by past expectations. However, the past mat-

ters for only N periods so that, from the point of view of period t,

        for i..> N iscompletely flexible. Hence,                 for i > N should be

invarient to the anticipated (as of time t) behavior of the nominal mon-

ey stock. From equation (4), this requires that, for i > N, the solu-

tion for p given by (10) be consistent with


           -            - u[r+.'   +            -
                                                    +±] +        t+i +         (12)



where r' is the equilibrium real rate of interest. For simplicity, it

will be assumed that rt is influenced by the same factors which affect

permanent income, as well as by a transitory disturbance:


                         =
                             rt+.1 +   6t+i +            -




 The transitory shock, v, captures factors other than permanent income

 which influence r'.15 Equation (12) requires that the b.'s in (10) sat-

 isfy


                                       -8-                   -
                                   b. =   a/(l+a)i,     j =   0,...           (13)



     Since (13) implies 1b.         1, (11) now requires that



                                                 d =   1.                    (14)



    Finally3 (12) and (13) imply that                   -
                                                            E[a/(l+)]   r'÷.. The
    presence of this term captures the effects of shifts in the equilibrium

    real interest rate on the price level.


        In order to represent, in the simpliest possible way, market partici-

    pants' expectations about monetary policy, the following assumptions

    will be made. First, it is assumed that the monetary authority follows

    a monetary aggregates policy in which it tries to achieve a targeted

    path for the money stock. Let m÷± denote the targeted value, as of

    time t, for m÷.. Second, while the particular control techniques used

    to achieve the target path depend on whether a federal funds or a re-

    serve aggregate operating procedure is being used, it is assumed that

-
    the monetary authority is expected to achieve its target. Under this

    assumption,           =
                                     Third, it is assumed that the monetary au-

    thority is expected to revise its target path for future money in light

    of past deviations from target. To maintain a simple structure, it will

    be assumed that rn'+. is adjusted in response to the new information

    obtained in week t    by   the release of the data on
                                                              m2.
       Two   hypotheses   about the monetary authority's behavior have figured

    prominantly in the analysis of interest rates and money announcements.

    The first is that the monetary authority acts to offset any deviation of

                                           -9-
money from the target path without changing the long-run growth target.

This hypothesis can be represented by assuming

                                 T            i
                                     =   (l-X) (m2 - m..2)             (15)




where ""   will   be used to denote an expectation just prior to the week t
                                                                              =
announcement of the actual value of m2. The difference m2 m*t2

     represents the new information contained in the announcement. Ac-
cording to (15), the monetary authority is expected to offset deviations

from target at the rate X per .week. As i -*      ,         =        --> 0,


so that no revision of the long-run target path is anticipated.


   The second hypothesis often made concerning the monetary authority's

behavior is that a deviation from the old target path as revealed by the

 announcement of m2 is an indication that a change in the target growth

 rate has occured. This case can be represented by assuming


                                                                        (16)



 where iT is a parameter measuring the fraction of the money surprise that

 gets incorporated into the new target gr.owth rate.


    During the sample period used in the empirical work on money surpris-

 es, the stated goals of the Federal Reserve were expresse4 in terms of

 ranges for the growth rates of various monetary aggregates.      Since these

 ranges are changed only every six months, the stated policy of the Fed-

 eral Reserve on a week to week basis is more closely represented by (15)

 than by (16).. 6 However, a plausible approximation to the public's ex-

 pectations of Fed behavior would place some positive probability on both

 possible adjustment responses to perceived deviations from target. For

  example, suppose it is expected with probability q that the monetary

  target path will be adjusted according          (15) in which deviations are


                                     - 10 -
gradually offset. With probability l-q, however, the growth path is be-

lieved to be adjusted according to (16). In this case,



                                                  [q(l-X)' + (lq)(i+2)1r]112.   (17)



The weight q is then a simple measure of what might be described as p01-

icy credibility. A high q implies market participants expect the mone-

tary authority to be unlikely to revise the underlying target growth

rate of the money stock.           Alternatively, q could be interpreted as a

means of reflecting uncertainty about the monetary authority's policy.


   The monetary authority can attempt to achieve its target path for the

money stock by using either the funds rate or nonborrowed reserves as an

operating instrument. If the funds rate is used, equation (7) defines

the required path of                If a nonborrowed reserves operating proce-

dure is used, equation (2) defines the path for nbr which is consistent

which provides an important link between the reserve market and the mon-

particular linear combination of the underlying disturbances, !Pt2

        and t3, to be observed. The revisions in the marketts estimates

of the basic shocks can be written as

 IV.    Interest   Rate Responses


       Equations (8) and (9) can be used to calculate the responses of both

 anticipated future nominal and real interest rates to the money an-

 nouncement. Details of the derivations are relegated to the appendix.

      First, consider the change in the real rate of interest expected to

  prevai.l at time t+i with      N:

  where 6 is the covariance between
                                               permanent income and real interest
  rate innovations. Since all contracts in force at time t will have
                                                                     ex-
 pired by t+N, the expected real rate for t+i is independent of
                                                                any of
 the monetary factors such.as X, ir, or the weight q determining
                                                                 expecta-
 tions of the future money stock. Real rates do respond to real
                                                                  shocks,
 and a positive money surprise would lead to an upward revision
                                                                   in the

                                                             0.                  Such is
 the case if real aggregate demand
                                           shocks dominate so that real income
 and real interest rates are positively correlated.

arid (23), three additional terms appear when

functions of the price adjustment

perfectly flexible, real interest rates will be
                                                                affected by monetary
disturbances and the monetary

  The second term multiplying i2    in   (23) is positive and captures the

effect of revisions .in expectations of future money demand.         This   term

is positive since higher money demand will, ceteris paribus, increase

real interest rates until prices have completely adjusted.            From the

definition of the a.'s a1 +     (l-fla2      -
                                                 a3     = 1   -      Thus, the

greater the revision in the public's estimate of cr2, the smaller will

be this term. Since t2 arises from permanent income and money demand
                                                                      the less
shocks, the greater the proportion of 't-2 attributed to

permanent is the shift in money demand since -P shocks are completely

permanent while c shocks, are only partially so.        This term capturing ex-

pectations about future money demand has been the main focus of emphasis

under the policy anticipations hypothesis. This hypothesis also empha-

sizes the policy response of the money supply which is represented in

the third and fourth terms multipying        in (23).


   The third term in (23) is negative and results from the change in ex-

pectations about the future money supply.        With X < 1, a positive money

 surprise implies that the money stock will remain above the old target

 growth path for several periods, while if (-l-q)r > 0, the nominal money

 stock is expected to permanently remain above the old target path. This

 upward revision in the expected future money stock lowers, for a given

 money demand shock, expected real interest rates as long as prices are

 not able to respond completely. Combining this and the previous term

 shows how the real interest rate response depends on a comparison of the

 revisions in expectations of future money demand and supply.

           The last term in (23) enters because the real rate of interest de-

     pends.on the expected rate of inflation as long as d.÷l                0. This final
     term can have either sign and depends
                                                      on whether the money supply is ex-
     pected to, grow at a different rate than

     expected to return to its old growth path. In the
                                                                  latter case, in which

     the
                             term dominates, the net effect is negative.

        Earlier discussions of the money announcement effect have all empha-

     sized some sort of active policy response as central to the response of

     interest rates to money surprises. Either the policy authority was as-

     suiried to revise its target growth
                                               path so that expectations of inflation

     rose, or the monetary authority was assumed to restrict
                                                                             money growth
    temporarily in order.to return to the target growth path. As (23) makes

    clear, anticipated future real interest rates are affected by a money

    surprise even if A =     it = 0.   Even      if   the monety authority allows for
    what   is   akin to base drift with   no   revision in the targeted growth

    real interest rates will be affected.
                                                       Because the higher money demand
    revealed by a positive money surprise is expected to be at least par-

    tially temporary, while with base drift the rise in the nominal money

-   supply is permanent, real rates will be lower            until prices have adjust-
    ed.21 Unless the
                         öa1 term dominates, however, some sort of policy re-
    sponse is necessary to explain what appears to be the positive response

    of real rates to positive money surprises.

gj path will increase the sensitivity of real rates to money surprises

if interest rates initially responded positively to such surprises.

Since the shift in policy operating procedures by the Federal Reserve in

October, 1979 was generally perceived as a move to keep monetary aggre-

gates closer to the long run growth target, it could be described as a

rise in ).    This   would then be one possible factor in explaining the

rise in the response of interest rates to money surprises that occurred

after October, 1979.22


   The observed response of nominal forward rates is the sum of the

change in the relevant expected future real rate and expected future in-

flation. When i       N, Li1 is given by


              =          -

j is not a necessary ment for expectations of nominal interest
rates several years in the future to move in response to a money sur-

prise.     If the surprise contains any information useful in predicting

 changes in the equilibrium real rate of interest,                      will be nonzero

 even if no change in the target growth rate of the money stock is antic-

 ipated.

    Because X has opposing effects on expected inflation and expected

 real rates, the net effect of a change in X on the sensitivity of nomi-

 nal rates to money surprises is ambiguous. A higher X implies a faster

 return to the target path, and this reduces the impact of     on future

 inflation. However, it increases the impact on expected real rates.

For i such that d(i) is small, that is, for small i or if prices are

very sluggish to adjust, the effect on real interest rates dominates,

and a rise in X will increase the response of 1't+i to a money sur-

prise.


   Referring back to equation (24), a rise in A can lead to a greater

response of expected future interest rates to money surprises even for i

 N as long as 2X + aX2 > 1.    Thus, the increase in long-term interest

rate responses to money surprises which occurred after the October 1979

shift in operating procedures is potentially consistent with market par-

ticipants believing the Federal Reserve would move more quickly to elim-

inate deviations from the targeted growth path. Even for the expected

interest rate at t+i for large i, it is not necessary to assume market

participants. believed the Fed was more likely to revise its target

growth path in order to explain the greater responses found in the em-

pirical studies.


  Equations (24) and (25) can be used to determine the effect of a rise

in q.. Since Fed policy, during the period studied in the empirical mon-

ey announcement literature, was aimed at achieving target growth paths

for the monetary aggregates, q can be interpreted as an index of the

policy's credibility. A high q implies the public expects, with high




                                - 17 —
probability, that deviations from target will be offset. Thus, a rise

in q is a rise in -credibility. Rewriting (24) and (25) as
                                                                             =


b(i)T'it2,

                         3b(i)/q =    -[(l-X)1X/(l+X)   + ii] <0         (26)


for i    N. Since a rise in q reduces the weight given to the possibili-

ty that a money surprise signals a change in the long run rate of infla-

tion, distant expected future interest rates respond less to the new in-

formation contained in the announcement.23


   For i < N, the sign of ab(i)/q is ambiguous. If prices are slow to

                                                                             -
adjust so that d(l) approximately equals zero, b(l)/q = cz1[31T
(l-X)]   which is negative for small it. In this case, greater belief in

the monetary authority's commitment to offset money surprises decreases

the response of the current short-term rate24 to the unanticipated com-

ponent of the         money announcement.


    Equations (23) and (25) also illustrate the manner in which the real

and nominal interest rate responses depend on the a. parameters. Be-

 cause the new information contained in the money announcement does not

 allow the individual underlying disturbances to be identified, a posi-

 tive money surprise is attributed partially to real, permanent income

 disturbances and partially to money demand shocks. Most previous models

 of the money announcements have considered only the special case in

 which the money surprises are caused by money demand shocks t-2' and

 the money arinouncement fully reveals st-V In the present framework,

                                  -   18 -
  follows immediately from (22) that expected future real rates are unaf-

  fected: by money surprises. For large 1, equation (24) implies that
                                                                      ex-
 pected future nominal interest rates will
                                               move only if the public be-
  lieves there is some chance the
                                    monetary authority will revise its tar-
 get growth path. For        N, the last term in both (23) and (25) becomes

                        so that real and nominal interest rates depend

 only on the permanent component of any disturbance to money demand.


    If money announcements provide any information that is useful in

 forecasting future real income, as
                                        suggested by Siegel (1985) and Lit-
 termari and Weiss (1985),
                             a1 will differ from zero. The Kalmari filter
 coefficients will depend on the sample estimates of the variances and

 èovariances of the underlying
                                 disturbances (see Chow (1975)), and will
 generally evolve over time. Unobserved shifts in the population vari-

ances of these disturbances (a and 2) will cause movements in the

a.'s. For example, suppose the, variance of real shocks rises relative
to that of nominal money demand shocks.
                                              Such a structural shift will
cause a1 to rise and
                       a2 to fall. From (23) and (25), the respoise of
both real and nominal interest rates will rise in absolute value. An

increase in the relative importance of real shocks will cause interest

rates to become more sensitive to money surprises.




V. Conclusions


   The simple model developed in this paper incorporates most of the

competing hypotheses which have been put forward to explain the positive

response of nominal interest rates to the
                                            unanticipated component of the



                                 - 19   -
Federal Reserve's weekly money announcements.25 By explicitly modelling

these hypotheses, an expression for the response of current and expected

future short-term real and nominal interest rates was obtained. The

factors emphasized in earlier models of the money announcement effect

become special cases in this more general framework. The model shows

how empirically estimated interest rate responses depend on the speed

with which money supply deviations from target

ity of such a policy, and    the    relative importance of shocks to real,

permanent income and   nominal   money demand.

     weekly announcement of Ml include Berkinan (1978), Conrad
                                                                   (1978),

     Walsh. (1983, 1984), Cornell (1983), Loeys (1984), and Gavin and Kar-
     amouzis (1984) who examine interest rate responses, Cornell (1982,
     1983), Engle and Frankel (1984), and Hardouvelis (l984a) who examine
     exchange rates and interest rates, and Pearce and Roley (1984) who
     examine stock prices, and Frankel and Hardouvelis
                                                       (1985) who examine
     commodity prices.

2. Such evidence would only be consistent with real rates remaining
    constant if the aggregate price level jumps in response to weekly
     money announcements.

3. For example, see Roley and Walsh (1983) or Loeys (1984).

4. See, for example, Campbell (1984) for some empirical evidence.

5. This ignores the existence of unequal reserve ratios on the various
    components of the money stock and assumes excess reserves are equal
     to zero.

6. See Goodfrjend (1982) for a discussion.

7.   Borrowing also depends on the current and expected future value of
     the discount rate, but this is assumed to be constant and so will be
     ignored.
8. To ensure stabiltiy of the forward rational expectations solution to
     (1), it is assumed that     > . For  a fuller analysis of discount
     window borrowing and Fede.al Rerve policy, see Goodfriend (1982).

9. This point is analyzed by Nichols and Small      (1984) and Campbell
     (1984).

10. This specification differs from that of Nichols, Small, and Webster
     (1983) and Hardouvelis (1985) who do not include income explicitly
     and who assume money demand also depends
                                                 +1 i. The money
     demand equation assumed here is more standar. j.n Roey and Walsh
     (1983), the interest rate in the money demand equation is identi-
     fied with a rate of longer maturity than

11. Roley. and Walsh (1984) regress the change in the 3-month Treasury
     Bill rate over a settlement week on the contemporaneous unantici-
     pated money stock. The resulting estimated coefficient was posi-
     tive and significant for the October 1979 to October 1982 period.
     Similar results were found using the ten-year constant maturity
     Treasury 'security yield.

12. Hardouvelis (1985) uses a similar specification. However, his
     shocks incorporate transitory income shocks as well as money demand

                                 -27-
    shocks since no income variable is explicitly included in his money
    demand equation.

13. The models of Urich (1983), Walsh (1983), Nichols, Small, and Web-
     ster (1983), and Roley and Walsh (1983, section II) fall into this
     category.

14. This is because the elasticity of money demand with respect to per-
     manent income is assumed to be equal to one.

15. Since ô depends on the correlation between permanent income and th
     real rate of interest, it could be either positive or negative.

16. Roley (1983) presents evidence which shows that the interest rate
     response to a money surprise depends on whether the announcement
     places the money stock inside, below, pr above the policy range.

17. Actually, the announcement represents a preliminary estimate of
             The evidence in Roley and Walsh (1984) suggests the subse-
     qLexLt revisions
                      in these preliminary estimates have no effects on
     interest rates.

18. This assumption is consistent with empirical evidence that the an-
     nouncement of the latest figures on the Consumer Price Index have
     little impact on interest rates. The release of the Producer price
     Index, however, does seem to affect rates. See Roley and Troll
     (1983) and Smirlock (1984)..

19. It is not necessary for the present analysis to derive explicitly
     the expectations of. the underlying shocks just prior to the money
     announceient.     Note that no revision in ei.ther permanent income or
     the money demand shock (u) from period t-3 appear in (18) since,
     from (4), the sum of these two is known exactly prior to week t's
     money announcement.

20. See Chow (1975). For an application to the case in which the money
     supply is measured with error, see Trevor (1984).

21. The second and third terms in (23) become _'(l_d(i))Za2        0.

22. The empirical evidence of increased responses refers to nominal in-
     terest rates while (23) gives the real rate response. As discussed
     earlier., however, the evidence suggests that the nominal rate move-
     ments are also real rate movements. The responses implied by the
     model for nominal rates are considered below.

 23. Judd (1984) reports results consistent with this result. After Oc-
      tober 182, when the Fed de-ernphasized control of Ml, forward rates
      five years out became more sensitive to money surprises. See also
      Hardouvelis (1984b) and Loeys (1985).

     cluded was the uncertainty hypothesis.
